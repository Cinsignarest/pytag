   abstract = {Many human genes have adapted to the constant threat of exposure to changing environmental conditions. Balancing selection is the result of an initial stage of positive selection that favors the spread in a population of a new allele until selection opposes its fixation and balanced situation is established. It is suggested that the disadvantageous celiac patients survived the last two millennias echo-catastrophes by adapting to the extreme temperature changes and their consequences in Europe. Genetic selective diversity induced by changing environment, enabled the celiac population to survive. Such a genetic positive selection is represented by the HEF C282Y mutation of hemochromatosis, SH2B3 loci and the HLA celiac disease-associated repertoire, enabling the celiac to overcome iron deficiency anemia and micro pathogen richness, respectively. The increased incidence of those evolutionary events in the celiac patients is a recent phenomenon that occurred in the latest era of the modern human history. The present hypothesis can shed light on additional selective genetic adaptations, echo catastrophe-driven that are at the basis of autoimmune disease-affected population survival and current expansion.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of dental enamel defects, recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) and caries experience and to measure salivary flow rate, buffer capacity, saliva and plaque pH and salivary cariogenic microflora in patients with celiac disease (CD) compared to healthy subjects. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients, aged 6-19 years, with a diagnosis of CD and 35 healthy children of the same age participated in the study. Enamel defects were diagnosed and classified using Aine's classification. The patients with RAS and dental caries were recorded using WHO criteria. The parents were interviewed about various oral health-related factors. Saliva samples were collected to measure the stimulated salivary flow rate, buffer capacity and pH values of saliva and plaque. Salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were counted. RESULTS: The enamel defects and RAS prevalence were statistically higher (40 and 37.1%, respectively) in the CD group, and the prevalence of salivary mutans streptococci (48 and 14%) and lactobacilli (51 and 34%) colonization was statistically lower (p = 0.012, p = 0.010) in the CD group; the DMFS and dfs values were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: CD appeared to be associated with a significantly higher prevalence of developing enamel defects and RAS, but a lower prevalence of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli colonization, and the diagnosis of these oral manifestations might be helpful for an early diagnosis of CD.},

The objective of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of developing a gluten-free food product database based on the assessment of the gluten content in processed foods available for CDP. Gluten was assessed in 41 processed food products available for CDP. Group A consisted of 26 products for CDP included in the NFID, and group B contained 15 food products for CDP not registered in the NFID but listed in the safe lists of the local Celiac Association (CA). High-sensitivity omega-gliadin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for analysis. Gluten was lower than 20 ppm in 37 of 41 analyzed products (90.2%): in 24 of 26 (92.3%) products in group A and in 13 of 15 (86.7%) products in group B (P = .61). No significant difference was found between the 2 groups regarding gluten content. No product in either group contained gluten in excess of 100 ppm. Most of the analyzed products included in the Greek NFID or listed in the lists of the local CA, even those not officially labeled "gluten free," can be safely consumed by CDP. The use of commercially available omega-gliadin ELISA is able to identify those products that contain inappropriate levels of gluten, making feasible it to develop an integrated gluten-free processed food database.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The clinical presentations of celiac crisis and refeeding syndrome in celiac disease are almost similar, but information about refeeding syndrome is scarce. We are reporting for the first time 5 cases of refeeding syndrome in children with celiac disease that could have otherwise been labeled as celiac crisis. METHODS: From January to December 2010, a chart review of hospital records of all celiac disease cases was performed, and refeeding syndrome was ascribed in those celiac patients who deteriorated clinically after initiation of a gluten-free diet and had biochemical parameters suggestive of refeeding syndrome such as hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypoalbuminemia. RESULTS: Of the total 35 celiac disease patients, 5 (median age 6.5 [range 2.2-10] years, 3 boys) were identified as having refeeding syndrome. All 5 children were severely malnourished (body mass index <14 kg/m) and all of them had anemia, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hypocalcemia, meaning that they had the perfect setting for developing refeeding syndrome. At the same time, their clinical features fulfilled the criteria for celiac crisis except that their symptoms have worsened after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. Nevertheless, instead of using steroids, they were managed as refeeding syndrome in terms of correction of electrolytes and gradual feeding, and that led to a successful outcome in all of them. CONCLUSIONS: Severely malnourished patients with celiac disease are at risk of developing potentially life-threatening refeeding syndrome, which may mimic celiac crisis, especially in developing countries. Early recognition and appropriate treatment are the keys to a successful outcome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Positivity of both immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) and anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA) has a positive predictive value of nearly 100% for celiac disease (CD). The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether patients of any age, with high pretest probability of CD and high titre of anti-TTG and EMA positivity, have a high probability of intestinal damage and may not require the biopsy for final diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 412 consecutively referred patients, age range 10 months to 72 years, who underwent small-bowel biopsy for suspicion of CD and positivity to both anti-TTG and EMA, was performed at 4 Italian centers. Biopsies were evaluated independently by 2 pathologists using Marsh modified classification; in cases of dissimilar results, a third pathologist examined the biopsy. The final histological finding diagnosis was expressed as the prevalent or highest score assigned by the pathologist board. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-six patients (96.1%) had histological findings consistent with CD (grade 2 and 3a, 3b, or 3c of modified Marsh classification). An anti-TTG ratio >/= 7 was able to identify with the 3 assays used (Celikey, anti-TTG immunoglobulin A, EuTTG) all of the patients with significant mucosal damage (Marsh >/= 2) independent of age and sex; specificity and positive predictive value were 100%. An anti-TTG ratio >20 was more specific (99.8%) for identification of patients with villous atrophy (Marsh 3 a, b, or c). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with positivity of anti-TTG >/= 7-fold cutoff, confirmed by positivity to EMA, have a high-degree probability of duodenal damage. In selected conditions, a duodenal biopsy may be avoided and a confirmed greatly positive anti-TTG result could be the basis to prescribe a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is a recently recognized form of pan-esophagitis, which is characterized by the presence of at least 15 eosinophils per high power field on esophageal histology. EE is closely associated with atopic disorders and occurs predominantly in male patients. Young children are more likely to be sensitized to food allergens whilst aeroallergen sensitization predominates in older children and adults--a pattern reminiscent of the "atopic march". EE presents with a diverse range of gastrointestinal symptoms, including regurgitation, vomiting, feeding difficulties or refusal in infancy, in addition to dysphagia and food bolus impaction in older children and adults. The diagnosis may also be ascertained incidentally in patients undergoing gastroscopy for other suspected gastrointestinal conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or celiac disease. Complications mainly relate to subepithelial remodeling and fibrosis which may result in dysmotility, dysphagia and esophageal strictures. The proportion of EE patients at risk of these complications is unknown due to a paucity of data on the natural history of EE. There are only few randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of treatment modalities for EE, which currently either involve food allergen elimination or use of swallowed aerosolized corticosteroids. This article aims to discuss the complex issues of the diagnosis and long-term management that confront clinicians who care for children with EE.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Coeliac disease is an important clinical disorder affecting the human gastrointestinal tract leading to multiple signs and symptoms in different body organs. This disease was the subject of a cross sectional descriptive-analytic study conducted in the Gaza Strip during 2010. Objectives were oriented to identify and verify several variables and attributes affecting the prognosis of coeliac disease in the patients. Ninety five children out of 113 patients were arranged into two groups according to age from 2 to 11 years and from 12 to 18 years old. Results showed the poor interest of health professionals regarding coeliac disease in the Gaza Strip. The mean age of study population was 5.47 years for males and 8.93 years for females. The lifestyle of coeliac patients was directly proportional with better nutritional indictors. Poor recognition of the emblem illustrating gluten in foods implicates effective health awareness or promotion. The more knowledgeable patients or mothers (P = 0.036) were the more compliant. The compliance to giving gluten free foods outside home was statistically significant (P = 0.037). Similarly, cautious approach when buying foods or detergents (P = 0.011). According to BMI 74.4%, 23.4% and 3.2% of all patients were normal, underweight and overweight respectively. Albumin blood level was normal in 32.6% and low in 67.4%. Meanwhile, blood calcium level was normal in 76.8%, low in 21.1% and high in 2.1% of all patients. CONCLUSION: The study showed that recreation and social activities for coeliac patients are substantially missing in the Gaza Strip. Moreover, the study proved that AEI is a reliable centre for care of coeliac disease patients and conducting relevant studies. RECOMMENDATION: There is a need for thorough and continuous community and institutional mobilization regarding coeliac disease in the Gaza Strip and in Palestine.},

We employed an adapted already validated questionnaire, with open, closed, and multiple choice questions. Of the 105 participants with Coeliac disease, 90.38% of them followed, where possible, a gluten-free diet; 67.12% consumed food with gluten inadvertently or because of a lack of alternatives and/or information in food found in public places. Seventy percent affirmed that their diet provided all the energy and nutrients they need; 77.67% of the Coeliac participants prepared their meals by themselves or this task was assumed by their caregivers; 77.14% read the manufacturers labels on products, and, 74.49% expressed dissatisfaction regarding the price and availability of gluten-free products. The data show an association only between the energy and nutrients needed for good health and gluten-free dietary tracking (p=0.0315). That is, people with Coeliac disease who avoided gluten consumed more calories and were more likely to have adequate nutrients in their diet.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disease, triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by ingesting gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and other closely related cereal grains. Currently, the estimated prevalence of CD is around 1 % of the population in the western world and medical nutritional therapy (MNT) is the only accepted treatment for celiac disease. To date, the replacement of gluten in bread presents a significant technological challenge for the cereal scientist due to the low baking performance of gluten free products (GF). The increasing demand by the consumer for high quality gluten-free (GF) bread, clean labels and natural products is rising. Sourdough has been used since ancient times for the production of rye and wheat bread, its universal usage can be attributed to the improved quality, nutritional properties and shelf life of sourdough based breads. Consequently, the exploitation of sourdough for the production of GF breads appears tempting. This review will highlight how sourdough LAB can be an efficient cell factory for delivering functional biomolecules and food ingredients to enhance the quality of gluten free bread.},

   abstract = {This review will try to address the question of whether we are diagnosing too many people with coeliac disease. The key reasons for diagnosing coeliac disease may be that it is a common condition affecting up to 1% of the adult population. Delays in diagnosis are common. The average time delay reported by Coeliac UK (National Medical Patient Charity), for patients with symptoms prior to the diagnosis being made is 13 years. For every adult case detected, it is estimated that there are eight cases not detected. Patients with coeliac disease have an associated morbidity and mortality. In addition, quality of life studies suggest that the majority of patients benefit from a gluten-free diet (GFD). Furthermore, the GFD reduces or alleviates the risk of the associated complications. All of these facts could even be used to support the argument for screening! However, conversely the tests for coeliac disease are not 100% sensitive and specific. In addition, we do not know whether patients with milder symptoms will derive less benefit from treatment and are at less risk of complications. Furthermore, evidence presented in this review suggests that actual outcomes for screening studies in an adult population have revealed poor uptake and subsequently difficulties with adherence. What little published data that are available also infers that individuals recognised through screening programmes could have been detected if carefully questioned for symptoms. There is evidence to suggest that diagnosing celiac disease is cost-effective and that the diagnostic costs are offset by reduced medical expenditures, reduced hospital and general practice attendances, but this view depends on the population prevalence of coeliac disease. We believe on the basis of the evidence presented in this review that we are not diagnosing too many adults with coeliac disease. However, the authors consider case-finding with a low threshold for serological testing to be the optimal approach. If you look for coeliac disease you will find it.},

   abstract = {The rise in gluten consumption over time has led to the increasing recognition of coeliac disease (CD) with associated complications. However, only recently has there been an appreciation that the spectrum of gluten-related disorders is greater than just CD, which may explain the growing global popularity in gluten-free products. Current literature suggests that a newly recognised clinical entity in the form of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) may be the most common gluten-related disorder encountered by healthcare professionals, although its exact prevalence is as yet unknown. This article will review the historical relationship between mankind and gluten as well as the progressive recognition that it is possible for gluten to have a deleterious effect on our health. To this effect we discuss the prevalence, diagnosis and complications of CD including the benefits derived from a gluten-free diet (GFD). Finally, we discuss our current understanding of NCGS, in addition to highlighting the need for further research to determine the extent, clinicopathological features and serological biomarkers to help recognise this emerging condition in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of clinical features of Celiac disease (CD) and Celiac crisis in children. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Paediatrics Unit, Sheikh Zayed Medical College and Hospital, Rahim Yar Khan, from September 2009 to September 2010. METHODOLOGY: Forty children aged between 4 to 13 years of either gender, presenting with complaints of recurrent diarrhea, abdominal distention, severe emaciation and dehydration were included. The information about breast feeding, weaning diets, age of introduction of wheat diets, onset of diarrhea, characteristics and frequency of stools, growth, vaccination status, symptoms in 1st degree relatives, restriction of Gluten diet in the past and anthropometric measures were recorded. Serological tests against anti-Tissue Transglultaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies were obtained in all cases. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed and multiple biopsies were taken from distal parts of duodenum. RESULTS: Among the forty children, twenty four (60%) were females and 16 were males (40%). The mean age was 6.35 +/- 2.83 years. Thirty five (87.5%) parents were cousins. Breast feeding was not exclusively given and the Gluten containing weaning diets were given as early as 3.5 months of age. Thirty (75%) children presented with typical sign and symptoms of CD. Celiac crisis presented with profuse diarrhea, severe dehydration; abdominal distention; pedal edema, carpopedal spasm due to tetany; wasted muscles; head drop and inability to stand. The serum TtG antibodies in thirty-eight cases (95%) were above the cut off level of 7 u/ml ranging from 35-99 u/ml. The histopathology of specimens from distal duodenum revealed lesions of M3 type in thirteen (32.5%) and M2 type in eighteen cases (45%). All cases recovered and improved on follow-up after strict adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD). CONCLUSION: Majority of children with Celiac disease presented with typical symptom, while Celiac crisis was characterized by severe dehydration, weakness and calcium deficiency signs. Most were the product of consanguineous marriages and were given Gluten-containing weaning foods as early as the 4th month of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the fecal calprotectin concentration in children with newly diagnosed celiac disease, children with celiac disease strictly adhering to a gluten-free diet and healthy controls. We also tried to correlate the fecal calprotectin concentration with the clinical presentation, degree of neutrophilic infiltration and the severity of histopathological injury (Marsh grade) in the small bowel mucosa. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included three groups: children with untreated celiac disease, children with treated celiac disease, and healthy controls. Moreover, we obtained a second fecal sample from nine newly diagnosed children when their endomysial antibody became negative after gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Fecal calprotectin concentrations were significantly higher in newly diagnosed celiac patients (n=31) compared to patients on gluten-free diet (n=33) and healthy controls (n=34) (117.2 mug/g (3.2-306) vs. 3.7 mug/g (0.5-58.2) and 9.6 mug/g (1-70), respectively, p<0.001). Patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms had higher fecal calprotectin concentration compared to the patients presenting with nongastrointestinal symptoms [142.8 (12.2-306) vs. 79.7 (3.2-243.2) respectively, p=0.04]. Nine newly diagnosed patients gave a second fecal sample after starting gluten-free diet when endomysial antibody became negative. Their fecal calprotectin concentration had decreased from 113.7 mug/g (8.7-295.2) to 4.2 mug/g (0.5-20.7) (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Increased fecal calprotectin concentration can be used as a non-invasive marker that might aid in the diagnosis of celiac disease, especially in patients with gastrointestinal presentation. Fecal calprotectin concentration returns to normal on a strict gluten-free diet. Fecal calprotectin may be used as a marker of diet adherence and improvement in gastrointestinal inflammation in children with celiac disease. Additionally, it may be used for the differentiation of celiac disease from functional disorders of the gastrointestinal system.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a food intolerance triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals; the only therapy is a strict gluten-free diet for life. In recent years, amaranth flour has received considerable attention as an interesting source for the formulation of gluten-free products due to its high nutritional value and low content of prolamins, the toxic proteins for celiacs. The aim of this study was to characterize 40 amaranth varieties using both SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting and ELISA to assess their possible tolerance by celiac subjects. All of the amaranth samples studied showed similar binding affinities for both specific anti-gliadin antibodies and human IgAs. In most amaranth grains, the content of gluten-like proteins measured by ELISA was <20 ppm. The molecular characterization of amaranth proteins suggests that amaranth is safe for celiacs to consume. It is recommended that the most suitable amaranth varieties are those having the lowest content of proteins cross-reacting with anti-gliadin antibodies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Capsule endoscopy (CE) allows for the assessment of the small bowel in numerous intestinal diseases, including celiac disease (CD). The main advantage of CE is the complete visualization of the intestinal mucosal surface. The objective of this study was to investigate whether CE can predict the severity of CD and detect complications. METHODS: We retrospectively studied the medical files of 9 patients with symptomatic CD, 11 patients with refractory celiac disease type I (RCDI) and 18 patients with refractory celiac disease type II (RCDII), and 45 patients without CD who were investigated both CE and upper endoscopy or enteroscopy. The type of CD was diagnosed on the basis of a centralized histological review, flow cytometry analysis of intraepithelial lymphocytes, and the analysis of T-cell receptor rearrangement by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 47 CEs (10, 11, and 26 CEs in the symptomatic CD, RCDI, and RCDII groups, respectively) from the 38 celiac patients and 47 CEs from the 45 nonceliac patients were retrospectively reviewed. Villous atrophy, numerous, or distally located ulcers were more frequent in celiac patients than in controls. Among celiac patients, CE was of acceptable quality in 96% of cases and was complete in 62% of cases. The concordance of CE with histology for villous atrophy was better than that of optic endoscopy (kappa coefficient =0.45 vs. 0.24, P<0.001). Extensive mucosal damage on CE was associated with low serum albumin (P=0.003) and the RCDII form (P=0.02). Three cases of overt lymphoma were detected by CE during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: CE findings have a satisfactory concordance with histology and nutritional status in patients with symptomatic or refractory CD. Moreover, CE may predict the type of RCD and allows for the early detection of overt lymphoma.},

All patients with diagnosis of AN according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition criteria were screened for CD. One hundred and seventy-seven patients (33 males and 144 females) were enrolled. Only one patient was found to be affected with CD as confirmed by intestinal biopsy. The overall prevalence of CD in AN patients was 0.6 % which is similar to that observed in the general population. In conclusion, AN patients do not seem to require a regular screening program for CD. The screening for CD may be useful in selected AN patients in which the symptoms are only partially responding to psychiatric interventions.},

   abstract = {The endocannabinoid system has been extensively investigated in experimental colitis and inflammatory bowel disease, but not in celiac disease, where only a single study showed increased levels of the major endocannabinoid anandamide in the atrophic mucosa. On this basis, we aimed to investigate anandamide metabolism in celiac disease by analyzing transcript levels (through quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction), protein concentration (through immunoblotting) and activity (through radioassays) of enzymes responsible for anandamide synthesis (N-acylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine specific phospholipase D, NAPE-PLD) and degradation (fatty acid amide hydrolase, FAAH) in the duodenal mucosa of untreated celiac patients, celiac patients on a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months and control subjects. Also, treated celiac biopsies cultured ex vivo with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin were investigated. Our in vivo experiments showed that mucosal NAPE-PLD expression and activity are higher in untreated celiac patients than treated celiac patients and controls, with no significant difference between the latter two groups. In keeping with the in vivo data, the ex vivo activity of NAPE-PLD was significantly enhanced by incubation of peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin with treated celiac biopsies. On the contrary, in vivo mucosal FAAH expression and activity did not change in the three groups of patients, and accordingly, mucosal FAAH activity was not influenced by treatment with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin. In conclusion, our findings provide a possible pathophysiological explanation for the increased anandamide concentration previously shown in active celiac mucosa.},

   abstract = {Miscarriage concerns approximately 15% of pregnancies and recurrent fetal loss (RFL) constitute a particular situation concerning approximately 1% of women. The etiologic inquiry is often disappointing. Nutritional factors represent a promising aspect, insufficiently investigated even if numerous studies underline their impact on fertility, gametogenesis, embryonic development and pregnancies outcome. Obesity is considered as an independent risk factor for miscarriage, involved in oocyte and embryo quality, but also in endometrial receptivity. The male part involved in miscarriage was for a long time underestimated, neglecting the role of sperm in embryo development. If conventional sperm analysis remains essential, new investigations have to be considered such as sperm DNA or oxidant stress evaluation. It is particularly important to take into account nutritional factors as favoring miscarriage because they represent a flexible factor on which intervention is possible to improve pregnancy outcome, with toxics eviction and recommendations for diversified and well-balanced food. At last, effects of nutritional complements for miscarriage prevention remain controversial.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The involvement of oxidative stress in gluten-induced toxicity has been evidenced in vitro and in clinical studies but has never been examined in vivo. We recently demonstrated the protective activity of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which functions by the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor2 (Nrf2), a key transcription factor for the synthesis of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes (phase 2). Here, we evaluate the involvement of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor2 in gliadin-mediated toxicity in human Caco-2 intestinal cells and in gliadin-sensitive human leukocyte antigen-DQ8 transgenic mice (DQ8) and the protective activity of CLA. METHODS AND RESULTS: Gliadin effects in differentiated Caco-2 cells and in DQ8 mice, fed with a gliadin-containing diet with or without CLA supplementation, were evaluated by combining enzymatic, immunochemical, immunohistochemical, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Gliadin toxicity was accompanied by downregulation of phase 2 and elevates proteasome-acylpeptide hydrolase activities in vitro and in vivo. Notably, gliadin was unable to generate severe oxidative stress extent or pathological consequences in DQ8 mice intestine comparable to those found in celiac patients and the alterations produced were hampered by CLA. CONCLUSION: The beneficial effects of CLA against the depletion of crucial intestinal cytoprotective defenses indicates a novel nutritional approach for the treatment of intestinal disease associated with altered redox homeostasis.},

We previously developed a score based on four fast and simple questions that can be administered even by non-expert personnel. The aim of the present study is to verify the reliability of our questionnaire in a new cohort of patients. The questionnaire has a five-level score. From March 2008 to January 2011, the questionnaire was administered to 141 coeliac patients on a GFD, who were undergoing re-evaluation. The score obtained was compared with persistence of both villous atrophy and endomysial antibodies (EMA). The rate of lower scores was higher among the patients with persistence of either villous atrophy (Fisher's exact, P < 0.001; test for trend, P < 0.001) or positive EMA (Fisher's exact, P = 0.001; test for trend, P = 0.018). Given that the coeliac patients have been well instructed on what a GFD means and on how to follow it, our questionnaire is a reliable and simple method to verify compliance to a GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) affects approximately 1% of the population in the UK and is managed by the life-long adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Adhering to a GFD is practically difficult and not only affects dietary patterns, but also can affect many other aspects of daily life. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of CD and a GFD on dietary habits and quality of life of a cohort of adult biopsy diagnosed coeliac patients who reside in England. METHODS: The cohort was composed of 146 adult biopsy-diagnosed CD patients, who were all members of the Coeliac UK charity. Participants responded to a self-administered questionnaire considering dietary habits and quality of life. A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess dietary compliance. RESULTS: Generally, English CD patients reported to be in good physical and emotional health, although there were reports of anxiety and depression as a result of CD, most likely as a result of exclusion from social and leisure activities. The cohort reported high levels of dietary compliance (96%) which was supported by FFQ responses. However, there were reports of intentional gluten intake during social situations and when eating take-away foods. The FFQ revealed further examples of gluten ingestion, presumably unintentional, particularly through the consumption of breakfast cereals and starch-based sauces such as cheese sauce, custard and ketchup. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that CD affects a wide range of daily activities and that gluten consumption may be more common than anticipated with possible consequences on health.},

   abstract = {Food intolerance is becoming increasingly prevalent, and increasing numbers of athletes have celiac disease. This poses challenges as dietary recommendations for exercise are largely based on gluten-containing carbohydrate-rich foods. The K4 cycle race covers 384 km around the Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand. Lack of sleep, darkness, and temperature variations pose a number of nutritional challenges. Limited food choices present those with celiac disease with even greater challenges. This case study describes the intakes of one such athlete during training and competing in the K4. Nutritional intakes were obtained during training using weighed-food records and during the race via dietary recall and the weighing of foods pre- and post-race. As simple substitution of gluten-containing foods for gluten-free foods leads to increased energy intake, alternatives need to be considered. During the race, insufficient energy was consumed to meet the nutritional guidelines for endurance performance. This was probably due to the nature of the course, racing conditions, the consistency of gluten-free food, and, toward the end of the race, sensory-specific satiety.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Plasma citrulline is not incorporated in endogenous or exogenous proteins so it is a theoretical marker of villous atrophy. Our aim was to correlate plasma citrulline levels with severity of villous atrophy in celiac patients. METHODS: Observational case-control study longitudinal in children 16 month-old to 14 year-old: 48 with untreated celiac disease, 9 celiac children under gluten free diet and 35 non-celiac healthy children. Plasma amino acids concentration is determined, expressed in mumol/L, and so are other clinical and analytical data. RESULTS: No statistically significative difference found in the referring to BMI, age or renal function. Small increase in fecal fat in celiac children. Citrulline, arginine and glutamine are significantly lower in cases (17.7 mumol/l, 38.7 mumol/l, 479.6 mumol/l respectively) than in controls (28.9 mumol/l, 56.2 mumol/l, 563.7 mumol/l). Citrulline levels are significantly lower in the severe degrees of atrophy than in mild ones (13.8 mumol/l vs. 19.7 mumol/l, p < 0.05), not happening so with rest of amminoacids. SUMMARY: Postabsortive mean of plasma citrulline is a good marker of reduction in enterocyte mass in celiac patients with villous atrophy; secondary reduction in plasma arginine too. Just a small histological alteration in intestinal biopsy is enough to differentiate citrulline in cases and controls and besides it can be seen that high levels of atrophy present with lower plasma citrulline.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The high prevalence of celiac disease (CD) prompted us to evaluate a new, noninvasive disease screening strategy. The aim was to identify CD in 6- to 8-year-old children for a timely diagnosis, start gluten-free diet (GFD) in compliant subjects, achieve the growth target, and prevent CD complications. METHODS: Five thousand subjects were invited to participate in the study. Four thousand forty-eight saliva samples were tested for anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin (Ig)A using a fluid-phase radioimmunoprecipitation method. Positive children were tested for serum radioimmunoassay tTG IgA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tTG IgA, and anti-endomysium IgA. Children confirmed as positive by serum assays underwent endoscopy with duodenal biopsies and, at the diagnosis of CD, were suggested to start GFD. RESULTS: Consent was obtained from 4242 parents (84.8%) for the screening to be performed, and adequate saliva samples were collected from 4048 children (95.4%). Thirty-two children were found to be salivary tTG IgA positive and 9 with borderline autoantibody levels. Thirty-one of the 32 and 3 of the 9 subjects were also serum positive. Twenty-eight children showed villous atrophy when undergoing intestinal biopsy, whereas 1 had Marsh 1 lesions; 3 children were suggested to start GFD without performing endoscopy. CD prevalence in the population investigated (including 19 CD known cases) was 1.16%. The ratio between screening-detected patients and those diagnosed before the screening was 3:2. The ratio between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was 1:1.6. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that it is possible to perform a powerful, simple, well-accepted, and sensitive CD screening using saliva. Until now, the compliance with GFD in children with CD has been optimal.},

The aim of the study was to assess nutritional status of iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) in patients with typical CD (TCD) and atypical CD (ACD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was done in patients with TCD, ACD, and healthy controls (HC). Hemoglobin, serum ferritin, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, Fe, Cu, ceruloplasmin, Zn, anti-endomysial antibodies, and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were measured. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis, principal component analysis, and linear discriminant analysis. RESULTS: : One hundred nine individuals were studied (54 TCD, 19 ACD, 36 HC); mean age +/- standard deviation was 23 +/- 15.8 (range 1.6-75.4) years. Median and range of hemoglobin were 12.8 g/dL (8.1-17.6) in TCD, 12.4 g/dL (10.5-14.5) in ACD, and 13.6 g/dL (11.1-16.7) in HC (P < 0.0001); serum ferritin was 17.7 mug/L (2.9-157), 10.8 mug/L (2.7-39.8), and 28.7 mug/L (4.5-127.2), respectively (P < 0.01). Cu was 105 mug/dL (60-185), 97.5 mug/dL (40-130), and 125 mug/dL (80-205), respectively (P < 0.05). Ceruloplasmin was 21.6 mg/dL (14.2-73.2), 22.6 mg/dL (0.9-34.3), and 32.1 mg/dL (5.8-72.6), respectively (P < 0.01). There were no differences in Fe, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and Zn. Principal component analysis showed that 58% of observed variability was explained by Fe and Cu indicators. Linear discriminant analysis revealed differences between CD and HC (P < 0.0001), with high values of correct classification for TCD (73%) and HC (72%), but not ACD (16%), which were mostly classified as TCD (79%). CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of micronutrients was found both in typical as well as in atypical cases.},

   abstract = {As gut immaturity precludes full enteral feeding, very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants receive parenteral nutrition (PN) during the first few weeks of life. Weaning VLBW infants off PN, however, is a top priority since PN is associated with a high risk of complications. The decision making is purely empirical, as there is currently no suitable index of gastrointestinal (GI) maturity. Plasma citrulline concentration is considered an index of GI function in conditions such as short-bowel syndrome and coeliac disease in adults. To identify the factors determining urinary citrulline excretion, and determine whether urinary citrulline excretion could be used as a non-invasive index of GI tolerance to enteral feeding, nutritional intake and urinary citrulline were monitored bi-weekly in forty-seven preterm infants < 1500 g (interquartiles 880-1320 g), during their stay in the Neonatology unit. Median urinary citrulline was 24.7 mumol/mmol creatinine (14.5-38.6 mumol/mmol creatinine). No relationship was observed with the percentage of energy tolerated enterally. In multivariate regression analysis, weak correlations were found with post-conceptional age (P = 0.001), parenteral amino acid supply (P = 0.001) and the daily volume of enteral mixture administered (P = 0.043). A significant correlation was found with urinary nitrite+nitrate excretion (r 0.47; P < 0.001). We conclude that in preterm infants: (1) one of the major determinants of urinary citrulline may be the biosynthesis of citrulline from arginine by NO-synthase; (2) urinary citrulline cannot be used to predict GI tolerance. This is consistent with the observations that, in neonatal gut, citrulline is converted to arginine in situ rather than exported towards the kidneys as observed in adults.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Studies of adults and children with celiac disease (CD) performed mostly in tertiary care centers have reported an increased risk of overweight during gluten-free diet (GFD). We measured body mass index (BMI) of CD children followed by family pediatricians in order to estimate prevalence of underweight and overweight at diagnosis and to describe BMI changes during GFD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared 150 CD children (age range 2-16 yrs) under GFD from a median (IQR) time of 4.4 (4.2) years with 288 healthy children matched for gender and age. We also evaluated retrospectively BMI changes between CD diagnosis and the current evaluation. The median (IQR) BMI of CD patients was significantly lower than that of controls [-0.38 (1.46) vs. 0.09 (1.18) SDS, p < 0.0001, Italian reference data]. Using the International Obesity Task Force classifications, CD children were less frequently overweight or obese (12% vs. 23.3%, p = 0.014) and more frequently underweight (16% vs. 4.5%, p < 0.001) than controls. During GFD, there was a marked decrease of number of underweight subjects (13 vs. 27) and a minimal increase of number of overweight subjects (9 vs. 6) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of overweight and obesity at diagnosis of CD and during GFD in children followed by family pediatricians is substantially lower than that reported in tertiary care centers. On the other hand, the high frequency of underweight at diagnosis confirms the need of careful personalized nutritional management.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder occurring in genetically susceptible subjects. The incidence of CD is around 1%, and it is much more common in first-degree relatives of CD patients, 10%-18%. However, the pattern of the genetic inheritance is still obscure. Environmental factors are undoubtedly affecting the disease's clinical presentation, time at presentation, and may have an effect on the characteristics of the disease. The clinical presentation of CD has shifted during the previous decades from the classical presentation in which the toddler suffers from diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, failure to thrive, abdominal distension, etc., to the child with a monosymptomatic presentation, such as anemia, as well as an enlarged list of extra-intestinal disorders. The diagnosis of CD is being established by symptoms consistent with CD and positive serology. The ultimate diagnosis should be made upon histological evaluation of the small bowel mucosa. The treatment of CD is a lifelong, strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Compliance with a GFD is quite difficult. Therefore, new strategies for prevention and treatment modalities other than GFD are greatly needed. Recently several promising therapeutic modalities have been developed; these include resuming traditional baking techniques. Another methodology is using probiotic-driven prolylendopeptidase. Another pathway to tackle the therapeutic option in CD is by down-regulation of the activity of zonulin-the active pump enabling gluten to enter the enterocytes. We are facing an era where other modalities beyond a GFD might allow CD patients to be able to tolerate occasionally a small amount of gluten in their diet.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will be discussed.},

The aim of the study was to establish the frequency and nature of reproductive function violation in patients with CD in the Russian Federation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 132 women (average age 38,5 +/- 1,17 years) with CD observed in CSRIG in the period from 2000 to 2010. Comparison group consisted 105 women (average age 38,7 +/- 1,6 years) with predominantly functional bowel disorders (irritable bowel syndrome, functional constipation, functional bloating, inert colon). Were took into account information regarding obstetric history, physical and laboratory signs of malabsorption syndrome (MS) study of antibodies to alpha-gliadin immunoglobulin (IG) A class (AGA) and tissue transglutaminase (AtTG). RESULTS: The average age of onset of menses was 14,3 +/- 1,4 years, and in the control group - 13,0 +/- 1,3 years (p > 0.05), half of patients with C (43.9%) had menstruation begun at age 15 years and older, while 7.6% of the women--aged 17 and older. In the comparison group menses beginning after 15 years was only at 13.3% of women. In 61.3% of patients with CD was irregular menstrual cycle while in the comparison group such violations were noted in 13.3% (p < 0.001). Prolonged periods of amenorrhea we observed in women with newly diagnosed GC 3 times more likely than the comparison group: 43.9% and 11.4% respectively (p < 0.01). They also had nearly 3 times more likely to occur spontaneous miscarriage: at 46.9% and 14.3% respectively (p < 0.01). The frequency of dead children birth was about the same: 2.3% and 1.9% respectively (p > 0.05). The frequency of reproductive disorders increased with the growth of the severity of MS. In 43% of women after 6-8 months of strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) had disappeared amenorrhea and there were regular menses. Three women of childbearing age, strictly abided the GFD and had a history of repeated spontaneous abortion during the year managed to get pregnant and give birth to healthy full-term baby. CONCLUSIONS: Reproductive disorders in women with celiac disease are significantly more likely than at women with functional bowel disease. One of the reasons of reproductive disorders in patients with CD can be malabsorption of necessary nutrients in the small intestine. The presence of reproductive disorders should be considered as a risk factor for celiac disease, so these women should be screened for celiac disease.},

In this study, the celiac IgA-immunoreactivity to zeins from raw or nixtamalized grains, before and after peptic/tryptic digestion was evaluated and their possible immunogenicity was investigated by in silico methods.IgA from some celiac patients with HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 haplotypes recognized two alpha-zeins even after peptic/ tryptic proteolysis. However, digestion affected zeins after denaturation, reduction, and alkylation, used for identification of prolamins as alpha-zein A20 and A30 by MS/MS sequencing. An in silico analysis indicated that other zeins contain similar sequences, or sequences that may bind even better to the HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules compared to the already identified ones. Results concur to indicate that relative abundance of these zeins, along with factors affecting their resistance to proteolysis, may be of paramount clinical relevance, and the use of maize in the formulation and preparation of gluten-free foods must be reevaluated in some cases of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed at investigating the effect of corn, rice and amaranth gluten-free (GF) sourdoughs on the release of nitric oxide (NO) and synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines by duodenal mucosa biopsies of eight coeliac disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Selected lactic acid bacteria were used as starters for the manufacture of corn, rice or amaranth sourdoughs. Chemically acidified doughs, without bacterial starters, and doughs started with baker's yeast alone were also manufactured from the same GF matrices. Pepsin-trypsin (PT) digests were produced from all sourdoughs and doughs, and used to assay the rate of recovery of biopsy specimens from eight CD patients at diagnosis. The release of NO and the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were assayed. RESULTS: During fermentation, lactic acid bacteria acidified and grew well (ca. log 9.0 CFU/g) on all GF matrices, showing intense proteolysis. Duodenal biopsy specimens still released NO and IFN-gamma when subjected to treatments with basal medium (control), PT-digest from chemically acidified doughs and PT-digest from doughs fermented with baker's yeast alone. On the contrary, the treatment of all the biopsy specimens with PT-digests from all GF matrices subjected to sourdough fermentation significantly decreased the release of NO and the synthesis of IFN-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: During manufacture of GF baked goods, the use of sourdough fermentation could be considered as an adjuvant to enhance the recovery from intestinal inflammation of coeliac patients at the early stage of the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) is based on the histological identification of gluten-sensitive enteropathy and detection of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) and/or endomysial antibodies. Serial measurements of tTGA are now recommended as a follow-up strategy to monitor compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD). We evaluated the performances of a quantitative radiobinding assay (RBA) of tTGA immunoglobulin A at diagnosis and during monitoring of GFD in pediatric CD. METHODS: Eighty children with confirmed CD were selected. Levels of serum tTGA measured by RBA and a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were compared at diagnosis. The relation between RBA-tTGA levels and histological damage was analyzed, as well as the time course of tTGA clearance during GFD. RESULTS: Both RBA and ELISA showed high sensitivity and specificity for tTGA detection at diagnosis. There was no relation between RBA-tTGA levels at diagnosis and severity of mucosal damage. Upon initiation of GFD, the rate of RBA-tTGA positivity declined slower than that of endomysial antibodies positivity, with >50% of the children still tTGA positive at year 5; however, tTGA levels decreased rapidly during the first year of GFD and more slowly thereafter. Children who seroreverted had lower tTGA levels at diagnosis (2080+/-1554 cpm) than those who remained tTGA positive throughout follow-up (3688+/-1435 cpm). CONCLUSIONS: The high sensitivity of RBA is likely responsible for higher tTGA positivity rates during GFD than previously reported with ELISA. A decreasing trend for tTGA levels may represent a better surrogate marker of compliance with GFD than absolute normal tTGA levels.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) involves disturbance of the small-bowel mucosal vascular network, and transglutaminase autoantibodies (TGA) have been related to angiogenesis disturbance, a complex phenomenon probably also influenced by common genetic variants in angiogenesis-related genes. A set of genes with "angiogenesis" GO term identified in a previous expression microarray experiment (SCG2, STAB1, TGFA, ANG, ERBB2, GNA13, PML, CASP8, ECGF1, JAG1, HIF1A, TNFSF13 and TGM2) was selected for genetic and functional studies. SNPs that showed a trend for association with CD in the first GWAS were genotyped in 555 patients and 541 controls. Gene expression of all genes was quantified in 15 pairs of intestinal biopsies (diagnosis vs. GFD) and in three-dimensional HUVEC and T84 cell cultures incubated with TGA-positive and negative serum. A regulatory SNP in TNFSF13 (rs11552708) is associated with CD (p = 0.01, OR = 0.7). Expression changes in biopsies pointed to TGM2 and PML as up-regulated antiangiogenic genes and to GNA13, TGFA, ERBB2 and SCG2 as down-regulated proangiogenic factors in CD. TGA seem to enhance TGM2 expression in both cell models, but PML expression was induced only in T84 enterocytes while GNA13 and ERBB2 were repressed in HUVEC endothelial cells, with several genes showing discordant effects in each model, highlighting the complexity of gene interactions in the pathogenesis of CD. Finally, cell culture models are useful tools to help dissect complex responses observed in human explants.},

   abstract = {The intestinal epithelial monolayer constitutes a physical and functional barrier between the organism and the external environment. It regulates nutrients absorption, water and ion fluxes, and represents the first defensive barrier against toxins and enteric pathogens. Epithelial cells are linked together at the apical junctional complex by tight junctions that reduce the extracellular space and the passage of charge entities while forming a physical barrier to lipophilic molecules. Cultured intestinal epithelial cells have been extensively used to study intestinal absorption of newly synthesized drugs and the regulation of tight junctions structure and function. In vitro mild irritants, proinflammatory cytokines, toxins and pathogens, and adverse environmental conditions open tight junctions and increase paracellular permeability, an effect often accompanied by immune activation of the enterocytes. Conversely, inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines, exposure to growth factors and probiotics, among others, exert a protective effect. Impaired barrier function results from activation of signalling pathways that lead to alteration of junctional proteins expression and/or distribution. In vivo, intestinal barrier dysfunction is associated with various intestinal and non-intestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and diarrhoeal infection. This review will describe the current knowledge of the mechanisms regulating tight junctions and intestinal permeability, how these findings have lead to a better understanding of barrier alteration in human intestinal disorders, and what the emerging therapies to treat these pathologies are.},

Some physical, chemical, rheological, mechanical and fluidity properties, as well as the color of these mixtures for a period of conservation of 90 days were evaluated. At the end of the storage, the sweet mixture turned out to be of "little flow" and the dessert mixture changed from "little flow" to "easy flow". Viscosity for the dessert mixture, with its two types of dilutions, water and milk, presented a behavior of pseudoplastic fluid. It was possible to guess that the time of shelf life of the mixtures would be of 9 months before achieving the rancidity limit (10 mEq of oxigen/kg of fat, which would disqualify the product for consumption). The CIEL*a*b* color coordinates did not show significant differences keeping the colour in "a beige" tonality.},

Recent epidemiological studies provide evidence that elective cesarean section (CS) is associated with aberrant short-term immune responses in the newborn infant, and a greater risk of developing immune diseases such as asthma, allergies, type 1 diabetes, and celiac disease. However, it is still unknown whether CS causes a long-term effect on the immune system of the offspring that contributes to compromised immune health. With the dramatic increase in the rate of CS today, a greater emphasis should be placed on the discussion among both professionals and childbearing women on potential consequences of CS on the health of the offspring.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 allelic genotyping combined with serologic testing for the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy children, who underwent jejunal biopsy for digestive symptoms or malnutrition, were tested for HLA-DQ2/DQ8 and serologic markers (tTG and/or anti-endomysial antibodies). Children were classified in 2 groups, according to jejunal histology: group 1, when partial or total villous atrophy was associated with an increased intraepithelial lymphocytosis suggesting CD, and group 2, when these histological criteria were absent. RESULTS: Eight children were excluded from the study because their intestinal histology was not informative; 82 children were classified in group 1 and 80 in group 2. Eighty-one of 82 children in group 1 were positive for HLA and serologic testing. The other child had negative HLA and serologic testing but marked villous atrophy, and further investigation showed an allergic disease. Among the 80 children in group 2, 53 were negative for both HLA and serologic testing, 22 were positive for HLA but negative for serologic testing, 2 were negative for HLA and positive for serologic testing, and 3 patients were positive for both HLA and serologic testing. The last 3 children were shown to have an autoimmune background and had probably a latent form of CD. The association of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 and serologic markers had a sensitivity of 98.8%, a specificity of 96.2%, a positive likelihood ratio of 26.3, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.013. CONCLUSIONS: The association of positive HLA-DQ2/DQ8 and serologic testing has a high predictive value for CD. We suggest that symptomatic children with high titers of immunoglobulin (Ig)A tTG could be diagnosed as patients with CD without performing jejunal biopsy. In other children, HLA-DQ2/DQ8 could be useful to exclude the diagnosis of CD if negative. In cases of low IgA tTG titers or in patients with IgA deficiency, intestinal biopsy remains mandatory.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Because capsule endoscopy (CE) avoids ionizing radiation, deep sedation, and general anesthesia, CE may be valuable in pediatrics. We report a single pediatric center's experience with the use and safety of CE. METHODS: In a retrospective review of consecutive CE studies, 284 CE studies were performed in 277 patients with a mean age of 15 (+/-3.7) years during a 5-year period. The youngest to swallow the capsule was 4.6 years old. Twenty capsules were placed. Overall, 245 (86%) patients underwent CE for suspected (184, 65%) or confirmed (61, 21%) Crohn disease (CD); 27 (9.5%) anemia or gastrointestinal bleeding; 6 (2%) polyposis; and 4 (1.4%) celiac disease. RESULTS: Positive findings were observed in 205 (72%) of the studies, with 152 (54%) having small bowel findings. Of these, 72 (47%) were diagnostic. Gastric (95, 33%) and colonic (31, 11%) abnormalities were also identified. Five CE studies (1.8%) resulted in retention of the capsule in nonsurgical patients. A patency capsule before CE in 23 patients allowed 19 CE to proceed with only 1 retained capsule. In 65 (21%) patients, the video capsule did not enter the colon before the video's end. Of these, 36 (65%) had significant findings, including 27 (49%) documenting small bowel (SB) CD. CONCLUSIONS: CE is useful to diagnose SB disease in children. Even in a study population with a high prevalence of confirmed and suspected CD, the risk of retention remains small. The patency capsule may lessen that risk. CE may identify gastric or colonic disease even when SB lesions are not present.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Production of autoantibodies to the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is a hallmark of coeliac disease (CD). We have previously demonstrated that the immumoglobulin (Ig) A response to tTG in adult CD specifically targets its catalytic core region, containing the active-site triad of amino acids. The aim of the present study was to investigate this phenomenon in paediatric patients with CD, and to elucidate the contribution of each active-site residue to epitopes recognised. The specificity of the IgG anti-tTG response was also investigated and compared with that of the IgA anti-tTG response, in both paediatric and adult patients with CD. METHODS: Wild-type and novel variants of tTG were generated via site-directed mutagenesis and expressed as glutathione-S-transferase-fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL-21. The mutagenic variants of tTG had substitutions of 1, 1, or all of the 3 of the catalytic triad amino acids. All of the recombinant tTGs were tested for their antigenicity in IgA and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with cohorts of paediatric (n=63) and adult (n=30) CD sera. RESULTS: Substitution of even 1 amino acid in the catalytic triad resulted in a significant reduction of CD IgA and IgG anti-tTG binding, with all of the mutant proteins displaying diminished antigenicity compared with the wild-type protein. CONCLUSIONS: The core region of tTG is specifically targeted from early on in disease course by CD patient autoantibodies of both the IgA and IgG class.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The only treatment available for coeliac disease (CD) is a strict diet in which the intake of wheat, barley, rye, or oats is avoided. Barley is a major cereal crop, grown mainly for its use in brewing, and it has high nutritional value. The identification of varieties with a reduced toxicity profile may contribute to improve the diet, the quality of life and health of CD patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Searching for harmless barleys, we investigated accessions of malting and wild barley, used for developing new cultivated cereals. The CD toxicity profile of barleys was screened using G12 antibody and cell proliferation and IFN-gamma release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal biopsies from CD patients. We found a direct correlation between the reactivity with G12 and the immunogenicity of the different barleys. CONCLUSION: The malting barleys were less immunogenic, with reduced levels of toxic gluten, and were possibly less harmful to CD patients. Our findings could raise the prospect of breeding barley species with low levels of harmful gluten, and the attractive goal of developing nontoxic barley cultivars, always taking into account the Codex standard for foods for special dietary use for persons intolerant to gluten.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Certain immunotoxic peptides from gluten are resistant to gastrointestinal digestion and can interact with celiac-patient factors to trigger an immunologic response. A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only effective treatment for celiac disease (CD), and its compliance should be monitored to avoid cumulative damage. However, practical methods to monitor diet compliance and to detect the origin of an outbreak of celiac clinical symptoms are not available. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the capacity to determine the gluten ingestion and monitor GFD compliance in celiac patients by the detection of gluten and gliadin 33-mer equivalent peptidic epitopes (33EPs) in human feces. DESIGN: Fecal samples were obtained from healthy subjects, celiac patients, and subjects with other intestinal pathologies with different diet conditions. Gluten and 33EPs were analyzed by using immunochromatography and competitive ELISA with a highly sensitive antigliadin 33-mer monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: The resistance of a significant part of 33EPs to gastrointestinal digestion was shown in vitro and in vivo. We were able to detect gluten peptides in feces of healthy individuals after consumption of a normal gluten-containing diet, after consumption of a GFD combined with controlled ingestion of a fixed amount of gluten, and after ingestion of <100 mg gluten/d. These methods also allowed us to detect GFD infringement in CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-derived peptides could be sensitively detected in human feces in positive correlation with the amount of gluten intake. These techniques may serve to show GFD compliance or infringement and be used in clinical research in strategies to eliminate gluten immunotoxic peptides during digestion. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01478867.},

   abstract = {Numerous complications can occur in celiac disease, nutritional (growth failure in children, malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies), hematologic (anaemia), bone disease (osteoporosis, fracture), gynaecologic (hypo fertility), cardiovascular (coronaropathy, venous thrombosis), neurological (peripheral neuropathy), hepatic (cytolysis, cirrhosis). Celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, thyroiditis), and cancer (upper digestive tract, hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphoma). The main digestive complications are microscopic colitis and refractory sprue, which are resistant to gluten-free diet. It can be associated with a monoclonal proliferation of intraepithelial lymphocytes (type 2 refractory sprue), which may be considered as a cryptic lymphoma and can lead to invasive T lymphoma, which occurs in one celiac patient in 1000. Gluten-free diet protects from the occurrence of most complications and correct the over-mortality related to these complications.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The main objectives of this study were to estimate dietary fumonisin exposure and nutrient intake in a group of patients diagnosed with celiac disease compared to non-celiac subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: The fumonisin level in 118 frequently consumed corn-based products was determined and dietary habits were recorded using a 7-day weighed food record. Data were then compared to those obtained for a control group. The fumonisin intake in the celiac patients was significantly higher than in controls, with mean values (+/- SE) of 0.395 +/- 0.049 and 0.029 +/- 0.006 mug/kg body weight per day, respectively. With regard to nutritional habits, celiac patients showed a preference for a high fat diet, coupled with a high intake of sweets and soft drinks and a low intake of vegetables, iron, calcium and folate. CONCLUSION: These findings may have serious health implications for the celiac population due to the widespread occurrence of fumonisins in most of the widely consumed gluten-free products, leading to continuous exposure to this particular mycotoxin. Moreover, the recorded nutritional quality of the celiac patient's diet raises concerns regarding its long-term adequacy and its potential impact on chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular complications have been frequently described in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Both Crohn disease and Ulcerative Colitis are characterized by malabsorption of some micronutrients, such as carnitine, which is a very important element for myocardial metabolism, being demonstrated that its deficiency correlates with heart involvement in coeliac disease. Aims of this study are to evaluate cardiac function in IBD patients asymptomatic for cardiovascular diseases and to correlate the cardiac data with the profile of carnitine esters plasma levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out on 20 IBD patients by comparison with 18 sex- and age-matched clinically healthy controls. Personal and familial history, physical examination, standard electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were performed in all subjects. Complete panel of nutritional status parameters and serum levels of free carnitine and its esters were evaluated both in IBD patients and control subjects. RESULTS: Isovaleryl-carnitine, Tiglyl-carnitine, Octenoylcarnitine and Decanoyl-carnitine, were found to be significantly lower in IBD patients. Significant correlations were found between some carnitine esters and echocardiographic parameters although total and free carnitine were meanly more elevated in IBD. No statistically significant differences in echocardiographic parameters were found between IBD patients and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of some isoforms of carnitine, especially those esterified with short chain fatty acids, may play an important role in cardiac involvement in course of IBD and could lead, over time, to dilated cardiomiopathy.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate all patients referred to our center with non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD), to establish a cause for their continued symptoms. METHODS: We assessed all patients referred to our center with non-responsive celiac disease over an 18-mo period. These individuals were investigated to establish the eitiology of their continued symptoms. The patients were first seen in clinic where a thorough history and examination were performed with routine blood work including tissue transglutaminase antibody measurement. They were also referred to a specialist gastroenterology dietician to try to identift any lapses in the diet and sources of hidden gluten ingestion. A repeat small intestinal biopsy was also performed and compared to biopsies from the referring hospital where possible. Colonoscopy, lactulose hydrogen breath testing, pancreolauryl testing and computed tomography scan of the abdomen were undertaken if the symptoms persisted. Their clinical progress was followed over a minimum of 2 years. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve consecutive patients were referred with NRCD. Twelve were found not to have celiac disease (CD). Of the remaining 100 patients, 45% were not adequately adhering to a strict gluten-free diet, with 24 (53%) found to be inadvertently ingesting gluten, and 21 (47%) admitting non-compliance. Microscopic colitis was diagnosed in 12% and small bowel bacterial overgrowth in 9%. Refractory CD was diagnosed in 9%. Three of these were diagnosed with intestinal lymphoma. After 2 years, 78 patients remained well, eight had continuing symptoms, and four had died. CONCLUSION: In individuals with NRCD, a remediable cause can be found in 90%: with continued gluten ingestion as the leading cause. We propose an algorithm for investigation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thyroid autoimmunity (TA) is often associated with coeliac disease (CD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, in children and adolescents with CD on a gluten-free diet (GFD): (1) the prevalence of TA; (2) the impact of TA on growth and the need for L-thyroxine (L-T4) treatment, during a longitudinal survey. METHOD: Between January and December 2005, 545 patients with CD, prospectively followed up until December 2007, and 622 controls were screened for TA. Antithyroperoxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies were assayed and, if positive, serum free tri-iodothyronine, free thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assays and thyroid ultrasound were performed. L-T4 was started if TSH was >5.5 mU/ml at two successive measurements. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in TA prevalence between patients with CD on a GFD (10%) and controls (8.2%). Duration of GFD differed significantly in coeliac patients with TA in comparison with those without TA (7.9+/-0.9 and 10.2+/-0.3 years, p<0.001), but no significant difference was found for weight and height gain (1.8+/-1.0 vs 3.7+/-1.5 and 2.1+/-1.2 kg/year vs 4.0+/-1.1 cm/year, respectively). At the end of the follow-up an increase of 7% in the prevalence of patients with CD with TA requiring L-T4 was found. CONCLUSIONS: TA seems no more common in paediatric and adolescent patients with CD on a GFD than in controls; its clinical evolution does not seem to impact on growth. Therefore, a long-term regular screening programme for thyroid disease may not be necessary for all patients with CD on a GFD, but only for those who are suspected of having thyroid diseases.},

   abstract = {Gluten is a commonly used cereal derivative found in bakery products, among other items. In some susceptible individuals, however, it triggers immune responses of different kinds; there is, to a lesser extent, the wheat allergy that is immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated and leads to histamine release and typical allergic symptoms. In this case, other water-soluble proteins, like albumins, are also involved. On the other hand, there is, more frequently, celiac disease (CD), where the gluten causes immune reactions in the intestines of certain individuals, leading to degeneration of villi, which typically leads to malabsorption of nutrients and, consequently, malnutrition. The only currently effective health strategy for affected consumers is avoidance of gluten-containing products, based on clear labeling rules. However, despite unanimously accepted Codex definitions by all member jurisdictions, the national implementation of equivalent laws shows significant differences. In the context of CD and in support of the gluten-free statement, regulatory enforcement, as well as manufacturers' quality controls are mostly based on analytical results. However, numerous methods are available, some of which have been validated better than others, and many provide different results on identical samples. Reasons include detection of different gluten components and variability in extraction efficiency due to different buffer compositions, especially from processed foods. Last but not least, the lack of reference materials is hindering the process of generating comparable data across different ELISA kits, as well as other methods. How can such data still be used to support a gluten-free claim? New methodologies, in particular mass spectrometric analysis of gluten derived peptides, are being introduced in numerous laboratories. This methodology is not only capable of detecting gluten derived peptides but can also differentiate between and quantitate wheat, barley, rye, and oat. This paper presents analytical limitations, as well as promising new approaches in support of industry and enforcement activities to ensure compliance with the gluten-free claim under the current regulatory framework.},

Celiac patients' first-degree relatives are more at risk of acquiring the disease. The objective of the present study was consequently to determine the prevalence of celiac disease in a group of first-degree relatives of our patients with celiac disease. METHODS: First-degree relatives of 195 patients with celiac disease attending a gastroenterology unit underwent serologic screening. Antitissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) immunoglobulin A (IgA) and total serum IgA tests were used for first-level screening. Duodenal biopsy was recommended to subjects showing positive results to anti-tTG IgA testing. Biopsy samples were obtained by endoscopy, and biopsy specimens were evaluated and classified according to Marsh classification. RESULTS: Positive anti-tTG IgA was found in 46 first-degree relatives (9.5%), whereas serum IgA levels were normal. Of 46 serology-positive relatives, 34 agreed to the endoscopy procedure. Histological changes characteristic of celiac disease were found in 23 subjects. The prevalence of celiac disease among the first-degree relatives was found to be at least 4.8%. Of 34 subjects that underwent biopsy, 11 were evaluated as Marsh 0, 5 as Marsh 1, 4 as Marsh 2, 12 as Marsh 3, and 2 as Marsh 4. Of the biopsy-positive subjects, 3 were mothers, 1 was a father, and 19 were siblings. CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified 23 undiagnosed cases of celiac disease among 484 first-degree relatives of 195 patients with celiac disease, confirming the high prevalence (4.8%) of the disease in this specific group. It is suggested that an extensive screening policy be mandatory for these subjects.},

Recognition of this entity is highly relevant to avoid malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality. Therapy of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is based on the oral administration of pancreatic enzymes aiming at providing the duodenal lumen with sufficient amount of active lipase at the time of gastric emptying of nutrients. Administration of enzymes in form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres avoids acid-mediated lipase inactivation and ensures gastric emptying of enzymes in parallel with nutrients. Despite that, factors like an acidic intestinal pH and bacterial overgrowth may prevent normalization of fat digestion even in compliant patients. The present article critically reviews current therapeutic approaches to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease is a common disease that affects approximately 1% of Northern European and American populations. Evidence suggests it is caused by an inappropriate immune response in genetically susceptible patients to dietary gluten found in wheat, rye, barley and, in a small minority of patients, oats. Treatment involves a lifelong gluten-free diet. This diet limits nutritional variety and is costly and difficult to maintain. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the current treatment options available and discusses novel emerging therapies for coeliac disease. EXPERT OPINION: Novel therapies are still in early stages of development and therefore, at present, a gluten-free diet remains the treatment of choice in coeliac disease due to its low side-effect profile. A replacement for a gluten-free diet would be superior to an adjunct; in this case dietary modification of gluten may well have the least side effects, be tolerated by a wider group of coeliac patients and therefore be accepted. Search terms used: Pubmed, Medline and clinicaltrials.gov were searched with 'celiac disease' and 'therapy' as MESH terms. Patent database was searched using the term 'celiac disease'. Conference attendance at DDW Chicago 2011 and Columbia 2010 was also used to gain further information from conference abstracts.},

   abstract = {The term oral (or mucosal) tolerance has been classically defined as the suppression of T- and B-cell responses to an antigen by prior administration of the antigen by the oral route. In recent years, it has become clear that both innate and acquired regulatory immune responses are essential for the development of oral tolerance. As such, mucosal microenvironmental factors such as transforming growth factor- beta, prostaglandins but also dietary vitamin A create conditioning of an adaptive regulatory T-cell response that suppresses subsequent antigen-specific responses. Particular resident subsets of antigen presenting dendritic cells are pivotal to convey conditioning signals next to the presentation of antigen. This review discusses the primary mechanisms of adaptive regulatory T-cell induction to ingested soluble protein antigen. However, we also discuss the limitations of our knowledge with respect to understanding the very common food hypersensitivity Celiac disease caused by an aberrant adaptive immune response to the food protein gluten.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify new markers of mucosal T cells to monitor ongoing intestinal immune responses in peripheral blood. METHODS: Expression of cell-surface markers was studied in mice on ovalbumin (OVA)-specific T cells in the gut-draining mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) after OVA feed. The effect of the local mucosal mediators retinoic acid (RA) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on the induction of a mucosal phenotype was determined in in vitro T-cell differentiation assays with murine and human T cells. Tetramer stainings were performed to study gluten-specific T cells in the circulation of patients with celiac disease, a chronic small-intestinal inflammation. RESULTS: In mice, proliferating T cells in MLN were CD62L(neg)CD38(+) during both tolerance induction and abrogation of intestinal homeostasis. This mucosal CD62L(neg)CD38(+) T-cell phenotype was efficiently induced by RA and TGF-beta in mice, whereas for human CD4(+) T cells RA alone was sufficient. The CD4(+)CD62L(neg)CD38(+) T-cell phenotype could be used to identify T cells with mucosal origin in human peripheral blood, as expression of the gut-homing chemokine receptor CCR9 and beta(7) integrin were highly enriched in this subset whereas expression of cutaneous leukocyte-associated antigen was almost absent. Tetramer staining revealed that gluten-specific T cells appearing in blood of treated celiac disease patients after oral gluten challenge were predominantly CD4(+)CD62L(neg)CD38(+). The total percentage of circulating CD62L(neg)CD38(+) of CD4 T cells was not an indicator of intestinal inflammation as percentages did not differ between pediatric celiac disease patients, inflammatory bowel disease patients and respective controls. However, the phenotypic selection of mucosal T cells allowed cytokine profiling as upon restimulation of CD62L(neg)CD38(+) cells interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) transcripts were readily detected in circulating mucosal T cells. CONCLUSIONS: By selecting for CD62L(neg)CD38(+) expression that comprises 5-10% of the cells within the total CD4(+) T-cell pool we are able to highly enrich for effector T cells with specificity for mucosal antigens. This is of pivotal importance for functional studies as this purification enhances the sensitivity of cytokine detection and cellular activation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wheat gluten comprises gliadins and glutenins. The high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin subunits (GS)-1Dy10 are toxic for patients with celiac disease (CD). This study aimed to assess whether CD patients mount a serological response to HMW-GS-1Dy10. METHODS: Recombinant HMW-GS-1Dy10 was deamidated using human recombinant tissue transglutaminase. MALDI-TOF was performed to compare the level of deamidation of glutamine residues between material before and after treatment. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were developed. Sera from patients with untreated CD and gastrointestinal disease controls were tested and receiver operator characteristics were used to calculate cutoffs. RESULTS: MALDI-TOF revealed a number of fragments matching known HMW-GS-1Dy10 sequences within both the deamidated and non-deamidated material. Evidence of deamidation of glutamine residues was found only within the human transglutaminase-treated material. Patients with untreated CD had significantly increased levels of serum antibodies to HMW-GS-1Dy10 compared to controls. Undeamidated HMW-GS-1Dy10 IgA antibodies had sensitivities and specificities of 72.5 and 78.26%, respectively. Deamidated HMW-GS-1Dy10 IgA antibodies had sensitivities and specificities of 76.8 and 65.2%. Undeamidated HMW-GS-1Dy10 IgG antibodies had sensitivities and specificities of 75.3 and 68.1%. Deamidated HMW-GS-1Dy10 IgG antibodies had sensitivities and specificities of 36.2 and 92.8%. CONCLUSION: Patients with untreated CD have raised antibody levels to HMW-GS-1Dy10, indicating the participation of these proteins in the adaptive immune response to gluten. Discrimination between CD patients and controls is not enhanced by deamidation of HMW-GS-1Dy10. Thus antibodies to these proteins are not useful markers for CD detection.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by immunemediated inflammatory damage of the small intestinal mucosa, precipitated by the ingestion of gluten-containing foods. Since human leucocyte antigen DQ2 (HLA-DQ2) is a marker of nonresponsiveness to hepatits B virus (HBV) vaccine, CD may also be associated with this nonresponsiveness. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the responses to HBV vaccine between children with CD and healthy children. We also investigated the relationship between the patients' responses to hepatitis B vaccine, the clinical presentation of CD, and dietary compliance in the patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 52 children with CD and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy children who received HBV vaccination according to the standard immunization schedule. The production of specific antihepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) antibodies was evaluated in all patients and control participants. Subjects with less than 10 IU/L anti-HBs were consided nonresponders to the vaccination. RESULTS: 31 of the 52 patients (59.6%) were female and 21 (40.4%) were male. The mean age of the CD patients was 10.7 +/- 4 years (range, 4-18 years). Anti-HBs titers were positive in 32 (61.5%) patients and negative in 20 (38.5%) patients, while they were positive in 18 (90%) of the children in the control group (P < 0.05). We found statistically significant differences between negative anti-HBs titers, clinical presentation of CD, and dietary compliance in patients with CD (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Nonresponsiveness to hepatitis B vaccination was more frequently found in children with CD than in the control group. Therefore, the response to HBV vaccination should be investigated in children with CD, and a different immunization schedule may need to be developed. Further, compliance to the prescribed gluten-free diet (GFD) may improve the immune response to HBV vaccination in children with CD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe whether a gluten-free diet (GFD) is indicated in Marsh I gluten-sensitive enteropathy where gastrointestinal symptoms are not present. Arguments are provided to prescribe a GFD to manage extraintestinal symptoms. By contrast, there are not enough reasons to prescribe a GFD to prevent long-term complications. RECENT FINDINGS: Population-based and prospective observational studies have found that lymphocytic duodenosis may be due to not just gluten-sensitive enteropathy but also due to other aetiologic factors. Marsh I type lesions may be the cause of iron-deficiency anaemia of unknown aetiology which is reverted by a GFD. A similar effect seems to occur with bone mineralization and hypertransaminasemia. The beneficial influence of a GFD reducing lymphoma and coeliac disease-related mortality remains controversial. SUMMARY: An appropriate differential diagnosis of the lymphocytic duodenosis is essential before a GFD is indicated. As a third of patients remained undiagnosed, in spite of genetic study and specific coeliac serology, flow cytometry and transglutaminase antibodies in duodenal tissue may be helpful in establishing gluten-sensitive enteropathy diagnosis. Future studies should assess whether lymphoma risk is reduced by a GFD in Marsh I patients. Also a more precise benefit in bone mineralization in this setting is needed.},

   abstract = {The primary functions of the gastrointestinal tract have traditionally been perceived to be limited to the digestion and absorption of nutrients and to electrolytes and water homeostasis. A more attentive analysis of the anatomic and functional arrangement of the gastrointestinal tract, however, suggests that another extremely important function of this organ is its ability to regulate the trafficking of macromolecules between the environment and the host through a barrier mechanism. Together with the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and the neuroendocrine network, the intestinal epithelial barrier, with its intercellular tight junctions, controls the equilibrium between tolerance and immunity to non-self antigens. Zonulin is the only physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions described so far that is involved in trafficking of macromolecules and, therefore, in tolerance/immune response balance. When the finely tuned zonulin pathway is deregulated in genetically susceptible individuals, both intestinal and extraintestinal autoimmune, inflammatory, and neoplastic disorders can occur. This new paradigm subverts traditional theories underlying the development of these diseases and suggests that these processes can be arrested if the interplay between genes and environmental triggers is prevented by reestablishing the zonulin-dependent intestinal barrier function. This review is timely given the increased interest in the role of a "leaky gut" in the pathogenesis of several pathological conditions targeting both the intestine and extraintestinal organs.},

Intestinal tight junctions (TJs) create gradients for the optimal absorption and transport of nutrients and control the balance between tolerance and immunity to nonself antigens. To meet diverse physiological challenges, intestinal epithelial TJs must be modified rapidly and in a coordinated fashion by regulatory systems that orchestrate the state of assembly of the TJ multiprotein network. While considerable knowledge exists about TJ ultrastructure, relatively little is known about their physiological and pathophysiological regulation. Our discovery of zonulin, the only known physiologic modulator of intercellular TJs described so far, has increased our understanding of the intricate mechanisms that regulate the intestinal epithelial paracellular pathway and has led us to appreciate that its upregulation in genetically susceptible individuals leads to autoimmune diseases.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD), a common heritable chronic inflammatory condition of the small intestine caused by permanent intolerance to gluten/gliadin (prolamin), is characterized by a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Developments in proteomics have provided an important contribution to the understanding of the biochemical and immunological aspects of the disease and the mechanisms involved in toxicity of prolamins. It has been demonstrated that some gliadin peptides resistant to complete proteolytic digestion may directly affect intestinal cell structure and functions by modulating gene expression and oxidative stress. In recent years, the creation of the two research fields Nutrigenomics and Nutrigenetics, has enabled the elucidation of some interactions between diet, nutrients and genes. Various dietary components including long chain omega-3 fatty acids, plant flavonoids, and carotenoids have been demonstrated to modulate oxidative stress, gene expression and production of inflammatory mediators. Therefore their adoption could preserve intestinal barrier integrity, play a protective role against toxicity of gliadin peptides and have a role in nutritional therapy of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Collagenous sprue is a small bowel mucosal lesion that has been historically associated with persistent diarrhea, progressive weight loss and severe malabsorption causing multiple nutrient deficiencies. A severe to variably severe mucosal lesion with distinct subepithelial collagen deposits occurs. Celiac disease has been intimately linked to collagenous sprue and, similar to celiac disease, small bowel ulceration, perforation and lymphoma may complicate the clinical course of collagenous sprue. In collagenous sprue, concomitant collagen deposits may also occur in gastric or colonic mucosal sites (or both), indicating that this unusual mucosal process may be very heterogeneous and far more extensive in the intestinal tract than previously appreciated. Moreover, reports of diagnosis during infancy suggest that the natural history of the disorder could be more prolonged than is currently appreciated. Finally, the collagen deposits, per se, may be due to different causes and, in some, even represent a novel paraneoplastic histopathological marker. Future studies are needed to more precisely define molecular and genetic biomarkers that identify homogeneous groups and permit the development of improved treatment strategies for this increasingly recognized disorder.},

Contamination with prolamins of other cereals is frequent, and some clinical and experimental studies support the view that a subgroup of celiac patients may be intolerant to pure oats. Thus, this issue is more complex than previously suggested. In order to produce oats that are safe for all celiac patients, the following topics should be addressed: selection of oat cultivars with low avenin content, research on such recombinant varieties of oats, development of assay methods to detect avenins in oat products, guidelines for the agricultural processing of oats and the manufacture of oat products, as well as guidelines for following up with celiac patients who consume oats.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate eating habits and nutritional behaviors of women in the perimenopausal period with celiac disease diagnosed within the last 4 years. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study covered a group of 26 women, at the age of 51-54 years, with celiac disease diagnosed in the last 4 years and staying on a gluten-free diet for 6 months to 4 years and agreed to participate in this studies. Information of nutrition were collected from the women, who, after an appropriate instruction, recorded the timing, type and amount of food consumed in the three days a week, selected at random. The amount of consumed portions was defined on the basis of the "Book of portions, products and dishes". The menus (78) were recorded in April and May. Collected data were prepared, based on a computer program Dietetyk 2009 Prof. RESULTS: The analysis of results achieved in this study enabled concluding that--from the viewpoint of the diagnosed disease--the nutritional patterns of the women were very appropriate. However, it failed to meet basic nutritional guidelines, which was reflected in, among other things, unsatisfactory intake of vegetables, fruits, oils and water, and in excessive intake of protein of animal origin. In addition, it did not cover demands resulting from the perimenopausal period the surveyed women were in, which is likely to facilitate, e.g. disorders in lipid metabolism and water-mineral balance, as well as development of osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS: The general picture of behaviors, including the nutritional ones, pointed to a strong predominance of the diagnosed disease but also to the need of compensating for the resultant restrictions, with the latter being perceived by the surveyed women as health-promoting actions.},

   abstract = {The functioning of the gastrointestinal tract is under the control of the most extensive system of peripheral neurons in the body, the enteric nervous system, and the largest endocrine system of the body, the GEP endocrine system. The enteric nervous system in large mammals contains 500 million neurons, and the GEP endocrine system produces more than 30 hormones. Numerous enteric neuropathies affecting both humans and animals have been described and digestive disorders affect commercially important species, such as horses and cattle. The most severe enteric neuropathies (e.g., lethal white syndrome in horses or Hirschsprung's disease in humans) can be fatal. Also, horses with ileus or other digestive disorders are commonly euthanized. In this review we discuss examples of enteric neuropathies that affect agricultural animals and humans: prion disease, postoperative ileus, distal enteric aganglionosis, and infective diarrhea. Enteric neurons and glia are a location of prion proteins and are involved in transmission of the infection from gut to brain and brain to gut. Postoperative ileus is a complex disorder involving the local inhibitory effects of sympathetic nervous system activation and the release of opioids, presumably from enteric neurons. Intestinal inflammation, especially of the external muscle that includes enteric ganglia, also occurs in ileus. Congenital distal bowel aganglionosis, responsible for lethal white syndrome in horses, Hirschsprung's disease in humans, and similar conditions in mice and rats, is a fatal condition if untreated. Mutations of the same genes can cause the condition in each of these species. The only effective current treatment is surgical removal of the aganglionic bowel. Infectious diarrheas involve activation of enteric secretomotor neurons by pathogens and the toxins they produce, which causes substantial fluid loss. Strategies to target enteric neurons in the treatment of secretory diarrheas have not been developed. Disorders of enteroendocrine cells, other than GEP endocrine tumors, are less well documented. However, evidence for the involvement of gut endocrine cells in a subset of patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and in the symptomology of celiac disease, has been demonstrated. Further investigation of the involvement of enteric neural and endocrine signaling systems in digestive disorders, especially in agricultural and companion animals, may lead to diagnostic and therapeutic advances.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a primarily digestive systemic disease triggered and maintained by the ingestion of gluten in the diet. Its has a wide clinical spectrum of manifestations, particularly varied in adult patients, in whom, because of their frequent negative serology and mild, nonspecific symptoms, there is a considerable delay in diagnosis. The intestinal lesion caused by CD leads to various deficiencies of nutrients, vitamins, and dietary minerals, with ferropenia, vitamin B12, folic acid, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies being especially frequent. The deficiencies, together with dairy intolerance, cause low bone density and an increased risk of fractures. Treatment using a gluten-free diet (GFD) does involve certain complications, since gluten is found in up to 70% of manufactured food products and manufacturing regulations are not standard in all countries. In addition, certain nutrient deficiencies require specific management. This article reviews the nutritional aspects of CD and provides practical guidelines to correct these deficiencies and to ensure optimum GFD compliance.},

METHODS: Patients over 18 years of age who were consecutively and newly diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) were recruited. A bone density scan with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was carried out on the left hip and lumbar spine; nutritional parameters were analyzed and a hormone study conducted in order to exclude secondary low BMD. RESULTS: 40 patients (36 females/4 males) between the ages of 18 and 68 (mean 44.25 years) were recruited. Overall, at the moment of diagnosis 45% of patients exhibited low BMD at both demarcations. Risk of hip fracture was generally low, but ascended to mild in patients with villous atrophy (p = 0.011). Differences in major fracture risk were also observed depending on Marsh stage (p = 0.015). Significant differences were observed in nutritional status between patients with and without duodenal villous atrophy, with body mass index and blood levels of prealbumin, iron, vitamin D and folic acid significantly lower in Marsh III stage patients. No differences were found in blood hormone levels between Marsh stages or BMDs. The degree of bone mass loss in the lumbar spine directly correlated to Marsh stage. In the hip, a parallel association between BMD and Marsh stage was also observed, but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Duodenal villous atrophy, through malabsorption, was the main determinant factor for low BMD in adult-onset CD patients.},

Interest in teff has increased noticeably due to its very attractive nutritional profile and gluten-free nature of the grain, making it a suitable substitute for wheat and other cereals in their food applications as well as foods for people with celiac disease. The main objective of this article is to review researches on teff, evaluate its suitability for different food applications, and give direction for further research on its applications for health food market. Teff is a tropical low risk cereal that grows in a wider ecology and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions where most other cereals are less viable. It has an excellent balance of amino acid composition (including all 8 essential amino acids for humans) making it an excellent material for malting and brewing. Because of its small size, teff is made into whole-grain flour (bran and germ included), resulting in a very high fiber content and high nutrient content in general. Teff is useful to improve the haemoglobin level in human body and helps to prevent malaria, incidence of anaemia and diabetes. The nutrient composition of teff grain indicates that it has a good potential to be used in foods and beverages worldwide. The high levels of simple sugars and alpha-amino acids as a result of breakdown of starch and protein, respectively, are essential for fermentation and beer making.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research is intense to find wheat of low or null toxicity for patients with celiac disease (CD). Among candidates, there are diploid wheat species. OBJECTIVE: We compared the immunological properties of 2 lines of diploid monococcum wheat (Triticum monococcum ssp. monococcum), Monlis and ID331, with those of common wheat (Triticum aestivum). DESIGN: Interferon-gamma production and the proliferation of intestinal gliadin-specific T cell lines and clones were measured as evidence of T cell activation by peptic and tryptic (PT) digests of gliadins from 2 monococcum lines. Furthermore, organ cultures of jejunal biopsies from 28 CD patients were set up to assess the effects of PT gliadin on innate and adaptive immune response by using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Monlis and ID331 induced interferon-gamma production and proliferation in celiac mucosal T cells. In organ cultures, Monlis PT digest induced a significant increase of IL-15 epithelial expression and crypt enterocyte proliferation, whereas ID331 had no effect. Both monococcum lines caused intraepithelial T cell infiltration and lamina propria T cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the monococcum lines Monlis and ID331 activate the CD T cell response and suggest that these lines are toxic for celiac patients. However, ID331 is likely to be less effective in inducing CD because of its inability to activate the innate immune pathways.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with treated celiac disease (CD), the ingestion of gluten traces contained in gluten-free (GF) wheat substitutes (eg, GF bread, flour, and pasta) could cause persisting intestinal mucosal damage. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the proportion of CD patients at risk of mucosal damage due to the consumption of GF products in 4 European countries (Italy, Spain, Germany, and Norway). DESIGN: A probabilistic modeling approach was used to assess the risk of gluten intake at the population level. The input variables were 1) consumption of GF products, 2) concentration of gluten traces in GF products determined by the sandwich R5 ELISA method, and 3) the gluten threshold for mucosal damage of 10 to 50 mg/d. Different population and product availability scenarios were examined for risk assessment. RESULTS: The gluten content of 205 commercially available GF products ranged between <5 and 27.8 mg/kg. Overall, 99.5% of the analyzed samples had a gluten concentration <20 mg/kg. Most (94%) had a gluten concentration below the limit of quantification (5 mg/kg). The mean percentage of the CD European population at risk of mucosal damage resulting from consumption of GF products ranged between 0.01 (Germany) and 0.15 (Italy) and remained very low, even in the worst-case scenario (<1%). CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of a single gluten threshold (20 mg/kg) for gluten contamination is suggested. GF products in Europe constitute a very safe option for patients with CD. The dietary follow-up of CD patients should focus on other potential sources of gluten contamination.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to summarise the evidence from 2004 to September 2009 on the performance of laboratory-based serological and point of care (POC) tests for diagnosing coeliac disease (CD) in children using histology as reference standard. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies reporting on children for tests based on IgA and IgG anti-gliadin (AGA), endomysial (EmA), anti-transglutaminase-2 (TG2), and anti-deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) antibodies or POC tests. For inclusion, histological analysis of duodenal biopsies and sensitivity and specificity for index tests had to be reported. Data were pooled and summary measures calculated for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios ("LR+", "LR-"), and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR). In case of elevated statistical heterogeneity, studies reaching 90% sensitivity or specificity were reported. RESULTS: A total of 2510 articles were reviewed; 16 entered meta-analysis, reporting on 3110 patients (1876 with CD, 1234 without CD). For IgA-EmA, sensitivity was >/=90% in 7/11 studies and pooled specificity 98.2%. For IgA-anti-TG2, 11/15 studies yielded sensitivities >/=90% and 13/15 specificities >/=90%. For IgA-DGP, sensitivity ranged between 80.7% and 95.1% (specificity 86.3%-93.1%); for IgG-DGP between 80.1% and 98.6% (specificity 86.0-96.9%). IgA-EmA had the highest pooled DOR (554) and LR+ (31.8) for a laboratory test, followed by IgA-anti-TG2, IgG-DGP, IgA-DGP and IgA-AGA. POC tests showed a pooled sensitivity of 96.4% for IgA-TG2 (specificity 97.7%). CONCLUSIONS: IgA-EmA and IgA-anti-TG2 tests appear highly accurate to diagnose CD. IgG-anti-DGP tests may help in excluding CD. IgA-AGA and IgA-DGP tests show inferior accuracy. POC tests may achieve high accuracy in the hands of experienced readers, but IgA-anti-TG2/EmA were superior.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Duodenal nodularity is an uncommon endoscopic appearance of numerous visible mucosal nodules in the proximal duodenum. In this retrospective study we aimed to determine the clinical significance and histopathologic features of duodenal nodularity in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of the patients who were defined to have duodenal nodularity by endoscopy were reviewed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The data were expressed as mean +/- SD and percentages (%). RESULTS: Seventeen patients with endoscopically defined duodenal nodularity were chosen. The mean age at diagnosis was 12.1 years (range: 6-17 years), 9 males. Abdominal pain (47%) was the most common clinical symptom and antral nodularity (41%) was the most common endoscopic finding in children with duodenal nodularity. Histopathologic evaluation of duodenal nodules revealed chronic inflammation in all patients, increased intercryptal and intraepithelial numbers of eosinophils in 70.5%, and villous atrophy in 47% of patients. Giardia infestation was demonstrated in 6 patients by histologic examination and/or Giardia lamblia-specific antigen positivity in stools. The clinical diagnoses of the patients have shown variations, such as celiac disease, giardiasis, secretory IgA deficiency, and Helicobacter pylori gastritis, and some of them were associated with the others. CONCLUSIONS: Although the endoscopic appearance is similar, clinical spectrum and pathologic features are not so similar and there are no specific histomorphologic findings for nodularity. The most demonstrative findings we observed in children were increased lymphocyte and/or eosinophil infiltration in the duodenal mucosa. We suggested that care should be taken in the evaluation of microbiological and immunologic etiologies causing this prominent inflammatory reaction.},

   abstract = {Chronic diarrhoea in children shows an age related spectrum. In infants and young children a major role is related to persistent intestinal infections, intolerance to specific nutrients such as cow's milk protein, and toddler's diarrhoea. In older children and adolescents, inflammatory bowel diseases are strongly increasing and nonspecific diarrhoea is also frequent. Coeliac disease is a major cause of diarrhoea throughout childhood. In neonates, congenital diarrhoea is a rare but severe syndrome that includes several highly complex diseases. In children, diagnosis should be based on noninvasive techniques. Endoscopy should be decided based on clinical criteria, but also driven by noninvasive tests to assess the digestive absorptive functions and intestinal inflammation. A stepwise approach may reduce the need of endoscopy, also in the light of its relatively limited diagnostic yield compared to adult patients. Treatment of chronic diarrhoea in children is also substantially different from what is generally done in adults and includes a major role for nutritional interventions. Therefore chronic diarrhoea in children is a complex age-specific disorder that requires an age-specific management that is in many aspects distinct from that in adults.},

   abstract = {Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is frequent in childhood. Inadequate nutrition and gastrointestinal malabsorption are the frequent causes of IDA in children. But reduced iron absorption and insidious blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract has been identified as the most frequent causes of IDA in older children and adolescents. Therefore the authors evaluated the frequency and etiologies of the upper gastrointestinal system pathologies causing IDA in older pediatric population. Patients with known hematological or chronic diseases, heavy menstrual flow, and obvious blood loss were excluded from the study. Forty-four children between the ages of 9.5 and 17.5 years and diagnosed with IDA were enrolled. They underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy from esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Mean age and hemoglobin (Hb) levels of study group (32 boys, and 12 girls) were 14.6 +/- 2.0 years and 7.9 +/- 1.8 g/dL, respectively. Only 1 patient had a positive serology testing with anti-tissue transglutaminase and small bowel biopsy correlating with celiac disease. Endoscopy revealed abnormal findings in 25 (56.8%) patients (21 endoscopic antral gastritis, 2 active duodenal ulcers, and 2 duodenal polyps). Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection was identified by using antral histopathological evaluation in 19 of 44 children (43.2%). In 2 of duodenal samples, one patient had celiac disease, and the other one was diagnosed as giardiasis. In conclusion, there are different etiologies resulting in IDA in older children and adolescents. When older children and adolescents are found to have iron deficiency, HP infection and other gastrointestinal pathologies should be ruled out before iron deficiency treatment.},

   abstract = {There is growing evidence that many aspects of our lifestyle and the environment we now live in contribute to the development of disease. The luminal digestive tract is a clear target of the influence of dietary components, alcohol, microbial organisms, and other ingested materials. External factors including obesity, lack of physical exercise, and tobacco consumption also impact diseases of the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A growing understanding of the microbiome which forms an integral part of the human organism indicates that this is another important external force that impacts human health and disease. The luminal GI tract conditions that arise, at least in part, from these external factors range from malignancies (squamous cell esophageal cancer, Barrett's esophagus and associated esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer), idiopathic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases, and post-infectious syndromes including post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome, post-infectious dyspepsia and other functional GI disorders. Of particular interest, given their increase in prevalence in much of the world, are immune-mediated conditions in which food antigens are the driving force behind disease development. These entities include celiac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and food allergies. Celiac disease is a prime example of a condition mediated by dietary factors whose pathogenesis has only recently been determined, providing opportunities for developing treatment options beyond the gluten-free diet. While a genetic basis for this disease clearly exists, it is believed that environmental factors such as an increase in gluten in the human diet account for its rising prevalence, now roughly 1% of genetically susceptible populations in all continents. Proposed therapeutic strategies span from preventing disease by modulating the time of gluten introduction in infants, to reducing exposure to gluten by developing strains of wheat with lower levels of gluten, degrading ingested gluten peptides within the intestinal lumen via endopeptidases or modulating uptake of these peptides across intestinal tight junctions. Other novel treatments in development focus on interfering with the immune events that lead to disease once gluten accesses the lamina propria including altering the immune milieu from a Th1-predominant response via hookworm infection, inhibiting tissue transglutaminase, and blocking antigen presentation and/or T-cell responses to gluten peptides. While new treatment options for celiac disease reflect the complex interaction of diet, genetic factors and the host immune response, the implications for treatment of many conditions of the large and small intestine that arise from environmental and lifestyle are as basic as ensuring adequate nutrition, regular exercise and cessation of tobacco use. Much more needs to be learned about the microbiome, dietary and other factors and their interaction with the human host in order to develop potential new treatment strategies for diseases that result from the environment and lifestyle.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The most common neurologic manifestation of gluten sensitivity is ataxia, which accounts for up to 40% of idiopathic sporadic ataxia. Timing of diagnosis of gluten ataxia is vital as it is one of the very few treatable causes of sporadic ataxia and causes irreversible loss of Purkinje cells. Antigliadin antibody (AGA) of the IgG type is the best marker for neurological manifestations of gluten sensitivity. This study was conducted to measure the prevalence of gluten ataxia in a group of Iranian patients with idiopathic ataxia. METHODS: For 30 patients with idiopathic cerebellar ataxia, a questionnaire about clinical and demographic data was completed. Serum AGA (IgA and IgG) and antiendomysial antibody (AEA) were assessed. Gluten ataxic patients underwent duodenal biopsy. Magnetic resonance imaging was done for all patients to see if cerebellar atrophy is present. RESULTS: Only 2 patients had a positive IgG AGA (6.7%) who both had a positive AEA while none of them showed changes of celiac disease in their duodenal biopsies. Only presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and pursuit eye movement disorders were higher in patients with gluten ataxia. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of gluten ataxia in Iranian patients with idiopathic ataxia seems to be lower than most of other regions. This could be explained by small sample size, differences in genetics and nutritional habits and also effect of serologic tests in clinical versus research setting. Further researches with larger sample size are recommended.},

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the predictive value of RDW in detection of intestinal atrophy in celiac disease (CD). METHODS: Iron indices and RDW were studied in 49 patients with CD to evaluate the utilization of RDW as a predictive marker for presence of intestinal atrophy. RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent of patients had iron deficiency at initial presentation and 89% had abnormal RDW defined as >14. Receiver operating characteristics curves of RDW has been found to be a predictive of intestinal atrophy at levels higher than 17.25 (68% sensitivity and 85% specificity). In patients with transglutaminase antibody IgA titers >200 U/l, RDW level >17.75 showed 76% sensitivity and 100% specificity for intestinal atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that RDW can be used as a surrogate marker of atrophy in patients with iron deficiency and suspected CD. In addition, the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of RDW increases when used in combination with high levels of transglutaminase IgA antibody.},

   abstract = {The aqueous alcohol-soluble fraction of wheat gluten is gliadin. This component has been implicated as the causative principle in celiac disease, which is a physiological condition experienced by some infants and adults. The outcome of the ingestion of whole wheat products by susceptible individuals is malabsorption of nutrients resulting from loss of intestinal vili, the nutrient absorption regions of the digestive system. This leads to incessant diarrhea and weight loss in these individuals. Only recently has this health condition been properly recognized and accurately diagnosed in this country. The culprit gliadin is characterized by preponderant glutamine side-chain residues on the protein surface. Gliadin is commercially available as a wheat gluten extract, and in our search for new biobased and environmentally friendly products from renewable agricultural substrates, we have exploited the availability of the glutamine residues of gliadin as synthons to produce novel elastomeric nonfood products dubbed "milkglyde", "saliglyde", and soyglyde from milkweed, salicornia and soybean oils. The reaction is an amidolysis of the oxirane groups of derivatized milkweed, salicornia, and soybean oils under neat reaction conditions with the primary amide functionalties of glutamine to give the corresponding amidohyroxy gliadinyl triglycerides, respectively. The differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analyses, and rheological data from a study of these products indicate properties similar to those of synthetic rubber.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review of observational studies published between 1966 and May 2004 on the subject was conducted in 2005. This update is a systematic review of observational studies published between June 2004 and April 2011. Pubmed, EMBASE and Cinahl were searched for published studies that examined the association between breastfeeding and CD. RESULTS: After duplicates were removed 90 citations were screened. Four observational studies were included in the review. Two of three studies which had examined the duration of breastfeeding and CD reported significant associations between longer duration of breastfeeding and later onset of CD (OR ranged from 0.18 to 0.665). Breastfeeding during the introduction of gluten to the infant was reported to have a protective effect in two studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support previous published findings that breastfeeding seems to offer a protection against the development of CD in predisposed infants. Breastfeeding at time of gluten introduction is the most significant variable in reducing the risk. Timing of gluten introduction may also be a factor in the development of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The optimum serological test for celiac disease (CD) in young children is not known. The objective of our study was to compare the performance of three serological tests (IgA + IgG DGP, IgA TTG, and IgA + IgG EMA) for children younger than 3 years of age. METHODS: We identified all subjects younger than 3 years of age (n = 6,074) that were tested for CD serology and included those with biopsy data. Patients were classified as group 1 (n = 47): patients with confirmed CD or group 2 (n = 12): patients with normal biopsy findings. RESULTS: There was statistically significant difference between group 1 and group 2 with regard to number of patients with positive IgA TTG (97.87% vs. 50%, P < 0.001), IgA + IgG DGP (100% vs. 77.78%, P = 0.007), and IgA + IgG EMA (95.65% vs. 9.09%, P < 0.001). There was a significantly positive correlation between Marsh-Oberhuber score on the small duodenal biopsies and all tests. Analysis of sensitivity and specificity showed that manufacturer's levels had high sensitivity for all tests (IgA TTG 97%, IgA + IgG DGP 100%, IgA + IgG EMA 96%), however specificity was low for IgA + IgG DGP (44%) and IgA TTG (50%) but not for IgA + IgG EMA (91%). CONCLUSIONS: For children younger than 3 years of age, IgA + IgG EMA is highly sensitive and specific. Use of IgA + IgG DGP or IgA TTG as a single serological marker is insufficient for definite diagnosis of CD in this age group. Based on our results, it might be reasonable to postpone the biopsy for asymptomatic children with negative EMA.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder induced by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The enzyme tissue transglutaminase (protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 2; tTG) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease and antibodies against tTG are used as serological markers for the diagnosis of CD. Discovery of tTG as the autoantigen for endomysial antibodies changed the diagnostic approach to patients with suspected CD and, importantly, made screening for CD more accurate and easier to perform. Studies in pediatric populations confirmed the high sensitivity and specificity of immunoglobulin A (IgA) tTG antibodies in the diagnosis of CD. The aim of this review is to summarize the data on the role of tTG in the pathogenesis of CD and to present current evidence on the accuracy of IgA tTG, IgG tTG and IgA tTG point-of-care tests in the diagnosis of CD in children. This review shows why IgA tTG antibodies replaced endomysial antibodies as the preferred serological marker due to the ease of their use, their high sensitivity and specificity, and the high correlation between high titers and intestinal mucosal lesions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A food questionnaire (FQ) to assess gluten intake in infants 0 to 12 months old has been developed and validated (FQ-gluten), but an instrument to assess gluten intake in children 1 to 4 years is not available. Development and validation of such an instrument (FQ-gluten4) was the aim of the present study. METHODS: The FQ-gluten was adapted according to age-related food consumption. The results of this FQ-gluten4 were compared with the results of a 2-day food record. RESULTS: Seventy-one parents filled in both instruments. The mean amount of gluten consumption calculated from the FQ-gluten4 was comparable with that of the food record, but significant differences were found in the amount of gluten intake in 1- to 2-year-old children and in the percentage of gluten from porridge among the 1- to 3-year-olds. The Blant-Altman limits of agreement with standard deviation of 2600 mg were -5118 to 5630 mg. CONCLUSIONS: The new, short, standardized, validated, and easy-to-use FQ-gluten4 may be a useful instrument in the assessment of gluten intake in young children. Using this standardized method provides opportunity for better comparison of the results of gluten consumption in studies throughout the world. Furthermore, such an instrument can be used to quantify the gluten intake in individuals suspected to have celiac disease but in whom the diagnoses cannot be confirmed.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a polygenic chronic enteropathy conferring an increased risk for various nutrient deficiency states. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a frequent finding in CD and may be related to the development of venous thrombosis, cardiovascular disease, and stroke in untreated CD patients. Recently, a possible excess in the frequency of the MTHFR c.677C>T (rs1801133) gene variant in CD patients was reported. The purpose of this study was to determine if there exist differences in the distribution of polymorphic variants of genes involved in homocysteine/methyl group metabolism between CD patients and the general population. A set of 10 gene polymorphisms (MTHFR rs1801133, MTR rs1805087, MTHFD1 rs2236225, MTRR rs1801394, CBS 844ins68, BHMT1 rs7356530 and rs3733890, BHMT2 rs526264 and rs625879, and TCN2 rs1801198) was tested in 134 patients with CD and 160 matched healthy controls. The frequency of the MTR rs1805087 GG genotype in CD patients was lower than in controls (0.01 and 0.06, respectively), although statistical significance was not achieved (P = 0.06). For the other analyzed polymorphisms, there was no evidence of difference in both allelic and genotypic distribution between cases and controls. The exhaustive Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction analysis revealed no combination of interactive polymorphisms predicting the incidence of CD. In contrast to the well-documented clinical observations of increased risks of vascular disease in patients with longstanding untreated CD, in our group of patients no significant association with CD was found for all tested polymorphic variants of genes involved in homocysteine metabolism. These findings should be replicated in studies with a larger sample size.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Diagnostic criteria for coeliac disease (CD) from the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) were published in 1990. Since then, the autoantigen in CD, tissue transglutaminase, has been identified; the perception of CD has changed from that of a rather uncommon enteropathy to a common multiorgan disease strongly dependent on the haplotypes human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8; and CD-specific antibody tests have improved. METHODS: A panel of 17 experts defined CD and developed new diagnostic criteria based on the Delphi process. Two groups of patients were defined with different diagnostic approaches to diagnose CD: children with symptoms suggestive of CD (group 1) and asymptomatic children at increased risk for CD (group 2). The 2004 National Institutes of Health/Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality report and a systematic literature search on antibody tests for CD in paediatric patients covering the years 2004 to 2009 was the basis for the evidence-based recommendations on CD-specific antibody testing. RESULTS: In group 1, the diagnosis of CD is based on symptoms, positive serology, and histology that is consistent with CD. If immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase type 2 antibody titers are high (>10 times the upper limit of normal), then the option is to diagnose CD without duodenal biopsies by applying a strict protocol with further laboratory tests. In group 2, the diagnosis of CD is based on positive serology and histology. HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 testing is valuable because CD is unlikely if both haplotypes are negative. CONCLUSIONS: The aim of the new guidelines was to achieve a high diagnostic accuracy and to reduce the burden for patients and their families. The performance of these guidelines in clinical practice should be evaluated prospectively.},

   abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate current nutrition counselling practices, knowledge of nutrition and the need for nutrition education by nurses in mother and child health clinics. BACKGROUND: Nutrition counselling of young families offers a tangible means to implement preventive measures for lifestyle-related chronic diseases. Nurses in health clinics are at prime position to execute this preventive work, which demands knowledge of current nutrition research as well as skill in counselling. Knowledge is limited regarding the current nutrition counselling practices of nurses and their needs in improving counselling. DESIGN: Descriptive questionnaire survey. METHODS: A questionnaire was formulated and sent to nurses in mother and child health clinics (n=650) nationwide via e-mail links using a computerised program. Non-respondents were re-contacted twice, the final response rate being 50% (n=327). RESULTS: Nurses considered nutrition counselling an important but challenging task in the clinics. In addition to promotion of health, they had counselled clients in the management of various disorders ranging from constipation to coeliac disease. Variability was noted in the extent to which nurses had adopted nutrition guidelines. As means to improve counselling, better collaboration with both families and healthcare professionals and an increase in resources, including time available for counselling, up-to-date educational material and clinical guidelines, as well as increased education in nutrition were suggested. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated a need and a readiness amongst nurses to develop nutrition counselling in health clinics. Given the health benefits presumably deriving from nutrition counselling, investments in operational counselling, comprising advancement of both knowledge and skills in the health clinics, are clearly warranted. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICES: The findings provide important insights into the current clinical practice in health clinics and can be exploited in designing nutrition counselling and in-service training.},

These changes allow infection by parasites that cause no symptoms in immunocompetent patients, such as Blastocystis hominis (Bh). OBJETIVE. To analyze the presence of Bh in symptomatic celiac patients and describe the clinical, histological, immune and nutritional status in these patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD An observational descriptive cross sectional study was performed. Thirty symptomatic celiac patients (18 women, mean age 41 years old, range 19-68 years), assisted at the Institute of Gastroenterology of Cuba from January to December 2009, entered the study. RESULTS: Diarrhea and chronic anemia were the most commonly reported clinical manifestations (22 and 4 patients, respectively). The analysis of more than five Bh per field was more frequent in the group ofpatients studied (63.3%), with statistically significant difference in patients with vilous atrophy and low weight (P < 0.03) compared to cases with less than five Bh per feld. No significant differences were found when the immune status of patients was analyzed. CONCLUSIONS. In symptomatic celiac patients with subtotal-total villous atrophy and low weight the finding of more than five Bh perfield should be considered as opportunistic.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal epithelium transports solutes and water between lumen and blood and at the same time forms a barrier between these compartments. This highly selective and regulated barrier permits ions, water, and nutrients to be absorbed, but normally restricts the passage of harmful molecules, bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. During inflammation, the intestinal barrier can be disrupted, indicated by a decrease in transcellular electrical resistance and an increase in paracellular permeability for tracers of different size. Such inflammatory processes are accompanied by increased oxidative stress, which in turn can impair the epithelial barrier. In this review, we discuss the role of inflammatory oxidative stress on barrier function with special attention on the epithelial tight junctions. Diseases discussed causing barrier changes include the inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and microscopic colitis, the autoimmune disorder celiac disease, and gastrointestinal infections. In addition, the main cytokines responsible for these effects and their role during oxidative stress and intestinal inflammation will be discussed, as well as therapeutic approaches and their mode of action.},

METHODS: Microbiota was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (total bacteria and 10 bacterial group- and species-specific primers) and gene expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR9, and regulators of TLRs, Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP), and single immunoglobulin IL-1R-related molecule, by relative quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 10 children with celiac disease (untreated celiacs), 9 children with normal small intestinal mucosa (controls), and 6 adults with celiac disease with normal small intestinal mucosa after following a gluten-free diet (treated celiacs). RESULTS: Small intestinal microbiota was comparable among controls, untreated celiacs, and treated celiacs. Expression of IL-8 mRNA, a marker of intestinal inflammation, was significantly increased in untreated celiacs as compared with treated celiacs (P=0.002) and controls (P=0.001). Expression of TLR-2 mRNA was significantly decreased in untreated (P=0.001) and treated (P=0.03) celiacs, whereas expression of TLR-9 mRNA was increased in untreated celiacs (P=0.001) as compared with controls. Expression of TOLLIP mRNA was downregulated in untreated celiacs as compared with controls (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Altered gene expression of TLR2, TLR9, and TOLLIP in small intestinal biopsies in celiac disease suggests that microbiota-associated factors may be important in the development of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the markers of lymphocyte activation (sIL-2R, IL-6 and TNF alpha) in the peripheral blood of newly diagnosed patients with celiac disease (CD) and patients with CD on Gluten free diet (GFD) for at least 2 y. The markers were correlated with conventional serological tests Anti-tissue transglutaminase (Anti-TTG) used for diagnosis and follow up of the disease; wherever possible. METHODS: Thirty newly diagnosed cases of CD (on the basis of histopathology and serology) not on GFD were enrolled as Group 1 of the study. Thirty age and sex matched controls from the Pediatric Surgery OPD formed Group 2. Thirty cases of CD on GFD for at least 2 y (Group 3) were also enrolled in the study. Upper G.I. endoscopy was performed in all Group 1 patients and cytokine levels assayed by ELISA on serum obtained from all patients in Groups 1, 2, 3. RESULTS: Mean sIL-2R level in Group 1(1498.1+/-1234.31 pg/ml) and Group 3 (488.78+/-396.18 pg/ml) were significantly higher than the controls (336.27+/-218.67 pg/ml p < 0.05). Among the patients with CD, mean serum levels in Group 1 were higher than in Group 3 (p < 0.05). sIL-2R levels showed good correlation with tTg levels in Group 1 patients (p < 0.000, r = 0.69). Mean IL-6 levels in Group 1 were significantly higher (28.43+/-28.32 pg/ml) than Group 2(15.03+/-7.72 pg/ml p < 0.05) and Group 3(11.26+/-5.13 pg/ml p < 0.05). IL-6 levels were comparable between Groups 2 and 3 (p > 0.05).IL-6 levels showed good correlation with tTg levels in Group 1(p < 0.008, r = 0.471). Mean TNFalpha levels in Group 1(179.66+/-102.93 pg/ml), Group 2 (153.16+/-27.02 pg/ml) and Group 3 (166.67+/-28.95 pg/ml) were comparable (p > 0.05). TNFalpha levels showed poor correlation with tTg levels in Group 1 patients (p > 0.604, r = -0.099). CONCLUSIONS: sIL-2R and IL-6 levels have a good correlation with CD activity and can be used as reliable markers for detecting minimal transgression from GFD.},

BACKGROUND: Psychiatric disorders are common in untreated celiac disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred Iranian inpatient men with in chronic phase of depressive disorders or schizophrenia, and 200 age-matched healthy male subjects were screened for celiac disease by anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies. The mean age of the study patients was 37 years. RESULTS: One (1%) schizophrenic and two (2%) depressive patients were positive for anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies; duodenal biopsy was not possible in these subjects. In the control group one (0.5%) individual was positive for anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies, but had normal duodenal histology. The difference between patients and controls was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The frequency of celiac disease serology in schizophrenic and depressive inpatients was not significantly higher than that in the general population. We would therefore not advocate systematic serologic screening in these patients, but alertness to celiac disease should be kept in mind.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Because of a variable clinical picture, most children with celiac disease remain unrecognized without active serologic screening. Because, however, many patients are asymptomatic, the justification for screening remains unclear. We assessed health and well-being and the effect of a 1-year gluten-free diet in a nationwide cohort of children with celiac disease detected by screening in at-risk groups. METHODS: A total of 222 newly detected children received a validated questionnaire covering aspects of the burden caused by the undiagnosed celiac disease. After 1 year, adherence to the diet and difficulties attending this, attitudes toward and effects of disease and diet on daily life, and parents' satisfaction with the diagnosis were inquired about. The children's health and parents' concern for it were asked about at diagnosis and on treatment. The outcomes of screen-detected children were compared with those of children diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Forty-three screen-detected and 88 symptom-detected children responded. Also, 65% of the screen-detected patients experienced symptoms; these, however, being less troublesome and of shorter duration than in symptom-detected subjects. There were no differences between the groups in dietary adherence (71% vs 84% strict diet), management of the diet (80% vs 80%), alleviation of symptoms (78% vs 86%), and improvement in daily life (73% vs 69%), or in satisfaction with the diagnosis (93% vs 88%). Improved health and reduced parental concern were observed in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Screen-detected children with celiac disease can attain satisfactory dietary adherence and benefit from treatment similarly to symptom-detected patients. The results support intensified screening for celiac disease in at-risk children.},

To test the three selected taste groups, rats were infused with inosine monophosphate (IMP) and L: -glutamate (GLU) for umami, with glucose and sucrose for sweet, and with sodium chloride (NaCl) for salty. Infusions of IMP and GLU solutions significantly increased VGA activity and induced the autonomic reflex, which activated VCE and SAE; these reflexes were abolished after sectioning of the VGA. Infusions of glucose, sucrose and NaCl solutions, conversely, had no significant effects on VGA activity. These results suggest that umami substances in the stomach send information through the VGA to the brain and play a role in the reflex regulation of visceral functions.},

   abstract = {The gustatory and visceral stimulation from food regulates digestion and nutrient utilization, and free glutamate (Glu) release from food is responsible for the umami taste perception that increases food palatability. The results of recent studies reveal a variety of physiological roles for Glu. For example, luminal applications of Glu into the mouth, stomach, and intestine increase the afferent nerve activities of the glossopharyngeal nerve, the gastric branch of the vagus nerve, and the celiac branch of the vagus nerve, respectively. Additionally, luminal Glu evokes efferent nerve activation of each branch of the abdominal vagus nerve. The intragastric administration of Glu activates several brain areas (e.g., insular cortex, limbic system, and hypothalamus) and has been shown to induce flavor-preference learning in rats. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of rats has shown that the intragastric administration of Glu activates the nucleus tractus solitarius, amygdala, and lateral hypothalamus. In addition, Glu may increase flavor preference as a result of its postingestive effect. Considering these results, we propose that dietary Glu functions as a signal for the regulation of the gastrointestinal tract via the gut-brain axis and contributes to the maintenance of a healthy life.},

A 28-year-old woman presented with diarrhea, oral ulcers, and refractory uveitis of 2.5-years duration. She was treated with prednisone, mydriatic drops, and infliximab with no response. She was referred to our hospital at which point her previous diagnosis of uveitis was confirmed; she was also diagnosed with right-sided sacro-iliitis. The patient did not have arthritis or any skin conditions. Three tests for fecal parasites and a fecal leukocyte were negative. Endoscopy revealed atrophic appearance of the duodenal mucosa. Biopsy showed atrophy of the duodenal villi with intra-epithelial lymphocytes, hyperplasia of the crypts, and chronic inflammatory infiltrate. The search for antiendomysial antibody was >1/1,280. The patient was started on a gluten-free diet and after 3 months demonstrated significant improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and uveitis, as well as a reduction of antiendomysial antibodies (1/80). After 6 months, there was complete remission of gastrointestinal symptoms and total control of uveitis. The antiendomysial antibody was negative at that time. Clinical uveitis as a manifestation of celiac disease has been described in only two cases in the literature. This case study is the third to demonstrate that uveitis is a clinical symptom that can be addressed in patients with celiac disease.},

Bone is intimately affected by chronic disease, including gastrointestinal disease. The mechanisms for bone loss in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and cystic fibrosis are discussed with regard to the role of the inflammatory response. Furthermore, we raise the issue of effects of inflammation on both intestinal and renal calcium and phosphate transport, although the ways in which these actions affect bone are not explained and require further research. The stress response, a prominent feature following burn injury, is also elucidated and its relation to gastrointestinal disease is examined. We then discuss the importance of knowing the mechanism of bone loss to determine proper prevention and treatment for the bone loss in specific gastrointestinal conditions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to explore pathogenesis and find new serum markers for cow's-milk-sensitive enteropathy (CMSE) and coeliac disease (CD). We assessed the intestinal expression and serum concentration of CD23, IL-15, and FasL. We hypothesised that the serum levels of CD23, a protein expressed in the lymphoid follicles, would be associated with lymphonodular hyperplasia (LNH), a feature characteristic of CMSE. We also presumed that interleukin (IL)-15 and FasL, functionally connected with proliferation and apoptosis of the intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), would relate with the increased numbers of IELs present in both CMSE and CD. METHODS: Twenty-three children with CMSE, 20 with untreated CD, and 14 controls were studied for CD3, alpha/beta- and gamma/delta-expressing IELs, and for duodenal and ileal expression of CD23, FasL, and IL-15 by immunohistochemistry, and for serum concentration of sCD23, sFasL, and sIL-15 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: There was a trend for increase in sCD23 serum levels in untreated CMSE and in CD (P = 0.074; P = 0.077). CD23 was expressed in the mucosal germinal centres, but sCD23 was not related to presence of LNH. In CMSE, there was a trend for increase in serum sFasL (P = 0.07) and high levels associated with LNH (P = 0.025) and correlated with the IEL numbers (P < 0.05). Mucosal high endothelial venules adjacent to lymphoid follicles showed an intensive FasL expression. CONCLUSIONS: Serum sCD23 shows a trend of increment in CMSE and CD, and in the latter, sCD23 level may provide information about the severity of villous atrophy. In CMSE, high serum sFasL indicates both LNH and an increase of IELs, suggesting importance of FasL-mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of these features characteristic of CMSE. Further studies are necessary to evaluate whether intensive FasL expression in mucosal high endothelial venules presents a regulatory element in mucosal immunity.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Recent research data concerning the risk of coeliac disease confirm that introduction of food containing gluten during breast-feeding not later than 6 months of life is justified. According to ESPGHAN and EFSA introduction of solid foods in the diet of infants between 4-6 months of age is safe. AIM OF STUDY: Evaluation of feeding practices in healthy full-term infants after implementation of the recommendations of coeliac disease prevention. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Conducted analysis concerned 54 healthy full-term infants, living in Warsaw, aged 6 to 12 months. Of these, 27 children were exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life and 27 children were non-breastfed. The differences between selected parameters of nutritional status and diets of breastfed and nonbreastfed infants were evaluated by using t-Student test. Relations between quantitative variables were assessed by chi2 test. RESULTS: Products containing gluten were introduced into the breastfed children's diet in the 5th month of life in 22% of studied subgroup, in the 6th month - in 15%, in the 7th or 8th month - in 30%, between 9th and 11th month - in 22% and 11% of these children have not received food containing gluten in the first year of life. In the group of non-breastfed infants 15% received products with gluten before 5th month of life, 15% in 5th month, 11% at age of 6 months, 22% between 7th and 8th month, 15% in 11th month and 22% of children have not received food containing gluten in the first 12 months of life. An average daily intake of foods with varying content of gluten amounted to 55 g in breastfed infants and 70.5 g in non-breastfed infants (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the pilot study it was found out that nutritional recommendations concerning prophylaxis of coeliac disease were not implemented correctly by the majority of mothers of studied infants. Products containing gluten were introduced to the infant's diet too early or too late and mostly in larger quantities than it was recommended. Due to the small number of studied children it is important to carry out the investigation on a larger sample. At the same time it is necessary to introduce more effective methods of implementing nutritional recommendations concerning prophylaxis of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Demonstration of small-bowel mucosal damage has been the basis of celiac disease diagnosis, but the diagnostic approach is undergoing changes. The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition recently stated that in a subgroup of children, high positive transglutaminase 2 antibody (TG2ab) values may be sufficient for the diagnosis. The utility of these new criteria was evaluated by applying the human red blood cell TG2 antibody test (RBC-TG2ab) to a large cohort of children and adults belonging to at-risk groups. METHODS: RBC-TG2ab and endomysial antibodies (EmA) were measured in 3031 family members or other relatives of patients with celiac disease. The RBC-TG2ab values were classified as weak (20-29 U), moderate (30-99 U), and strong (>/=100 U) positive. Seropositive subjects were further tested by human recombinant TG2ab (Hr-TG2ab) and for the presence of celiac disease-associated human leukocyte antigen-DQ alleles. Gastroscopy was recommended for all with positive RBC-TG2ab, EmA, or Hr-TG2ab, or weak positive RBC-TG2ab and symptoms. RESULTS: Strong positive RBC-TG2ab has good correlation with EmA and Hr-TG2ab and positivity of DQ2/8, and the diagnosis was established in 94% of both children and adults. In contrast, moderately positive (>/=30 U) RBC-TG2ab showed poor correlation with the other tests, and celiac disease was diagnosed in 69% of children and 86% of adults. Most participants with weak positive RBC-TG2ab were negative for EmA and Hr-TG2ab. CONCLUSIONS: In accordance with the new European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition criteria, strong positive RBC-TG2ab showed good accuracy and excellent correlation with the other antibodies and celiac-type human leukocyte antigen. In contrast, low or moderately positive RBC-TG2ab values were of unsatisfactory prognostic value for a subsequent diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Nutritional factors, as sources of luminal antigens, have been thought to be important factors in the immunopathogenesis of numerous gastrointestinal diseases. In some diseases, the role of the nutritional component is causal in the susceptible host. Such diseases include celiac disease, a common heritable chronic inflammatory condition of the small intestine induced by dietary wheat, rye and barley, in susceptible individuals. Specific HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 risk alleles are necessary, but not sufficient, for disease development. The well-defined role of HLA-DQ heterodimers encoded by these alleles is to present cereal peptides to CD4+ T cells, activating an inflammatory immune response in the intestine. Genome-wide association studies have been performed which identified the IL2-IL21 risk locus and other genes with immune functions and key roles in thymic T-cell selection. Another example for this group is Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutation of the ATP7B gene, resulting in a defect of biliary copper excretion and toxic accumulation in the body, especially in the liver, brain and cornea, resulting in hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. In other diseases, however, the association is less well established. In such endeavor, epidemiological observations may become a valuable part of the overall investigations aimed at identifying dietary factors, which are involved in the initiation and perpetuation of the specific disease. As an example, relationships between nutrition and colorectal cancer have been hypothesized early on (e.g. folate, calcium, vitamin D, red meat). Similarly, intake of certain diet constituents like fat, refined sugar, fruits, vegetables and fiber was reported to be associated with the expression of inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, in children with active Crohn's disease, enteral nutrition was found to be equally effective as corticosteroids in induction of remission, with mucosal healing induced by downregulation of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in both the ileum and the colon after enteral nutrition. However, the particular effect of the consumption of each type of food remains questionable in most cases, at least in part because of insufficient data and serious methodological limitations (e.g. recall bias, heterogeneity between collected data, lack of correction for covariates, difficulties in double blinding).},

   abstract = {Various mechanisms detect the presence of dietary triacylglycerols (TAG) in the digestive tract and link TAG ingestion to the regulation of energy homeostasis. We here propose a novel sensing mechanism with the potential to encode dietary TAG-derived energy by translating enterocyte fatty acid oxidation (FAO) into vagal afferent signals controlling eating. Peripheral FAO has long been implicated in the control of eating (141). The prevailing view was that mercaptoacetate (MA) and other FAO inhibitors stimulate eating by modulating vagal afferent signaling from the liver. This concept has been challenged because hepatic parenchymal vagal afferent innervation is scarce and because experimentally induced changes in hepatic FAO often fail to affect eating. Nevertheless, intraperitoneally administered MA acts in the abdomen to stimulate eating because this effect was blocked by subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (21), a surgical technique that eliminates all vagal afferents from the upper gut. These and other data support a role of the small intestine rather than the liver as a FAO sensor that can influence eating. After intrajejunal infusions, MA also stimulated eating in rats through vagal afferent signaling, and after infusion into the superior mesenteric artery, MA increased the activity of celiac vagal afferent fibers originating in the proximal small intestine. Also, pharmacological interference with TAG synthesis targeting the small intestine induced a metabolic profile indicative of increased FAO and inhibited eating in rats on a high-fat diet but not on chow. Finally, cell culture studies indicate that enterocytes oxidize fatty acids, which can be modified pharmacologically. Thus enterocytes may sense dietary TAG-derived fatty acids via FAO and influence eating through changes in intestinal vagal afferent activity. Further studies are necessary to identify the link between enterocyte FAO and vagal afferents and to examine the specificity and potential physiological relevance of such a mechanism.},

The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of coeliac disease on the social aspects of daily life of individuals in the U.S.A. METHODS: The present study used a self-administered survey including the standard Quality of Life questionnaire (12-item short-form) with validated disease-specific questions. sas statistical software 2010 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, U.S.A.) was used to calculate the mean (SD). RESULTS: Individuals with coeliac disease overall had a low positive health perception. Validated diet and disease-specific questions revealed a significant negative impact on quality of life in social settings. Specifically, the areas of travel, dining out and family life are most affected. The negative impact of diet significantly decreased over time, although it did not resolve for the domains of dining out of the home and travel. Those diagnosed in childhood and maintained on the diet had less of an impact on the quality of life as an adult. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with coeliac disease in the U.S.A. have a diminished quality of life, especially in the social aspects of life.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common autoimmune disease affecting 1% of the Western populations. It is an inappropriate immune response, in genetically susceptible patients to dietary wheat, rye, barley and oats. Treatment involves a Lifelong gluten-free diet that predisposes to low compliance due to limited variety, high cost and low palatability, imposing social pressure and affecting quality of life. The result is an urgent need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Based on the growing actual knowledge on the intestinal inflammatory cascade, mucosal immunology and genetics of celiac disease, new attractive potential therapies are emerging. Possibilities include: searching for low immunogenic wheat variants or strains pretreated with enzymes or binders for lower toxicity. Other strategies involve decreasing transepithelial uptake or dampening of the adaptive immune response by transglutaminase inhibitors or blockage of the HLA groove and immune modulation to shift the TH1 to TH2 profile. Developing biological therapy aims to decrease intestinal homing, adhesion and activity of inflammatory cells, counteract the pro-inflammatory cytokines, clonal intestinal T cells or mesenchymal stem cell replacement or mitogenic intestinal repair safety, cost, affordability and clinical effectiveness are of prime concern. Most of the above strategies showed promising results ex-vivo. The future will highlight the in-vivo winner.},

Groups 5 and 1 had the highest levels compared to groups 4 and 3 with the lowest levels. The levels in groups 1 and 2 were comparable. Concerning 25(OH)-vitamin D sera levels, only the difference between group 5 and 4 was statistically significant (30.3 +/- 12.3 and 20.2 +/- 10.5 ng/ml, respectively p=0.003). When vitamin D was splitted above and below 20 ng/ml level, 54.5% of Spanish adult CD had vitamin D deficiency compared to 16.9% of the local CD children (p=0.001). 29.6% of group 2 had deficient levels compared to their parents with 50% (p=0.019). In conclusion, Vitamin D sera levels negatively correlate with age. Thus, mainly adult CD population should be assessed for vitamin D levels and supplemented accordingly.},

Whether bulb biopsies suggestive of CD can be found on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) done for reasons other than CD diagnosis is not clear. The aim of our study was to evaluate the contribution of routine bulb biopsies to the diagnosis of CD, when taken regardless of prior suspicion of CD. METHODS: The study included 96 children who underwent EGD for suspected CD and a control group of 69 children who underwent EGD for reasons other than CD. The mucosal changes were evaluated using the Marsh-Oberhuber classification. RESULTS: Among the 87 children diagnosed with CD, we identified 6 patients (7%) with typical histologic findings only in the bulb (Marsh 3), but also 1 patient (1.1%) with findings only in the distal duodenum (Marsh 2). In 20 patients (23%) the histological changes were more severe in the bulb. One patient had more prominent findings in the second part of the duodenum. None of the control patients had histological changes compatible with CD in the bulb or the second part of the duodenum. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that when CD is suspected, biopsies should be taken from both locations (bulb and second part) as mucosal changes may emerge only at one site. Nevertheless, the presence of characteristic histology on duodenal bulb biopsies might be sufficient for the diagnosis of CD.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: the study was made in 104 CD pediatric patients (Chilean and Argentineans) and 104 controls subjects. MYO9B gene polymorphisms were analyzed by Taqman allelic probes. We evaluated the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by means of Chi-square and compared the haplotypes distribution using Fisher test. RESULTS: SNPs rs2305767 and rs1457092 were associated with celiac disease (CD); TT genotype in rs2305767 would be a protective factor (p < 0.000, OR = 0.19 CI 0.1-0.4) and the CT genotype would be a risk factor (p < 0.0001, OR = 4.9 CI 2.2 to 11.3). CC genotype in rs1457092 also showed a protective effect for celiac (p < 0.000, OR = 0.07 CI 0.0 to 0.3). CONCLUSION: our findings suggest that genetic variation MYO9B gene is associated with CD, as a protective or a risk factor depending on the polymorphism studied.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) may often be associated with various motor disorders affecting the different segments of the digestive tract, including the esophagus. Although it has not been universally reported, some available evidences indicate that pediatric and adult celiac patients could manifest a higher frequency of esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease-related symptoms compared to nonceliac patients. In addition, several published studies have consistently shown the efficacy of a gluten-free diet in rapidly controlling esophageal symptoms and in preventing their recurrence. Since the participation of gluten in the esophageal symptoms of CD seems clear, its intimate mechanisms have yet to be elucidated, and several hypothesis have been proposed, including the specific immune alterations characterizing CD, the reduction in nutrient absorption determining the arrival of intact gluten to distal gastrointestinal segments, and various dysregulations in the function of gastrointestinal hormones and peptides. Recent studies have suggested the existence of a possible relationship between CD and eosinophilic esophagitis, which should be more deeply investigated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine if Coeliac disease (CD) can be still be considered a predominantly paediatric disorder, in spite of the increased incidence of adult-onset CD reported in recent years. METHODS: An observational, descriptive, and retrospective study was developed at two Spanish hospitals. Data was collected and analyzed from all paediatric and adult patients newly diagnosed with CD throughout the year 2010. CD diagnoses were based on a concordant clinical history, serology, HLA-DQ compatibility, the presence of mucosal lesions in duodenal biopsies with gluten dependence of symptoms, and histological lesions. RESULTS: A total of 79 patients were diagnosed with CD throughout 2010, of which 68 (86.1%) were adults. Classic symptoms (diarrhoea and iron-deficiency anaemia) were more frequent in children (90.9%), being present in only 54.4% of adults (p = 0.02). Adult patients showed, mainly, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and GERD-related symptoms. Villous atrophy (Marsh III) was present in 63.7% of children, but only in 19.1% of adults (p = 0.004). Positive tTGA was present in 81.8% of the children and only in 19.1% of the adults (p = 0.004). Haemoglobin levels were significantly lower in children (p = 0.025), but no differences were observed in iron and ferritin blood levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that adult-onset CD was the predominant presentation in two hospitals in Spain in the year 2010. Therefore, CD can no longer be considered a predominantly paediatric disorder. Marsh I and negative tTGA titters are characteristic in most of adults. New diagnostic algorithms are needed to improve correct diagnosis of CD in adults.},

   abstract = {Breast milk is the natural nutrition for infants, but in the second half of the first year of life, complementary feeding is needed. Many complementary foods contain gluten, but gluten exposure is associated with the risk of developing celiac disease (CD). CD is a disease with considerable morbidity and mortality. Although CD is associated with certain genetic features, carrying the human leukocyte antigen haplotypes DQ2 or DQ8 (a prerequisite for CD development) cannot fully explain who will or who will not develop CD. Potential risk factors for CD include perinatal events and infant feeding practice. With the exception that children who are breastfed at and beyond gluten introduction into the diet probably may be at a lower risk of developing CD, and that heavy gluten load early in life may increase the risk of future CD, data on the impact of infant feeding are inconsistent.},

The study objective was to determine the interrelationships between vitamin K/D status and lifestyle variables on BMD in children and adolescents with CD at diagnosis and after 1 year on the gluten-free diet (GFD). SUBJECTS/METHODS: Children and adolescents aged 3-17 years with biopsy proven CD at diagnosis and after 1 year on the GFD were studied. BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Relevant variables included: anthropometrics, vitamin D/K status, diet, physical activity and sunlight exposure. RESULTS: Whole-body and lumbar-spine BMD-z scores were low (< or = -1) at diagnosis (10-20%) and after 1 year (30-32%) in the children, independent of symptoms. Whole-body BMD-z scores (-0.55+/-0.7 versus 0.72+/-1.5) and serum levels of 25(OH) vitamin D (90.3+/-24.8 versus 70.5+/-19.8 nmol/l) were significantly lower in older children (>10 years) when compared with younger children (< or =10 years) (P<0.001). Forty-three percent had suboptimal vitamin D status (25(OH)-vitamin D <75 nmol/l) at diagnosis; resolving in nearly half after 1 year on the GFD. Twenty-five percent had suboptimal vitamin K status at diagnosis; all resolved after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with CD are at risk for suboptimal bone health at time of diagnosis and after 1 year on GFD; likely due in part to suboptimal vitamin D/K status. Therapeutic strategies aimed at optimizing vitamin K/D intake may contribute to improved BMD in children with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: While celiac disease is estimated to affect about 1% of the world's population, it is thought to be uncommon not only in India but in Asia also. There is a lack of studies on the prevalence of celiac disease from Asian nations. The aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of celiac disease in the community. METHODS: In a cross sectional study, we estimated the prevalence of celiac disease in urban and rural populations in the National Capital Region, Delhi, India. A structured questionnaire was administered, by door-to-door visits, to all participants to collect socio-demographic data and to screen for features of celiac disease, namely chronic or recurrent diarrhea and, anemia. In children, additional features, namely short stature (linear height below 5th percentile for age) and failure to thrive/gain weight were also used. All respondents who were screen positive (any one of above) and 10% of screen negative individuals were called for serological testing, which is anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody. All serologically positive respondents were invited to undergo further evaluation including endoscopic biopsy. Celiac disease was diagnosed on the basis of a positive serology, the presence of villous atrophy and/or response to gluten free diet. RESULT: Among 12,573 contacted, 10,488 (83.4%) (50.6% male) agreed to participate. Based on screening, 5622 (53.6%) participants were screen positive. Of all those screen positive, 2167 (38.5%) agreed for serological testing; additionally 712 (14%) negatives were also tested. The overall sero-prevalence of celiac disease was 1.44% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22 1.69) and the overall prevalence of celiac disease was 1.04% (95% CI 0.85 1.25). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of celiac disease in this north Indian community is 1 in 96. Celiac disease is more common than is recognized in India.},

METHODS: Forty-five children at the time of diagnosis of CD (group A, 77.8% girls) and 36 children receiving GFD for >2 years (group B, 75% girls) were included. Sixteen children in group A were reexamined 12 months after initiation of GFD. Serum measurements of biochemical bone health indices and BMD, assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry, were obtained. RESULTS: Patients after 1 year of receiving GFD had higher BMD z scores compared with baseline (-1.45 +/- 0.28 vs -0.61 +/- 0.25, respectively, P = 0.004). BMD z scores were significantly lower than expected for the normal population, after 1 (P = 0.03) or at least 2 (P < 0.001) years of receiving GFD. In group B, BMD z score was positively correlated with 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels (P = 0.009). In the repeated measurements group, 25-hydroxy vitamin D differed between pre- and post-GFD (P = 0.018). No biochemical index was capable of predicting an abnormal BMD z score (receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, all of the areas under the curve <0.66). CONCLUSIONS: GFD has a beneficial effect on bone health. Two years receiving diet do not ensure normalization. Biochemical markers are not indicative of BMD disturbances. Dual x-ray absorptiometry should be included in the standard management of children with CD.},

RESULTS: The II national Survey has been realized on school cafeterias: 7,710 used daily by 678,587 users. They provide near the 2.8% of special diets (allergies 38.9%, other pathologies 23.2%, religious causes 26.7% causes and celiac disease 11.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The numbers of prevalence of obesity and infantile overweight indicate that it is necessary to improve the diet of the students.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that affects approximately 1% of the US population. Disease is characterized by damage to the small intestinal lining and malabsorption of nutrients. Celiac disease is activated in genetically susceptible individuals by dietary exposure to gluten in wheat and gluten-like proteins in rye and barley. Symptoms are diverse and include gastrointestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. Treatment requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. The Internet is a major source of health information about celiac disease. Nonetheless, information about celiac disease that is available on various websites often is questioned by patients and other health care professionals regarding its reliability and content. OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy, comprehensiveness, transparency, and readability of information on 100 of the most widely accessed websites that provide information on celiac disease. METHODS: Using the search term celiac disease, we analyzed 100 of the top English-language websites published by academic, commercial, nonprofit, and other professional (nonacademic) sources for accuracy, comprehensiveness, transparency, and reading grade level. Each site was assessed independently by 3 reviewers. Website accuracy and comprehensiveness were probed independently using a set of objective core information about celiac disease. We used 19 general criteria to assess website transparency. Website readability was determined by the Flesch-Kincaid reading grade level. Results for each parameter were analyzed independently. In addition, we weighted and combined parameters to generate an overall score, termed website quality. RESULTS: We included 98 websites in the final analysis. Of these, 47 (48%) provided specific information about celiac disease that was less than 95% accurate (ie, the predetermined cut-off considered a minimum acceptable level of accuracy). Independent of whether the information posted was accurate, 51 of 98 (52%) websites contained less than 50% of the core celiac disease information that was considered important for inclusion on websites that provide general information about celiac disease. Academic websites were significantly less transparent (P = .005) than commercial websites in attributing authorship, timeliness of information, sources of information, and other important disclosures. The type of website publisher did not predict website accuracy, comprehensiveness, or overall website quality. Only 4 of 98 (4%) websites achieved an overall quality score of 80 or above, which a priori was set as the minimum score for a website to be judged trustworthy and reliable. CONCLUSIONS: The information on many websites addressing celiac disease was not sufficiently accurate, comprehensive, and transparent, or presented at an appropriate reading grade level, to be considered sufficiently trustworthy and reliable for patients, health care providers, celiac disease support groups, and the general public. This has the potential to adversely affect decision making about important aspects of celiac disease, including its appropriate and proper diagnosis, treatment, and management.},

   abstract = {The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) publishes their MyPyramid plan as a recommended eating model for all Americans. As part of this model, grain consumption is emphasized. This grain consumption has the potential to generate positive externalities, such as reduced rates of obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases. Such positive externalities can potentially produce tangible economic benefits in terms of public health. In contrast, newer nutritional research shows that grain consumption may have negative effects on health for certain population groups. Celiac disease is four times as common as it was 50 years ago and is often under-diagnosed. Other population groups exhibit gluten sensitivity which can impact the development of asthma, allergies and neurological difficulties. This survey intends to provide a comprehensive description of both the positive and negative externalities associated with grain consumption and the resulting impact on human health.},

   abstract = {Transport of molecules across the intestinal epithelium takes place through 2 major routes, ie, trans-cellular and paracellular. Assessment of intestinal permeability is performed to assess the overall function of transport through the intestinal epithelial paracellular route. Urinary excretion of disaccharides and monosaccharides and ratio of their excretion is a basis for measurement of intestinal permeability. Lactulose and mannitol ratio is the most commonly used test for assessment of small intestinal permeability and the most reliable method for measurement of concentration of lactulose and mannitol in the urine is high performance liquid chromatography. After the measurement of concentration of probes in the urine; the results are expressed as the ratio of percentage excretion of the ingested dose of lactulose and mannitol in the urine. Testing of intestinal permeability is not required for routine patient care, however it is an important tool to understand the function of the paracellular transport in the research setting. Increase in intestinal permeability has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases including celiac disease, Crohn's disease, type I diabetes and food allergy.},

During the past 50 years we have come to understand a great deal about the pathogenesis, clinical spectrum, and treatment. Great advances have been made in the technology of diagnosing CD. Heretofore, the gold standard used for diagnosis of CD is the small intestinal biopsy. The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition has recently issued guidelines that state that some patients do not require a biopsy for diagnosis. This review traces the history of CD with a particular attention to the evolution of the technology involved in the field. The question of the need for biopsy or not is discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The "gold standard" for the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) is the small intestinal biopsy. A significant number of biopsies are inadequate for interpretation. Furthermore, the labeling of a biopsy as a Marsh I or II is somewhat subjective and may vary with the experience of the pathologist. Our hypothesis is that patients with intact villi undergoing biopsies frequently have associated disaccharidase deficiencies (DSD). METHODS: We reviewed 220 charts of pediatric patients with CD and selected those with a duodenal biopsy Marsh score of I/II. The disaccharidase (DS) levels of these patients were compared with a randomly selected, age-matched control group. DSD is defined as levels below the lower limits of normal. RESULTS: Lactase (mean lactase = 18.8 in the control group vs. 4.2 in the diseased group, p = 0.004); sucrase (mean sucrase = 46.4 in the control group vs. 21.4 in the diseased group, p = 0.001); maltase (mean maltase = 138 in the control group vs. 52.5 in the diseased group, p = 0.001); palatinase (mean palatinase = 9.6 in the control group vs. 3.3 in the diseased group, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: There is a profound deficiency of DS levels in pediatric patients with CD who have intact villi.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate performance of serum antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides (a-DGPs) in detecting compliance with gluten-free diet (GFD) in children with celiac disease (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples were collected the same day of endoscopy in 95 children with CD and 106 controls. We preliminarily calculated the cutoff of a-DGP immunoglobulin A (IgA) and a-DGP IgA+G in our population by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Of 95 children with CD, 28 were studied during the first year after GFD introduction, with interview and serum collection every 3 months. In addition, serum samples were collected in 106 children with CD on GFD for more than 1 year (range 1-14). In both groups of children with CD on GFD, we compared a-DGP IgA and IgA+G performance in monitoring compliance with GFD with anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) IgA and anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) IgA. RESULTS: The cutoff resulted in 13.1 arbitrary units (AU) for a-DGP IgA (sensitivity 87.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 79%-92%, specificity 97.2, 95% CI 92%-99%) and 16.5 for a-DGP IgA+G (sensitivity 94.7, 95% CI 88%-98%, specificity 89.6, 95% CI 84%-95%). In the first year of GFD, at 6 to 8 months prevalence of positive a-DGPs was significantly higher in partially versus strictly compliant children, and at 9 to 12 months only prevalence of positive a-DGP IgA+G remained significantly higher. Moreover, at 9 to 12 months sensitivity to detect transgressions to GFD was 44% for a-DGP IgA and 100% for a-DGP IgA+G (P = 0.03). In the 106 children on GFD for more than 1 year, sensitivity to detect transgressions to GFD was 60% for a-DGP IgA and 76% for a-DGP IgA+G. Anti-tTG IgA and AGA IgA sensitivity was much lower (24% and 4%, respectively). The 4 tests showed comparable high specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Both a-DGPs showed higher sensitivity than anti-tTG IgA and AGA IgA in monitoring compliance with GFD, but a-DGP IgA+G seemed to perform better. a-DGPs did not outperform anti-tTG IgA for CD screening.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a prevalent condition with a broad spectrum of presentations requiring a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Our aims were to examine the presentation and adherence to a GFD as well as the adequacy of follow-up of children diagnosed with CD at a tertiary referral center. METHODS: A retrospective electronic chart review of pediatric patients suspected of CD (n = 581) who were seen at our institute between January 1999 and December 2008 was performed. RESULTS: 387 children were diagnosed with CD (F/M ratio of 1.54, median age: 6.25 years). Presenting symptoms were iron deficiency anemia (n = 82, 34%), short stature (n = 59, 24.5%) and abdominal pain (n = 59, 24.5%). In 63 patients (16.3%) an associated autoimmune disease was recorded. Only 42.7% of the patients (165/387) had regular out-patient gastroenterologist visits; 22% (86/387) were followed by their primary care physician. Over 35% (136/387) were completely lost to follow-up. Negative serology on follow-up was present in 91% of the CD patients(150/165) followed at our center in comparison to 70% (60/86) in those followed up by their primary physician (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: At least in our referral center, follow-up of children diagnosed with CD is far from satisfactory. Initiatives aimed at improving adherence to regular follow-up are needed as this intervention is associated with a significant increase in patient compliance with a long-term GFD.},

METHODS: Anti-dGp IgG and IgA and anti-native gliadin (nGlia) IgA were determined by enzyme fluoroimmunoassay in 100 newly diagnosed anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA-positive pediatric and adult patients with CD and in 100 age-matched patients with other digestive pathologies. Anti-dGp IgG was evaluated in 6 CD IgA-deficient patients. RESULTS: When analyzing all of the patients, the anti-dGp IgG assay showed higher diagnostic accuracy (area under receiver operating characteristic curve), specificity, and positive predictive value than anti-dGp IgA and anti-nGlia IgA. All of the diagnostic parameters corresponding to anti-dGp IgG reached the same values as anti-tTG IgA in children 7 years or younger. In older patients, both anti-dGp isotypes showed an inverse behavior, IgG having a higher specificity and positive predictive value but a lower sensitivity and negative predictive value than IgA. Anti-dGp levels were associated with the severity of intestinal lesions, and an inverse association was found regarding age at diagnosis. Both anti-dGp IgG and IgA were found to be positive in the 9 patients with minimal intestinal changes included in the study. All of the patients with CD with IgA deficiency were positive for anti-dGp IgG. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic performance of anti-dGp depends on the antibody isotype and on the age at CD diagnosis, anti-dGp IgG being a serological marker at least as useful as anti-tTG IgA for detecting CD in children ages 7 years or younger. Our data also indicate that anti-dGp IgG can improve the diagnosis of IgA-deficient patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Small intestinal histology is the criterion standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). However, results of serological tests such as anti-endomysium antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) are becoming increasingly reliable. This raises the question of whether a small intestinal biopsy is always necessary. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to investigate whether a small intestinal biopsy can be avoided in a selected group of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serology and histological slides obtained from 283 pediatric patients suspected of having CD were examined retrospectively. The response to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients with a tTGA level >/= 100 U/mL was investigated. RESULTS: A tTGA level >/= 100 U/mL was found in 128 of the 283 patients. Upon microscopic examination of the small intestinal epithelium, villous atrophy was found in 124 of these patients, confirming the presence of CD. Three patients had crypt hyperplasia or an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes. In 1 patient no histological abnormalities were found. This patient did not respond to a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with a tTGA level >/= 100 U/mL in whom symptoms improve upon consuming a GFD may not need a small intestinal biopsy to confirm CD.},

Fully 1% of the Caucasian population are affected by coeliac disease and a substantial portion of children living in poverty in the developing world are affected by environmental enteropathy. These are but two examples of the many diseases that cause mucosal injury to the primary digestive and absorptive organ in our body. While diarrhoea may be a common, though not universally seen symptom of small bowel mucosal disease, the consequent malabsorption can lead to substantial malnutrition and nutrient deficiencies. The small intestine, unlike the colon, has been relatively inaccessible, and systematic evaluation is often necessary to identify and treat small intestinal mucosal diseases that lead to diarrhoea. Immunodeficiency states, including HIV enteropathy, adult autoimmune enteropathy, drug-associated enteropathy, and tropical sprue continue to occur and require specific therapy. All patients with severe diarrhoea or diarrhoea associated with features suggestive of malabsorption may have a disease of the small intestinal mucosa that requires careful evaluation and targeted management.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is defined as a 'chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals'. Sweden has experienced an "epidemic" of celiac disease in children below two years of age. Celiac disease etiology is considered multifactorial; however, little is known regarding potential risk- or protecting factors. We present data on the possible association between early infectious episodes and celiac disease, including their possible contribution to the Swedish celiac disease epidemic. METHODS: A population-based incident case-referent study (475 cases, 950 referents) with exposure information obtained via a questionnaire (including family characteristics, infant feeding, and the child's general health) was performed. Celiac disease cases were diagnosed before two years of age, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition. Referents were randomly selected from the national population register after fulfilling matching criteria. The final analyses included 954 children, 373 (79%) cases and 581 (61%) referents, with complete information on main variables of interest in a matched set of one case with one or two referents. RESULTS: Having three or more parental-reported infectious episodes, regardless of type of infection, during the first six months of life was associated with a significantly increased risk for later celiac disease, and this remained after adjusting for infant feeding and socioeconomic status (odds ratio [OR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.0; P=0.014). The celiac disease risk increased synergistically if, in addition to having several infectious episodes, infants were introduced to dietary gluten in large amounts, compared to small or medium amounts, after breastfeeding was discontinued (OR 5.6; 95% CI, 3.1-10; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that having repeated infectious episodes early in life increases the risk for later celiac disease. In addition, we found a synergistic effect between early infections and daily amount of gluten intake, more pronounced among infants for whom breastfeeding had been discontinued prior to gluten introduction. Regarding contribution to the Swedish celiac disease epidemic, which partly was attributed to concurrent changes in infant feeding, early infections probably made a minor contribution via the synergistic effect with gluten amount.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Lymphocytic gastritis (LG) has been reported in patients with celiac disease (CD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate gastric mucosa involvement in celiac children and gastroenterological controls (GC). METHODS: In a retrospective study on 226 patients with CD (82 M; median age: 5.7 years) at diagnosis and 154 GC (66 M; median age: 7.4 years), the evaluation of gastric and duodenal mucosa was performed. CD was diagnosed according to the North America Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition criteria. Gastric lesions were classified according to Updated Sydney System. Anti-gastric parietal cell antibodies (GPCA) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: A total of 21.2% and 7% of patients with CD showed chronic superficial gastritis (CSG) and LG, respectively. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection was found in 6 (2.7%) children with CD (66.7% had CSG, 16.7% LG, and 16.7% interstitial gastritis). CSG was present in 21.4% of controls. No control subject showed LG. Hp infection was found in 24 (15.6%) children with GC (91.7% had CSG). Among patients with CSG, Hp infection was more frequent in controls than in celiac children (P < 0.0001). Ten of 90 patients with CD and 1 of 29 controls were positive for GPCA. CONCLUSIONS: Gastritis is a common finding in children with CD and adolescents. In celiac subjects, CSG is the most frequently detected. Our data suggest the hypothesis that LG may be related to a longer exposure to gluten. The presence of GPCA may suggest the presence of an underlying autoimmune process.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine Swedish parents' willingness to pay (WTP) for coeliac disease (CD) screening of their child. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: CD screening was undertaken involving 10,041 12-year-old children, with 7567 (75%) agreeing to participate. Blood samples from the children were analysed for CD serological markers. Parents received a questionnaire including a scenario describing the health-related risks of having CD and screening and diagnostic procedures. Parents were also asked whether they were willing to pay for CD screening, should this not be offered free of charge, and, if so, what their maximum WTP would be. Their WTP was compared with the average cost per child for the screening and case ascertainment procedures. RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 6524 parents, and of 6057 valid responses 63% stated that they were willing to pay something. The mean WTP was 79 EUR and the median 10 EUR. The average cost per child for the screening and case ascertainment procedures was 47 EUR, which 23% of the parents stated they were willing to pay. Parents' WTP increased with higher education and income, and with child symptoms that may indicate CD. CONCLUSIONS: Swedish parents' WTP for school-based CD screening of their child was higher than the average cost per child; however, only a minority of the parents were willing to pay that amount.},

METHODS: All of the consecutive patients younger than 18 years tested for tTG and/or DGP, who underwent duodenal biopsy because of suspected CD in Stockholm and Gothenburg, Sweden, from 2008 to 2010, were included. Medical records were reviewed. RESULTS: Of 537 children who underwent duodenal biopsy, 278 (52%) had CD. A total of 71 (13%) were younger than 2 years and 16 (4%) had IgA deficiency. Sensitivity and specificity for tTG were 94% and 86%, respectively. Corresponding values for DGP were 91% and 26%. Positive predictive values (PPV) were 88% for tTG and 51% for DGP. There were 148 children who were tTG-negative and DGP-positive, of which only 5% (8/148) had villous atrophy. Among children younger than 2 years with normal IgA, PPV was 96% (25/26) for tTG and 48% (24/50) for DGP. In 16 IgA-deficient children, 11 were DGP positive, of which 5 had CD (PPV 45%). Eight of 278 cases of CD would possibly have been missed without DGP. The cost of adding DGP and consequently more biopsies to be able to detect 8 extra cases of CD was [Euro sign]399,520 or [Euro sign]49,940 per case. CONCLUSIONS: For diagnosing CD, tTG is superior to DGP, even in children younger than 2 years. Combining tTG and DGP does not provide a better tradeoff between number of missed cases of CD, number of unnecessary duodenal biopsies, and cost than tTG alone.},

The literature was searched for studies on vitamin D status in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease, and liver disease. Vitamin D supplementation in healthy children was also reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Those with gastrointestinal diseases are more likely to have vitamin D deficiency as a result of malabsorption. Current recommendations for supplementation may be too low to achieve optimal levels. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: It is important to monitor vitamin D levels in pediatric populations with gastrointestinal diseases and appropriately treat levels that are insufficient.},

   abstract = {The prolamin peptides in wheat gluten and in the homologous storage proteins of barley and rye cause painful chronic erasure of microvilli of the small intestine epithelium in celiac patients. If untreated, it can lead to chronic diarrhea, abdominal distension, osteoporosis, weight-loss due to malabsorption of nutrients, and anemia. In addition to congenital cases, life-long exposure to gluten proteins in bread and pasta can also induce development of celiac sprue in adults. To date, the only effective treatment is life-long strict abstinence from the staple food grains. Complete exclusion of dietary gluten is, however, difficult due to use of wheat in many foods, incomplete labeling and social constraints. Thus, finding alternative therapies for this most common foodborne disease remained an active area of research, which has led to many suggestions in last few years. The pros and cons associated with these therapies were reviewed in the present communication. As different celiac patients are immunogenic to different members of the undigestible proline/glutamine rich peptides of ~149 gliadins and low molecular weight glutenin subunits as well as the six high molecular weight glutenin subunits, an exhaustive digestion of the immunogenic peptides in the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of celiacs is required. In view of the above, we evaluated the capacity of cereal grains to synthesize and store the enzymes prolyl endopeptidase from Flavobacterium meningosepticum and the barley cysteine endoprotease B2, which in combination are capable of detoxifying immunogenic gluten peptides in a novel treatment of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Celiac disease is one of the most common forms of food intolerance in children, being an autoimmune enteropathy occurring in genetically susceptible individuals. The only treatment of celiac disease consists in a lifelong strict gluten-free diet. After gluten free diet patients with normal weight or growth failure risk become obese on the one hand because of recovery intestinal absorption and, on the other hand, nutritionally unbalanced diet, high in fat and protein. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional status and the presence and prevalence of various changes dyslipidemia in gluten free diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial was formed by 92 patients (mean age at diagnosis 88,5 months) diagnosed with CD between January 2008 - December 2010 in 2nd and 3rd Pediatric Clinics of "Sf. Maria" Hospital Iasi. Patients were divided into two groups: group I included 36 patients younger than 2 years and group II included 52 patients aged over 2 years at time of diagnosis of celiac disease. All patients received gluten free diet. Were evaluated periodically anthropometric indices (weight, height, body mass index and Z scores in children over 2 years and weight and nutritional index in children under 2 years) and lipid profile (total lipids, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides). Assessing food intake was achieved by interviewing parents and children on dietary habits and daily food ration. RESULTS: Assessment of nutritional status: group I:--after 24 months of gluten free diet 5 cases presented overweight; group II: after 24 months of gluten free diet obesity (BMI > 30) was found in 16.07% of cases (9 patients) and overweight (BMI > 25) was found in 28.57% of cases (16 patients). Food intake: in all cases was observed increased calorie intake by an excess of lipids and carbohydrates in the diet. Investigation of lipid metabolism: in group II high values of cholesterol were found in 12 cases (21,42 of cases). In conclusions, in celiac disease gluten free diet should be balanced caloric, fat and protein to ensure an optimal nutritional status and prevent long-term complications.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is defined as a permanent intolerance to ingested wheat gliadins and other cereal prolamins, occurring in genetically susceptible people. Persistent elevation of serum aminotransferase activity is expression of liver damage related to CD, which occurs in two distinctive forms. The most frequent is a mild asymptomatic liver injury, with a moderate increase of serum aminotransferase activities and a mild inflammatory portal and lobular infiltrate on liver biopsy (celiac hepatitis), reversible on a gluten-free diet (GFD). More rarely, severe and progressive inflammatory liver damage, induced by an autoimmune process and identified as autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), can develop and it is generally unaffected by gluten withdrawal. Surveys that included only pediatric patients report a wide range of prevalence of CD in AIH of 11.5-46% (mean 21.5%). CD and AIH share selected combinations of genes coding for class II human leukocyte antigens, which could explain their coexistence. Increased intestinal permeability and circulation of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) have also been considered as further potential causes of liver damage in CD patients. tTG in the liver and in other extraintestinal tissues could modify other external- or self-antigens and generate different neo-antigens, which are responsible for liver injury in patients with CD. Patients with AIH represent a population at high risk for developing CD; screening for CD should be integrated into the diagnostic routine of all patients with AIH, with or without gastrointestinal manifestations, before starting immunosuppressive treatments. The only currently available treatment for CD is the GFD and the supportive nutritional care for iron, calcium, and vitamin deficiencies. Due to the difficulties of a GFD, in the past decade researchers have become increasingly interested in therapeutic alternatives to continuous or intermittent use of a GFD in patients with CD. Interventions addressed to correct the defect in the intestinal barrier are currently at the most advanced stage of clinical trials. The impact of a GFD on the outcome of AIH is not clear but it seems to be ineffective in the treatment of AIH. The early detection and treatment of CD, however, may prevent progression to end-stage liver failure.},

METHODS: Between June 2005 and June 2009, 169 patients aged <2 years, with symptoms suggestive of CD, were submitted to biopsy. CD diagnosis was based on the revised criteria of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition. RESULTS: Of the 169 patients enrolled, 155 were included: 108 of them showed mucosal atrophy and 47 negative histology. Sensitivity and specificity of tTG, at the cut-off of 8 AU/mL, were 0.96 (CI 0.91-0.99) and 0.91 (CI 0.80-0.98), respectively, with likelihood ratio (LR) of 11.31; at the cut-off of 16 AU/mL, they were 0.79 (CI 0.70-0.86) and 1.00, respectively (CI 0.92-1.00), with LR 4.50. CONCLUSIONS: In patients younger than 2 years, suspected for CD, tTG is very valuable in selecting for small intestinal biopsy.},

   abstract = {Malabsorption encompasses dysfunctions occurring during the digestion and absorption of nutrients. A small proportion of patients presents with chronic diarrhoea. A clinical history supportive of malabsorption may guide investigations toward either the small bowel or pancreas. Serological testing for coeliac disease will determine most cases without invasive investigations. In the clinical context of persisting weight loss and malnutrition, small bowel enteropathy may be investigated with small intestinal biopsies. Small bowel absorptive capacity and permeability might be measured by oral sugar-mix ingestion. Further, approaches to the investigation of malabsorption might also involve the detection in faeces of a substance that has not been absorbed. A variation of the latter is the use of breath testing which relies on the breakdown of the malabsorbed test substance by colonic flora. Measurement of protein absorption is difficult and unreliable; it is, therefore, rarely advocated in clinical settings. No single biological marker confirming a diagnosis of small bowel malabsorption or small bowel integrity is presently available in clinical practice. Plasma citrulline concentration, an amino acid not incorporated into endogenous or exogenous proteins, has been extensively used in research studies and supportive results are establishing its concentration as a reliable quantitative biomarker of enterocyte absorptive capacity.},

   abstract = {The global prevalence of celiac disease is of one person per 250 inhabitants. The disease is induced by gluten, a peptide contained in wheat, rye and barley that during small intestinal digestion generates smaller peptides. Some of these are resistant to hydrolysis and cross through the epithelium into the mucosa, inducing a cascade of immune reactions leading to the appearance of the disease in susceptible individuals. Gluten appeared as a consequence of agricultural practices initiated 10000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent of southwest Asia. Celiac disease epidemiology is complicated since consumption of gluten differs depending on the origin of populations. Treatment of celiac disease consists of withdrawing gluten from the diet, a task that becomes difficult in the long term. The concept of gluten-free food has changed along time. This article updates the concept of celiac disease, the history of gluten consumption in the world, the characteristics of a gluten free diet and the difficulties to adhere to it.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Risk haplotypes have been described in celiac disease (CD), but the influence of native genes on CD in Hispanic Americans is unknown. The aim of the study was to measure the frequency of Amerindian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups (inherited by the maternal line) in mixed-blood patients with CD from Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay, and to assess the relation between these and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and haplotypes and clinical presentations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical history, histological data, and genetic studies were conducted following 2 protocols: a case-control study of 72 Chilean patients with CD and controls, and an assessment of 43 (additional) samples of celiac patients from Chile, 96 from Argentina, and 57 from Uruguay, compared with the mtDNA frequency in the corresponding country. HLA typing was performed by a commercial kit, and mtDNA was determined by means of polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphisms analysis. RESULTS: A total of 73.6% of cases had typical presentations. The most frequent HLA alleles were HLA-DQB*201 and 202. No-DQ2/DQ8 HLA haplotypes were found in 7% of cases. mtDNA frequencies for typical Amerindian haplogroups were found in 71% of cases and 64% of controls (P chi2 = 0.016); in the comparative analysis, mtDNA distribution was not different from the figures reported for the respective general country population. No relation was found between haplotypes or haplogroups and clinical presentations. CONCLUSIONS: mtDNA haplogroups A/B/C/D were frequently found in celiac patients and controls, but no relations appeared between haplogroups, haplotypes, and clinical presentations.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In adult patients, the diagnostic process for celiac disease (CD) is often very late and generates health complications that would be avoided by earlier diagnosis. The diseases of wich these patients were diagnosed before setting the diagnosis of CD were many and diverse. In addition, following a gluten-free diet (GFD) leads to a reduction in the quality of life for patients, who find it difficult to travel, to find accredited restaurants with menus without gluten, to interpretate food labels or to go to friends' houses. OBJECTIVE: To determine the delay in diagnosis, the satisfaction of the information provided by different sources and circumstances related to the quality of life. METHOD: A retrospective cross-sectional observational study in 98 adult celiac through a validated questionnaire for celiac patientes. RESULTS: The average delay in diagnosis was 11 years and the average of doctors consulted prior to confirmation of the CD was 6. Osteoporosis or osteopenia were nearly twice as common among those who took more than five years to be diagnosed. Some 90% say they transgress the dietary pattern, however, 58% show clinical symptoms due to unnoticed consumption of gluten. The impact of GFD on the quality of life is very high. CONCLUSIONS: Long delays in diagnosis suggest the need for greater awareness among physicians about the EC and the use of serological tests in potential patients or risk groups.},

Pregnant women who are vegetarian or vegan, have Crohn's or celiac disease, or have undergone gastric bypass surgery are at increased risk of B12 deficiency. Low serum levels of B12 have been linked to negative impacts in cognitive, motor, and growth outcomes. Low cobalamin levels also may be related to depression in adults. Some studies indicate that B12 supplementation may improve outcomes in children, although more research is needed in this area. Overall, the mechanisms of B12 action in development remain unclear. Further studies in this area to elucidate the pathways of cobalamin influence on development, as well as to prevent B12 deficiency in pregnant women and children are indicated.},

   abstract = {As the gluten-free diet (GFD) gains in popularity with the general public, health practitioners are beginning to question its real health benefits. For those patients with celiac disease (CD), the GFD is considered medical nutrition therapy, as well as the only proven treatment that results in improvements in symptomatology and small bowel histology. Those with wheat allergy also benefit from the GFD, although these patients often do not need to restrict rye, barley, and oats from their diet. Gluten sensitivity is a controversial subject, where patients who have neither CD nor wheat allergy have varying degrees of symptomatic improvement on the GFD. Conditions in this category include dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and neurologic diseases such as gluten-sensitive ataxia and autism. It is important for patients and healthcare practitioners to understand the differences between these conditions, even though they may all respond to a GFD. Patients with CD can experience comorbid nutrition deficiencies and are at higher risk for the development of cancers and other autoimmune conditions. Those with wheat allergy and gluten sensitivity are thought not to be at higher risk for these complications. Defining the symptoms and biochemical markers for gluten-sensitive conditions is an important area for future investigations, and high-quality, large-scale randomized trials are needed to prove the true benefits of the GFD in this evolving field.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) on coeliac disease (CD) have identified risk loci harbouring genes that fit the accepted pathogenic model and are considered aetiological candidates. METHODS: Using Taqman single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and expression assays, the study genotyped 11 SNPs tagging eight GWAS regions (1q31, 2q11-2q12, 3p21, 3q25-3q26, 3q28, 4q27, 6q25 and 12q24) in a Spanish cohort of 1094 CD patients and 540 controls, and performed expression analyses of candidate genes (RGS1, IL18R1/IL18RAP, CCR3, IL12A/SCHIP1, LPP, IL2/IL21-KIAA1109, TAGAP, and SH2B3) in intestinal mucosa from 29 CD children and eight controls. RESULTS: Polymorphisms in 1q31, 2q11-2q12, and 3q25 showed association in our cohort, and also 3q28 and 4q27 when combined with a previous study. Expression levels of IL12A, IL18RAP, IL21, KIAA1109, LPP, SCHIP1, and SH2B3 were affected by disease status, but the correlation between genotype and mRNA levels was observed only in IL12A, LPP, SCHIP1, and SH2B3. CONCLUSIONS: Expression differences between treated CD patients and controls along with SNP expression associations suggest a possible primary role for these four genes and their variants in pathogenesis. The lack of SNP effect in the remaining genes is probably a consequence of arbitrary candidate gene selection within association signals that are not based on functional studies.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: In addition to genetic risk, environmental factors might influence coeliac disease (CD) development. We sought to assess the effect of the interaction between milk-feeding practices and the HLA-DQ genotype on peripheral lymphocyte subsets and their activation markers in infants at familial risk for CD. METHODS: 170 newborns were classified in 3 different genetic risk groups (high risk, HR; intermediate risk, IR; and low risk, LR) after DQB1 and DQA1 typing. Lymphocyte subsets were studied at the age of 4 months by flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: 79 infants were receiving exclusive breastfeeding (BF) and 91 partial breastfeeding or formula feeding (FF). Regarding genetic risk, 40 infants were classified in HR group, 75 in IR group and 55 in LR group. Two-way ANOVA did not show significant interactions between the type of milk feeding and genetic risk group on the lymphocyte subsets analysed. One-way ANOVA for milk-feeding practice alone showed that the percentage of CD4 + CD25+ cells was significantly higher in BF group than in FF group (BF, 10.92 +/- 2.71; FF, 9.94 +/- 2.96; p = 0.026), and absolute counts of CD4 + CD38+ cells were significantly higher in FF group than in BF group (FF, 2,881.23 +/- 973.48; BF, 2,557.95 +/- 977.06; p = 0.038). One-way ANOVA for genetic risk alone showed that absolute counts of NK cells were significantly higher in IR group than HR and LR groups (IR, 539.24 +/- 340.63; HR, 405.01 +/- 239.53; LR, 419.86 +/- 262.85; p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: Lymphocyte subset profiles in the early stages of life could be modulated by milk-feeding practices and genetic risk separately. Breastfeeding might have a positive immunomodulatory effect on lymphocyte subsets in infants at risk of CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy, triggered by dietary wheat gluten and similar proteins of barley and rye in genetically susceptible individuals. The etiology of this disorder is complex, involving both environmental and genetic factors. The major genetic risk factor for CD is represented by HLA-DQ genes, which account for approximately 40% of the genetic risk; however, only a small percentage of carriers develop the disease. Gluten is the main environmental factor responsible for the signs and symptoms of the disease, but exposure to gluten does not fully explain the manifestation of CD. Epidemiological and clinical data suggest that environmental factors other than gluten might play a role in disease development, including early feeding practices (e.g., breast milk versus formula and duration of breastfeeding), infections, and alterations in the intestinal microbiota composition. Herein, we review what is known about the influence of dietary factors, exposure to infectious agents, and intestinal microbiota composition, particularly in early life, on the risk of developing CD, as well as the possible dietary strategies to induce or increase gluten tolerance.},

These restrictions could put them at risk for disturbed eating. The purpose of this study was to determine if young adults with and without DRCHCs differed with regard to disturbed eating behaviors and related psychographics characteristics (i.e., body image attributes, mental disorders, intrapersonal characteristics and sociocultural environment [i.e., media and family]). Each DRCHC participant (cases=166) was matched to 4 healthy participants (controls=664) based on gender and BMI (+/-0.50 BMI units). Conditional logistic regression analyses indicate cases were twice as likely to have been diagnosed by a healthcare provider with an eating disorder (p=0.08, OR=1.99, CI(90) [1.03-3.83]). Cases were significantly more likely to use Inappropriate Compensatory Behaviors to manage their weight, i.e., excessive exercise (p=0.04, OR=1.41, CI(95) [1.02-1.94]) and misuse medication (p=0.04, OR=1.14, CI(95) [1.00-1.29]) than controls. Depression and anxiety were significantly higher, and health status was significantly poorer in cases compared with controls. DRCHC participants were less likely to report feeling body image pressures from the media, placed a greater value on their health, used social diversion, and recalled a greater emphasis being placed on their mothers' weights and mealtimes being less structured than control participants. Findings indicate that nutrition and other healthcare professionals should incorporate screening DRCHC patients for disturbed eating behaviors and eating disorders in their standards of care.},

The current communication presents a review of published studies in recent years on the topic and looks at possible future trends in the improved nutritional and health qualities which have been applied in the bakery industry, directing it further to the formulation design and production of functional breads. The results show that many beneficial ingredients such as dietary fibers, phenolic antioxidants, marine ingredients, and n-3 fatty acids can be used in the bread industry to increase its functionality and result in healthy products, low in calories, cholesterol and celiac disease. Moreover, the use of psyllium seed, amaranth seed, chestnut flour and prebiotics in gluten-free bread (GFB) baking may be the promising frontier to improve overall appearance, quality, sensory properties, and shelf-life of GFB.},

   abstract = {Gluten, a complex protein group in wheat, rye, and barley, causes celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune enteropathy of the small intestine, in genetically susceptible individuals. CD affects about 1% of the general population and causes significant health problems. Adverse inflammatory reactions to gluten are mediated by inappropriate T-cell activation leading to severe damage of the gastrointestinal mucosa, causing atrophy of absorptive surface villi. Gluten peptides bind to the chemokine receptor, CXCR3, and induce release of zonulin, which mediates tight-junction disassembly and subsequent increase in intestinal permeability. Proinflammatory cytokine IL-15 also contributes to the pathology of CD, by driving the expansion of intra-epithelial lymphocytes that damage the epithelium and promote the onset of T-cell lymphomas. There is no cure or treatment for CD, except for avoiding dietary gluten. Current gluten thresholds for food labeling have been established based on the available analytical methods, which show variation in gluten detection and quantification. Also, the clinical heterogeneity of celiac patients poses difficulty in defining clinically acceptable gluten thresholds in gluten-free foods. Presently, there is no bioassay available to measure gluten-induced immunobiological responses. This review focuses on various aspects of CD, and the importance of gluten thresholds and reference material from an immunological perspective.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There are few data on pediatric celiac disease in the United States. The aim of our study was to describe the presentation of celiac disease among children with a normal and an elevated body mass index (BMI) for age, and to study their BMI changes following a gluten-free diet (GFD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-two children (age 13 months-19 years) with biopsy-proven celiac disease, contained in a registry of patients studied at our center from 2000 to 2008, had follow-up growth data available. Patients' height, weight, and BMI were converted to z scores for age and grouped by BMI as underweight, normal, and overweight. Compliance was confirmed using results of serological assays, and data of noncompliant patients were analyzed separately. Data were analyzed during the observation period and were expressed as change in height, weight, and BMI z score per month of dietary treatment. RESULTS: Nearly 19% of patients had an elevated BMI at diagnosis (12.6% overweight, 6% obese) and 74.5% presented with a normal BMI. The mean duration of follow-up was 35.6 months. Seventy-five percent of patients with an elevated BMI at diagnosis decreased their BMI z scores significantly after adherence to a GFD, normalizing it in 44% of cases. Of patients with a normal BMI at diagnosis, weight z scores increased significantly after treatment, and 13% became overweight. CONCLUSIONS: Both normal weight and overweight frequently occur in North American children presenting with celiac disease. A GFD may have a beneficial effect upon the BMI of overweight and obese children with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder, characterized by small intestinal malabsorption of nutrients after the ingestion of gluten by genetically susceptible individuals. The discovery of the wide variations in the nature and intensity of clinical presentation of CD has transformed its status, long considered a rare disease, to that of a common health problem. As patients with CD get older, they tend to present with complaints not directly referable to the gastrointestinal tract. Neurologic symptoms, caused by lesions of the central or peripheral nervous system occasionally occur in patients with CD and are poorly understood. This review focalizes on the present knowledge of the potential relationship between CD and epilepsy. The prevalence of CD among patients with epilepsy is not homogeneously distributed, probably because epilepsy encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders. In fact, the clinical spectrum of epilepsy related to CD ranges from benign syndromes to intractable epilepsy. The precise mechanism of the potential association between CD and epilepsy is also still under discussion.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A revision of criteria for diagnosing coeliac disease (CD) is being conducted by The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). In parallel, we have performed a survey aimed to evaluate present practices for CD among paediatric gastroenterologists and to learn their views on the need for modification of present criteria for CD diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed to experienced paediatric gastroenterologists (ESPGHAN members) via the Internet. RESULTS: Overall, 95 valid questionnaires were available for analysis, pertaining to 28 different countries, with the majority of responders treating patients with CD for >15 years. Only about 12% of the responders comply with present criteria, noncompliance being related mainly to the challenge policy. Approximately 90% request a revision and modification of the present criteria. Forty-four percent want to omit the small bowel biopsy in symptomatic children with positive anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin (Ig) A or endomysial IgA antibodies, especially if they are DQ2/DQ8 positive. For silent cases detected by screening with convincingly positive anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA or EMA IgA, about 30% consider that no small bowel biopsy should be required in selected cases. Adding human leukocyte antigen typing in the diagnostic workup was asked for by 42% of the responders. As for gluten challenge, a new policy is advocated restricting its obligation to cases whenever the diagnosis is doubtful or unclear. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these opinions, revision of the ESPGHAN criteria for diagnosing CD is urgently needed.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a permanent inflammatory disorder of the small bowel affecting approximately 1% of the population. The only effective treatment that exists is exclusion of gluten from the diet. The present paper aims to review the literature as to whether oats are safe to eat for people with coeliac disease. Much data exist on the restrictive nature that adhering to a gluten-free diet imposes on an individual. If oats could be eaten, this would help reduce the restrictive nature of the diet. This in turn could lead to an increase in the quality of life. Oats are of high-nutritional value, providing a rich source of fibre, vitamins and minerals. The fibre source contains soluble fibre which is believed to help reduce LDL-cholesterol. A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Earlier studies conducted are difficult to compare as they used different methodologies and it is not known whether samples of oats in the studies were contaminated with gluten from other cereals. Many studies reviewed do not state the strain of oat used. Recent research has suggested that it may only be in certain strains of oats which could produce a toxic response to people with coeliac disease. In conclusion, research suggests that the risk from consuming oats may be less harmful than first thought; however, may vary according to the strain of oat. Handling that risk in clinical practice remains controversial.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Assays for antibodies against native gliadin (anti-nGli) are still often assumed to perform better in the diagnosis of coeliac disease in young children than tests for antibodies to deamidated gliadin (anti-dGli), tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG), and endomysium (EmA). We compared the performance of assays for anti-nGli, anti-dGli, anti-tTG, and EmA in this age group. METHODS: We investigated retrospectively 184 children (42 with coeliac disease under normal diet and 142 controls) up to 2 years of age. Immunoglobulin (Ig) A- and IgG-anti-dGli, IgA- and IgG-anti-nGli, IgA- and IgG-anti-tTG, and IgA-EmA were measured in serum. Areas under receiver operating characteristics curves, sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, as well as diagnostic odds ratios were calculated. RESULTS: From all of the tests investigated, only assays for IgG-anti-dGli, IgA-anti-tTG, and IgA-EmA had high specificity (>/= 0.96) connected with high sensitivity (>/= 0.86), with high positive predictive values (>/= 0.52 and >/= 0.69 at pretest probabilities of 0.05 and 0.1, respectively) and negative predictive values (>/= 0.99 and >/= 0.98 at pretest probabilities of 0.05 and 0.1, respectively). These assays also showed high positive likelihood ratio (>/= 24) at low negative likelihood ratio (</= 0.15) and high diagnostic odds ratios (>/= 136). CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the use of assays of anti-nGli to diagnose coeliac disease in young children. IgA-anti-tTG, IgA-EmA, and IgG-anti-dGli perform better than anti-nGli.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in the United States is unknown. We sought to estimate CD prevalence nationwide by using a nationally representative sample. METHODS: This study included 7,798 persons aged 6 years or older who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2010. Serum samples from all participants were tested for immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase antibodies and, if findings were abnormal, also for IgA endomysial antibodies. Information about prior diagnosis of CD and use of a gluten-free diet (GFD) was obtained by direct interview. CD was defined as having either double-positive serology (serologically diagnosed CD) or a reported diagnosis of CD by a doctor or other health-care professional and being on a GFD (reported clinical diagnosis of CD). RESULTS: CD was found in 35 participants, 29 of whom were unaware of their diagnosis. Median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 23-66 years); 20 were women and 29 were non-Hispanic white. The prevalence of CD in the United States was 0.71% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58-0.86%), with 1.01% (95% CI, 0.78-1.31%) among non-Hispanic whites. In all, 55 participants reported following a GFD, which corresponded to a prevalence of 0.63% (95% CI, 0.36-1.07%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CD in the United States was 0.71% (1 in 141), similar to that found in several European countries. However, most cases were undiagnosed. CD was rare among minority groups but affected 1% of non-Hispanic whites. Most persons who were following a GFD did not have a diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is a major consequence of pancreatic diseases (e. g. chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis), extrapancreatic diseases like celiac disease and Crohn's disease, and gastrointestinal and pancreatic surgical resections. Recognition of this entity is highly relevant to avoid malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality. The main clinical consequence of PEI is fat maldigestion and malabsorption, resulting in steatorrhoea. Pancreatic exocrine function should be assessed by measuring levels of faecal elastase-1. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for PEI. Administration of enzymes in form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres avoids acid-mediated lipase inactivation and ensures gastric emptying of enzymes in parallel with nutrients. In adults, the initial recommended dose of pancreatic enzymes is 25.000 units of lipase per meal, titrating up to a maximum of 80000 units of lipase per meal. Large meals require 25.000 - 80.000 units of lipase per meal while snacks require 10.000 - 40.000 units of lipase per meal. Oral pancreatic enzymes should be taken with meals to ensure adequate mixing with the chyme. Adjunct therapy with acid-suppressing agents may be useful in patients who continue to experience symptoms of PEI despite high-dose enzyme therapy. Patients with PEI should be encouraged to consume small, frequent meals and to abstain from alcohol. Dietary fat restriction is not recommended for patients with PEI.},

   abstract = {Last consensus in celiac disease in 2008 conducted under the aegis of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition jointly with North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition reveals the following: "celiac disease is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy characterized by sensitization to gluten. That can affect any organ or system, with a wide range of clinical manifestations of variable severity". Thus, in recent years, clinical picture of celiac disease has changed the old paradigm--bowel disease with villous atrophy and malnutrition, being replaced with the new paradigm--multi-organ autoimmune disease, affecting many organs and systems throughout but with more less specific symptoms, which undiagnosed leads to delayed diagnosis, at a late-onset disease and long-term major complications as the risk of cancer. According to this consensus "the serological diagnosis of celiac disease is based on high sensitivity and specificity tests", but in line with changing clinical features of celiac disease, its diagnosis has undergone significant changes in recent years. These changes in the diagnosis of celiac disease, we have decided to analyze them.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: According to the 2008 celiac disease working group run by Dr. A. Fassano under the auspices of the Federation of International Societies of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, celiac disease is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy characterized by gluten sensitivity, which can affect any organ or system, having a wide range of clinical manifestations of variable severity. The serological diagnosis of celiac disease is based on high sensitivity and specificity tests. The measurement of IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies by ELISA is universally accepted in the screening of celiac disease. METHODS: Using the gold standard represented by IgA anti-endomysium antibodies in a group of 890 children investigated during 2008-2009, we aimed to evaluate IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG IgA), as well as to establish their prevalence in associated diseases. RESULTS: Following the measurement of tTG IgA in the entire group, we obtained: sensitivity 773%, positive predictive value 55.2%, specificity 93.1%, negative predictive value 973%, p = 0.000, and in tTG IgA associations we obtained the value 0.51 for the ROC curve area. We found associations of tTG IgA with type 1 diabetes mellitus (235% prevalence), protein-calorie malnutrition (0.89% prevalence), and intestinal malabsorption (0.56% prevalence). CONCLUSIONS: Our results have a high specificity and sensitivity in the screening of celiac disease, while requiring a second method of confirmation.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy involving genetic and environmental factors whose interaction might influence disease risk. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of milk-feeding practices and the HLA-DQ genotype on intestinal colonization of Bacteroides species in infants at risk of CD development. This study included 75 full-term newborns with at least one first-degree relative suffering from CD. Infants were classified according to milk-feeding practice (breast-feeding or formula feeding) and HLA-DQ genotype (high or low genetic risk). Stools were analyzed at 7 days, 1 month, and 4 months by PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The Bacteroides species diversity index was higher in formula-fed infants than in breast-fed infants. Breast-fed infants showed a higher prevalence of Bacteroides uniformis at 1 and 4 months of age, while formula-fed infants had a higher prevalence of B. intestinalis at all sampling times, of B. caccae at 7 days and 4 months, and of B. plebeius at 4 months. Infants with high genetic risk showed a higher prevalence of B. vulgatus, while those with low genetic risk showed a higher prevalence of B. ovatus, B. plebeius, and B. uniformis. Among breast-fed infants, the prevalence of B. uniformis was higher in those with low genetic risk than in those with high genetic risk. Among formula-fed infants, the prevalence of B. ovatus and B. plebeius was increased in those with low genetic risk, while the prevalence of B. vulgatus was higher in those with high genetic risk. The results indicate that both the type of milk feeding and the HLA-DQ genotype influence the colonization process of Bacteroides species, and possibly the disease risk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common in children. Abdominal pain (AP) is the most common gastrointestinal (GI) symptom in children. The severity of AP drives medical consultations and quality of life in adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Thirty-eight percent of 8- to 15-year-old schoolchildren report AP weekly with 24% of those children reporting persistence of AP >8 weeks. Despite the high prevalence of AP, only 2% of school children seek medical attention for AP. Lack of parental knowledge on their child's symptoms may constitute one of the factors affecting the low ratio of consultation in children reporting AP. The aim was to assess parental reports of AP symptoms in a population of healthy community children. METHODS: Data of 5 studies with identical methodology to assess GI symptoms in children with celiac disease (CD), cow's milk allergy (CMA), pyloric stenosis (PS), Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP), and stem cell transplant (SC) and their healthy siblings were reviewed: a phone questionnaire on GI symptoms and Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rome III version questionnaire (QPGS-RIII). Inclusion criteria were healthy children 4 to 18 years of age with a sibling previously diagnosed with CD, CMA, PS, HSP, or SC. RESULTS: Data on 246 healthy children, mean age (9.8 years, range 3-24, 112 girls) were obtained. Parents reported presence of AP in the last 8 weeks before the telephone contact in 20 (8.1%) children (age range 4-18 years, 11 girls). There was no significant difference in AP prevalence between boys and girls (P = 0.64). Six children (2.4%) met QPGS-RIII diagnostic criteria for FGIDs: 3 functional abdominal pain (FAP) and 3 IBS. CONCLUSIONS: AP was common in community children. FAP was the most common FGID among healthy community children. The prevalence of AP by parental report is lower than the previously published prevalence of AP reported by children. Lack of awareness of children's symptoms may play a role in the low ratio of consultation for AP in symptomatic children. Future prospective studies should confirm our findings and investigate the factors influencing the medical consultation decision including parental awareness of children's symptoms.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patients with celiac disease (CD) are more likely than controls to develop abdominal pain (AP) and AP-associated functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in long-term follow-up. STUDY DESIGN: In a retrospective study, data on children (3-22 years old) with CD diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 were obtained. Parents were contacted by telephone at least 6 months after the diagnosis of CD and invited to participate in the study. Consenting parents completed: (1) a telephone questionnaire on the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms; and (2) the parent report version of the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III for cases and selected controls. RESULTS: Forty-nine cases (mean 11.3 years, 20 male participants) and 48 controls (mean 11.1 years, 24 male participants) were enrolled. Twelve children in the CD group (24.5%) and 7 children in the control group (14.6%) had AP at the time of the study (P = .3). Nine children in the CD group (18.3%) and 4 children in the control group (8.3%) met criteria for an AP-associated FGID according to the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III (P = .23). CONCLUSION: It was found that children with CD and controls have a similar risk of AP and AP-FGIDs. Methodologic limitations prevent generalization of results, but large prospective studies should confirm the findings.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the immunogenicity of an inactivated hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine and the effect of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type on immunogenicity in children with CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients with CD and 62 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Inactivated HAV vaccine (Havrix; GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) containing 720 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units of alum-adsorbed hepatitis A antigen was administered intramuscularly in a 2-dose schedule at 0 and 6 months. Seroconversion rates and antibody titers of HAV were measured at 1 and 7 months. RESULTS: At 1 month, seroconversion rates were 78.8% and 77.4% and geometric mean titers were 50.7 and 49.9 mIU/mL in the CD and control groups, respectively (P > 0.05). At 7 months, seroconversion rates were 97% and 98.4% and geometric mean titers were 138.5 and 133 mIU/mL in the CD and control groups, respectively (P > 0.05). The most frequent HLA types were HLA-DQ2, -DR3, and -DR7 alleles in patients with CD and HLA-DQ3, -DQ6, -DR11, and -DR14 in the controls. There was no association between HLA alleles and antibody titers of hepatitis A vaccine. CONCLUSION: Children with CD have a good immune response to hepatitis A vaccine, similar to healthy controls.},

   abstract = {Objectives. To our knowledge, the occurrence of esophagitis in children with celiac disease (CD) has never been evaluated. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of esophagitis in children with CD. Patients and Methods. Between 2003 and 2007, children with biopsy confirmed CD were retrospectively identified. Biopsy reports were reviewed for esophageal inflammation. Biopsy reports of 2218 endoscopies performed during the same period were also evaluated for inflammation. Results. Forty-nine children diagnosed with CD (47% boys). Nineteen of 49 (39%) patients with CD had esophagitis (95% CI 0.23-0.5). Thirty percent of boys and 46% of girls with CD had esophagitis (95% CI 0.12-0.40). Overall, 45% of patients who underwent upper endoscopy had esophagitis. The prevalence of esophagitis in CD (39%) compared to the prevalence of esophagitis (45%) in our practice was not significantly different, P = 0.2526. Conclusion. There was no difference in the prevalence of esophagitis between children diagnosed with CD at the time of their diagnostic EGD and the prevalence of esophagitis in children without CD. A prospective study to determine whether the esophagitis should be treated with acid suppression or whether the esophagitis heals with the gluten-free diet is warranted.},

   abstract = {The normal intestinal microflora (microbiota) represents a complex, dynamic, and diverse collection of microorganisms, which usually inhabit the gastrointestinal tract. Normally, between this flora and the human host a mutually beneficial long-term symbiotic relationship is established, where the host contributes essential nutrients necessary for the survival of the microbiota and the latter fulfils multiple roles in host nutrition and development. Several achievements have recently converged to renew interest in studying the normal gut microbiota: the development of molecular methods of studying the microbial communities, the improved understanding of host-microbe interactions in health and disease, and the potential for therapeutic manipulation of the microbiota. We present recent data concerning the molecular technologies of studying the microbiota and new findings regarding the composition of the normal flora. We underline the beneficial activities of the gut flora on the human host. We emphasize the recent findings in the alterations of the microbiota in various medical conditions (celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, colorectal cancer, allergic disorders, and especially inflammatory bowel diseases). The results of these new studies suggest that changes of the microbiota could be linked to the etiopathogenesis of these diseases. These outstanding findings could be used for further diagnostic tools and/or therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pure oats are safe for most patients with celiac disease, but concerns regarding contamination by other grains limit their consumption. The Canadian Celiac Association recently released guidelines governing the production of pure oats. The objective was to test the safety of a product manufactured under these guidelines. METHODS: Fifteen adults with established, biopsy-confirmed celiac disease of >/= 1 year duration were challenged with 350 g/wk of pure oats for 12 weeks. Symptom scores, weight, hemoglobin, ferritin, albumin, and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) were assessed at weeks 0, 6, and 12. Duodenal biopsies were obtained before and after oat challenge and assessed based on the modified Marsh-Oberhuber score. Compliance with a gluten-free diet was monitored with random food diaries. RESULTS: Fifteen patients completed the study and were analyzed in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. There were no significant changes in symptom scores, weight, hemoglobin, ferritin, or albumin during oat consumption. The tTG remained negative in all patients, and the histology scores did not significantly change during oat challenge. The only relapse occurred in a patient who became noncompliant with her gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: The findings support the safety of pure, uncontaminated oats manufactured under Canadian Celiac Association guidelines for patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: To assess the clinical characteristic of CD as well as correlation of symptoms and the degrees of intestinal mucosal lesions in Iranian children. BACKGROUND: Microscopic Enteritis (Marsh 0-II) is associated with malabsorption. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From August 2005 to September 2009, 111 cases with malabsorption and classical gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) age of children with CD was 4.9+/-3.5 years (range, 6 month - 16 years) and the mean duration of symptoms was 8 +/- 20.5 months. 50 cases (45%) were female and 61 cases (55%) were male. The most common clinical presentation was failure to thrive in 72%, chronic diarrhea in 65.8% and Iron deficiency anemia in 59.5%. Sensitivity of EMA was 100% in patients with Marsh IIIb and Marsh IIIc. EMA was also positive in 77% of cases with Marsh 0, 18% in Marsh I, 44% in Marsh II and 81.8% in patients with Marsh IIIa. CONCLUSION: Histopathology did not reflect the severity of gluten sensitivity. This would suggest that the degree of intestinal mucosal damage might not be a reliable prognostic factor. Significant symptoms can be present with minor histological change on biopsy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of adjuvant treatment is necessary for rapid and effective treatment in patients with celiac disease. In a pilot randomized controlled trial, the effect of prednisolone on enterocyte apoptosis and regeneration in celiac disease was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three treatment-naive patients with celiac disease were randomized to either gluten-free diet (GFD, n = 17) or GFD + prednisolone (1 mg/kg for 4 weeks, n = 16). Duodenal biopsies were taken at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks posttreatment. Six patients with functional dyspepsia were recruited as controls. All these biopsies were stained for markers of intrinsic apoptotic pathway (AIF, H2AX, p53), common apoptotic pathway (CC3, M30), apoptotic inhibitors (XIAP, Bcl2), and epithelial proliferation (Ki-67). Apoptotic (AI) and proliferation indices (PI) were compared. RESULTS: At baseline duodenal biopsies, the end apoptotic products H2AX and M30 were significantly increased. In comparison with those treated with GFD alone, after 4 weeks of GFD + prednisolone treatment, some markers of both intrinsic and common apoptotic pathways showed rapid decline. After prednisolone withdrawal, there was overexpression of H2AX, CC3, and p53 in the latter group. In comparison with those treated with only GFD, patients treated with prednisolone showed suppression of mucosal PI, which started rising again after withdrawal of prednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis takes place in mucosal epithelium in celiac disease. Addition of short course of prednisolone suppresses apoptosis rapidly. However, it also suppresses epithelial regeneration; hence, if used, it should be withdrawn after an initial short course.},

The detection of gluten/wheat traces in foods is important to safeguard the health of wheat-sensitive individuals and comply with food labeling. Many immunoanalytical-based commercial kits are available for the quantification of gliadin/gluten/wheat proteins. We compared the immunoreactivity of wheat fractions with wheat-allergic human serum IgE and antibody conjugates used in six commercial immunoassay kits. Moreover, the performance of the kits was tested using corn flour spiked with gluten (5, 10, 25, and 50 ppm) and wheat flour (50, 100, 250, and 500 ppm). The albumin, globulin, gliadin, and glutenin fractions reacted with IgE from nine, eight, two, and eight patients' sera, respectively, out of nine wheat allergic patients tested. Among the antibodies from commercial kits, those from R-Biopharm, Morinaga, and Romer Labs reacted strongly with the gliadin fraction, whereas those from BioKits, ALLER-TEK, and ELISA Systems reacted strongly with the glutenin fraction. All kits showed minimal or no reactivity with albumin and globulin fractions. All kits detected the gluten and wheat flour in a corn flour matrix at the lowest spiked levels of 5 and 50 ppm, respectively. However, there was wide variation among the kits when comparing the recovery of gluten and wheat flour. The recovery was also dependent on the source material (gluten or wheat flour) used for spiking the corn flour matrix.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only recognised treatment for coeliac disease (CD). The present study aimed to determine the nutritional adequacy of the 'no detectable gluten' diet. METHODS: Seven-day prospective food intake was assessed in 55 patients who were adherent to a GFD for more than 2 years and in 50 newly-diagnosed age- and sex-matched patients (18-71 years, 24% male) studied prospectively over 12 months on GFD. Historical precoeliac intake was also assessed in the latter group. Intake was compared with Australian Nutritional Recommendations and the Australian population data. RESULTS: Nutritional intake was similar between groups. Of macronutrients, only starch intake fell over 12 months (26% to 23%, P = 0.04). Fibre intake was inadequate for all except in diet-experienced men. More than one in 10 of both newly-diagnosed and experienced women had inadequate thiamin, folate, vitamin A, magnesium, calcium and iron intakes. More than one in 10 newly-diagnosed men had inadequate thiamin, folate, magnesium, calcium and zinc intakes. Inadequate intake did not relate to nutrient density of the GFD. Inadequacies of folate, calcium, iron and zinc occurred more frequently than in the Australian population. The frequency of inadequacies was similar pre- and post-diagnosis, except for thiamin and vitamin A, where inadequacies were more common after GFD implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intake patterns at 12 months on a GFD are similar to longer-term intake. Dietary inadequacies are common and may relate to habitual poor food choices in addition to inherent deficiencies in the GFD. Dietary education should also address the achievement of adequate micronutrient intake. Fortification of GF foods also need to be considered.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Serological markers are of great interest in coeliac disease (CD), although intestinal biopsy is still the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis. Tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies (AATGt-IgA) and antiendomysial antibodies IgA (AAE-IgA) are closely correlated to intestinal damage observed in biopsies. Villous atrophy (Marsh 3) plays a major role in CD diagnosis. Marsh 2 stage (crypt hyperplasia) as a CD marker is still under debate. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain an AATGt-IgA level that corresponds to a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% for a histological CD diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A series of 120 patients younger than 14 years, non- IgA deficient, who underwent an intestinal biopsy and were positive for both serological markers (AATGt-IgA and AAE-IgA). For AATGt-IgA, according to the manufacturer's recommendations, a value greater than 16 IU/mL is considered as a positive value. The PPV of AATGt was determined for different cut-off points. RESULTS: The histological findings distribution is directly correlated to the AATGt-IgA cut-off point. When the cut-off point is set above 7.5-10.6 times the commercial reference value, there is a 2.1% of Marsh 2 lessions and 93.4% of Marsh 3; above 10.6 times the reference value, all biopsies where Marsh 3 (100%). The PPV that considers Marsh 3 is (93.4%). The PPV, for considering Marsh 3 is low (55%) when AATGt-IgA serology is positive with levels between 16 and 67 IU/ml (1-4.2 times the cut-off point) and a higher value (92%) for concentrations between 68 and 118 IU/ml (4.3-7.4 times) and for cases with 69-170 IU/ml (7.5-10.6 times); above 170 IU/ml (>10.6 times) PPV is 100%. CONCLUSION: The use of values higher than the recommended cut-off point must logically improve specificity and PPV. In 31.6% patients positive for AATGt-IgA and AAE-IgA (38/120) it would have been possible to diagnose the disease without intestinal biopsy as of the PPV was 100%. It is not possible to standardise results as there are different commercial kits with variable cut-off points, so we must be cautious when setting recommendations based on AATGt-IgA.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: [corrected] K562(S) agglutination has been used as a rapid and economic tool for the in vitro screening of the toxicity of cereal fractions and prolamins in celiac disease (CD). A strict correlation has been reported between the toxicity of cereals and cereal fractions for celiac patients and their ability to agglutinate K562(S) cells. Whether this specificity of K562(S)-cell agglutination is caused by the activation of the same pathogenic events triggered by toxic cereal fractions in CD intestine or simply represents a bystander event of gluten toxicity is, however, unknown. METHODS: K562(S) cells were incubated in vitro with the peptic-tryptic digest of wheat gliadin. RESULTS: The agglutination of K562(S) cells by wheat gliadin peptides is orchestrated by a cascade of very early events occurring at the K562(S)-cell surface similar to those occurring at the intestinal epithelial surface. They involve a rapid increase in intracellular calcium levels that activate tissue transglutaminase (TG2), leading to a rapid actin reorganization that is pivotal in driving cell agglutination. These specific effects of toxic cereals are phenocopied by the gliadin-derived peptide p31-43, which orchestrates the activation of innate response to gliadin in CD. DISCUSSION: Our study provides the rationale for the extensive use of K562(S)-cell agglutination as a valuable tool for screening cereal toxicity.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Diversifying food during the first year of life is an extremely important step for the adequate nutritional status of infants and their physical and psychological development, functioning as a means of transition from lactation to feed the family. Despite the introduction of food diversification is a necessary step for human development, some issues still exist today, not only for the initiation but also in relation to the proper sequence for the various types of food, causing different perspectives and ways of acting on part of clinicians. OBJECTIVES: To determine the best time for the start of food diversification and the best time to introduce certain foods. METHODS: Bibliographic search of the literature in English and Portuguese, from January 2004 to May 2010 through Medline / Pubmed sites and Evidence Based Medicine. Twenty-five of fifty-eight articles were selected, given the full availability of publications and relevance to the topic. RESULTS: The food diversification should never start before 17 or after 2 6 weeks. There is no current evidence that delaying the introduction of any antigen after six months reduces the risk of food allergy, asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema, even if there is family history of allergy. It is prudent to avoid the introduction of both prior (less than four months) and late (more than seven months) of gluten and a gradual introduction will reduce the risk of celiac disease, type 1 diabetes and allergy to it. The introduction of fish at one year of age reduces the risk of allergic diseases at age four at the immunological benefits of its early introduction outweigh the risks of sensitization to its antigens. CONCLUSIONS: It is important that the onset of food diversification and the introduction of antigens is performed within a specified time interval. It is crucial to implement a healthy diet for the whole family, to the extent that children learn by example.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the benefits of screening for celiac autoimmunity via immunoglobulin A transglutaminase autoantibodies (TG) in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). STUDY DESIGN: We followed up 79 screening-identified TG+ and 56 matched TG- children with T1D for 2 years to evaluate growth, bone mineral density, nutritional status, and diabetes control. TG+ subjects self-selected to gluten-free or gluten-containing diet. RESULTS: Of the initial cohort, 80% were available for reexamination after 2 years. TG+ subjects had consistently lower weight z-scores and higher urine N-telopeptides than TG- subjects, but similar measures of bone density and diabetes outcomes. TG+ children who remained on a gluten-containing diet had lower insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 z-scores compared with TG+ subjects who reported following a gluten-free diet. Children who continued with high TG index throughout the study had lower bone mineral density z-scores, ferritin, and vitamin D 25OH levels, compared with the TG- group. CONCLUSIONS: No significant adverse outcomes were identified in children with T1D with screening-identified TG+ who delay therapy with a gluten-free diet for 2 years. Children with persistently high levels of TG may be at greater risk. The optimal timing of screening and treatment for celiac disease in children with T1D requires further investigation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A gluten-free diet is the only treatment for patients with coeliac disease, although it can be burdensome to follow and result in inadequate nutrient intake. The cost and availability of a gluten-free diet has been cited as a cause of incomplete dietary compliance; however, this has not been extensively investigated. The aim was to investigate the availability and cost of gluten-free foods across a wide range of stores. METHODS: The availability and cost of 20 foods (both wheat-based and everyday foods) was surveyed at 30 different stores across five different store categories. For each of the 20 foods, four products were selected (branded gluten-free, cheapest gluten-free, branded standard, cheapest standard) resulting in sampling of up to 80 products in each of the 30 stores. RESULTS: In general, there was limited availability of gluten-free foods, with an average of 8.2 of the 20 (41%) foods being available in a gluten-free version per store. Regular supermarkets had a greater availability (18.0/20, 90%), whereas budget supermarkets (1.8/20, 9%) and corner shops (1.8/20, 9%) had almost no gluten-free versions (P < 0.001). All 10 gluten-free versions of wheat-based foods were more costly than their standard counterparts (76-518% more expensive; P < 0.001). Some gluten-free versions of everyday foods were also more costly than standard counterparts (2-124%). CONCLUSIONS: There is limited availability of gluten-free foods and they are generally more expensive than their standard counterparts. This may impact on compliance to a gluten-free diet, with potential nutritional and clinical consequences, together with an increased risk of complications.},

   abstract = {Adverse reactions to foods are classified according to the presence or absence of involvement of the immune system, which may or may not include the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. This review focuses on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of adverse food reactions, primarily in adults, and excluding celiac disease and lactose intolerance. Reported reactions to foods are often believed to be manifestations of a food allergy; however, IgE-mediated food allergy only affects 1% to 4% of adults, with seafood, tree nuts, peanuts, fruits, and vegetables being the most common triggers. Diagnosis is challenging and most commonly achieved through careful evaluation of clinical history followed by elimination and reintroduction or challenge with the suspected offending food. With acute-onset allergic reactions, estimation of food-specific IgE antibodies is frequently used to confirm or refute the diagnosis. Recent developments, such as single allergen assays, enhance the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy, but the gold standard remains oral food challenge. Despite recent advances in the management of food allergy, including the promotion of oral tolerance, the mainstay of management is still the avoidance of food triggers. Dietary management can be compromised by nutritional inadequacy, accidental exposure, food labeling, and quality of life or adherence issues. It is essential that adults with confirmed food allergy receive optimal nutrition and dietetic support to enable them to manage their condition.},

   abstract = {Gluten exclusion (protein complex present in many cereals) has been proposed as an option for the prevention of diseases other than coeliac disease. However, the effects of gluten-free diets on obesity and its mechanisms of action have not been studied. Thus, our objective was to assess whether gluten exclusion can prevent adipose tissue expansion and its consequences. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet containing 4.5% gluten (Control) or no gluten (GF). Body weight and adiposity gains, leukocyte rolling and adhesion, macrophage infiltration and cytokine production in adipose tissue were assessed. Blood lipid profiles, glycaemia, insulin resistance and adipokines were measured. Expression of the PPAR-alpha and gamma, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), carnitine palmitoyl acyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), insulin receptor, GLUT-4 and adipokines were assessed in epidydimal fat. Gluten-free animals showed a reduction in body weight gain and adiposity, without changes in food intake or lipid excretion. These results were associated with up-regulation of PPAR-alpha, LPL, HSL and CPT-1, which are related to lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. There was an improvement in glucose homeostasis and pro-inflammatory profile-related overexpression of PPAR-gamma. Moreover, intravital microscopy showed a lower number of adhered cells in the adipose tissue microvasculature. The overexpression of PPAR-gamma is related to the increase of adiponectin and GLUT-4. Our data support the beneficial effects of gluten-free diets in reducing adiposity gain, inflammation and insulin resistance. The data suggests that diet gluten exclusion should be tested as a new dietary approach to prevent the development of obesity and metabolic disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We have reported on increased levels of antibodies against gliadin and/or transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in children with cerebral palsy (CP) but without having increased prevalence of celiac disease (CD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether these children have mucosal signs of early developing CD, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/DQ8, and antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Stored blood samples from 16 children with CP were analyzed regarding HLA-DQ2/DQ8 and anti-DGP antibodies. HLA-DQ2/DQ8 were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. Anti-DGP antibodies were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Small-bowel biopsies from 15 of these children were available for immunohistochemistry regarding IgA colocalized with TG2, densities of alpha/beta+ and gamma/delta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes. RESULTS: Mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) deposits colocalized with TG2 were found in the small-bowel biopsy from 1 patient with serum IgA-class anti-TG2 antibodies, HLA-DQ2, and gastrointestinal complaints. Another 2 children had slightly increased numbers of mucosal alpha/beta+ and/or gamma/delta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes. In total, 10 of 16 children were HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8-positive. Anti-DGP antibodies were detected in sera from 4 of 16 children. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, 1 child with CP had IgA colocalizing with TG2 in the small-bowel mucosa, suggesting CD at an early stage. Although the majority of children with CP and elevated levels of CD-related seromarkers are HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8-positive, they have neither classical nor early developing CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine independent predictors of gluten avoidance and of a physician's decision to initiate a gluten-free diet (GFD) in children and adolescents without confirmed celiac disease. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a structured medical record review of 579 patients aged 1-19 years presenting for evaluation of celiac disease between January 2000 and December 2010 at a large Boston teaching hospital. We collected data including demographic information, medical history, serology, small intestinal biopsy, history of gluten avoidance, and the postworkup recommendation of implementation of a GFD. Predictors of gluten-related issues were identified by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 579 children without a previous diagnosis of celiac disease (mean age, 8.7 years), 43 (7.4%) had ever avoided gluten. Independent predictors of gluten avoidance were irritability or poor temper (OR, 3.2), diarrhea (OR, 2.5), weight issues (OR, 0.4), pervasive developmental disorder (OR, 5.3), and family history of celiac disease (OR, 2.2). Among 143 children without confirmed celiac disease who underwent diagnostic evaluation, several predictive factors were associated with a physician- recommended/parent-initiated GFD: irritability (OR, 6.4), diarrhea (OR, 3.4), pervasive developmental disorder (OR, 7.9), and positive serology before the referral (OR, 4.3). CONCLUSION: Gluten avoidance among children and adolescents without a previous diagnosis of celiac disease is relatively common. The identified predictors suggest that gluten avoidance is associated with nonspecific behavioral and gastrointestinal complaints and perhaps with the perceived dietary responses in another family member thought to have celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although gluten avoidance is thought to be common among New Zealanders, the prevalence of gluten avoidance and of actual coeliac disease (CD) in children is uncertain. Our aims were: (1) to determine the prevalence of doctor-diagnosed CD and of gluten avoidance in New Zealand children; and (2) among children without CD, to identify independent predictors of gluten avoidance. DESIGN: The New Zealand Asthma and Allergy Cohort Study has detailed information on participants' demographic, pregnancy-related and neonatal factors. The authors surveyed parents regarding their child's history of lactose intolerance and gluten-related issues (eg, gluten avoidance, history of wheat or gluten allergy in first degree relatives, testing and doctor diagnosis of CD). After excluding children with doctor-diagnosed CD, the authors identified independent predictors of gluten avoidance. RESULTS: Among 916 children, most (78%) were of European ethnicity. The authors identified nine (1.0%, 95% CI 0.5% to 1.9%) who had doctor-diagnosed CD, while 48 (5.2%, 95% CI 4.0% to 6.9%) avoided gluten. Among children without diagnosed CD, significant independent predictors for gluten avoidance were Christchurch site (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.02 to 4.7), prior testing for CD (OR 9.0, 95% CI 4.1 to 19.5) and doctor-diagnosed lactose intolerance (OR 5.2, 95% CI 2.0 to 13.9). CONCLUSIONS: CD affected 1% of these New Zealand children, but 5% reported gluten avoidance. The predictors of gluten avoidance in children without doctor-diagnosed CD suggest important regional differences in community belief or medical practice regarding implementation of gluten avoidance and the contributory role of non-specific subjective abdominal complaints.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether season of birth is associated with celiac disease (CD). STUDY DESIGN: We performed a medical record review of 1964 patients with biopsy-proven CD at 3 teaching hospitals (2 pediatric centers and 1 adult center) between 2000 and 2010. The first positive small intestinal biopsy result defined age of diagnosis. The observed proportions of births in each season (spring [March-May], summer [June-August], fall [September-November], and winter [December-February]) were compared with the expected proportions using binomial probability tests. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 9.8 +/- 5.0 years in the 2 pediatric centers and 43.6 +/- 15.8 years in the adult center. The cohort was predominately female (69%). Overall, more patients were born in spring (27%) than in any other season: summer (25%), fall (25%), and winter (23%). In patients diagnosed before age 15 years, the spring birth excess was present in boys (33%; P = .0005), but not in girls (26%; P = .43). The sex difference in season of birth was less striking in patients with CD diagnosed at age >/=15 years. CONCLUSION: Season of birth is an environmental risk factor for CD, particularly in boys diagnosed before age 15 years. The results are consistent with a new theoretical model that integrates potential environmental factors (eg, gluten introduction, ultraviolet-B exposure, vitamin D status) and acute viral gastrointestinal infections in early childhood.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease triggered by exposure to gluten-containing foods. IgA autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase (TTG) are elevated in CD, but little is known about the gastrointestinal state before the appearance of TTG. Antibodies to wheat storage globulin Glo-3A have been studied in type 1 diabetes, and may be a marker of altered mucosal barrier and/or immune function. In the present study, we investigated antibody responses to Glo-3A in CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young, children were studied prospectively from birth for the appearance of TTG and CD. Fifty cases of CD were frequency matched with 50 controls on age (of TTG seroconversion in the case), sex, ethnicity, presence of a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes mellitus, and human leukocyte antigen -DR3 genotype. In cases and controls, IgG antibodies to Glo-3A were analyzed in a blinded manner in the sample collected at the time of seroconversion to TTG positivity (or the matched sample in controls) and in all of the previous samples since birth (mean 4.5 samples). The association between Glo-3A antibody levels and CD case status was explored using t tests at the TTG-positive visit and when Glo-3A levels were highest, and mixed modeling to describe Glo-3A over time. RESULTS: At the time of first elevated TTG (mean 4.9 years), patients with CD had higher Glo-3A antibody levels than controls (13.3 +/- 17.2 vs 7.6 +/- 11.7, P = 0.005). In both cases and controls, Glo-3A antibodies appear to peak at a mean age of 2.9 years, before mean age of initial TTG seroconversion. The peak Glo-3A antibody levels were higher in cases than controls (25.5 +/- 21.8 vs 14.9 +/- 18.3 P = 0.0007). Using mixed modeling to account for multiple visits per person, cases had higher levels of Glo-3A antibodies than controls at all ages from birth to TTG seroconversion (beta = 0.53, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls, CD cases have higher Glo-3A antibody responses in the beginning years, before initial detection of TTG.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is an under-diagnosed and often misunderstood disease, yet is one of the most common food intolerance disorders. The only treatment available to prevent the health impacts of CD is a lifelong, strict gluten-free diet (GFD). There are few studies that explore the experiences of diagnosis and the everyday experiences of living with this chronic condition. METHODS: Utilising a qualitative study design, and purposive sampling, the present study describes the experiences of 10 women with coeliac disease in Victoria, Australia. Individual interviews were conducted with women aged between 31 and 60 years who had been diagnosed with CD for at least 2 years. RESULTS: A thematic analysis of the interview transcripts highlighted a number of issues for those living with the disease. Reactions to diagnosis, transition to a GFD and the changes needed to live with CD are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: A range of recommendations including the need to increase CD awareness and education and further research on the impacts of living with the disease are made.},

This study was planned to assess the prevalence of CD in the family members of index cases by serological screening. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 50 children diagnosed to be having CD. Serological screening of the family members of index cases was done and those showing positivity for the screening tests were further subjected to endoscopic duodenal biopsy for histopathological examination. RESULTS: A total of 164 members of 50 celiac families were initially screened for antibodies. Antibody picked up 32.9% by IgG anti-gliadin (AGA), 20.7% by endomysial antibody, 19.5% by tissue transglutaminase and 14.6% IgA AGA as seropositive for CD. Endoscopic findings characteristics for CD were present in only eight family members. CONCLUSION: Family members of CD cases represent potential cases of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an immunologic enteropathy triggered by the intake of gluten. It is thought that the enteropathy impairs gut function and absorption. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the zinc-absorption capacity and small-bowel integrity in children with CD. DESIGN: Children in whom a diagnosis of CD was considered clinically and either confirmed (n = 16; Marsh score >/=3) or not (n = 22; Marsh score of 0) with a small-bowel biopsy (SBB) were recruited. The fractional absorption of zinc (FAZ) was determined by the administration of an oral (67)Zn dose (2.5 mg) and an intravenous (70)Zn dose (0.2 mg) 2 h before and during the SBB, respectively. Spot urine samples were collected, and zinc isotopic ratios were determined by ion-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Gut health was assessed by the ingestion of (13)C-sucrose (20 g) after an overnight fast, and breath samples were collected and analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. RESULTS: There was no difference in FAZ between children with a Marsh score >/=3 (mean +/- SEM: 0.68 +/- 0.05) and children with a Marsh score of 0 (0.74 +/- 0.05). The exchangeable zinc pool (EZP) was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in children with a Marsh score >/=3 (2.6 +/- 0.8 mg/kg) than in children with a Marsh score of 0 (3.8 +/- 1.4 mg/kg). Gut function in children with a Marsh score >/=3 (4.5 +/- 0.7% cumulative dose recovered at 90 min) was lower than the lower cutoff of a normal gut-function breath test (5.06% cumulative dose recovered at 90 min) but not significantly different from that in children with a Marsh score of 0 (4.9 +/- 0.4%). There was a significant (P < 0.01) correlation between zinc absorption and gut function in children with CD. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc absorption did not appear below usual amounts in subjects with CD. Children with CD have impaired gut function that may affect their zinc nutritional status as shown by a smaller EZP. However, the EZP decrease in children with CD was not compared with that in healthy control subjects, and its biological meaning is uncertain.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition proposed guidelines for the diagnosis of celiac disease, stating that duodenal biopsy is no longer needed if patients have symptoms and levels of immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase (IgA anti-tTG) more than 10-fold the cut-off value. We evaluated the accuracy of this guideline in a well-characterized population using different commercial assays. METHODS: We analyzed levels of IgA anti-tTG in serum samples from 104 consecutive pediatric and adult patients who were not deficient in IgA and were diagnosed with celiac disease from August 1, 2000, to December 31, 2009. We also analyzed serum samples from 537 consecutive patients without celiac disease (controls), collected from May 1, 2004, to October 12, 2006, who underwent intestinal biopsy analysis. Serum levels of antibodies were quantified using assays from Bio-Rad, INOVA, Genesis, and Thermo Fisher. RESULTS: The likelihood ratio (probability of a specific result in patients divided by the probability of the same result in controls) for celiac disease increased with levels of IgA anti-tTG in all assays. Depending on the assay, the likelihood ratio for levels greater than 10-fold the cut-off value ranged from 111 to 294. The percentage of patients with celiac disease with levels of IgA anti-tTG greater than 10-fold the cut-off value ranged from 41% to 61%, depending on the assay. For levels of anti-tTG greater than 10-fold the cut-off value, the post-test probabilities for celiac disease (probability of disease, based on pretest probability and test result) were, depending on the assay, 89%-96% and 53%-75% for pretest probabilities (probability of disease depending on symptoms) of 7% and 1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: To diagnose celiac disease based on serologic factors, it might be best to define thresholds for levels of IgA anti-tTG based on a predefined likelihood ratio or post-test probability, instead of a multiple of a cut-off value. Patients with a high pretest probability and levels of anti-tTG greater than 10-fold the cut-off value have a high probability for having celiac disease, aiding clinical decision making.},

   abstract = {Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a potent regulator of visceral functions as a consequence of its actions on vago-vagal reflex circuit elements. This paper addresses three current controversies regarding the role of CCK to control gastric function via vago-vagal reflexes. Specifically: (a) whether CNS vs. peripheral (vagal afferent) receptors are dominant, (b) whether the long (58) vs. short (8) isoform is more potent and (c) whether nutritional status impacts the gain or even the direction of vago-vagal reflexes. Our in vivo recordings of physiologically identified gastric vagal motor neurones (gastric-DMN) involved in the gastric accommodation reflex (GAR) show unequivocally that: (a) receptors in the coeliac-portal circulation are more sensitive in amplifying gastric vagal reflexes; (b) in the periphery, CCK8 is more potent than CCK58; and (c) the nutritional status has a marginal effect on gastric reflex control. While the GAR reflex is more sensitive in the fasted rat, CCK amplifies this sensitivity. Thus, our results are in stark contrast to recent reports which have suggested that vago-vagal reflexes are inverted by the metabolic status of the animal and that this inversion could be mediated by CCK within the CNS.},

Vitamin D deficiency has been described in autoimmune diseases, but its status in prepubertal children with CD has not been adequately studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine the vitamin D status of prepubertal children with CD. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of prepubertal children aged 3-12 years with CD (n=24) who were compared to prepubertal, non-CD children of the same age (n=50). Children were included in the study if they had a diagnosis of CD by intestinal biopsy, and were not on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Patients were excluded if they had diseases of calcium or vitamin D metabolism, or were receiving calcium or vitamin D supplementation or had other autoimmune diseases. All subjects had their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level measured. RESULTS: There was no difference in 25(OH)D level between the CD and non-CD children (27.58 +/- 9.91 versus 26.20 +/- 10.45, p = 0.59). However, when the patients were subdivided into obese and non-obese groups, the non-obese CD patients had a significantly higher 25(OH)D level than the obese normal children (28.39 +/- 10.26 versus 21.58 +/- 5.67, p = 0.009). In contrast, there was no difference in 25(OH)D level between non-obese CD patients and non-obese normal children (28.39 +/- 10.26 versus 30.64 +/-12.08, p = 0.52). The season of 25(OH)D measurement was not a significant confounder (p =0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The cytosolic phospolypase A(2) (cPLA(2)) - dependent release of arachidonic acid (AA) from the intra-epithelial lymphocytes plays a pivotal role in arming lymphocytes to cytolysis in the immune response of celiac disease. However, little is known about the role of enterocytes in releasing AA. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid that counteracts many of the proinflammatory effect of AA. The aims of the present work were to evaluate if: 1) intestinal epithelial cells have a role in the celiac inflammation, releasing AA, and 2) if DHA is able to modulate the celiac inflammation, down-regulating the release of AA. METHODS: A human intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco-2) was exposed to gliadin peptides (PT-gl) (500 mug/ml) and DHA (2 mug/ml), both alone and simultaneously up to 24 h. RESULTS: The exposure of those cells to PT-gl alone resulted in an increased AA release, cycloxygenase-2 expression, cPLA(2) activity and prostaglandin E(2) and interleukin-8 release in culture medium, whereas the simultaneous exposure of the cells to DHA and PT-gl prevented the above-mentioned increases. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that intestinal epithelial cells sustain the celiac inflammation, releasing AA when stimulated with gliadin and that DHA inhibits the AA release by these cells.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of celiac disease among type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients is 5-10 times higher than in the general population. Thus, evaluation of celiac serology is indicated at diagnosis of T1DM and on follow up. AIM: This study was prompted by the observation that elevated anti-TTG antibody levels in diabetic children may spontaneously normalize despite continued consumption of gluten. The objective of the study was to investigate the prevalence of this phenomenon and associated factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The files of all children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus from 2003-2009 at a tertiary pediatric medical center were reviewed for those with elevated serum levels of anti-TTG antibody. Clinical, medical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected. Findings were compared between patients diagnosed with celiac disease and patients with initially elevated anti-TTG antibody levels that spontaneously normalized. RESULTS: Forty-eight of the 738 patients with type 1 diabetes attending our center (6.5%) had elevated anti-TTG antibody blood levels. Celiac disease was diagnosed in 23, and anti-TTG antibody levels normalized in 17 (35.4%), all of whom consumed gluten. At one-year follow-up, there was no significant difference between the groups in HbA1c level or change in anthropometric measurements. CONCLUSION: Physicians treating children with type 1 diabetes and mildly elevated anti-TTG antibody levels might consider 12-month serologic follow-up on a gluten-containing diet rather than immediate duodenal biopsy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In a Swedish celiac disease screening study (Exploring the Iceberg of Celiacs in Sweden), we systematically reviewed the clinical diagnostic procedures with the aim to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and to take advantage of lessons learned for improving diagnostic routines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A school-based celiac disease screening study involving 5 Swedish centers, with 10,041 invited 12-year-olds with 7567 consenting participation. All 192 children with elevated serological markers were recommended to undergo small-bowel biopsy, performed and evaluated according to local clinical routines. All of the mucosal specimens were reevaluated by 1 and, when needed, 2 expert pathologists to reach diagnostic consensus. RESULTS: Small-bowel biopsies were performed in 184 children: 130 by endoscopy and 54 by suction capsule. Endoscopic biopsies were inconclusive in 0.6%, compared with 7.4% of biopsies by suction capsule. A patchy enteropathy was found in 9.1%. Reevaluation by the expert pathologist resulted in 6 additional cases with celiac disease and 1 cleared. Sixteen children with normal or inconclusive biopsies, 4 after endoscopy, and 12 after suction capsule were endoscopically rebiopsied, resulting in another 8 cases. The celiac disease prevalence of 30 of 1000 (95% confidence interval 26-34) was not statistically different from that previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: The present review revealed the importance of controlling each step of the diagnostic procedure. Several cases would have been missed by relying only on local routines. To improve the quality of childhood celiac disease diagnostics, we recommend multiple endoscopic biopsies from both proximal and distal duodenum and standardized evaluation by a pathologist with good knowledge of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To establish the incidence of childhood coeliac disease (CD) in Scotland between 1 September 2009 and 31 August 2010, to determine clinical features at presentation and reasons for diagnosis, and to identify any differences in incidence and practice between regions. DESIGN: Prospective data collection through the Scottish Paediatric Surveillance Unit (SPSU). Strategic contacts in each tertiary gastrointestinal region (East, West and North) were emailed monthly to report new cases of CD (<16 years). A clinical questionnaire was completed for each case. Additionally, regional laboratories were asked to report the number of diagnostic antibody tests for CD performed over the year. SETTING: This national study looked at the total cases within Scotland. Scotland has a population of 5.2 million, with the mid-year estimate in 2009 of 912 144 children under the age of 16. RESULTS: 91 new cases were reported, giving an overall adjusted incidence of 10.0/100 000/year. Incidence in the East was 16.3/100 000/year, West 8.1/100 000/year and North 7.7/100 000/year. Cases diagnosed due to active screening in the East (4.6/100 000/year) were more than twice the number observed in the West (2.0/100 000/year) and North (1.3/100 000/year), as was the incidence of classic cases. The most frequent symptoms reported were abdominal pain (50/91; 54.9%), failure to thrive (29/91; 31.9%), fatigue (29/91; 31.9%), diarrhoea (27/91; 29.7%) and bloating (19/91; 20.9%). Twenty-two children (24.2%) were diagnosed due to active screening, of which 14 had associated type 1 diabetes mellitus, one Down syndrome and seven had family history. Fifty-five per cent (12/22) of the patients diagnosed through active screening were asymptomatic. Significantly more CD diagnostic antibody tests were performed per head of population in the East compared with the West (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.57 to 1.73) and North (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.70 to 1.92). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately double the incidence of paediatric CD was observed in the East of Scotland. Evidence of more actively screened cases diagnosed and more antibody tests performed in the region suggests a lower threshold to test. An environmental influence cannot be dismissed since more classic cases were also captured. Further research is needed to highlight the role of any exogenous factors.},

The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of laparoscopic ischemic preconditioning of the stomach prior to thoracotomy, esophagectomy, and gastric pull-up with an intrathoracic anastomosis. A retrospective review of 24 consecutive patients between October 2008 and July 2011 with esophageal adenocarcinoma (stage I-III) undergoing laparoscopic gastric ischemic conditioning prior to esophagectomy was conducted. Conditioning included laparoscopic ligation of the left and short gastric arteries, celiac node dissection, and jejunostomy tube placement. Formal resection and reconstruction was then performed 4-10 days later. Of the 24 patients, 88% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiation therapy. Twenty-three of the 24 patients underwent successful laparoscopic ischemic conditioning and subsequent esophagectomy. Total mean number of lymph nodes harvested was 21.8 (+/-8.0), and a mean of 5.3 (+/-2.4) celiac lymph nodes identified. There were no conversions to an open procedure. Length of stay was 3.8 (+/-4.8) days with a median length of stay of 2 (1-24) days. Three patients experienced anastomotic leak, six patients experience delayed gastric emptying, and two patients developed anastomotic stricture. There were no surgical site infections. R0 resection was achieved in all patients who underwent laparoscopic ischemic conditioning followed by esophagectomy. Laparoscopic ischemic conditioning of the gastric conduit has been shown to be feasible and safe.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The gold standard for the diagnosis and evaluation of Crohn disease (CD) is endoscopy/colonoscopy, although this is invasive, costly, and associated with risks to the patient. Recently, circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising noninvasive biomarkers. Here, we examined the utility of serum miRNAs as biomarkers of CD in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Studies were conducted using sera samples from patients with pediatric CD, healthy controls, and a comparison group of patients with pediatric celiac disease. Serum miRNA levels were explored initially using a microfluidic quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction array platform. Findings were subsequently validated using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in larger validation sample sets. The diagnostic utility of CD-associated serum miRNA was examined using receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: A survey of miRNA levels in the sera of control and patients with CD detected significant elevation of 24 miRNAs, 11 of which were chosen for further validation. All of the candidate biomarker miRNAs were confirmed in an independent CD sample set (n = 46). To explore the specificity of the CD-associated miRNAs, they were measured in the sera of patients with celiac disease (n = 12); none were changed compared with healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that serum miRNAs have promising diagnostic utility, with sensitivities for CD above 80%. Significant decreases in serum miRNAs were observed in 24 incident patients with pediatric CD after 6 months of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present study identifies 11 CD-associated serum miRNA with encouraging diagnostic potential. Our findings suggest serum miRNAs may prove useful as noninvasive biomarkers in CD.},

There was no significant difference between the modified and the standard samples in terms of appearance, aroma, flavor, and overall quality. The modified pastas presented approximately 98% less lipids. Green bananas are considered a subproduct of low commercial value with little industrial use. The possibility of developing gluten-free products with green banana flour can expand the product supply for people with celiac disease and contribute to a more diverse diet.},

Currently, the only therapy able to normalize the clinical and histological manifestation of the disease is a strict and life-long gluten-free (GF) diet. The replacement of gluten presents a significant technological challenge, as it is an essential structure-building protein, which is necessary for formulating high-quality baked goods. The objective of this paper is to review some basics about CD, its current prevalence, and the recent advances in the preparation of high-quality GF breads using GF flours, starches, hydrocolloids, gums, and novel functional ingredients and technologies.},

   abstract = {A gluten-free (GF) diet is recognised as being the only accepted treatment for celiac disease-a permanent autoimmune enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals. The bakery products available in today's gluten-free market are characterised by lower palatability than their conventional counterparts and may lead to nutritional deficiencies of vitamins, minerals and fibre. Thus, the production of high-quality gluten-free products has become a very important socioeconomical issue. Microbial fermentation by means of lactic acid bacteria and yeast is one of the most ecological/economical methods of producing and preserving food. In this review, the role of a fermentation process for improving the quality of GF products and for developing a new concept of GF products with nutraceutical and health-promoting characteristics will be examined.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is the only treatment for coeliac disease. The gluten-free diet is complex, costly and impacts on all activities involving food, making it difficult to maintain for a lifetime. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the difficulties experienced, the strategies used and the emotional impact of following a gluten-free diet among Canadians with coeliac disease. METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to all members (n = 10 693) of both the Canadian Celiac Association and the Fondation quebecoise de la maladie coeliaque in 2008. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 72%. Results are presented for the 5912 respondents (>/=18 years) reporting biopsy-confirmed coeliac disease and/or dermatitis herpetiformis. Two-thirds never intentionally consumed gluten. Women reported significantly greater emotional responses to a gluten-free diet but, with time, were more accepting of it than men. Difficulties and negative emotions were experienced less frequently by those on the diet for >5 years, although food labelling and eating away from home remained very problematic. Frustration and isolation because of the diet were the most common negative emotions experienced. CONCLUSIONS: The present study quantifies the difficulties experienced, the strategies used and the emotional impact of following a gluten-free diet. It highlights the need to improve the training and education of dietitians, other health providers and the food service industry workers about coeliac disease and a gluten-free diet, with the aim of better helping individuals improve their adherence to a gluten-free diet and their quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an enteropathy triggered by dietary gluten found in wheat, barley, and rye. The current treatment is a strict gluten-free diet. Quinoa is a highly nutritive plant from the Andes, with low concentrations of prolamins, that has been recommended as part of a gluten-free diet; however, few experimental data support this recommendation. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the amount of celiac-toxic prolamin epitopes in quinoa cultivars from different regions of the Andes and the ability of these epitopes to activate immune responses in patients with celiac disease. DESIGN: The concentration of celiac-toxic epitopes was measured by using murine monoclonal antibodies against gliadin and high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits. Immune response was assessed by proliferation assays of celiac small intestinal T cells/interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and production of IFN-gamma/IL-15 after organ culture of celiac duodenal biopsy samples. RESULTS: Fifteen quinoa cultivars were tested: 4 cultivars had quantifiable concentrations of celiac-toxic epitopes, but they were below the maximum permitted for a gluten-free food. Cultivars Ayacuchana and Pasankalla stimulated T cell lines at levels similar to those for gliadin and caused secretion of cytokines from cultured biopsy samples at levels comparable with those for gliadin. CONCLUSIONS: Most quinoa cultivars do not possess quantifiable amounts of celiac-toxic epitopes. However, 2 cultivars had celiac-toxic epitopes that could activate the adaptive and innate immune responses in some patients with celiac disease. These findings require further investigation in the form of in vivo studies, because quinoa is an important source of nutrients for patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease affects about 1% of the European and North American population. The classical clinical presentation is with symptoms of malabsorption. Serologic studies demonstrate that most celiac patients present with oligosymptomatic (silent), latent, potential, and extraintestinal forms. The disease is defined as an immune-mediated systemic disorder of genetically disposed individuals (HLA-DQ2/8) induced by the alcohol-soluble fractions of cereals and characterized by gluten-dependent symptoms, celiac-specific antibodies (against tissue transglutaminase 2), and a Marsh 2-3 enteropathy. In the last 60 years, a strict and lifelong gluten-free diet has been demonstrated to be effective and safe, preventing most potential complications of the disease, including autoimmune disease, osteoporosis, infertility, prematurity, and malignancy. Among patients with celiac disease, the toxicity of oats seems to be less than wheat, barley, and rye. The introduction of oats into the diet of patients with celiac disease should increase taste, fiber content, diversity, compliance with the diet, and quality of life. The clinical studies provide limited results in favor of a general harmlessness of oats for celiac disease patients. Patients with celiac disease who consume oats (20-25 g/d for children, 50-70 g/d for adults) need proper follow-up.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only therapeutic option; however, it may contribute to the consumption of an unbalanced diet. The present study aimed to evaluate the dietary intake of CD affected children on a GFD and compare it with non-celiac children and with Italian nutritional intakes recommendations, as well as evaluate the contribution of commercially available gluten-free products (GFPs). METHODS: Eighteen celiac children, median age 7.6 years, median GFD duration 4.2 years, and 18 non-celiac controls, were enrolled in a cross-sectional age-matched study. Dietary intakes of both groups were collected using a food frequency questionnaire and a 24-hour dietary recall. Nutritional intakes were compared between the group and controls and with Italian dietary reference values. The contribution of GFPs to energy and macronutrient intakes was evaluated. RESULTS: Median energy intake was significantly higher in CD patients than in controls (8961.8 and 5761.0 kJ day(-1); P < 0.001). CD subjects showed higher carbohydrate intakes and lower fat intakes compared to controls. Protein-derived energy did not differ. By contrast to control subjects, energy derived from carbohydrate intakes in CD children met the Italian recommendations. Both children groups showed higher protein and fat intakes than recommended in Italy. GFPs consumption accounted for 36.3% of daily total energy intake. CONCLUSIONS: Intakes of simple sugars, fats and protein exceeded the National recommendations for health. Children with CD had significantly higher energy intakes than controls, although body mass index was comparable across the groups. Lack of nutritional information for GFPs prevented complete dietary analysis of subfractions of fat and micronutrient intakes. This aspect need to be addressed if studies in this field are to be meaningful in the future.},
