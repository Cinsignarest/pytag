   abstract = {UNLABELLED: This report from the Medical Advisory Secretariat (MAS) was intended to evaluate the clinical utility of vitamin D testing in average risk Canadians and in those with kidney disease. As a separate analysis, this report also includes a systematic literature review of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in these two subgroups.This evaluation did not set out to determine the serum vitamin D thresholds that might apply to non-bone health outcomes. For bone health outcomes, no high or moderate quality evidence could be found to support a target serum level above 50 nmol/L. Similarly, no high or moderate quality evidence could be found to support vitamin D's effects in non-bone health outcomes, other than falls. VITAMIN D: Vitamin D is a lipid soluble vitamin that acts as a hormone. It stimulates intestinal calcium absorption and is important in maintaining adequate phosphate levels for bone mineralization, bone growth, and remodelling. It's also believed to be involved in the regulation of cell growth proliferation and apoptosis (programmed cell death), as well as modulation of the immune system and other functions. Alone or in combination with calcium, Vitamin D has also been shown to reduce the risk of fractures in elderly men (>/= 65 years), postmenopausal women, and the risk of falls in community-dwelling seniors. However, in a comprehensive systematic review, inconsistent results were found concerning the effects of vitamin D in conditions such as cancer, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular disease. In fact, no high or moderate quality evidence could be found concerning the effects of vitamin D in such non-bone health outcomes. Given the uncertainties surrounding the effects of vitamin D in non-bone health related outcomes, it was decided that this evaluation should focus on falls and the effects of vitamin D in bone health and exclusively within average-risk individuals and patients with kidney disease. Synthesis of vitamin D occurs naturally in the skin through exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from sunlight, but it can also be obtained from dietary sources including fortified foods, and supplements. Foods rich in vitamin D include fatty fish, egg yolks, fish liver oil, and some types of mushrooms. Since it is usually difficult to obtain sufficient vitamin D from non-fortified foods, either due to low content or infrequent use, most vitamin D is obtained from fortified foods, exposure to sunlight, and supplements. CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION Vitamin D deficiency may lead to rickets in infants and osteomalacia in adults. Factors believed to be associated with vitamin D deficiency include: darker skin pigmentation,winter season,living at higher latitudes,skin coverage,kidney disease,malabsorption syndromes such as Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, andgenetic factors.Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency due to either renal losses or decreased synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Health Canada currently recommends that, until the daily recommended intakes (DRI) for vitamin D are updated, Canada's Food Guide (Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide) should be followed with respect to vitamin D intake. Issued in 2007, the Guide recommends that Canadians consume two cups (500 ml) of fortified milk or fortified soy beverages daily in order to obtain a daily intake of 200 IU. In addition, men and women over the age of 50 should take 400 IU of vitamin D supplements daily. Additional recommendations were made for breastfed infants. A Canadian survey evaluated the median vitamin D intake derived from diet alone (excluding supplements) among 35,000 Canadians, 10,900 of which were from Ontario. Among Ontarian males ages 9 and up, the median daily dietary vitamin D intake ranged between 196 IU and 272 IU per day. Among females, it varied from 152 IU to 196 IU per day. In boys and girls ages 1 to 3, the median daily dietary vitamin D intake was 248 IU, while among those 4 to 8 years it was 224 IU. VITAMIN D TESTING: Two laboratory tests for vitamin D are available, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, referred to as 25(OH)D, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Vitamin D status is assessed by measuring the serum 25(OH)D levels, which can be assayed using radioimmunoassays, competitive protein-binding assays (CPBA), high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). These may yield different results with inter-assay variation reaching up to 25% (at lower serum levels) and intra-assay variation reaching 10%. The optimal serum concentration of vitamin D has not been established and it may change across different stages of life. Similarly, there is currently no consensus on target serum vitamin D levels. There does, however, appear to be a consensus on the definition of vitamin D deficiency at 25(OH)D < 25 nmol/l, which is based on the risk of diseases such as rickets and osteomalacia. Higher target serum levels have also been proposed based on subclinical endpoints such as parathyroid hormone (PTH). Therefore, in this report, two conservative target serum levels have been adopted, 25 nmol/L (based on the risk of rickets and osteomalacia), and 40 to 50 nmol/L (based on vitamin D's interaction with PTH). ONTARIO CONTEXT: VOLUME #ENTITYSTARTX00026; COST: The volume of vitamin D tests done in Ontario has been increasing over the past 5 years with a steep increase of 169,000 tests in 2007 to more than 393,400 tests in 2008. The number of tests continues to rise with the projected number of tests for 2009 exceeding 731,000. According to the Ontario Schedule of Benefits, the billing cost of each test is $51.7 for 25(OH)D (L606, 100 LMS units, $0.517/unit) and $77.6 for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (L605, 150 LMS units, $0.517/unit). Province wide, the total annual cost of vitamin D testing has increased from approximately $1.7M in 2004 to over $21.0M in 2008. The projected annual cost for 2009 is approximately $38.8M. EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS: The objective of this report is to evaluate the clinical utility of vitamin D testing in the average risk population and in those with kidney disease. As a separate analysis, the report also sought to evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Canada. The specific research questions addressed were thus: What is the clinical utility of vitamin D testing in the average risk population and in subjects with kidney disease?What is the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the average risk population in Canada?What is the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with kidney disease in Canada?Clinical utility was defined as the ability to improve bone health outcomes with the focus on the average risk population (excluding those with osteoporosis) and patients with kidney disease. LITERATURE SEARCH: A literature search was performed on July 17th, 2009 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1, 1998 until July 17th, 2009. Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer and, for those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles with unknown eligibility were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist, then a group of epidemiologists until consensus was established. The quality of evidence was assessed as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE methodology. Observational studies that evaluated the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Canada in the population of interest were included based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below. The baseline values were used in this report in the case of interventional studies that evaluated the effect of vitamin D intake on serum levels. Studies published in grey literature were included if no studies published in the peer-reviewed literature were identified for specific outcomes or subgroups. Considering that vitamin D status may be affected by factors such as latitude, sun exposure, food fortification, among others, the search focused on prevalence studies published in Canada. In cases where no Canadian prevalence studies were identified, the decision was made to include studies from the United States, given the similar policies in vitamin D food fortification and recommended daily intake. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies published in EnglishPublications that reported the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in CanadaStudies that included subjects from the general population or with kidney diseaseStudies in children or adultsStudies published between January 1998 and July 17(th) 2009 EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies that included subjects defined according to a specific disease other than kidney diseaseLetters, comments, and editorialsStudies that measured the serum vitamin D levels but did not report the percentage of subjects with serum levels below a given threshold OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: Prevalence of serum vitamin D less than 25 nmol/LPrevalence of serum vitamin D less than 40 to 50 nmol/LSerum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was the metabolite used to assess vitamin D status. Results from adult and children studies were reported separately. Subgroup analyses according to factors that affect serum vitamin D levels (e.g., seasonal effects, skin pigmentation, and vitamin D intake) were reported if enough information was provided in the studies QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: The quality of the prevalence studies was based on the method of subject recruitment and sampling, possibility of selection bias, and generalizability to the source population. The overall quality of the trials was examined according to the GRADE Working Group criteria. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses are powerful tools to assess the diversity of complex microbiota. T-RFLPs permit rapid comparisons of microbiota from many samples. AIM: To perform T-RFLP analyses of faecal microbiota in Crohn's disease (CD) patients to investigate potential alterations in faecal microbial communities and furthermore to analyse the effects of elemental diet on faecal microbiota profiles. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with CD and 30 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. DNA was extracted from stool samples and 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR. PCR products were digested with BslI restriction enzymes and T-RF lengths were determined. RESULTS: Faecal microbial communities were classified into seven clusters. Almost all healthy individuals (28/30) were included in cluster I, II and III, but the majority of CD patients (25/34) could be divided into another four clusters (cluster IV-VII). Prediction of bacteria based on the BslI-digested T-RFLP database showed a significant decrease in Clostridium cluster IV, Clostridium cluster XI and subcluster XIVa in CD patients. In contrast, Bacteroides significantly increased in CD patients. Significant increases in Enterobacteriales were also observed in CD patients. Furthermore, elemental diets modulated faecal bacterial communities in CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses showed that the diversity of faecal microbiota in patients with CD differed from that of healthy individuals. Furthermore, elemental diets modulated faecal microbiota composition, and this effect may be involved in mechanisms of clinical effects of elemental diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Elemental diet (ED) is effective for human Crohn's disease (CD). Although some of this effectiveness may be due to its low antigenic load and low fat content, the mechanisms remain unclear. We sought to assess the role of histidine, one of the constituent amino acids of ED, in controlling colitis. METHODS: The interleukin (IL)-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) cell transfer model of colitis was used. SCID mice with colitis induced by transfer of IL-10(-/-) cells were maintained on experimented diets containing either single amino acids or a mixture. The severity of colitis was assessed by wet colon weight. Colonic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS), with or without amino acids. The concentration of cytokines in the supernatant was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-alpha and nuclear p65 were confirmed by immunoblotting. RESULTS: In the IL-10(-/-) transfer model, dietary histidine, but not alanine, reduced histologic damage and colon weight and TNF-alpha mRNA expression. Histidine inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 production by mouse macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas alanine or histidine-related metabolites had no such effect. Histidine inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappaB in macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that histidine could be a novel therapeutic agent for CD by inhibition of NF-kappaB activation, following down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages. Thus, our studies provided new insights into the roles of amino acid metabolism in the pathophysiology of CD and for therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {The inappropriate immune response to foods, such as peanut, wheat and milk may be the basis in the pathogenesis of enteropathies like coeliac and Crohn disease, which present small intestinal malabsorption. A number of recent studies have utilized d-xylose absorption as an investigative tool to study small intestinal function in a variety of clinical settings. Thus, the aim of this experimental study was to evaluate the intestinal absorption of D-xylose in an antigen-specific gut inflammatory reaction rat model. Animals of the experimental group were inoculated with peanut protein extract before their exposure to a challenge diet containing exclusively peanut seeds to induce the gut inflammatory reaction caused by peanut allergy. Our results show that systemic inoculation with peanut protein extract renders significantly higher antibody titres (5.085 +/- 0.126 units) (P < 0.0001) than control rats (0.905 +/- 0.053 units) and that the antibody titres correlate positively to an inflammatory alteration of the gut morphology (P < 0.0001). Animals pertaining to the experimental group showed an intestinal absorption of D-xylose lower than control rats (P < 0.0001). We also observed that D-xylose absorption correlates negatively with IgG titres and positively with morphometric parameters (Pearson correlation). In conclusion, the use of serum D-xylose test was useful to identify the presence of small intestinal malabsorption in our antigen specific gut inflammatory reaction rat model.},

Some nutrients could induce a low antigenic stimuli, regulate inflammatory and immunological responses and stimulate intestinal mucosal trophism. Present available evidence supports enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease as a primary treatment if treatment with steroids is not possible (failure or contraindication) (grade of recommendation A) or either combined treatment with drugs in malnourished patients or those with inflammatory bowel stenosis. In those patients with sustained clinical remission, no benefit of either enteral nutrition or supplements in the absence of nutritional deficits has been shown. Elemental or modified formula (glutamine, omega 3 fatty acids) could not be recommended. In ulcerative colitis, nutritional influence over the activity of the disease has not been shown, although there are some promising results regarding enteric coated W3 fatty acids and a possible role for probiotics. In the treatment and prevention of pouchitis, there could be a role for probiotics (VSL#3). Nutritional treatment should be considered an integral component in the Management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex and probably multifactorial. Nutrition has been proposed to be an important aetiological factor for development of IBD. Several components of the diet (such as sugar, fat, fibre, fruit and vegetable, protein, fast food, preservatives etc.) were examined as possible causative agents for IBD. According to some researchers infant feeding (breast feeding) may also contribute to the development of IBD. Though the importance of environmental factors is evidenced by the increasing incidence in developed countries and in migrant population in recent decades, the aetiology of IBD remained unclear. There are many theories, but as yet no dietary approaches have been proved to reduce the risk of developing IBD. The role of nutrition in the management of IBD is better understood. The prevention and correction of malnutrition, the provision of macro- and micronutrients and vitamins and the promotion of optimal growth and development of children are key points of nutritional therapy. In active disease, the effective support of energy and nutrients is a very important part of the therapy. Natural and artificial nutrition or the combination of two can be chosen for supporting therapy of IBD. The author summarises the aetiological and therapeutic role of nutrition in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fermentable, short chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) have been identified as triggers for functional gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition, excess FODMAP consumption has been implicated in the onset of Crohn's disease, and animal studies suggest that a low glycemic index diet can impair absorption of fructose, a major dietary FODMAP. Such hypotheses cannot be tested without the ability to quantify FODMAP ingestion with a validated dietary assessment tool. OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity and reproducibility of a 297-item comprehensive, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in estimating intake of macro- and micronutrients, FODMAPs, and glycemic index/load. SUBJECTS/SETTING: One hundred healthy participants were recruited to complete the FFQ on two occasions, plus four 1-week food diaries kept during a 12-month period. Participants exhibiting major dietary change during the study period or low energy reporting on the FFQ were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Validation and reproducibility of the semi-quantitative FFQ by comparison with the mean of four 1-week food diaries. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Validation was assessed using Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman's correlation, Bland-Altman, and weighted kappa statistics. Reproducibility was examined using Shrout-Fleiss intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Seventy-two participants fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria. Demographics of the participants were comparable with 2006 Australian Census data. Consistent with other reported FFQs, the FFQ overestimated nutrient intake by a mean 140% (range=95% to 249%). However, based on the other analyses performed, it demonstrated validity for intake of sugars, fiber, alcohol, glycemic index, glucose, FODMAPs, calcium, folate, phosphate, potassium, iron, and magnesium; moderate validation for energy, total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, sodium, thiamin, sucrose, and retinol; poor validation for protein, mono/polyunsaturated fat, starch, glycemic load, niacin, and zinc. Riboflavin intake was not validated. Intraclass correlation coefficients for reproducibility ranged from 0.352 to 0.928. CONCLUSIONS: The FFQ was validated for assessment of a wide range of nutrients, including the new class of carbohydrates, FODMAPs, and glycemic index. This provides a useful tool for dietary research, particularly in the area of gastroenterological disorders.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating and widespread immune-mediated illness of unknown etiology. Current treatments are modestly successful and with significant side-effects. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current understanding of mechanisms of action underlying the anti-inflammatory actions of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in IBD. RECENT FINDINGS: Nutrition-based interventions that target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) such as dietary CLA and n-3 PUFA have demonstrated anti-inflammatory efficacy in animal models of IBD. Clinical data on n-3 PUFA in IBD remains generally unimpressive, although results of a recent human study demonstrate that IBD remission can be maintained by maintaining the n-3: n-6 ratio more than 0.65 via n-3 PUFA intervention. In mice, CLA prevented inflammation-driven colorectal cancer by activating PPAR gamma and modulating regulatory T cells and macrophages. CLA is the subject of an ongoing clinical study in Crohn's disease patients. SUMMARY: Compelling evidence demonstrates that n-3 PUFA and CLA prevent or ameliorate IBD in animal models. However, this basic knowledge has not been translated into novel nutrition-based clinical interventions. For both compounds there is an urgent need for placebo-controlled, large-scale, multicenter clinical trials.},

   abstract = {While the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still increasing, the etiology has not finally been dissected. The main hypothesis suggests that the mucosal immune system is hyperresponsive to dietary factors and commensal bacteria in genetically predisposed individuals. Burrill Crohn himself described a local hypertrophy of the mesenteric fat tissue adjacent to the segments of inflamed intestine. In addition, more recent data indicate altered local expression and serum levels of some adipocyte-derived mediators (adipokines) with immune-modulating capacities in IBD. This review focuses on the role of adipose tissue and adipokines in the immune system, with particular focus on the mucosal immune system. The available data will serve to establish a working hypothesis on how the mesenteric fat tissue contributes to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reports of an increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders in patients receiving thiopurines for inflammatory bowel disease are controversial. We assessed this risk in a prospective observational cohort study. METHODS: 19,486 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, of whom 11,759 (60.3%) had Crohn's disease and 7727 (39.7%) had ulcerative colitis or unclassified inflammatory bowel disease, were enrolled in a nationwide French cohort by 680 gastroenterologists, who reported details of immunosuppressive therapy during the observation period, cases of cancer, and deaths. The risk of lymphoproliferative disorder was assessed according to thiopurine exposure. Median follow-up was 35 months (IQR 29-40). FINDINGS: At baseline, 5867 (30.1%) of patients were receiving, 2809 (14.4%) had discontinued, and 10,810 (55.5%) had never received thiopurines. 23 new cases of lymphoproliferative disorder were diagnosed, consisting of one case of Hodgkin's lymphoma and 22 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoproliferative disorder. The incidence rates of lymphoproliferative disorder were 0.90 per 1000 (95% CI 0.50-1.49) patient-years in those receiving, 0.20/1000 (0.02-0.72) patient-years in those who had discontinued, and 0.26/1000 (0.10-0.57) patient-years in those who had never received thiopurines (p=0.0054). The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio of lymphoproliferative disorder between patients receiving thiopurines and those who had never received the drugs was 5.28 (2.01-13.9, p=0.0007). Most cases associated with thiopurine exposure matched the pathological range of post-transplant disease. INTERPRETATION: Patients receiving thiopurines for inflammatory bowel disease have an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders.

   abstract = {Crohn's disease results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors that trigger an inappropriate immune response to commensal gut bacteria. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is well known for its involvement in the toxicity of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), an environmental contaminant that affects people primarily through the diet. Recently, TCDD was shown to suppress immune responses by generating regulatory T cells (Tregs). We hypothesized that AhR activation dampens inflammation associated with Crohn's disease. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) murine model of colitis. Mice were gavaged with TCDD prior to colitis induction with TNBS. Several parameters were examined including colonic inflammation via histological and flow cytometric analyses. TCDD-treated mice recovered body weight faster and experienced significantly less colonic damage. Reduced levels of interleukin (IL) 6, IL-12, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha demonstrated suppression of inflammation in the gut following TCDD exposure. Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)(egfp) mice revealed that TCDD increased the Foxp3+ Treg population in gut immune tissue following TNBS exposure. Collectively, these results suggest that activation of the AhR by TCDD decreases colonic inflammation in a murine model of colitis in part by generating regulatory immune cells. Ultimately, this work may lead to the development of more effective therapeutics for the treatment of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental factors are thought to play an important role in the development of Crohn's disease (CD). Immune responses against auto-antigens or food antigens may be a reason for the perpetuation of inflammation. METHODS: In a pilot study, 79 CD patients and 20 healthy controls were examined for food immunoglobulin G (IgG). Thereafter, the clinical relevance of these food IgG antibodies was assessed in a double-blind cross-over study with 40 patients. Based on the IgG antibodies, a nutritional intervention was planned. The interferon (IFN)gamma secretion of T cells was measured. Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin was quantified in stool. RESULTS: The pilot study resulted in a significant difference of IgG antibodies in serum between CD patients and healthy controls. In 84 and 83% of the patients, respectively, IgG antibodies against processed cheese and yeast were detected. The daily stool frequency significantly decreased by 11% during a specific diet compared with a sham diet. Abdominal pain reduced and general well-being improved. IFNgamma secretion of T cells increased. No difference for eosinophil-derived neurotoxin in stool was detected. CONCLUSION: A nutritional intervention based on circulating IgG antibodies against food antigens showed effects with respect to stool frequency. The mechanisms by which IgG antibodies might contribute to disease activity remain to be elucidated.},

Our objective was to investigate the effect of dietary fibre exclusion and supplementation on the intestinal microbiota and SCFA concentrations. Faecal samples were obtained from healthy volunteers before and after two 14 d periods of consuming formulated diets devoid or supplemented with fibre (14 g/l). The faecal microbiota were analysed using fluorescent in situ hybridisation and SCFA were measured using GLC. There were large and statistically significant reductions in the numbers of the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P < or = 0.01) and Roseburia spp. (P < or = 0.01) groups during both the fibre-free and fibre-supplemented diets. Significant and strong positive correlations between the proportion of F. prausnitzii and the proportion of butyrate during both baseline normal diets were found (pre-fibre free r 0.881, P = 0.001; pre-fibre supplemented r 0.844, P = 0.002). A significant correlation was also found between the proportional reduction in F. prausnitzii and the proportional reduction in faecal butyrate during both the fibre-free (r 0.806; P = 0.005) and the fibre-supplemented diet (r 0.749; P = 0.013). These findings may contribute to the understanding of the association between fibre, microbiota and fermentation in health, during enteral nutrition and in disease states such as Crohn's disease.},

Epidemiologic studies present data on disease burden, but may also provide clues to disease etiology. The emergence of IBD in developing nations warrants a systematic search for environmental changes in those countries to explain the evolution of IBD. The hygiene hypothesis suggests that an alteration in the microbial environment experienced by the host facilitates the evolution of chronic immune-mediated diseases. One complex database study suggested that areas with high species richness of human intestinal helminthes are areas with genetic changes in interleukin gene loci. In other words, over the years, the microbial ecology has affected human genetics, which in turn would have an impact on immune responses. Other factors affect the gut microbiome, and several studies have explored the increase in incidence of IBD in relation to such factors as exogenous infections, use of antibiotics, and diet.},

   abstract = {Changing trends in the epidemiology of IBD provide an opportunity to examine possible etiological hypotheses. Why did IBD emerge in developed nations in the middle of the 20th century? Why did it emerge initially as ulcerative colitis but now Crohn's disease has become the predominate form of IBD in developed nations? Why is IBD emerging in recent years in developing nations and why is it that ulcerative colitis is the predominate form in these countries? In this chapter we will explore what is known about environmental issues that impact on disease presentation and where they provide opportunities for therapy. Managing smoking cessation in Crohn's disease is substantiated by evidence showing that smokers have a worse course of disease than non-smokers or than persons who quit smoking. Introducing nicotine to patients with ulcerative colitis has not brought the positive results anticipated with the widespread observation that smoking cessation was associated with flaring of this disease. Assessing and managing stress in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has emerged as an important consideration for clinicians caring for patients with IBD, especially for patients with active disease who may develop maladaptive coping mechanisms. Recent data suggest that stress may antedate flares. It is unknown what may induce changes in the gut flora of patients with IBD compared to controls. There are suggestions that antibiotic use in childhood and specific diets particularly those lower in omega-3 fatty acids may impact on disease presentation and the common mechanism may be through alteration of gut flora. For at-risk families (where there are affected family members) perhaps greater vigilance with antibiotic use in childhood and ensuring diets are higher in omega-3 fatty acids can be considered. In the future there may be approaches to modulate gut flora either with antibiotics targeted against identified noxious microbes or with selective probiotics that can rebalance the gut dysbiosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) are being used increasingly by patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed to assess the prevalence and usage of CAM in different geographical areas of Italy and possible predictors of their use. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A structured questionnaire, administered to outpatients, attending 8 general hospitals and 9 tertiary referral centres, was completed by 2011 patients (909 CD, 1087 UC and 15 indeterminate colitis). 583 patients lived in the North, 659 in Central Italy and 769 in the South. RESULTS: CAM users were 475 (23.6%) with no regional differences in their distribution. Usage correlated significantly with female gender (p=0.030), higher education (p=0.021), hospitalization rates (p=0.000), extra-intestinal complications (p=0.000), non-adherence to conventional treatments (p=0.054), adverse reactions to conventional treatments (p=0.000), and active disease (p=0.007); 5-ASA usage was associated with a more limited use of CAM (p=0.005). Dietary changes or supplements and prayer were significantly more frequently reported in South, while Northern Italian patients more frequently used homeopathy, herbal medicines and physical exercises. Patients in Central Italy adopted an intermediate behavior. CAM use ameliorated the patient's general well-being according to two thirds of the users. Costs were higher for Northern patients than in Central or Southern Italy. CONCLUSION: One in four IBD patients in Italy use CAM. More money is spent on CAM in Northern Italy. Regional differences emerged as regards the type of CAM but not in terms of disease features, frequency of and reasons for CAM use, or perceived effects.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) may lead to protein and calorie malnutrition (PCM) secondary to impaired digestive and absorptive functions of the small intestine and sometimes to the influence of diet taboos. The earlier the PCM is diagnosed, the higher are the odds of reversal. The objective of this study was to compare different methods of nutritional assessment in patients with CD and correlate them with the disease characteristics. SAMPLE: The sample comprised 75 patients with CD from the Gastroenterology Service at the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre; 37 were male, with a mean age of 38.2 years old (SD = 13.3). All patients had been in clinical remission (CDAI <150) for over 3 months. They were not receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition. The nutritional assessment was considered: body mass index (BMI), triceps skin fold (TSF), arm circumference (MAC), arm muscle circumference (MAMC), subjective global assessment (SGA), non-dominating handgrip strength (HGS) and food intake inquiries. RESULTS: When comparing the different nutritional assessment methods, 26.7% of the patients were malnourished according to the MAC, 29.3% according to the MAMC, 18.7% according to the SGA, 6.7% according to the BMI, 37.3% according to the TSF and 73.3% according to the HGS. No statistically significant associations were found for disease location, its behavior, drugs utilized, ESR, CRP, age of patients and disease time with the nutritional state verified by HGS, TSF, MAMC and SGA. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is significant in patients with CD, even in clinical remission. The BMI should not be used as reference in this population. The HGS detected a high prevalence of nutritional risk in patients with CD in remission. Studies are required that correlate it with more sensitive methods, for the patients' effective nutritional state assessment.},

   abstract = {Prescription drugs and surgery are two common medical therapies for Crohn's disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the GI tract. Unfortunately, certain drugs can cause serious side effects, and surgeries must often be repeated. No diet has been established to alleviate the pain and suffering of CD patients. This is curious given the fact that a higher prevalence of food sensitivities exist in this population of patients, and enteral nutrition is not only the first-line of therapy in Japan, but a known research method used to place the majority of CD patients into remission. Although not all patients respond equally to diet, many simply remove symptom-provoking foods, such as dairy, wheat, corn and certain fruits and vegetables. We suggest assisting these patients in their self-assessment of irritating and symptom-provoking foods by educating them in the use of a food-symptom diary followed by a customized elimination diet trialed for 2-4 weeks to determine if there is any benefit to the individual patient.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) achieves variable remission rates in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: To describe our experience of treating CD with an 8-week course of primary EEN and to study factors affecting treatment outcome. METHODS: All CD patients treated with EEN in our centre between 2004 and 2007 were included in the study. Remission was determined by a combination of clinical parameters. Disease phenotype was assigned using published classifications. Inflammatory markers and anthropometry (Z-scores) were calculated before and after treatment. RESULTS: A total of 114 children were treated (four were excluded). Median age at diagnosis was 11.6 years. Fifty-seven (51.8%) were fed orally whilst 53 (48.2%) were fed by tube. Eighty-eight (80%) achieved remission with consequent reductions in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (P < 0.001). Patients in remission had comparative improvements in weight (-1.04 cf. -0.40) and BMI Z-scores (-0.98 cf. -0.03) by the end of treatment (P < 0.001). Individuals with isolated terminal ileal disease (n = 4) had lower remission rates than other locations (P = 0.02). No other significant differences in remission rates for any other disease locations were found. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive enteral nutrition induces clinical remission, normalization of inflammatory markers and improves weight/BMI Z-scores in most patients. This study demonstrates that disease phenotype should not influence clinicians when commencing patients on EEN.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and 2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89 months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive, multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab, thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.},

   abstract = {Alterations in autophagy leading to a defective intracellular response to low-level invasive bacteria are considered a major recent advance in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. A genome-wide association study has shown an association of Crohn's disease with the autophagy related 16-like 1 gene. A second autophagy gene, the immunity-related Guanosine triphosfatase, has also been found to be significantly associated with Crohn's disease. The enteric flora of Crohn's disease patients includes, more commonly than controls, strains of adherent/invasive E. coli. The high level of adherent/invasive E. coli colonizing the intestinal mucosa of patients with Crohn's disease strongly suggests that it may play an important role in the aetiopathogenesis of the disease. E. coli strains are able to cross the mucosal barrier, survive within macrophages and induce the secretion of TNFalpha and the formation of granuloma. Recently it has been clearly shown that Crohn's disease patients have a defective mucosal macrophage killing activity resulting in increased exposure to commensal bacteria and activation of T cells. However, the hypothesis of macrophages dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease was already suggested in 1977 by M. Ward, who introduced the concept of the "dyspeptic macrophage", consisting of an inability to degrade a variety of phagocytosed normal gut dietary and microbial luminal constituents. Defective autophagy and dyspeptic macrophages seems therefore indicate the same pathogenetic mechanism. What is really new is the demonstration that this impaired macrophage function is genetically determined.},

   abstract = {Rapid increase in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) incidence in developed countries, occurrence of CD in spouses and lack of complete concordance in monozygotic twins are strong arguments for the role of environmental factors in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Only two environmental factors have an established role in IBD. Smoking is a risk factor for CD and a protective factor for UC; appendectomy is a protective factor for UC. Many other environmental factors for IBD have been investigated. These are infectious agents, diet, drugs, stress and socio-economic factors. They are detailed in this paper. Among them, adherent invasive E. coli, infectious gastroenteritis, oral contraceptives and antibiotics could play a role in CD. To date, three theories integrate environmental factors to pathogenesis of IBD: hygiene, infection and cold chain. Much work remains to be done to identify risk factors for IBD. As exemplified by smoking, research of environmental risk factors of IBD is useful since it may lead to an improved disease course among patients and perhaps, to appropriate prevention among predisposed subjects. Further studies in this field are eagerly awaited.},

For instance, patients with Crohn's Disease (CD) or Ulcerative Colitis (UC) have a 12-20% increased risk for developing CRC. Preventive strategies utilizing nontoxic natural compounds that modulate immune responses could be successful in the suppression of inflammation-driven colorectal cancer in high-risk groups. The increase of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) expression and its transcriptional activity has been identified as a target for anti-inflammatory efforts, and the suppression of inflammation-driven colon cancer. PPARgamma down-modulates inflammation and elicits antiproliferative and proapoptotic actions in epithelial cells. All of which may decrease the risk for inflammation-induced CRC. This review will focus on the use of orally active, naturally occurring chemopreventive approaches against inflammation-induced CRC that target PPARgamma and therefore down-modulate inflammation.},

   abstract = {In order to increase dietary folic acid intake and to improve nutritional status regarding folate by controlling homocysteine concentrations, ten patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease in the colon and ulcerative colitis) received individualized nutritional guidance and were followed up as outpatients for 2 months. The following procedures were performed at the beginning of the study (T0), after 1 month (T1) and at the end of the study (T2): collection of anthropometric data (weight and height), dietary data (24 h diet recall), and blood under fasting condition for the determination of serum folic acid, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and vitamin B12. Plasma folic acid deficiency was not detected but hyperhomocysteinemia was present in six individuals and C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased (>0.5 mg/dl) in seven patients. After the patients were instructed there was a significant increase in vitamin B6 intake (about 35%) and in folate intake (49.6%). Mean plasma levels of folic acid, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 did not change, but there was a significant decrease of CRP at T1, 0.36 mg dl(-1) on average (P = 0.01), which was maintained at T2. We conclude that the increased folate intake reported by this group of patients was not reflected in improved serum concentrations of folic acid and homocysteine. However, the guidelines for the patients probably induced them to choose a more adequate diet, providing nutrients that help control the inflammatory process.},

METHODS: A prospective, single center, 2-year clinical trial was conducted. Twenty-two adult CD patients who achieved clinical remission either medically (n = 17) or surgically (n = 5) and consumed an SVD during hospitalization were advised to continue with an SVD and avoid known high-risk foods for inflammatory bowel disease. The primary endpoint was clinical relapse defined as the appearance of active symptoms of CD. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to calculate the cumulative proportion of patients who had a relapse. A 2-year analysis of relapse rates of patients who followed an SVD and those who did not (an omnivorous diet group) was undertaken. RESULTS: SVD was continued by 16 patients (compliance 73%). Remission was maintained in 15 of 16 patients (94%) in the SVD group vs two of six (33%) in the omnivorous group. Remission rate with SVD was 100% at 1 year and 92% at 2 years. SVD showed significant prevention in the time to relapse compared to that in the omnivorous group (P = 0.0003, log rank test). The concentration of C-reactive protein was normal at the final visit in more than half of the patients in remission who were taking an SVD, who maintained remission during the study (9/15; 60%), who terminated follow-up (8/12; 67%), and who completed 2 years follow-up (7/10; 70%). There was no untoward effect of SVD. CONCLUSION: SVD was highly effective in preventing relapse in CD.},

   abstract = {The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is multifactorial and involves interactions of gut luminal content with mucosal barrier and especially immune cells. Malnutrition is a frequent issue during IBD flares, especially in Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and nutritional support is frequently used to treat malnutrition but also in an attempt to modulate intestinal inflammation. The use of oral or enteral nutrition intervention in IBDs may be effective, alone or in combination with drugs, to achieve and maintain remission. However, standard diets are less effective than new-generation biotherapies and could be improved by supplementation with specific immunomodulatory amino acids. Experimental studies evaluating glutamine, the preferential substrate for enterocytes, are promising. Some clinical studies with oral glutamine in CD are until now disappointing, but new formulations and targeting could enhance glutamine efficacy at the site of mucosal lesions. The role of arginine, involved in nitric oxide and polyamines synthesis, still remains debated. However, the effects of these amino acids in IBD have been poorly documented in humans. Other candidates like glycine, cysteine, histidine, or taurine should also be evaluated in the future.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Variation in medical care can be a barrier to improving clinical outcomes. We aim to describe the variation in care of Crohn disease as provided by a broad sample of pediatric gastroenterologists. METHODS: Two hundred forty-six Crohn disease patients of 93 pediatric gastroenterologists from 48 practice sites starting treatment with either thiopurine or infliximab were studied. We assessed variation in diagnostic testing that had been performed to establish the diagnosis of Crohn disease and to assess the phenotype, extent, and severity of disease. We also assessed variation in initial thiopurine and infliximab dosage and in nutritional therapy. RESULTS: Diagnostic studies in which care was uniform included complete blood count, performed in 100% of patients, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and colonoscopy in 96%, and upper endoscopy in 89%. However, imaging of the small bowel had not been performed in 19%, and a stool test for pathogens had not been performed in 29%. Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) had been measured in 61% of patients before treatment with a thiopurine; in 85%, TPMT was normal. Nonetheless, even when TPMT was normal, 40% of patients received an initial dose of thiopurine that was lower than recommended. Testing for tuberculosis before initiating treatment with infliximab was not performed in 30%. In addition, 36% of severely underweight patients were not receiving a multivitamin supplement, supplemental formula, or tube feeding. CONCLUSIONS: There is variation in diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in the management of pediatric Crohn disease, and gaps exist between recommended and actual care.},

   abstract = {The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic abdominal symptom complex that is heterogeneous in terms of its clinical presentation and underlying pathophysiology and pathogenesis. It is now established that enteric infection can trigger the syndrome in at least a subset of patients. In addition, there is growing evidence of low grade inflammation and immune activation in the distal bowel of some IBS patients. These observations now prompt the question as to what maintains gut dysfunction in these patients. The intestinal microbiota influences a broad array of host organs that include the gut and the brain, and is an important determinant of normal function in these systems. Disruption of the delicate balance between the host and its intestinal microbiota (termed dysbiosis) results in changes in the mucosal immune system that range from overt inflammation as seen in Crohn's Disease, to low grade inflammation without tissue injury, as seen in a subset of IBS patients. Under experimental conditions, disruption of the microbiota also produces changes in gut sensory-motor function and immune activity. Thus, dysbiosis induced by infection, dietary change or drugs such as antibiotics could produce low grade inflammation and chronic gut dysfunction, reminiscent of that seen in IBS. Fluctuations in gut physiology destabilize the habitat of commensal bacteria and provide a basis for chronic dysbiosis. Recent observations in animal models that changes in gut flora influence behavior provide a basis for a novel unifying hypothesis that accommodates both gut dysfunction and behavioral changes that characterize many IBS patients. This hypothesis states that dysbiosis exists in at least a subset of IBS patients, as a result of infection, dietary change or drugs and contributes to gut inflammatory and functional change in addition to psychiatric co-morbidity.},

   abstract = {Nutrition is a critical part of the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children and adults. Malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are common at the time of diagnosis and may persist throughout the course of the disease. There are a number of similarities with regards to the nutritional complications and the approach to nutritional management in IBD in both children and adults, but there are also important differences. Growth failure, pubertal delay and the need for corticosteroid-sparing regimens are of higher importance in pediatrics. In the pediatric population, exclusive enteral nutrition may be equivalent to corticosteroids in inducing remission in acute Crohn's disease, and may have benefits over corticosteroids in children. Adherence with exclusive enteral nutrition is better in children than in adults. Iron deficiency anemia is an important problem for adults and children with IBD. Intravenous iron administration may be superior to oral iron supplementation. Ensuring adequate bone health is another critical component of nutritional management in IBD, but guidelines for screening and therapeutic interventions for low bone mineral density are lacking in children.},

   abstract = {Current smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease and worsens its course, increasing the need for steroids, immunosuppressants, and re-operations. On the contrary, smoking protects against ulcerative colitis and after disease onset improves its course, decreasing the need for colectomy. Smoking cessation improves Crohn's disease and worsens ulcerative colitis. Achieving smoking cessation in Crohn's disease is thus an important goal of therapy, whereas patients with ulcerative colitis should not be discouraged to quit, because the beneficial effect of smoking for their disease is counterbalanced by the deleterious respiratory and cardiovascular effects of tobacco. Physical activity improves quality of life without detrimental effect on disease activity, and may contribute to increase muscle mass and to prevent osteoporosis. Regarding nutrition, a Western diet may be associated with an increased risk of IBD, and a case-control study revealed an increased consumption of linoleic acid before diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Liquid diets may improve Crohn's disease flares and decrease the need for steroids; however, there are no defined diets able to improve the disease course, and in Crohn's disease, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids did not show a significant benefit. Obesity is becoming more prevalent in IBD and may be associated with higher disease activity. In total, adhering to four simple lifestyle factors - never smoking, physical activity, prudent diet and body mass index <25 - may have a strong impact both on the prevention of major chronic diseases and on the course of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim was to evaluate the presence of metabolic bone disease (MBD) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and to identify potential etiologic factors. METHODS: The case-control study included 99 patients with CD and 56 controls with a similar age and gender distribution. Both groups had dual-energy x-ray absorptionmetry and a nutritional evaluation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms at the IL1, TNF-alpha, LTalpha, and IL-6 genes were analyzed in patients only. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. RESULTS: The prevalence of MBD was significantly higher in patients (P = 0.006). CD patients with osteoporosis were older (P < 0.005), small bowel involvement and surgical resections were more frequent (P < 0.005), they more often exhibited a penetrating or stricturing phenotype (P < 0.05), duration of disease over 15 years (P < 0.005), and body mass index (BMI) under 18.5 kg/m(2) (P < 0.01) were more often found. No association was found with steroid use. Patients with a Z-score < -2.0 more frequently had chronic active disease (P < 0.05). With regard to diet, low vitamin K intake was more frequent (P = 0.03) and intake of total, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat was higher in patients with Z-score < -2.0 (P < 0.05). With respect to genetics, carriage of the polymorphic allele for LTalpha252 A/G was associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis (P = 0.02). Regression analysis showed that age over 40 years, chronic active disease, and previous colonic resections were independently associated with the risk of developing MBD. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MBD was significantly higher in CD patients. Besides the usual risk factors, we observed that factors related to chronic active and long-lasting disease increased the risk of MBD.},

This is a chronic and relapsing condition of unknown aetiology that comprises chiefly ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Although there are treatments for IBD, they have frequent side effects and they are not always effective; therefore there is a need for new therapies that could alleviate this condition. Two bioactive peptides present in milk (transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and casein macropeptide, also named glycomacropeptide) have been shown to have intestinal anti-inflammatory activities. In fact, TGF-beta is currently added to formulas intended for patients with IBD, and several studies indicate that these formulas could induce clinical remission. In this paper, evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory effect of TGF-beta and bovine glycomacropeptide, as well as their mechanisms of action, is reviewed, focusing on the evidence obtained in animal models.},

   abstract = {A multidisciplinary working group has outlined evidence-based practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in children (IBD). Both diagnosis and treatment of IBD in children differ significantly from practice in adults. The incidence of IBD in children is low (5.2 per 100,000 per year in the age group 0-17 years), but most of the presenting symptoms are non-specific; therefore it is difficult for the general practitioner to recognise the disease in children. For a correct diagnosis, ileocolonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy are necessary, often combined with radiological imaging of the small bowel. In children and adolescents with Crohn's disease, nutritional therapy is the first choice of treatment for remission induction. As maintenance treatment, immunomodulators (azathioprine or mercaptopurine) should be started from the time of initial diagnosis. In children and adolescents with ulcerative colitis, the first treatment is with aminosalicylates. Prednisone and/or immunomodulators (azathioprine, cyclosporin) are indicated if there is insufficient response to aminosalicylates. A final treatment option is colectomy. The transition from paediatric to adult health care needs special attention as the patient and his or her parents may be reluctant to change trusted contacts which they have made.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD)-related small-bowel strictures remain a major cause of morbidity, frequently requiring surgery. OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the feasibility and effectiveness of CD small-bowel stricture dilation by DBE. DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTINGS: Single, tertiary referral center. METHODS: Outcome data on cases of DBE-assisted CD small-bowel stricture dilation were prospectively collected from 2005. Dilation was performed by using controlled radial expansion balloon dilators. A 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess obstructive symptoms and dietary restriction before DBE stricture dilation and at follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 13 DBEs were performed in 11 consecutive patients (mean +/- SD age 46.4 +/- 7.8 years). Eighteen small-bowel stricture dilations were performed in 9 of 11 patients. The mean dilation diameter was 15.4 mm (range 12-20 mm). In 2 cases, stricture dilation was not performed because adhesions made reaching the strictures impossible. One case was complicated by a delayed perforation. In the other 8 patients, stricture dilation was successful; VAS scores improved dramatically and none of the patients has required surgery (mean follow-up 20.5 months; range 2-41 months). During follow-up, 2 patients required repeated dilation (at 6.5 and 13 months, respectively) because of symptom recurrence. Clinical improvements in before and after VAS scores were significant (mean 8.8 vs 1.8, respectively; P < .001). LIMITATIONS: Small case series; single tertiary referral center. CONCLUSION: DBE-assisted small-bowel stricture dilation for selected patients with CD is potentially of significant benefit and should be considered as a useful and effective alternative to surgery. Larger studies are required to confirm this benefit.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The utility and efficacy of the laparoscopic approach to the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children are not clearly known. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective descriptive cohort study of children with a diagnosis of IBD who underwent a laparoscopic or laparoscopy-assisted procedure at a quaternary pediatric referral center between 1999 and 2007. RESULTS: One-hundred thirty-six children underwent 154 operations (85 small bowel/ileocolic and 69 colorectal) over the 8 years of the study. Median age was 14.8 years (range = 1.8-18.8). The diagnosis was Crohn's disease in 83, ulcerative colitis in 50, and indeterminate colitis in 3. Median time to regular diet was 5 days (range = 1-19), and median postoperative stay was 7 days (range = 1-70). Seven patients undergoing a small bowel/ileocolic resection (8.2%) were converted to an open procedure. Overall morbidity for the small bowel/ileocolic procedures was 27.1%. The conversion rate during subtotal colectomy (STC) was 7.1% (3/42), and it was 0% for the 22 patients who underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) procedures. Overall morbidity associated with STC was 62.8%, and following IPAA it was 63.6%. Sixteen percent (7/69) of those who underwent a colorectal procedure developed a late postoperative bowel obstruction with three patients requiring operative intervention. CONCLUSION: A laparoscopic approach is feasible with a low conversion rate in most children with IBD. Despite superior cosmesis, perioperative morbidity is similar to that seen with open procedures. Laparoscopic colorectal IBD procedures are associated with an unexpectedly high incidence of postoperative bowel obstruction, although the rates are comparable to those seen with open surgery.},

   abstract = {Carotenoids are colored molecules that are widespread in the plant kingdom, but animals cannot synthesize them. Carotenes are long, apolar molecules which require fully functioning digestive processes to be absorbed properly. Hence they could be interesting markers of intestinal absorption and digestion. Indeed, only few tests are available to assess these processes and only the D-xylose tolerance test is routinely used. However D-xylose is a sugar that tests only the absorption of water-soluble compounds and it only tests duodenal absorption. In this study, we have evaluated carotenoids as markers of digestion and absorption. We compared fasting plasma carotenoids concentrations in 21 control subjects, 20 patients with Crohn's disease, and 18 patients with pancreatic cancer. Crohn's disease alters intestinal absorption while pancreatic cancer decreases pancreatic enzyme secretion thus impairing digestion. Results show that all carotenoids are significantly lower in Crohn's and cancer patients as compared to control subjects and the multifactorial analysis shows that this decrease is mostly independent of dietary intake. Interestingly, maldigestion as seen in pancreatic cancer more strongly influences plasma lutein and lycopene concentrations while malabsorption in Crohn's disease acts on other carotenoids. Thus carotenoids could be interesting alternatives for testing and following patients that are suspected of having malabsorption or maldigestion syndromes.},

   abstract = {Deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 (DMBT1) is a secreted glycoprotein displaying a broad bacterial-binding spectrum. Recent functional and genetic studies linked DMBT1 to the suppression of LPS-induced TLR4-mediated NF-kappaB activation and to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Here, we aimed at unraveling the molecular basis of its function in mucosal protection and of its broad pathogen-binding specificity. We report that DMBT1 directly interacts with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and carrageenan, a structurally similar sulfated polysaccharide, which is used as a texturizer and thickener in human dietary products. However, binding of DMBT1 does not reduce the cytotoxic effects of these agents to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. DSS and carrageenan compete for DMBT1-mediated bacterial aggregation via interaction with its bacterial-recognition motif. Competition and ELISA studies identify poly-sulfated and poly-phosphorylated structures as ligands for this recognition motif, such as heparansulfate, LPS, and lipoteichoic acid. Dose-response studies in Dmbt1(-/-) and Dmbt1(+/+) mice utilizing the DSS-induced colitis model demonstrate a differential response only to low but not to high DSS doses. We propose that DMBT1 functions as pattern-recognition molecule for poly-sulfated and poly-phosphorylated ligands providing a molecular basis for its broad bacterial-binding specificity and its inhibitory effects on LPS-induced TLR4-mediated NF-kappaB activation.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a major source of morbidity in children and adults. Its incidence is rising, particularly in young people. IBD carries a lifelong risk of cancer, which is proportional to disease duration. Drug and surgical treatments rarely offer cure and often carry a high side effect burden. Dietary therapy is highly effective in Crohn's disease. For these reasons, there is much interest in developing novel dietary treatments in IBD. Curcumin, a component of the spice turmeric, and an anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agent, shows preclinical and clinical potential in IBD. Its mechanisms of action are unknown. Our aim was to assess the effect of curcumin on key disease mediators p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), IL-1beta, IL-10 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in the gut of children and adults with IBD. Colonic mucosal biopsies and colonic myofibroblasts (CMF) from children and adults with active IBD were cultured ex vivo with curcumin. p38 MAPK, NF-kappaB and MMP-3 were measured by immunoblotting. IL-1beta and IL-10 were measured by ELISA. We show reduced p38 MAPK activation in curcumin-treated mucosal biopsies, enhanced IL-10 and reduced IL-1beta. We demonstrate dose-dependent suppression of MMP-3 in CMF with curcumin. We conclude that curcumin, a naturally occurring food substance with no known human toxicity, holds promise as a novel therapy in IBD.},

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory bowel diseases for which twin studies reveal genetic susceptibility that is impacted by diet and environment. Apparently contradictory data on the role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease would be entirely explainable if genetic variability determined dietary requirements and intolerances. Considering Crohn's disease, we recognize three major classes of genes. The first of these involves bacterial recognition through pattern recognition receptors and autophagy genes, while the second act through secondary immune response, and the third concern epithelial barrier integrity. Despite genetic overlap with CD, the first two groups of genes appear to be less important in ulcerative colitis, while other genes, particularly those involved in barrier function, gain prominence. Case-control studies suggest that these different genetic groups reflect distinct dietary requirements. Such studies suggest nutrigenomic approaches to maintaining disease remission at present, and preventing disease development in the future.},

   abstract = {The Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are debilitating conditions, characterised by lifelong sensitivity to certain foods, and often a need for surgery and life-long medication. The anti-inflammatory effects of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated acids justify their inclusion in enteral nutrition formulas that have been associated with disease remission. However, there have been variable data in clinical trials to test supplementary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in inducing or maintaining remission in these diseases. Although variability in trial design has been suggested as a major factor, we suggest that variability in processing and presentation of the products may be equally or more important. The nature of the source, and rapidity of getting the fish or other food source to processing or to market, will affect the percentage of the various fatty acids, possible presence of heavy metal contaminants and oxidation status of the various fatty acids. For dietary supplements or fortified foods, whether the product is encapsulated or not, whether storage is under nitrogen or not, and length of time between harvest, processing and marketing will again profoundly affect the properties of the final product. Clinical trials to test efficacy of these products in IBD to date have utilised the relevant skills of pharmacology and gastroenterology. We suggest that knowledge from food science, nutrition and engineering will be essential to establish the true role of this important group of compounds in these diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is a multifactorial disease where resistance to apoptosis is one major defect. Also, dietary fat intake has been shown to modulate disease activity. We aimed to explore the interaction between four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in apoptotic genes and dietary fat intake in modulating disease activity in CD patients. METHODS: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) techniques were used to analyze Caspase9+93C/T, FasLigand-843C/T, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma+161C/T and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma Pro12Ala SNPs in 99 patients with CD and 116 healthy controls. Interactions between SNPs and fat intake in modulating disease activity were analyzed using regression analysis. RESULTS: None of the polymorphisms analyzed influenced disease susceptibility and/or activity, but a high intake of total, saturated and monounsaturated fats and a higher ratio of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFA), was associated with a more active phenotype (p < 0.05). We observed that the detrimental effect of a high intake of total and trans fat was more marked in wild type carriers of the Caspase9+93C/T polymorphism [O.R(95%CI) 4.64(1.27-16.89) and O.R(95%CI) 4.84(1.34-17.50)]. In the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma Pro12Ala SNP, we also observed that a high intake of saturated and monounsaturated fat was associated to a more active disease in wild type carriers [OR(95%CI) 4.21(1.33-13.26) and 4.37(1.52-12.51)]. Finally, a high intake of n-6 PUFA was associated with a more active disease in wild type carriers for the FasLigand-843C/T polymorphism [O.R(95%CI) 5.15(1.07-24.74)]. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to disclose a synergism between fat intake and SNPs in apoptotic genes in modulating disease activity in CD patients.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease, which covers Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease are both inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract. In both diseases an antigen activates several inflammatory pathways, which cause extensive damage to the intestinal mucosa and lead to increased permeability of the intestinal epithelium. The causative antigen in inflammatory bowel disease is the microflora in the intestinal lumen, facilitated by an impaired innate immune system that is unable to halt the invasion of microbes into the lamina propria. These provoke T helper 1 and T helper 17 responses in Crohn's disease and a T helper 2 response in ulcerative colitis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and interleukins produced in these processes lead to impairment of tight junctions and increased permeability of the intestinal epithelial lining. In celiac disease, inflammation is caused by dietary gluten, a peptide present in wheat, barley and rye. In genetically predisposed people, gliadin peptides (derivatives of gluten) are presented on the Human Leukocyte Antigen DQ2 or DQ-8 molecules of antigen-presenting cells to T helper cells. This provokes a T helper 1 response, which leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequent damage to, and increased permeability of the intestinal epithelium. We describe the details and overlaps in the pathomechanism and genetics of inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease, and discuss potential drug targets for intervention.},

   abstract = {Allele variants in the L-carnitine (LCAR) transporters OCTN1 (SLC22A4, 1672 C --> T) and OCTN2 (SLC22A5, -207 G --> C) have been implicated in susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD). LCAR is consumed in the diet and transported actively from the intestinal lumen via the organic cation transporter OCTN2. While recognized mainly for its role in fatty acid metabolism, several lines of evidence suggest that LCAR may also display immunosuppressive properties. This study sought to investigate the immunomodulatory capacity of LCAR on antigen-presenting cell (APC) and CD4+ T cell function by examining cytokine production and the expression of activation markers in LCAR-supplemented and deficient cell culture systems. The therapeutic efficacy of its systemic administration was then evaluated during the establishment of colonic inflammation in vivo. LCAR treatment significantly inhibited both APC and CD4+ T cell function, as assessed by the expression of classical activation markers, proliferation and cytokine production. Carnitine deficiency resulted in the hyperactivation of CD4+ T cells and enhanced cytokine production. In vivo, protection from trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid colitis was observed in LCAR-treated mice and was attributed to the abrogation of both innate [interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 production] and adaptive (T cell proliferation in draining lymph nodes) immune responses. LCAR therapy may therefore represent a novel alternative therapeutic strategy and highlights the role of diet in CD.},

This small intestinal mucosal disorder is gluten-dependent and causes nutrient malabsorption, often with diarrhea and weight loss. Diagnosis depends on detection of typical biopsy changes in the proximal small bowel along with an unequivocal response to a gluten-free diet. Recurrent changes usually result from poor adherence to the gluten-free diet, sometimes intentional, or from consumption of unsuspected gluten sources. In others, the original diagnosis may not be correct (e.g., duodenal involvement with Crohn's disease) or another cause for symptoms may have supervened (e.g., collagenous colitis, functional bowel disease). Rarely, a complication may occur (e.g., collagenous sprue, lymphoma). In some, the gluten-dependent nature of the small bowel disorder was not initially documented and biopsy changes continued despite a gluten-free diet. These have a sprue-like intestinal disorder, also labeled unclassified sprue. This represents a small, but likely, heterogeneous group, and in these, intractable symptoms may be present and, in some, lymphoma is eventually diagnosed.},

   abstract = {The human superorganism is a conglomerate of mammalian and microbial cells, with the latter estimated to outnumber the former by ten to one and the microbial genetic repertoire (microbiome) to be approximately 100-times greater than that of the human host. Given the ability of the immune response to rapidly counter infectious agents, it is striking that such a large density of microbes can exist in a state of synergy within the human host. This is particularly true of the distal gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which houses up to 1000 distinct bacterial species and an estimated excess of 1 x 10(14) microorganisms. An ever-increasing body of evidence implicates the GI microbiota in defining states of health and disease. Here, we review the literature in adult and pediatric GI microbiome studies, the emerging links between microbial community structure, function, infection and disease, and the approaches to manipulate this crucial ecosystem to improve host health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The proinflammatory effect of high-fat diet has been observed beyond the cardiovascular system, but there is little evidence to support its role in triggering inflammatory bowel disease. GPx1/2-double-knockout (DKO) mice deficient in 2 intracellular glutathione peroxidases, GPx1 and GPx2, on a C57BL/6 (B6) background, have mild ileocolitis on a conventional chow. METHODS: We fed B6 DKO mice 2 atherogenic diets to test the dietary effect on atherosclerosis and ileocolitis. Both atherogenic diets have high cholesterol-the Chol+/CA diet has cholic acid (CA), and the Chol+ diet has no CA. RESULTS: The Chol+/CA diet induced severe colitis, but not ileitis, in the DKO mice compared with the Chol+ and the Chol- control diet. On the Chol+/CA diet, the wild-type (WT) mice had levels of aortic lesions and hypercholesterolemia similar to those of DKO mice but had no intestinal pathology. The diet-associated inflammatory responses in the DKO mice included increased colonic proinflammatory serum amyloid A3 expression, plasma lipopolysaccharide, and TNF-alpha levels. The Chol+/CA diet lowered the expression of the unfolded protein response genes ATF6, CHOP, unspliced Xbp(U) , and Grp78/Bip, in WT and DKO mice compared with mice on the Chol- diet. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that a cholesterol diet weakens the colon unfolded protein response, which can aggravate spontaneous colitis, leading to gut barrier breakdown. GPx has no impact on atherosclerosis without ultrahypercholesterolemia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fast-track surgery accelerates recovery, reduces morbidity, and shortens hospital stay. However, the benefits of laparoscopic versus open surgery remain unproven within a fast-track program. Case reports of laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) colectomies are appearing with claims of cosmetic advantage and decreased parietal trauma. This report describes the largest case series of LESS colorectal surgery and its effects on recovery. METHODS: In this series, 20 consecutive unselected patients underwent LESS colorectal surgery including right hemicolectomy (n = 3), extended right hemicolectomy, high anterior resection (n = 2), low anterior resection involving total mesorectal excision (TME; n = 3), ileocolic anastomosis (n = 2, including 1 redo surgery), colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (n = 4, including 1 with ventral mesh rectopexy), panproctocolectomy (n = 2), proctocolectomy and ileoanal pouch (n = 2) and an abdominoperineal excision of rectum. Single-port conventional instrumentation and transversus abdominus plane (TAP) block analgesia were used. The indications included cancer (n = 8), Crohn's disease (n = 4), ulcerative colitis (n = 3) complicated diverticulosis (n = 2), and slow-transit constipation (n = 3). Eight of the patients had undergone previous surgery. RESULTS: Most of the cases (90%) were managed successfully using the LESS technique and conventional instrumentation. Two operations (10%) were converted to standard laparoscopy, due to insufficient theater time and an unstable port. The operative time ranged from 45 to 240 min (median, 110 min). A normal diet was tolerated within 6 h by 7 patients and in 12 to 16 h (overnight) by 11 patients. Complications included anastomotic bleed (n = 1), ileus (n = 2), acute renal failure secondary to hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia (n = 1), urine retention (n = 1), and wound infection (n = 1). The median hospital stay was 46 h (range, 7-384 h). Eight patients were discharged within 24 h. There was one readmission (5%). CONCLUSION: Laparoendoscopic single-site colorectal resection using conventional instrumentation is feasible and safe when performed by an experienced team. The LESS approach may have advantages in terms of minimal pain, cosmesis, lower costs, and faster recovery. A randomized trial is required to confirm whether LESS offers a true patient benefit over standard laparoscopic resection.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Functional gut symptoms are common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) appear to play an important role in the induction of functional gut symptoms, we aimed to determine the effect of their dietary restriction on abdominal symptoms in patients with stable IBD and to examine factors associated with success of and adherence to the diet. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 52 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease and 20 with ulcerative colitis who received dietary advice at least 3 months prior at a gastrointestinal dietetic service in Victoria, Australia, underwent a retrospective telephone questionnaire. Information gathered included patient demographics, recall of dietary advice, dietary adherence, and change in gastrointestinal symptoms. RESULTS: Up to 70% of patients were adherent to the diet. Approximately one in two patients responded (defined as improvement of at least 5 out of 10 in overall symptoms). Overall abdominal symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating, wind and diarrhoea improved in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (p<0.02 for all), but constipation did not. For Crohn's disease, efficacy was associated with dietary adherence (p= 0.033) and inefficacy with non-adherence (p=0.013). Sustained response was associated with post-secondary education and working 35 h per week or less (p<0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that reduction of FODMAP intake offers an efficacious strategy for patients with IBD who have concurrent functional gut symptoms. A controlled dietary intervention trial is indicated.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nutritional deficiency is prevalent in developing countries but should also be considered in developed countries in the setting of genetic or acquired disease states. The skin is commonly involved and is often one of the first organs affected in nutritional deficiency, providing a key to the diagnosis. This article will review the most common nutritional deficiencies causing a periorificial and/or acrodermatitis: zinc deficiency, biotin deficiency, kwashiorkor, and essential fatty acid deficiency. RECENT FINDINGS: Whereas older literature has focused on the relationship among nutritional deficiency, malnutrition and poverty, recent research has identified additional patient populations that are at risk for developing nutritional deficiencies. These populations include premature infants, patients with long-term total parenteral nutrition, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, intestinal bypass procedures, chronic alcoholics, anorexia nervosa, and restrictive diets. Recent studies have also focused on further understanding the genetic basis of inherited nutritional deficiencies such as acrodermatitis enteropathica. SUMMARY: Skin manifestations can lead a provider to the diagnosis of a nutritional deficiency. In a child with a periorificial or acral dermatitis, the diagnosis of zinc, biotin, protein, or essential fatty acid deficiency should be considered, especially if accompanied by systemic signs of failure to thrive.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) affect bone metabolism and are frequently associated with the presence of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. Although several mechanisms may contribute to skeletal abnormalities in IBD patients, inflammation and inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 may be the most critical. It is not clear whether the changes in bone metabolism leading to decreased mineral density are the result of decreased bone formation, increased bone resorption, or both, with varying results reported in experimental models of IBD and in pediatric and adult IBD patients. New data, including our own, challenge the conventional views, and contributes to the unraveling of an increasingly complex network of interactions leading to the inflammation-associated bone loss. Since nutritional interventions (dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation) are of limited efficacy in IBD patients, understanding the pathophysiology of osteopenia and osteoporosis in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is critical for the correct choice of available treatments or the development of new targeted therapies. In this review, we discuss current concepts explaining the effects of inflammation, inflammatory mediators and their signaling effectors on calcium and phosphate homeostasis, osteoblast and osteoclast function, and the potential limitations of vitamin D used as an immunomodulator and anabolic hormone in IBD.},

We now report the utility of Length Heterogeneity Polymerase Chain Reaction (LH-PCR) to survey samples and a proprietary Multitagged Pyrosequencing (MTPS) methodology to interrogate the gut microbiome in healthy and disease states. We present an overview of our studies demonstrating the application of these molecular-biology techniques to an example disease state such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The findings show that there is a core mucosal bacterial microbiome (i.e., a mucosal biofilm) that is distinct from the luminal microbiome in health, and that the mucosal microbiome appears to be dysbiotic in IBD. We propose that the mucosal microbiome forms a synergistic and stable interaction with the host immune system, while the lumen microbiome varies based on diet or other environmental factors. We define this composite ecosystem of the human microbiome and human host as the Human Metabiome.},

In that sense, rosemary extracts have long been recognized as having antioxidant properties, and folic acid may be able to improve endothelial progenitor cell function. A mixture containing both has been tested as a possible nutraceutical to improve health complications in diabetes. We have developed the methodology to evaluate metabolic changes in the urine of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats after supplementing their diet with rosemary extract obtained with supercritical fluids (SFE) containing 10% folic acid in an acute but short-term study. It has been done with a metabolomics approach using LC-QTOF as an analytical tool. About 20 endogenous metabolites have been identified by databases and MS/MS showing statistically significant changes. Among them, several amino acids and their metabolites point to changes due to the effect of the gut microbiota. In addition, the comparison between control and streptozotocin-diabetic rats has permitted the showing of some metabolic coincidences between type 1 diabetes and other (possible) autoimmune diseases such as autism and/or Crohn's disease, and the nutraceutical intervention has succeeded in inducing changes in such biomarkers.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has long been considered a disease that affects predominantly a Western population. The incidence and prevalence rates from Asian populations are much lower in comparison. More recent data, however, have shown significantly higher rates in Asians and time trend studies have shown an increase in the incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) and a similar but lower rise in Crohn's disease (CD). The epidemiological changes that are taking place mirror that of the Western experience seen 50 years previously and seem to occur in parallel with the rapid socioeconomic development taking place in Asia. It appears that certain racial groups are more prone than others to develop IBD. For instance, Indians in South-East Asia have higher rates compared to Chinese and Malays. While there is host genetic predisposition, environmental factor(s) may be responsible for this difference. Migrant studies of South Asians in the UK, where second-generation immigrants have assumed incidence rates as high as the indigenous whites and Asian Jews who develop high incidence rates comparable to Jews from Europe or North America in Israel point to the role of environmental factors. It is unclear which specific factors are responsible. Studies have suggested a change in diet to a more Westernized one may underlie this epidemiological change in the Asian population. It is likely that there are racial groups amongst Asians who are more susceptible to IBD and who will demonstrate a higher frequency of IBD when exposed to putative environmental factors.},

The confounding effect of enterohepatic Helicobacters on the outcome of biomedical research was investigated in several studies and led to recommendations that animals should be screened prior to performing experiments. A number of important and novel investigations regarding pathogenic mechanisms and immune responses to enterohepatic Helicobacters were conducted. Genomic advances in non-H. pylori Helicobacters included description of the complete genome of Helicobacter canadensis, delineation of two Helicobacter bilis genomospecies, and identification of a novel cis-regulatory RNA. New insights concerning growth conditions, biochemical characterization, and the effect of certain dietary compounds on Helicobacter spp. have also been reported.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to study the interaction between genetic polymorphisms (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and fat intake on the risk of developing Crohn's disease (CD) or modifying disease activity. METHODS: Seven SNPs in interleukin 1 (IL1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), lymphotoxin alpha (LTalpha), and IL6 genes were analyzed in 116 controls and 99 patients with CD. The type of fat intake was evaluated, and the interaction between SNPs and dietary fat in modulating disease activity was analyzed. RESULTS: Individuals who were homozygous for the IL6-174G/C polymorphism had a six-fold higher risk for CD (odds ratio (OR)=6.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.9-19.4), whereas the TT genotype on the TNFalpha-857C/T polymorphism was associated with more active disease (OR=10.4; 95% CI=1.1-94.1). A high intake of total, saturated, and monounsaturated fats, as well as a higher ratio of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), was associated with a more active phenotype (P<0.05). Furthermore, there was an interaction between dietary fat intake and SNPs, with a high intake of saturated and monounsaturated fats being associated with active disease, mainly in patients carrying the variant alleles of the 857 TNFalpha polymorphism (OR=6.0, 95% CI=1.4-26.2; OR=5.17; 95% CI=1.4-19.2, respectively) and the 174 IL6 polymorphism (OR=2.95; 95% CI=1.0-9.1; OR=3.21; 95% CI=1.0-10.4, respectively). Finally, low intake of n-3 PUFA and high n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in patients with the TNFalpha 857 polymorphism were associated with higher disease activity (OR=3.6; 95% CI=1.0-13.0; OR=5.92; 95% CI=1.3-26.5, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that different types of fat may interact with cytokine genotype, modulating disease activity.},

Although a variety of susceptibility genes were identified in genome-wide association studies, the impact of environmental factors in initiating or promoting the development of these complex diseases are unknown. Nutrigenomics is a transdisciplinary approach to understand the subtle but contentious impact of nutrition and/or microbes as prime environmental triggers in shaping the dynamic range between health and diseases. Profiling technologies such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabonomics at the interface of the host's genetic make-up and its metabolic phenotype are implemented to identify cellular and molecular targets to develop novel hypothesise with respect to the functional role of diet and gut bacteria in modulating chronic degenerative diseases including inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Underweight and specific nutrient deficiencies are frequent in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In addition, a significant number of children with IBD, especially Crohn's disease (CD) have impaired linear growth. Nutrition has an important role in the management of IBD. In adults with CD, enteral nutrition (EN) is effective in inducing clinical remission of IBD, although it is less efficient than corticosteroids. Exclusive EN is an established primary therapy for pediatric CD. Limited data suggests that EN is as efficient as corticosteroids for induction of remission. Additional advantages of nutritional therapy are control of inflammation, mucosal healing, positive benefits to growth and overall nutritional status with minimal adverse effects. The available evidence suggests that supplementary EN may be effective also for maintenance of remission in CD. More studies are needed to confirm these findings. However, EN supplementation could be considered as an alternative or as an adjunct to maintenance drug therapy in CD. EN does not have a primary therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis. Specific compositions of enteral diets-elemental diets or diets containing specific components-were not shown to have any advantage over standard polymeric diets and their place in the treatment of CD or UC need further evaluation. Recent theories suggest that diet may be implicated in the etiology of IBD, however there are no proven dietary approaches to reduce the risk of developing IBD.},

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients have many vitamin and nutrient deficiencies which can lead to important consequences such as hyperhomocysteinemia which is associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic disease. Nutritional deficiencies in IBD patients are the result of insufficient intake, malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy as well as the metabolic distubances directly induced by the chronic disease and its treatments, in particular corticosteroids. Screening for nutritional deficiencies in chronic disease patients is warranted. Managing the deficiencies involves simple nutritional guidelines, vitamin supplements, and nutritional support in the worst cases, in particular in children in order to limit the impact of IBD on growth. In active CD, enteral nutrition is the first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls. DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4 patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20 IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P = 0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7 ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400 microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis should be explored further.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4) years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236), 1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE, it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.},

Our aim was to assess whether or not a laparoscopic approach was safe, feasible, and conferred meaningful short-term benefits in this patient population. METHODS: Patients undergoing LAP surgery for recurrent ileocolic CD at our institution from 1998-2008 were identified using a prospectively maintained database. Potential risk factors for conversion to open surgery and overall patient outcomes were assessed with univariate analysis. RESULTS: Forty patients were identified, of which 30 (75%) were LAP-completed and 10 (25%) were LAP-converted. The groups did not differ with respect to clinicopathological features. LAP-converted patients were significantly more likely to require adhesiolysis than LAP-completed patients (100% versus 67%, P = 0.04). There was 1 intraoperative complication in a converted patient. LAP-converted patients had longer times to soft diet (4 versus 3 days, P = 0.03) and longer length of stay (7 versus 4 days, P = 0.003). The groups did not differ with respect to incidence of postoperative complications or frequency of readmission within 30 days. There was no mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In up to 20% of patients with recurrent ileocolic, successful laparoscopic re-resection may be prevented by adhesions. Conversion increased the length of stay without increasing morbidity. We conclude that LAP surgery can be safely performed in selected patients with recurrent ileocolic CD and leads to short-term benefits.},

In a randomized, double-blind trial, faeces were collected from healthy volunteers, and from patients with active CD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome before and after treatment. The levels of F. prausnitzii DNA in faecal suspensions were determined by PCR. Treatment by an elemental diet was effective, resulting in decreases in both the Harvey and Bradshaw index (P<0.001) and the concentrations of serum C-reactive protein (P<0.05). The total levels of F. prausnitzii in faecal samples from CD patients at presentation were lower than those in the other groups both before and after the treatment. There was no correlation between F. prausnitzii abundance and the severity of CD before treatment. Clinical improvement unexpectedly correlated with a significant decrease in the abundance of F. prausnitzii, especially the A2-165 subgroup (P<0.05). Our data suggest that a paucity of F. prausnitzii in the gastrointestinal microbial communities is likely to be a minor aetiological factor in CD: recovery following elemental diet is attributed to lower levels of gut flora.},

In interleukin-10 (IL-10)-deficient cell-transferred mice, we investigated the change of intestinal microbiota with ED using molecular terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and culture method, and evaluated its influence on therapeutic effects of ED. ED significantly suppressed intestinal inflammation. The total amount of bacteria in colitis mice fed the regular diet was higher than in normal mice but decreased in colitis mice fed ED. T-RFLP profiles of the ED group markedly differed from those of the regular diet groups. The diversity of bacterial species in the ED group decreased to 60% of that found in the regular diet groups. Among the cultivated bacteria, the change in lactic acid bacteria composition was remarkable. Lactobacillus reuteri and L. johnsonii decreased and Enterococcus faecalis and E. durans increased in the ED group. The culture supernatant of L. reuteri isolates induced significant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 activity in RAW 264 cells, while the culture supernatant of E. faecalis and E. durans barely induced their activity. These data suggested that reduction in amount and diversity of intestinal microbiota and decrease of proinflammatory cytokines via a change in composition of lactic acid bacteria by ED seem to contribute to reduction of bowel inflammation in this model.},

   abstract = {It is well established that intestinal microbiota play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Various methods of altering the composition of intestinal microbiota have been examined. Recent evidence suggests that the administration of select prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics may improve the clinical outcome of patients with IBD. In addition, IBD patients are well known to carry a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer due to chronic inflammation. Therefore, probiotics and/or prebiotics may be appropriate treatments for prophylactic use due to their physiologic characteristics and lack of obvious toxicity. This review summarizes the current experimental and clinical knowledge about the role of intestinal microbiota in IBD, the prevention of carcinogenesis related to IBD, and its importance as a target for new forms of neutraceutical therapy.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Lupus patients need alternatives to steroids and cytotoxic drugs. We recently found that apigenin, a non-mutagenic dietary flavonoid, can sensitize recurrently activated, normal human T cells to apoptosis by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kappaB)-regulated Bcl-xL, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) expression. Because sustained immune activation and hyperexpression of COX-2 and c-FLIP contribute to lupus, we treated SNF1 mice that spontaneously develop human lupus-like disease with apigenin. METHODS: SNF1 mice with established lupus-like disease were injected with 20 mg/kg of apigenin daily and then monitored for development of severe nephritis. Histopathologic changes in kidneys, IgG autoantibodies to nuclear autoantigens in serum and in cultures of splenocytes, along with nucleosome-specific T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 responses, COX-2 expression, and apoptosis of lupus immune cells were analyzed after apigenin treatment. RESULTS: Apigenin in culture suppressed responses of Th1 and Th17 cells to major lupus autoantigen (nucleosomes) up to 98% and 92%, respectively, and inhibited the ability of lupus B cells to produce IgG class-switched anti-nuclear autoantibodies helped by these Th cells in presence of nucleosomes by up to 82%. Apigenin therapy of SNF1 mice with established lupus suppressed serum levels of pathogenic autoantibodies to nuclear antigens up to 97% and markedly delayed development of severe glomerulonephritis. Apigenin downregulated COX-2 expression in lupus T cells, B cells, and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and caused their apoptosis. Autoantigen presentation and Th17-inducing cytokine production by dendritic cells were more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of apigenin in culture, as evident at 0.3 to 3 muM, compared with concentrations (10 to 100 microM) required for inducing apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Apigenin inhibits autoantigen-presenting and stimulatory functions of APCs necessary for the activation and expansion of autoreactive Th1 and Th17 cells and B cells in lupus. Apigenin also causes apoptosis of hyperactive lupus APCs and T and B cells, probably by inhibiting expression of NF-kappaB-regulated anti-apoptotic molecules, especially COX-2 and c-FLIP, which are persistently hyperexpressed by lupus immune cells. Increasing the bioavailability of dietary plant-derived COX-2 and NF-kappaB inhibitors, such as apigenin, could be valuable for suppressing inflammation in lupus and other Th17-mediated diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and psoriasis and in prevention of inflammation-based tumors overexpressing COX-2 (colon, breast).},

   abstract = {It is unclear why patients with inflammation of the distal bowel complain of symptoms referable to the upper gastrointestinal tract, specifically to gastric emptying (GE) disturbances. Thus we aimed to determine occurrence and putative pathomechanisms of gastric motor disorders in such patients. Thirteen healthy subjects (CON), 13 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 10 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 7 with diverticulitis (DIV) underwent a standardized (13)C-octanoic acid gastric emptying breath test. Plasma glucose, CCK, peptide YY, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) were measured periodically and correlated with GE parameters. Results were given in means +/- SD. Compared with CON, GE half time (T) was prolonged by 50% in CD (115 +/- 55 vs. 182 +/- 95 min, P = 0.037). Six CD, 2 DIV, and 2 UC patients had pathological T (>200 min). Postprandial plasma glucose was increased in all patients but was highest in DIV and correlated with T (r = 0.90, P = 0.006). In CD, mean postprandial CCK levels were increased threefold compared with CON (6.5 +/- 6.7 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.6 pmol/l, P = 0.027) and were correlated with T (r = 0.60, P = 0.041). Compared with CON, GLP-1 levels were increased in UC (25.1 +/- 5.2 vs. 33.5 +/- 13.0 pmol/l, P = 0.046) but markedly decreased in DIV (9.6 +/- 5.2 pmol/l, P < 0.0001). We concluded that a subset of patients with CD, UC, or DIV has delayed GE. GE disturbances are most pronounced in CD and might partly be caused by excessive CCK release. In DIV there might be a pathophysiological link between decreased GLP-1 release, postprandial hyperglycemia, and delayed GE. These explorative data encourage further studies in larger patient groups.},

   abstract = {The effects of adding fiber to the tolerance of a peptide-based formula have not been studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the tolerance of a peptide-based formula with insoluble and prebiotic fiber in children with compromised gut function. During January 2005 to June 2006, a 6-week randomized, double-blind, cross-over clinical study was conducted to compare stool frequency, stool consistency, and tolerance (abdominal pain, abdominal distension, vomiting, weight gain, and intake) between a formula with or without 3.5 g fructo-oligosaccharides and 3.8 g insoluble fiber/L. Fourteen children with gastrointestinal dysmotility (n=9), Crohn's disease (n=3), or mild short bowel syndrome (n=2) were randomized to receive one of two formulas for 2 weeks followed by a 5-day washout period and then the second diet for another 2 weeks. Means and standard deviations of daily stool frequency and consistency were calculated and compared using intent-to-treat analysis. Linear mixed models were applied to each outcome variable. Stool frequency did not differ by formula. Stool consistency did differ with more soft "mushy" stools (less hard stools) occurring with use of fiber (P<0.001) and more watery stools occurring with control formula (P<0.01). The extremes of stool consistency were normalized with the fiber formula. No significant differences were observed in vomiting, abdominal pain, feeding intakes, or weight gain between the two formulas. This study showed that a peptide-based formula containing fiber was as well-tolerated as a fiber-free formula in a small population of children with gastrointestinal impairments. Longer-term effects of the fiber formula need to be studied.},

   abstract = {Interleukin-10 gene-deficient (Il10(-/-)) mice show a hyper-reaction to normal intestinal bacteria and develop spontaneous colitis similar to that of human Crohn's disease when raised under conventional (but not germ-free) conditions. The lack of IL10 protein in these mice leads to changes in intestinal metabolic and signalling processes. The first aim of this study was to identify changes in the bacterial community of the caeca at 7 weeks of age (preclinical colitis) and at 12 weeks of age (when clinical signs of colitis are present), and establish if there were any changes that could be associated with the mouse genotype. We have previously shown that dietary n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have anti-inflammatory effects and affect colonic gene expression profiles in Il10(-/-) mice; therefore, we also aimed to test the effect of the n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) on the bacterial community of caeca in both Il10(-/-) and C57 mice fed these diets. The lower number of caecal bacteria observed before colitis (7 weeks of age) in Il10(-/-) compared to C57 mice suggests differences in the intestinal bacteria that might be associated with the genotype, and this could contribute to the development of colitis in this mouse model. The number and diversity of caecal bacteria increased after the onset of colitis (12 weeks of age). The increase in caecal Escherichia coli numbers in both inflamed Il10(-/-) and healthy C57 mice might be attributed to the dietary PUFA (especially dietary AA), and thus not be a cause of colitis development. A possible protective effect of E. coli mediated by PUFA supplementation and associated changes in the bacterial environment could be a subject for further investigation to define the mode of action of PUFA in colitis.},

Therefore, we examined a panel of potential viral and bacterial pathogens in a large series of CD patients and controls. Archival tissue from 76 patients, 56 with CD and 20 control patients, with normal colon mucosa (n=10) and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced colitis (n=10) were examined using PCR-based detection methods for human cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus 1, 2 (HSV1,2), adenovirus (AD), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), human herpes virus 6 (HHV6), human herpes virus 8 (HHV8), Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (Mtbc), atypical mycobacteria (nM/MG1), including Mycobacterium avium (subspecies paratuberculosis, MAP), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Sm), and Yersinia enterocolitica (Ye). In CD patients, positive PCR results were achieved in 19 cases (34%). Sm was most frequent in 10 of 56 cases (17.9%) followed by EBV (6/56, 10.7%), nM/MG1 (4/56, 7.1%), including MAP, HHV6, and CMV (2/56, 3.6%), and finally Mtbc and AD (1/56, 1.8%). The control patients showed positive PCR results in 12 patients (12/20, 60%), nine of them with only weak signals, suggesting a persistent infection. In addition, we compared typical pathomorphological features of CD patients with the PCR results and found a significant correlation between EBV infection and mural abscesses (P=0.014). Our data demonstrate that several potential pathogens can be detected in a sizeable fraction of specimens from patients with CD, but also in control patients, suggesting that the analyzed infectious pathogens may be associated with the disease, but do not represent an obligatory cause.},

METHODS: Three hundred individuals, 206 females (68.7%) and 94 males (31.3%), were submitted to a rapid and easy immunoglobulin-A-class fingertip whole blood point-of-care test in the doctor's office in order to make immediate clinical decisions: 13 healthy controls, 6 with CD suspicion, 46 treated celiacs, 84 relatives of the celiac patients, 69 patients with dyspepsia, 64 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 8 with Crohn's disease and 9 with other causes of diarrhea. RESULTS: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsies was performed in patients with CD suspicion and in individuals with positive test outcome: in 83.3% (5/6) of the patients with CD suspicion, in 100% of the patients that admitted gluten-free diet transgressions (6/6), in 3.8% of first-degree relatives (3/79) and in 2.9% of patients with dyspepsia (2/69). In all these individuals duodenal biopsies confirmed CD (Marsh's histological classification). The studied test showed good correlation with serologic antibodies, endoscopic and histological findings. CONCLUSION: The point-of-care test was as reliable as conventional serological tests in detecting CD cases and in CD diet monitoring.},

OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of ASCA positivity in patients with Crohn's disease and celiac disease in relation to healthy individuals. METHODS: A total of 145 individuals were studied: 36 with Crohn's disease and 52 with celiac disease, that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for both affections, and 57 healthy individuals for control. The celiac patients were divided as follow: group CeD I at diagnosis (n = 34), group CeD II with gluten-free diet compliance (n = 13) and group CeD III with transgressions to the diet (n = 5). ASCA IgA and IgG were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: With statistical significance, ASCA IgA were positive in Crohn's disease, celiac disease at diagnosis and celiac disease with diet transgressions; ASCA IgG in Crohn's disease and in all groups with celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of ASCA in patients with celiac disease allows to suggest that ASCA is not a specific marker for Crohn's disease, but was associated with the inflammation of the small intestine. The increased levels of positive ASCA may be due to genetic factors and increased intestinal permeability.},

   abstract = {Vitamin D is the critical hormone for intestinal absorption of calcium. Optimal calcium absorption is important for proper mineralization of bone in the prevention of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures, among other important functions. Diseases associated with gut inflammation, such as Crohn's disease (CD), may impair calcium absorption. This pilot study evaluated vitamin D- dependent calcium absorption in subjects with CD. Male subjects with CD (n=4) and healthy age-matched controls (n=5) were studied. All subjects had fractional calcium absorption (FCA; by the dual calcium isotope method), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, serum calcium and 24 h urinary calcium excretion measurements at baseline. The FCA in response to vitamin D therapy was re-assessed following administration of oral calcitriol 0.25 mcg twice daily for 1 wk, followed by oral calcitriol 0.50 mcg twice daily for 1 wk. Serum calcium and 24 h urinary calcium determinations were re-assessed after each increasing dose of calcitriol as safety measures. There was no significant difference in calcium FCA at baseline or after increasing doses of calcitriol between the CD and controls. FCA in the control and CD group was approximately 35% at baseline, which increased to 60% after calcitriol therapy. No subject developed hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria. Our results suggest that CD patients have a normal response to vitamin D in enhancing the efficacy of calcium absorption. This suggests that stable CD patients can follow calcium and vitamin D guidelines of non-CD adults. Other factors independent of vitamin D status may impair intestinal calcium absorption in CD, including the degree and location of inflammation, presence of surgical resection and/or use of glucocorticoids.},

METHODOLOGY: We cross-sectionally evaluated the effect of multiple clinical factors including enteral nutrition on the health-related quality of life of Crohn's disease patients focusing on patient disease duration using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire. RESULTS: Of all 126 patients examined, 95 patients were receiving enteral nutrition. Multiple linear regression analysis using 18 clinical parameters revealed that disease activity was a dominant factor that affected the health-related quality of life of Crohn's disease patients, and that enteral nutrition was also an independent factor that improved the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire total score, bowel symptoms, and systemic symptoms for patients with a disease duration of 10 years or more (P = 0.0090, 0.0033, and 0.016, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutrition improved the health-related quality of life of Crohn's disease patients with long-term disease duration. Thus, enteral nutrition should be recommended as one of the options for maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK), menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of these vitamins.},

Furthermore, a significant number of IBD patients fail to comply with treatment. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of non-adherence the use of CAM in Hungarian patients with IBD. METHODS: A total of 655 consecutive IBD patients (Crohn's disease [CD]: 344, age: 38.2 + or - 12.9 years; ulcerative colitis [UC]: 311, age: 44.9 + or - 15.3 years) were interviewed during the visit at specialists by self-administered questionnaire including demographic and disease-related data, as well as items analyzing the extent of non-adherence and CAM use. Patients taking more then 80% of each prescribed medicine were classified as adherent. RESULTS: The overall rate of self reported non-adherence (CD: 20.9%, UC: 20.6%) and CAM (CD: 31.7%, UC: 30.9%) use was not different between CD and UC. The most common causes of non-adherence were: forgetfulness (47.8%), too many/unnecessary pills (39.7%), being afraid of side effects (27.9%) and too frequent dosing. Most common forms of CAM were herbal tee (47.3%), homeopathy (14.6%), special diet (12.2%), and acupuncture (5.8%). In CD, disease duration, date of last follow-up visit, educational level and previous surgeries were predicting factors for non-adherence. Alternative medicine use was associated in both diseases with younger age, higher educational level and immunosuppressant use. In addition, CAM use in UC was more common in females and in patients with supportive psychiatric/psychological therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherence and CAM use is common in patients with IBD. Special attention should be paid to explore the identified predictive factors during follow-up visits to improve adherence to therapy and improving patient-doctor relationship.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is only partially understood; various environmental and host (e.g. genetic, epithelial, immune, and nonimmune) factors are involved. The critical role for environmental factors is strongly supported by recent worldwide trends in IBD epidemiology. One important environmental factor is smoking. A meta-analysis partially confirms previous findings that smoking was found to be protective against ulcerative colitis and, after the onset of the disease, might improve its course, decreasing the need for colectomy. In contrast, smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease and aggravates its course. The history of IBD is dotted by cyclic reports on the isolation of specific infectious agents responsible for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The more recently published cold chain hypothesis is providing an even broader platform by linking dietary factors and microbial agents. An additional, recent theory has suggested a breakdown in the balance between putative species of 'protective' versus 'harmful' intestinal bacteria - this concept has been termed dysbiosis resulting in decreased bacterial diversity. Other factors such as oral contraceptive use, appendectomy, dietary factors (e.g. refined sugar, fat, and fast food), perinatal events, and childhood infections have also been associated with both diseases, but their role is more controversial. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that economic development, leading to improved hygiene and other changes in lifestyle ('westernized lifestyle') may play a role in the increase in IBD. This review article focuses on the role of environmental factors in the pathogenesis and progression of IBDs.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two main disorders, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, that cause chronic, recurrent inflammation of the intestine. An inappropriate immune response to the enteric ecosystem has been postulated to cause IBD. Genomewide association studies provide the information of diverse genetic variations and susceptibilities to patients with IBD. Through the application of these studies, the pathogenesis of IBD may result in part from genetic abnormalities that regulate epithelial barrier function and innate and adaptive immune responses. Crohn's disease shows strong association with CARD15, ATG15L1, and IRGM, which are involved in the innate immunity. In the adaptive immune response, IL23R, MST1, IL12B, and STAT3 polymorphisms are associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Current pharmacologic treatment of IBD, including 5-aminosalycylate, steroids, and immunomodulator therapy, are mainly aimed at suppressing inflammation non-specifically, except biologic therapies such as anti-tumor necrosis factor molecule, which block specific proinflammatory molecules. For nutritional issues in IBD, the mainstay of therapy has been supportive, with particular attention paid to the prevention, recognition, and therapy of nutritional deficiencies, and individual outcomes to specific dietary factors have been controversial. Parenteral nutritional support and exclusionary diets have been investigated and are not the subject of this review. The emerging concepts of nutrition-gene interaction gave birth to unique scientific fields, nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics. These studies provide information about 1) the genetic variability that induces an individual's response to nutrition according to particular states of health and disease and 2) changes in gene expression that develop as a result of nutrition-gene interaction. For IBD, the role of diet in the regulation of the immune response against gut flora is the subject of current intensive evaluation. These approaches may lead clinicians to derive a personalized nutritional prescription based on individual genetic variations and may result in a significant impact on IBD treatment.},

Low body weight is associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in CD, although the relative importance of its components, lean and fat mass, is unclear. Muscle strength is also a predictor of BMD in nondiseased populations; however, its association with bone in CD is unknown. We examined the independent effects of body composition and muscle strength on regional and whole-body BMD in a cohort of CD patients. Sixty men and women, aged 22-72 years, with disease duration of 13 +/- 7 years, underwent scanning of the spine, hip, forearm, and whole-body BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Lean tissue, appendicular muscle mass (AMM), and fat mass were derived by DXA and grip strength by dynamometry. Medical history, medication usage, clinical variables, and nutritional intake were obtained by questionnaire. Prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was 32 and 17%, respectively, with osteopenia more common at the hip and osteoporosis more common at the spine. In multiple regression analyses, AMM was an independent predictor of whole-body and regional BMD whereas lean mass was an independent predictor at the hip. Neither grip strength nor fat mass was independently associated with BMD. Of the components of body composition, muscle mass was strongly associated with regional and whole-body BMD. Preserving or augmenting muscle mass in this population may be a useful strategy to preserve BMD and thereby reduce fracture risk.},

   abstract = {Prebiotics are nondigestible fermentable fibers that are reported to have health benefits for the host. Older as well as more recent studies show beneficial effects in experimental colitis and lately also in human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and chronic pouchitis. In this review we give an overview of the benefits of prebiotics in rodent IBD models and in IBD patients and discuss their possible protective mechanisms. Commensal intestinal bacteria induce and perpetuate chronic intestinal inflammation, whereas others are protective. However, most of the current medications are directed against the exaggerated proinflammatory immune response of the host, some of them toxic and costly. Feeding prebiotics changes the composition of the intestinal microflora toward more protective intestinal bacteria and alters systemic and mucosal immune responses of the host. Therapy for IBD targeting intestinal bacteria and their function is just emerging. Prebiotics have the promise to be relatively safe, inexpensive, and easy to administer. Unraveling their protective mechanisms will help to develop rational applications of prebiotics. However, the initial promising results with dietary prebiotics in preclinical trials as well as small studies in human IBD will need to be confirmed in large randomized controlled clinical trials.},

   abstract = {Butyrate-producing bacteria play a key role in colonic health in humans. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of the diversity, metabolism and microbial ecology of this functionally important group of bacteria. Human colonic butyrate producers are Gram-positive firmicutes, but are phylogenetically diverse, with the two most abundant groups related to Eubacterium rectale/Roseburia spp. and to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Five different arrangements have been identified for the genes of the central pathway involved in butyrate synthesis, while in most cases butyryl-CoA : acetate CoA-transferase, rather than butyrate kinase, appears to perform the final step in butyrate synthesis. Mechanisms have been proposed recently in non-gut Clostridium spp. whereby butyrate synthesis can result in energy generation via both substrate-level phosphorylation and proton gradients. Here we suggest that these mechanisms also apply to the majority of butyrate producers from the human colon. The roles of these bacteria in the gut community and their influence on health are now being uncovered, taking advantage of the availability of cultured isolates and molecular methodologies. Populations of F. prausnitzii are reported to be decreased in Crohn's disease, for example, while populations of Roseburia relatives appear to be particularly sensitive to the diet composition in human volunteer studies.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from the interaction between an individual's immune response and precipitant environmental factors, which generate an anomalous chronic inflammatory response in those who are genetically predisposed. Various feeding practices have been implicated in the origin of IBD based on epidemiological observations in developed countries, but we do not have solid evidence for the etiological role played by specific food types. IBD is associated with frequent nutritional deficiencies, the pattern and severity of which depends on the extent, duration and activity of the inflammation. Nutritional support allows these deficiencies in calories, macro- and micro-nutrients to be rectified. Enteral nutrition is also a primary therapy for IBD, especially for Crohn's disease, as it allows the inflammatory activity to be controlled, kept in remission, and prevents or delays the need for surgery. Nutritional support is especially important in childhood IBD as an alternative to pharmacological treatment. This report discusses the complex relationship between diet and IBD.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate whether symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), before diagnosis modify dietary habits, and to investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in comparison with an age-matched healthy control group. METHODS: Overall, 83 new cases of IBD (41 ulcerative colitis, 42 Crohn's disease) and 160 healthy controls were studied. Portions per week of 34 foods and beverages before onset of symptoms were recorded using a validated questionnaire. Duration of symptoms before IBD diagnosis, presence of specific symptoms and their impact on subjective changes in usual dietary habits were also recorded. The association between diet and IBD was investigated by multiple logistic regression and dietary patterns were assessed by factor analysis. RESULTS: Changes in dietary habits, due to the presence of symptoms, were reported by 38.6% of patients and were not significantly related to specific symptoms, rather to long duration of symptoms, only in Crohn's disease patients. In IBD patients who did not change dietary habits, moderate and high consumption of margarine (OR = 11.8 and OR = 21.37) was associated with ulcerative colitis, whilst high consumption of red meat (OR = 7.8) and high intake of cheese were associated with Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: More than one third of IBD patients change dietary habits before diagnosis. Margarine, red meat and cheese increase the risk of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Enteral nutrition has a primary therapeutic effect in active Crohn's disease. It is unknown which nutrient(s) account for this action, but a role for both the amount and type of dietary fat has been postulated. Some clinical and experimental data suggest that medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) may reduce intestinal inflammation. We aimed to assess the effect of replacing part of the dietary fat with MCT on the incidence and severity of colitis in interleukin (IL)-10(-/-) mice under specific pathogen-free conditions. Twenty-four IL-10(-/-) 4-wk-old mice were randomized to receive a control diet based on sunflower oil [(n-6) fatty acids (FA)] and an experimental isocaloric, isonitrogenous diet with 50% sunflower and 50% coconut oil (MCT diet). When the mice were 12 wk old, they were killed and the colon was examined for the presence of colitis, lymphocyte subpopulations and apoptosis, ex vivo cytokine production in supernatant of colon explants, toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-9 mRNA, and FA profile in colonic tissue homogenates. Colitis incidence was lower in the IL-10(-/-) mice fed the MCT diet (1/12) than in the mice fed the control diet (8/12; P = 0.03). The histological damage score was also lower in the former (P < 0.0005). Feeding the MCT diet resulted in fewer total and apoptotic intraepithelial CD3+ and lamina propria CD3+CD4+ lymphocytes, as well as downregulated production of IL-6 and interferon-gamma, and reduced TLR-9 mRNA. We conclude that partial replacement of dietary (n-6) FA with MCT decreases the incidence of colitis in a model of spontaneous intestinal inflammation and provide experimental arguments for a possible primary therapeutic effect of MCT in human Crohn's disease.},

Vitamin D deficiency in adults may cause osteomalacia, increase fracture risk in osteoporosis, induce cardiovascular diseases, diabetes type 1 and 2, multiple sclerosis, Lesniowski-Crohn disease, and cancer, including colon, breast, and prostate cancer. Possible causes of vitamin D deficiency in a healthy population include decreased cutaneous synthesis and an inadequate intake of vitamin D, both in food and in supplements. Vitamin D deficiency level (25(OH) D. <20 ng/mL), is fairly widespread, being found in a substantial percentage of healthy subjects around the world, regardless of race, gender and age. Daily vitamin D dose, as determined by the Food and Nutrition Board in 1997, is now rather insufficient, the biggest problem being associated with maximal vitamin D levels (50 mug/day) in actually available food supplements. Nowadays, it is recommended that adults need a minimum of 800-1,000 U/day when their exposure to the sun is inadequate (in Poland from October to April). This dosage should be provided to all subjects who avoid sunlight, as well as to those aged over 65 because of their slower skin synthesis of vitamin D and for its proven anti-fracture and anti-fall effects.},

   abstract = {Clinical studies using omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega3-PUFA) to Crohn's disease (CD) are conflicting. Beneficial effects of dietary omega3-PUFA intake in various experimental inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models have been reported. However, animal models of large intestinal inflammation have been used in all previous studies, and the effect of omega3 fat in an animal model of small intestinal inflammation has not been reported. We hypothesized that the effects of omega3 fat are different between large and small intestine. The aim of this study was to determine whether the direct effect of omega3 fat is beneficial for small intestinal inflammation. Senescence accelerated mice (SAM)P1/Yit mice showed remarkable inflammation of the terminal ileum spontaneously. The numbers of F4/80-positive monocyte-macrophage cells as well as beta7-integrin-positive lymphocytes in the intestinal mucosa were increased significantly compared with those in the control mice (AKR-J mice). The area of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1)-positive vessels was also increased. The degree of expression levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-gamma mRNA were increased significantly compared with those in the control mice. The feeding of two different kinds of omega3 fat (fish-oil-rich and perilla-oil-rich diets) for 16 weeks to SAMP1/Yit mice ameliorated inflammation of the terminal ileum significantly. In both the omega3-fat-rich diet groups, enhanced infiltration of F4/80-positive monocytes/macrophages in intestinal mucosa of SAMP1/Yit mice cells and the increased levels of MCP-1, IL-6 and IFN-gamma mRNA expression were ameliorated significantly compared with those in the control diet group. The results suggest that omega3 fat is beneficial for small intestinal inflammation by inhibition of monocyte recruitment to inflamed intestinal mucosa.},

The aim was to analyze pediatric CD activity at diagnosis, its influence on pediatrician's prescribing behavior, and clinical outcome 5 years later. METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter study we divided pediatric CD patients at diagnosis into mild or moderate-severe disease. We compared initial therapies, duration of first remission, number of exacerbations, height-for-age and weight-for-height evolvement, and cumulative duration of systemic steroid use in a 5-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Forty-three children were included (25 with mild and 18 with moderate-severe disease). Aminosalicylate monotherapy was more frequently prescribed in the mild group (40% versus 17%; P < 0.01). The median duration of systemic steroid use was 18.3 months in the mild group and 10.4 months in the moderate-severe group (P = 0.09). Duration of first remission was 15.0 months in the mild group and 23.4 months in the moderate-severe group (P = 0.16). The mean number of exacerbations was 2.2 in the mild group and 1.8 in the moderate-severe group (P = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: CD patients with mild disease were treated with aminosalicylate monotherapy more frequently. These patients, however, tend to have more exacerbations, shorter duration of first remission, and longer total duration of systemic steroid use. Our data support the concept that severity of disease at diagnosis does not reliably predict subsequent clinical course. This study suggests that there is no indication that children with mild CD should be treated differently compared to children with moderate-severe disease.},

The etiology of IBD has been extensively studied during the last several decades; however, causative factors in disease pathology are not yet fully understood. IBD is thought to result from the interaction between genetic and environmental factors that influence the normal intestinal commensal flora to trigger an inappropriate mucosal immune response. Although many IBD susceptibility genes have been discovered, similar advances in defining environmental risk factors have lagged. A number of environmental risk factors have been explored, including smoking, appendectomy, oral contraceptives, diet, breastfeeding, infections/ vaccinations, antibiotics, and childhood hygiene. However, most of these factors have demonstrated inconsistent findings, thus making additional studies necessary to better understand the etiology of IBD.},

Extensive randomized trials are lacking in this area at this time. Current trials indicate the possibility of maintaining remission in pouchitis (non-specific inflammation) and the potential for inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis.

This study aimed to define the technical success, clinical influence and tolerance of CTE in patients with suspected small bowel disease. METHODS: CTE scans of 42 consecutive patients (aged 21-78 years, 12 men) were reviewed by a single radiologist for technical adequacy and diagnosis. A panel of gastroenterologists reviewed clinical information. At a telephone interview, tolerance of CTE was graded numerically from 1 (unbearable) to 10 (excellent) and descriptively as unbearable, fair, good or excellent. RESULTS: Good or optimal distension of small bowel was achieved in 98%. The entire small bowel was imaged in 88%. Eighteen patients had a normal small bowel, whereas 12 (29%) had active small bowel Crohn disease, 4 intussusception, 3 small bowel diverticula and 7 having other diagnoses. Mesenteric lymphadenopathy was evident in 11 and fat stranding in 5. CTE resulted in a new or altered diagnosis in 13 (31%) patients and identified more extensive Crohn disease in a further 8 (19%). A change in management plan was instituted in 18 (43%) patients, with subsequent clinically significant improvement in 12. 33 (85%) described the procedure as 'fair' or 'unbearable' rather than 'good' or 'excellent'. The median tolerance score was 3 out of 10. CONCLUSION: CTE provided high-quality images in nearly all patients and had an effect on diagnosis, management or outcome in most, but was not well tolerated.},

AIM: We analyzed sensitivities and specificities of 4 IgA tTG and 3 deamidated gliadin peptide (alpha-DGP) kits. METHODS: The performance of 4 tTG IgA assays, A: Inova (Hu red blood cell), B: Binding site (rHu Ag), C: Eurospital (rHu Ag), D: Immco (rHu Ag) and 3 Inova alpha-DGP assays, E: alpha-DGP-IgA, F: alpha-DGP-IgG, and G: alpha-DGP-IgA+G was evaluated using sera from different subsets of celiac disease patients and controls; group 1: active celiac disease n=28, group 2: gluten-free diet n=54, group 3: healthy controls n=40, group 4: disease controls n=57(Crohn's disease n=17, chronic hepatitis n=40). RESULTS: Using the manufacturer's cut-off values, the sensitivities and specificities of different kits ranged from 71.4% to 96.4% and 87.5% to 100%, respectively. When group 1 was compared with disease controls, sensitivities remained the same but specificities decreased. Receiver operating characteristic plot derived cut-off values modified decision thresholds in all assays except kit (G). Kappa analysis demonstrated variable degrees of agreement. All assays demonstrated higher sensitivities for patients with higher grades of villous atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Overall sensitivity was at or below 90%, which is lower than that reported in the literature. Performance of the recombinant and red blood cell antigen-based tTG assays was similar, whereas the alpha-DGP assays demonstrated lower values. Receiver operating characteristic plot derived cut-off values altered test results. Many factors affect the results of these tests and clinicians should be aware of their limitations.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal autoimmune condition with an inappropriate immune response. We investigated DNA damage induced in vitro in lymphocytes from IBD patients caused by oxidative stress through H(2)O(2) and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and whether the plant flavonoids, quercetin and epicatechin, found in fruits, tea and soybeans could effectively reduce such stress. Lymphocytes from IBD patients and healthy volunteers were treated with 50 microg/ml H(2)O(2) or IQ in the presence of quercetin (0-250 microg/ml) or epicatechin (0-100 microg/ml). Flavonoid supplementation (250 microM quercetin or 100 microM epicatechin) caused an overall significant decrease of induced DNA damage resulting in a 48.6% (P < 0.001) reduction of H(2)O(2)-induced and a 43% (P < 0.001) reduction of IQ-induced DNA damage within the patient groups; for the control groups, reductions in DNA damage were 35.2 and 57.1%, respectively (both, P < 0.001). There was less induced DNA damage within lymphocytes from UC patients compared to CD patients for both series of experiments (H(2)O(2) and quercetin, IQ and epicatechin). In conclusion, flavonoids dramatically reduced oxidative stress in vitro in lymphocytes from IBD patients and healthy individuals. Thus, flavonoids could be very effective in the treatment of oxidative stress and encouraged in the diet of IBD patients.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory disorders of the intestinal tract with excessive production of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and reactive oxygen species. Although nitric oxide (NO) is reported to be involved in the onset and progression of IBDs, it remains controversial as to whether NO is toxic or protective in experimental colitis. We investigated the effects of oral nitrite as a NO donor on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis in mice. Mice were fed DSS in their drinking water with or without nitrite for up to 7days. The severity of colitis was assessed by disease activity index (DAI) observed over the experimental period, as well as by the other parameters, including colon lengths, hematocrit levels, and histological scores at day 7. DSS treatment induced severe colitis by day 7 with exacerbation in DAI and histological scores. We first observed a significant decrease in colonic nitrite levels and increase in colonic TNF-alpha expression at day 3 after DSS treatment, followed by increased colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and increased colonic expressions of both inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) at day 7. Oral nitrite supplementation to colitis mice reversed colonic nitrite levels and TNF-alpha expression to that of normal control mice at day 3, resulting in the reduction of MPO activity as well as iNOS and HO-1 expressions in colonic tissues with clinical and histological improvements at day 7. These results suggest that oral nitrite inhibits inflammatory process of DSS-induced experimental colitis by supplying nitrite-derived NO instead of impaired colonic NOS activity.},

Examinations for gastrointestinal lesions containing double-balloon total enteroscopy revealed erosions located longitudinally throughout the small intestine and the patient was diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD). Biopsy of the lower lip showed non-caseating granuloma and confirmed the diagnosis of CG. Despite an elemental diet and mesalazine therapy, the lip swelling persisted.

   abstract = {The exact aetiology of Crohn's disease remains unknown. The consensus is that the disease results from a complex interaction between genes, immunity and environmental factors. Diet is attractive, in theory, as an environmental risk factor in the aetiology of the disease. The epidemiological data, often impeded by methodological issues, have failed to confirm a direct link between pre-diet illness and the development of Crohn's disease. Once diagnosed, however, nutrition has an important role in disease management. Among the nutritional issues are malnutrition, weight loss and suboptimal nutritional status; these outcomes may be present at any stage of the disease but are likely to be overt during acute illness and hospitalisation. Malnutrition has been identified in approximately 40% of hospital admissions with Crohn's disease and is associated with higher mortality, longer hospital stays and higher healthcare costs. Patients in remission may indeed be overweight and appear to be influenced by the general population trends toward overweight and obesity. Irrespective of BMI, patients are at risk of micronutrient deficiencies. Vitamin D deficiency, for example, is common in Crohn's disease and has important implications for bone health. Moreover, newer evidence suggests that vitamin D has potential anti-inflammatory effects. Dietary approaches, in the form of enteral nutrition, have previously been shown to reduce inflammation and treat the active disease. Current guidelines now recommend that corticosteroids are more effective than enteral nutrition for treating adults. Enteral nutrition has important growth and developmental benefits and continues to be a recommended therapy for children with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a chronic, disfiguring, granulomatous inflammation of the lips and oral mucosa. The pathogenesis is unknown, but it has been linked previously to Crohn's disease (CD) and more recently to dietary sensitivity. The oral mucosa is an immunologically responsive site associated with the generation of protective mucosal and systemic immune responses to vaccination and also hyperresponsiveness to allergens in some individuals. Classically, immune responses in oral mucosa are considered to be mediated by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT), secondary lymphoid follicles that are intimately associated with epithelia. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the inflammatory infiltrate in OFG and control tissue samples. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloning of PCR products, and sequencing were used to characterize the local immunoglobulin gene profile in OFG. RESULTS: We describe large, active, dendritic B cells in oral mucosa that were not associated with any organized lymphoid tissues in the local subepithelial microenvironment. They express activation induced cytidine deaminase, which is essential for immunoglobulin gene diversification by somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination. IgE is also expressed by these B cells. They do not align with any other previously described B-cell subset in secondary lymphoid tissues in terms of morphology, proliferative activity, or phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: These subepithelial dendritic B cells may contribute to the immune responsiveness of the oral mucosa, including IgE-mediated allergic responses. In patients with OFG, further understanding of the role these cells play in oral immunity may lead to novel therapeutic possibilities.},

Case-control data on New Zealand Caucasians show no differences for CD risk between individuals carrying the L503F OCTN1 C-allele when compared with those carrying the variant T-allele. However, more of the New Zealand CD cases report intolerance to maize and mushrooms than those who report beneficial effects or no differences. The OCTN1 gene encodes a transporter for ergothionine, a fungal metabolite at high levels in mushrooms but not widely common in other dietary items. An inability to tolerate mushrooms showed statistically significant associations with the variant OCTN1 genotype. That is, among those individuals reporting adverse effects from mushrooms, there was a higher frequency of the variant T-allele when compared with the general population, or with CD patients overall. We believe that this is a novel gene-diet association, suggesting that individuals carrying the OCTN1 variant single nucleotide polymorphism may have an enhanced risk of adverse symptoms associated with consuming mushrooms. Nutrigenomic approaches to dietary recommendations may be appropriate in this group.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD), a major form of human inflammatory bowel disease, is characterized by primary immunodeficiencies. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is essential for intestinal homeostasis in response to both dietary- and microbiota-derived signals. Its role in host defense remains unknown, however. We show that PPARgamma functions as an antimicrobial factor by maintaining constitutive epithelial expression of a subset of beta-defensin in the colon, which includes mDefB10 in mice and DEFB1 in humans. Colonic mucosa of Ppargamma mutant animals shows defective killing of several major components of the intestinal microbiota, including Candida albicans, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli. Neutralization of the colicidal activity using an anti-mDefB10 blocking antibody was effective in a PPARgamma-dependent manner. A functional promoter variant that is required for DEFB1 expression confers strong protection against Crohn's colitis and ileocolitis (odds ratio, 0.559; P = 0.018). Consistently, colonic involvement in CD is specifically linked to reduced expression of DEFB1 independent of inflammation. These findings support the development of PPARgamma-targeting therapeutic and/or nutritional approaches to prevent colonic inflammation by restoring antimicrobial immunity in CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neither the rate of endoscopic remission (ER) in Crohn's disease (CD) after therapy nor its role in patients' prognosis is well defined. AIM: To systematically review the current evidence on the proportion of ER of different therapies in patients with Crohn's disease and its relation with clinical outcomes. METHODS: Databases (MEDLINE and Cochrane) and manual search of manuscripts found 482 titles. Data was extracted from 24 manuscripts. RESULTS: Ten different methods were used to assess endoscopic outcomes. Corticosteroids induced a pooled proportion of patients with no ulcerations at endoscopic follow-up of 17% (95% confidence interval: 12-22%) lower than that found with infliximab [44% (34-53%)], diet [43% (33-52%)] or azathioprine [54% (38-69%)] (P<0.0001). Enteric diets and infliximab were associated with 61% (52-70%) and 70% (62-78%) reduction in endoscopic scores, respectively, significantly higher than corticosteroids [45% (39-52%)] (P=0.01) and placebo [12% (1-22%)] (P<0.0001). A linear relation between ER and clinical remission was observed with infliximab (r=0.931). Only one study tried to assess the direct correlation between ER and patients' prognosis. CONCLUSION: Available treatments induce significant endoscopic improvement. However, pooled results should be cautiously interpreted because of the diversity of measurements. A better definition of endoscopic outcomes and a prospective validation of their relevance in patients with Crohn's disease are needed.},

   abstract = {Approximately 25 % of individuals with Crohn's disease (CD), a life-long relapsing-remitting disease, are diagnosed during childhood and adolescence. Symptoms of CD, including abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea, can lead to reduced food intake, which may negatively have an impact on nutritional status during this critical period of growth and development. The aims of the present study were to assess the growth and adequacy of dietary intakes of children with CD at Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, and compare with healthy controls. Sixty-three subjects aged 10-16 years were recruited, including: children with active CD (n 18), children with CD in remission (n 23) and healthy controls (n 22). Dietary intake was assessed using a FFQ and compared with current Australian recommended dietary intakes (RDI). Growth and dietary intakes were compared between groups. Subjects with active CD had lower weight and BMI Z scores than children in remission and controls. The energy intakes of children with active CD and those in remission were significantly lower than estimated energy requirements (P = 0.001 and P = 0.03 respectively). Children with active CD did not meet the RDI for Fe and their Ca intake was lower than the RDI (P = 0.04). In conclusion, the dietary intake of children with active CD was impaired, with inadequate intakes of energy, Ca and Fe. Reduced energy intakes during active disease may contribute to poor weight gain and impaired growth. Quantifying nutrient intake and ascertaining requirements for nutritional supplementation are essential components of successful management in paediatric CD.},

Moreover, unlike the situation with respirable particles, relatively little is known about gastrointestinal intake and handling of nanoparticles. With a long term interest in gut exposure and responses to dietary microparticles, our group is now applying its expertise to nanoparticles in the gastrointestinal tract. Here we aim to address (i) the current challenges associated with the characterisation of particle-host or particle-cell interactions, (ii) the origin and mechanisms of uptake of particles in the gastrointestinal tract, especially via the Peyer's patch and (iii) potential cellular effects of nanoparticles in the generation of reactive oxygen species and inflammasome activation, or microparticles in their adjuvant activity in pro-inflammatory signalling and immune responsiveness.},

   abstract = {Many studies have looked at connections between diet, etiology, signs and symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although these connections are apparent to clinicians, they are difficult to prove qualitatively or quantitatively. Enteral feeding and polymeric diets are equally effective at bringing about remission in Crohn's disease (CD). Parenteral feeding is also effective, although none of these methods is as effective as corticosteroid therapy. However, enteral feeding is preferred in the pediatric population because linear growth is more adequately maintained via this route. Exclusion diets in patients brought into remission using an elemental diet have been shown to maintain remission for longer periods. Studies that aim to isolate culpable food groups have shown that individuals react differently on exposure to or exclusion of various foods. The commonly identified food sensitivities are cereals, milk, eggs, vegetables and citrus fruits. Studies that have looked at gut mucosal antigen behavior have shown higher rectal blood flow, in response to specific food antigens, in those with CD over healthy subjects. Exclusion of sugar shows little evidence of amelioration in CD. Omega 3 fatty acids show promise in the treatment of IBD but await larger randomized controlled trials. Patients frequently notice that specific foods cause aggravation of their symptoms. Whilst it has been difficult to pinpoint specific foods, with advances in the laboratory tests and food supplements available, the aim is to prolong remission in these patients using dietary measures, and reduce the need for pharmacotherapy and surgical intervention.},

METHOD: Forty patients with symptomatic CD were recruited. Their sera were tested for IgG4 antibodies to 14 specific food antigens and each subject's four most reactive foods were excluded for 4 weeks. Disease activity was assessed using a modified CD activity index (mCDAI). Questionnaire and inflammatory markers were measured before and on completion of the exclusion diet. RESULTS: Eleven patients did not complete the study, leaving 29 for analysis. Of these, 26 (90%) reported symptomatic improvement with a reduction in mCDAI from a mean of 171-97.5 (P = 0.0001). The ESR fell from 23 to 17 mm/h (P = 0.021) and the IgG4 titres for the excluded foods fell from a mean of 3015-2306 mcgA/l (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: IgG4-guided exclusion diets resulted in significant symptomatic improvement with an objective fall in an inflammatory marker. This approach may be useful in clinical practice.},

Klebsiella pneumoniae shares certain molecular structures present in pullulanase pulA and pulD secretion enzymes with various self-antigens present in collagens and HLA-B27 molecules, respectively. A link exists between high dietary starch intake and the growth of intestinal microflora, involving especially Klebsiella microbes. Increased exposure to Klebsiella in the gut as the result of high starch intake would lead to high production of antiKlebsiella antibodies as well as autoantibodies to the cross-reactive self-antigens with the resultant inflammation at the pathological sites. Eradication of these microbes from the gut in patients with Crohn's disease with the use of low-starch diet and antibacterial agents as well as immunomodulatory measures could be beneficial in the management of this disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is common in developed nations where the typical diet is low in fibre and high in processed food. Primary lesions overlie Peyer's patches and colonic lymphoid follicles where bacterial invasion through M-cells occurs. We have assessed the effect of soluble non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) and food emulsifiers on translocation of Escherichia coli across M-cells. METHODS: To assess effects of soluble plant fibres and food emulsifiers on translocation of mucosa-associated E coli isolates from Crohn's disease patients and from non-Crohn's controls, we used M-cell monolayers, generated by co-culture of Caco2-cl1 and Raji B cells, and human Peyer's patches mounted in Ussing chambers. RESULTS: E coli translocation increased across M-cells compared to parent Caco2-cl1 monocultures; 15.8-fold (IQR 6.2-32.0) for Crohn's disease E coli (N=8) and 6.7-fold (IQR 3.7-21.0) for control isolates (N=5). Electron microscopy confirmed E coli within M-cells. Plantain and broccoli NSP markedly reduced E coli translocation across M-cells at 5 mg/ml (range 45.3-82.6% inhibition, p<0.01); apple and leek NSP had no significant effect. Polysorbate-80, 0.01% vol/vol, increased E coli translocation through Caco2-cl1 monolayers 59-fold (p<0.05) and, at higher concentrations, increased translocation across M-cells. Similarly, E coli translocation across human Peyer's patches was reduced 45+/-7% by soluble plantain NSP (5 mg/ml) and increased 2-fold by polysorbate-80 (0.1% vol/vol). CONCLUSIONS: Translocation of E coli across M-cells is reduced by soluble plant fibres, particularly plantain and broccoli, but increased by the emulsifier Polysorbate-80. These effects occur at relevant concentrations and may contribute to the impact of dietary factors on Crohn's disease pathogenesis.},

AIM: To evaluate the relationships between inflammatory parameters, plasma lipids and phospholipid fatty acid (FA) composition in patients with active UC and CD. METHODS: Diet, the Harvey-Bradshaw Activity Index (HBAI), inflammatory parameters, lipoproteins and FA composition were assessed in 60 CD and 34 UC. RESULTS: No differences in clinical parameters were observed in the two groups. Total cholesterol correlated inversely with the number of bowel movements in both groups and directly with BMI in UC. Arachidonic acid correlated inversely with HBAI in UC and total and HDL cholesterol were inversely related to C-reactive protein (CRP) in CD while HDL correlated with CRP in UC. Docosapentaenoic acid was the only polyunsaturated n-3 FA that was correlated to CRP in both groups. Total cholesterol was independently associated in the multiple regression analysis with the number of bowel movements and systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Total and LDL cholesterol were lower in the active UC and CD than in the healthy subjects and were correlated with the systemic inflammatory status. Phospholipid FA composition was correlated to the systemic inflammatory status, but was unrelated to dietary intake and intestinal disease activity.},

In vitro fermentation was carried out using a validated, dynamic, computer-controlled model of the human colon (Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek gastro-intestinal model-2) after inoculation with pooled faeces from healthy individuals, patients with inactive IBD (Crohn's disease (CD)) or patients with active IBD (ulcerative colitis (UC)). Starch-entrapped microspheres fermented more slowly and produced more butyrate than fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) when fermented with the faecal microbiota from patients with active UC. When fermented with the microbiota from patients with inactive CD, starch-entrapped microspheres also fermented more slowly but produced similar amounts of butyrate compared with FOS. Starch-entrapped microspheres showed a greater ability to maintain a low pH during simulated-distal colon conditions compared with FOS. After fermentation with the microbiota from inactive CD patients, starch-entrapped microspheres resulted in lower concentrations of some potentially harmful gut bacteria, included in Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Fusobacterium and Veillonella, compared with FOS. These findings suggest that slow fermenting starch-entrapped microspheres may induce a favourable colonic environment in patients with IBD through high butyrate production, maintenance of low pH in the distal colon and inhibition of the growth of potentially harmful bacteria.},

However, inappropriate inflammation contributes to several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Both conditions are characterized by the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, arachidonic acid (AA)-derived eicosanoids, and other inflammatory agents (e.g., reactive oxygen species, adhesion molecules). By virtue of their anti-inflammatory action, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may be beneficial in inflammatory diseases. A large body of evidence supports a protective effect of omega-3 PUFA in experimental animal and ex-vivo models of Crohn's disease (CD), Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although fish oil supplementation in patients with IBD results in omega-3 PUFA incorporation into gut mucosal tissue and modification of inflammatory mediator profiles, the evidence of clinical benefits of omega-3 PUFA is weak. On the other hand, more convincing data support the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA in reducing pain, number of tender joints, duration of morning stiffness, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and improving physical performance in RA patients. In both IBD and RA further clinical trials with large sample size are needed to clarify the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA as a treatment.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological observations and clinical findings have strengthened the concept that both nutritional deficiencies and nutritional excesses impair the gastrointestinal response(s) and alter susceptibility to inflammation and other diseases. The interaction of micronutrient intake, biochemical indicators of nutritional status, and four specific gastrointestinal inflammation states are reviewed. These conditions include celiac disease and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies resulting from the sustained adherence to a gluten-free diet; micronutrient nutrition as an important determinant of immunity for two major types of inflammatory bowel disease: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies which may be exacerbated by the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. SUMMARY: For each inflammation 'state', enhancement of micronutrient status can improve immunocompetance and minimize therapeutic side-effects. The impact of single-micronutrient deficiencies on immune responses, and the possible impact of uncorrected micronutrient status are discussed.},

   abstract = {Almost 80 % of the dry weight of the yeast cell wall is composed of glycans including mannans, glucans and chitin. Within this variable and complex edifice, glycans play a major role in their relation with the environment. Experimental antibodies allowed to define the localization, the variability of expression and the biological role of numerous natural oligosaccharidic sequences. These glycans and their synthetic analogues were used to study the human humoral response during invasive candidiasis (IC) determined by Candida albicans and Crohn's disease (CD) where antibodies against the dietary yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been reported. On these bases, it was established experimentally and clinically that a large panel of CD biomarkers consisting in anti glycans antibodies were also generated during IC establishing a link never suspected between C. albicans and CD. We describe here the principle of this serological analysis and its perspectives related to the use of multianalyte profiling technology for a a better understanding of IC and CD pathophysiology. This may contribute to improve disease management in terms of diagnosis and therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lactobacilli are used in an attempt to maintain remission for Crohn disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of Lactobacilli compared with placebo in maintenance therapy for Crohn disease. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, OVID and BIOSIS. All randomized trials comparing Lactobacilli with placebo in maintenance therapy for Crohn disease were included. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials with a total of 359 participants met the inclusion criteria. From the meta-analyses, the relative risk (RR) of clinical relapse rate was 1.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-1.48) comparing Lactobacilli with placebo and RR of endoscopic relapse rate was 1.31 (95%CI 0.57-3.00). Subgroup analyses showed RR for clinical relapse rates of Lactobacilli versus placebo was 0.99 (95%CI 0.76-1.29) in adults, 1.85 (95%CI 1.00-3.41) in children, 1.68 (95%CI 1.07-2.64) in Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG and 0.91 (95%CI 0.68-1.23) in Lactobacillus johnsonii respectively. The pooled RR of adverse events was 0.83 (95%CI 0.61-1.12). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that compared with placebo, administration of L. rhamnosus strain GG as maintenance therapy may increase the relapse rates of Crohn disease. L. johnsonii is inefficacious in reducing the incidence of relapse.},

Diagnosis can be made at any age, no sex predominance is apparent, and while mortality rates are similar to in general population, higher rates of colorec-tal cancer are evident in most studies, probably as a consequence of long-term chronic inflammation. Probably, IBD are polygenic diseases sharing genes of sus-ceptibility for both of them (Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease), but with other specific different genes for each one. Among environmental risk factors described, smoking is the most important, with different behaviour in both diseases, though there have been described other associated risk factors like appendectomy, oral contraceptives, infections, diet, childhood hygiene, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory intake.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most moderate-severe juvenile Crohn's disease (CD) patients are in a constant catabolic state resulting in poor weight gain and growth failure. Anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and monoclonal antibody drugs, as well as growth hormone (GH), frequently fail to achieve sustained remission or reverse growth failure. OBJECTIVE: To test whether an exclusion diet with nutraceutical therapy (DNT) could induce sustained clinical remission and weight gain, and if so does this enhance the ability for GH to reverse growth failure. METHODS: An uncontrolled prospective case study was undertaken in six moderate- severe CD patients, two of whom had completed growth. All were treated with DNT. Adequate caloric and protein ( >or= 3g/kg/d) intake for catch up weight was prescribed. Dairy products, certain grains and carrageenan containing foods were eliminated. Nutraceuticals, consisting of fish peptides, bovine colostrum, boswellia serrata, curcumin and a multivitamin were administered daily. Lactobacillus GG, a probiotic, was administered twice weekly. Recombinant human GH (rhGH) was administered daily. RESULTS: Within 2 months of starting DNT all six patients went into remission, with discontinuation of all pharmacological drugs. Three patients have remained in sustained remission for 4 to 8 years. One patient with very severe CD had recurrence of CD symptoms after being in complete remission for 18 months, one patient was in remission for 3 years but symptoms recurred when she became less compliant to DNT and one recently treated patient remains in remission after 6 months. With the addition of rhGH, the 4 growing patients had good-excellent growth response CONCLUSION: DNT engendered prolonged remission and restoration of normal weight in moderate-severe juvenile CD patients, providing conditions that enabled rhGH to stimulate growth. These findings justify larger controlled trials to evaluate the long-term benefit of compliance to DNT in both juvenile and adult CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The functional outcome and quality of life after sphincter-saving operations for ulcerative colitis have not been previously assessed in Indian patients whose dietary habits and socio-cultural practices differ considerably from those in western countries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2002, we performed 46 J-pouch ileoanal anastomoses (IPAA), for patients with ulcerative colitis. Thirty-eight of these patients had had their ileostomy closure more than 4 years previously of whom 31 could be assessed by interviews and a telephonic questionnaire. Their quality of life was objectively assessed using the Cleveland Global Quality of Life (CGQL) index, a validated index for IPAA, the score being 1 in normal people. There were 20 males and 11 females with a mean age of 38 years. In the same period, six of the nine patients who did not opt to have an IPAA (permanent stoma) were assessed. These included four males and two females, mean age 45 years (36-52). RESULTS: One patient died in the postoperative period and another died 3 months after surgery from multiple small bowel perforations. Other complications included intestinal obstruction in seven, pouchitis in four and incisional hernia in two. One pouch had to be converted to a permanent ileostomy following development of a fistula because of Crohn's disease. The mean daily postoperative stool frequency was seven (range 2-20). Eighty-one percent had perfect daytime continence and 81% used dietary restrictions. Eighty-four percent rated their pouch function to be excellent or good. All patients preferred IPAA to an ileostomy citing mainly social and cultural reasons and were willing to choose it again. The mean preoperative CGQL score (0.27) increased significantly after colectomy (0.50) and after closure of ileostomy (0.77; p < 0.001). The mean CGQL in the "permanent stoma" group did not improve significantly after surgery (0.62 vs. 0.50) and four of these expressed a wish to have an IPAA. CONCLUSIONS: Restorative proctocolectomy provides a good functional outcome and improves the quality of life in Indians with ulcerative colitis and may be the most appropriate procedure for such patients in developing countries.},

We have reported the effectiveness of 'half elemental diet (ED)' as maintenance therapy for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the QOL of CD patients and medical costs of half-ED. METHODS: Fifty-one CD patients in remission were randomly assigned to a half-ED group (n=26) or a free diet group (n=25). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of relapse during a 2-year period. This time, we investigated the QOL of the patients and medical costs of half-ED, as secondary outcomes. QOL was evaluated using the Japanese version of the IBDQ scoring system, and medical costs were calculated monthly from the receipts. RESULTS: IBDQ score was not significantly different between the two groups at 1 and 13 months after the start of maintenance treatment. Medical costs were not significantly different between them either. This study showed that half-ED therapy did not affect the treatment of CD patients, neither regarding their QOL nor medical costs. CONCLUSION: This study has confirmed this half-ED therapy is beneficial for patients with Crohn's disease.},

Nutritional therapy with an elemental diet has been reported effective in improving nutritional state and suppressing inflammation, and might be expected to assist in minimizing the need for surgery. We evaluated the relationship between an elemental diet and the period that patients spent without intestinal resection. METHODOLOGY: A total of 153 patients with Crohn's disease who visited our hospital from July, 1999 to July, 2005 were enrolled. The relationship between the caloric content of an elemental diet and surgery as an endpoint was examined using Cox regression analysis. Cumulative non-operation rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical significance was determined using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Among patients with jejunoileal involvement, patients receiving an elemental diet providing 900 kcal or more per day showed a statistically significant improvement in cumulative non-operation rate. Among those without jejunoileal involvement, in contrast, the cumulative non-operation rate did not differ among those receiving an elemental diet of less or more than 900 kcal per day. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an elemental diet of 900 kcal per day may be effective in avoiding surgery in patients with jejunoileal lesions. This diet may be useful in improving long-term convalescence in these patients.},

There are no reports that have compared the effects on mid- and long-term prognosis among the induction and maintenance therapies, especially between infliximab, a chimeric antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and nutritional therapies. A total of 262 CD patients with induced remission were enrolled in the cohort study. Patients who failed to achieve remission, and patients who were lost to follow-up within 12 months were excluded. Induction therapies for CD included total elemental enteral nutrition, total parenteral nutrition, infliximab, prednisolone, and surgical resection. Maintenance therapies included home elemental diet, 5-aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, and scheduled infliximab therapy. We evaluated the possible predictive factors of relapse and surgical recurrence including the clinical backgrounds of the patients and medical therapies, using the Cox multivariate hazard analysis. The main factors that strongly affected the first relapse were scheduled infliximab therapy (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.24, p < 0.0001), surgical induction (HR = 0.19, p < 0.0001) and high frequency of previous relapse (HR = 2.56, p = 0.002). Penetrating (HR = 3.33, p = 0.009) and stricturing (HR = 6.60, p < 0.0001) disease behavior were main risk factors of surgical recurrence. Scheduled infliximab therapy is the most effective maintenance therapy in a real clinical setting with respect to the mid- and long-term prognosis.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate how quiescent CD patients cope with their conditions worsening. METHODS: A questionnaire containing six types of coping strategy for worsening conditions was created based on a semi-structured interview. Seventy-six quiescent CD patients participated in this study. We also analyzed the related factors of each coping strategy for worsening conditions. RESULTS: The total percentage of subjects who adopt the strategy of "change contents of meals" 'always' or 'often' was approximately 70%. On the other hand, the strategy of "see a doctor immediately" was approximately 20% in total of 'always' or 'often'. When 'sometimes' was added, "take extra medicine" was approximately 42%. The subjects with experience of hospitalization within 3 years (Z = -2.352, P = 0.019), presence of supplemental elemental diet (Z = -5.182, P < 0.001), or 1 year or less interval since last relapse (Z = -3.352, P = 0.001) showed a significant tendency to adopt the coping strategy of "take (add to) elemental diet." CONCLUSION: The major coping strategy was "change contents of meals," and the minor coping strategy was "see a doctor immediately." The subjects with unstable disease state adopted the coping strategy of "take (add to) elemental diet." The coping strategies for worsening conditions vary according to patients' backgrounds. The coping type should be taken into account when treating CD patients.},

   abstract = {Although providing necessary information to patients with Crohn disease (CD) can influence their quality of life, there has been no study regarding the information provided by healthcare providers to CD patients. The aim of our study was to describe the contents of brochures given to CD patients in Japanese hospitals. These brochures were compared with ones used in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Forty-nine members of the research group on inflammatory bowel disease in Japan were asked to answer a questionnaire regarding educational brochures for CD patients. We obtained 15 Japanese and three foreign brochures and conducted content analyses for seven global brochures. We received 34 replies. Only 15 (44%) of 34 hospitals gave the brochures to all newly diagnosed CD patients. In the Japanese brochures, a lot of content was devoted to nutrition therapy and self-management in terms of diet. On the contrary, foreign brochures devoted more content to symptoms and drug therapy. The existing approaches for providing information in Japanese hospitals were unsatisfactory. Furthermore, Japanese educational brochures for CD patients emphasized nutritional therapy and dietary restriction. This reflected the differences in treatment strategies among countries.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients represent a high-risk group for enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) formation, related to both their disease process and the need for multiple surgeries. Often the abdominal wall is significantly involved with the ECF and requires partial resection. The use of synthetic prosthetic material to reconstruct the abdominal wall after ECF surgery is associated with increased risk of infection and recurrent fistulas. Herein we report the use human acellular dermal matrix (hADM) in the surgical treatment and reconstruction of the abdominal wall in 11 consecutive IBD patients with complex and medically refractory ECF. METHODS: After resection of the involved bowel segment and the overlying abdominal wall, a single sheet of hADM was used to reconstruct the defect. Pre- and perioperative risk factors were reviewed and patients were followed prospectively for a year (360 +/- 118 days). RESULTS: Operative mortality was nil. Three patients (27%) developed subcutaneous seroma and there were 2 cases (18%) of superficial wound infection, all of which resolved with conservative management. The mean length of hospital stay was 13.5 (+/-7.2) days and all patients were tolerating an oral diet at the time of dismissal. There were no recurrences. One patient with Crohn's disease developed a new ECF from a separate bowel site on postoperative day 145, which was treated with the same surgical approach. No further complications have occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that in a high-risk IBD patient population with multiple perioperative risk factors the use of hADM during ECF takedown is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option.},

Both may present with similar complaints such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and bloating. Lactose, fructose and sucrose hydrogen breath tests are widely used to detect sugar malabsorption. AIM: To determine the proportion of children with symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) that have sugar intolerance as determined by using a breath hydrogen test. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled subjects with chronic abdominal pain, bloating and/or chronic diarrhea. All subjects underwent triple sugar screen hydrogen breath test (TSST) using the combined sugar solution. Breath hydrogen concentration >/= 20 ppm above baseline was interpreted a positive test for sugar malabsorption. RESULTS: A positive hydrogen breath test consistent with sugar malabsorption was found in 5 out of 31 (16%) subjects. Three of these subjects were confirmed to have lactose malabsorption based on small bowel lactase enzyme analysis or subsequent lactose hydrogen breath test. One subject with positive TSST was diagnosed with fructose malabsorption based on dietary history; he improved on a limited fructose diet, and one was diagnosed to have gastric Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: Approximately one in six children with symptoms of FGID had sugar intolerance as determined by the TSST.},

   abstract = {This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and 1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants. Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.},

   abstract = {Diet is known to play a major role in the symptoms of the inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease (CD). Although no single diet is appropriate to all individuals, most CD patients are aware of foods that provide adverse or beneficial effects. This study seeks to categorise foods in relation to their effects on symptoms of CD, in a New Zealand Caucasian population. Four hundred and forty-six subjects from two different centres in New Zealand were recruited into the study. An extensive dietary questionnaire (257 food items in 15 groups) recorded self-reported dietary tolerances and intolerances. Across each of the food groups, there were statistically significant differences among responses to foods. A two-dimensional graphical summary enabled stratification of foods according to the probability that they will be either beneficial or detrimental. A small number of foods are frequently considered to be beneficial, including white fish, salmon and tuna, gluten-free products, oatmeal, bananas, boiled potatoes, sweet potatoes (kumara), pumpkin, soya milk, goat's milk and yoghurt. Foods that are typically considered detrimental include grapefruit, chilli or chilli sauce, corn and corn products, peanuts, cream, salami, curried foods, cola drinks, high energy drinks, beer, and red wine. For a number of the food items, the same item that was beneficial for one group of subjects was detrimental to others; in particular soya milk, goat's milk, yoghurt, oatmeal, kiwifruit, prunes, apple, broccoli, cauliflower, linseed, pumpkin seed, sunflower seed, ginger and ginger products, beef, lamb, liver, and oily fish. It was not possible to identify a specific group of food items that should be avoided by all CD patients. The wide range of detrimental items suggests that dietary maintenance of remission is likely to be difficult, and to exclude a substantial number of foods. Personalised diets may be especially important to these individuals.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 (omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil) have been suggested to be beneficial in chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the efficacy and safety of n-3 for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (CD). SEARCH STRATEGY: The following databases were searched from their inception without language restriction: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Healthstar, PubMed, and ACP journal club. Experts were contacted for unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) of n-3 for maintenance of remission in CD were included. Studies must have enrolled patients of any age group, who were in remission at the time of recruitment, and were followed for at least six months. The intervention must have been fish oil or n-3 given in pre-defined dosage. Co-interventions were allowed only if they were balanced between the study groups. The primary outcome was the relapse rate and secondary outcomes included change in disease activity scores, time to first relapse and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using Jadad's criteria. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 4.2 software weighted by the Mantel-Haenszel method. Random or fixed effect models were used according to degree of heterogeneity and subgroup analyses were performed in an attempt to explore possible sources of heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: Six studies were eligible for inclusion. There was a marginal significant benefit of n-3 therapy for maintaining remission (RR 0.77 0.; 95%CI 0.61 to 0.98; P = 0.03). However, the studies were both clinically and statistically heterogeneous (P = 0.03, I(2) = 58%). Two large studies showed negative results. When considering the estimated rather than the observed 1-year relapse rate of these two studies, the benefit was no longer statistically significant (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.03; P=0.06). A funnel plot suggested publication bias. No serious adverse events were recorded in any of the studies but in a pooled analyses there was a significantly higher rate of diarrhea (RR 1.36 95% CI 1.01 to 1.84) and symptoms of the upper gastrointestinal tract (RR 1.98 95% CI 1.38 to 2.85) in the n-3 treatment group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Omega 3 fatty acids are safe but probably ineffective for maintenance of remission in CD. The existing data do not support routine maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease with omega 3 fatty acids.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are considered important pharmaconutrients for modulating mucosal immunity and therapeutic responses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We investigated the influence of diet therapy involving the use of an "n-3 PUFA food exchange table" (n-3DP) on the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membranes of IBD patients and its remission-maintaining effects. METHODS: We analyzed the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membrane before and after n-3DP intervention in 20 initial-onset IBD patients who had not undergone any dietary intervention. We then analyzed it again and evaluated disease activity after 12-18 months intervention in 230 IBD patients (168 ulcerative colitis, 62 Crohn's disease; follow-up group) in whom n-3DP was introduced after remission had been achieved. The follow-up group was divided into remission and relapse groups. RESULTS: In the 20 initial-onset patients, the mean n-3/n-6 ratio significantly increased after intervention (0.41 +/- 0.16 versus 0.70 +/- 0.20; P < 0.001). In the follow-up group the ratio in the remission group (n = 145) was significantly higher than that in the relapse group (n = 85) (0.65 +/- 0.28 versus 0.53 +/- 0.18; P < 0.001). The ratio significantly decreased in those who suffered a relapse after the beginning of treatment (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: N-3DP significantly increased the erythrocyte membrane n-3/n-6 ratio in IBD patients, and this ratio was significantly higher in the remission group, suggesting that n-3DP alters the fatty acid composition of the cell membrane and influences clinical activity in IBD patients.},

An elemental diet was started for remission maintenance. Ten years later, the patient suffered from a recto-vaginal fistula and subtotal colectomy with stoma formation was performed. At the age of 33 years, the patient was investigated for painless macroscopic hematuria and proteinuria. Renal biopsy revealed IgA nephropathy. Mizoribine was started but proteinuria persisted. Due to diarrhea she was admitted to our hospital, and scheduled maintenance therapy with infliximab was initiated. After the first infliximab infusion, the patient presented significant clinical improvement in both diarrhea and proteinuria with concomitant decrease of C-reactive protein to normal levels and proteinuria ~1 g/day. This represents the first report of infliximab treatment in a patient with IgA nephropathy associated with CD and clarifies the importance of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in immunity to renal disease. Further studies are needed to draw firm conclusions for the safety of infliximab in patients with IgA nephropathy.},

   abstract = {The Dutch national practice guideline 'Diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in adults' describes the multidisciplinary approach for adult patients with (suspected) IBD, recommended following analysis of the literature according to the principles of evidence based guideline development. The symptoms on first presentation of a patient with IBD are mainly connected with the localisation and severity of the disease and less with the resulting diagnosis 'Crohn's disease' or 'ulcerative colitis'. There is no test by which the diseases can be distinguished with certainty. Clinical course, ileocolonoscopy and histopathological investigation following biopsy form the 'gold standard' for diagnosis of IBD. The final diagnostic step is disease assessment according to the Montreal classification in order to enable unambiguous communication with medical professionals. The first aim of treatment is to treat and stabilise active disease (induction therapy); at the same time maintenance therapy is initiated. A step-up approach is recommended for both treatment aims. Surgical intervention is indicated if the medical treatment is ineffective, in case of intractable gastrointestinal bleeding, in clinically significant gastrointestinal stenosis due to fibrotic scar tissue, or if complications of the inflammation occur such as abscess, peritonitis, or complicated fistula formation. Nutrition and diet do not play a primary therapeutic role in treatment of adult patients with IBD. However, supportive nutritional care is warranted. Probiotics have a demonstrable effect in preventing pouchitis, but not in the treatment of IBD. Alternative medicine has no role to play in the treatment of IBD. The risk of developing colorectal carcinoma is slightly elevated in IBD patients. Therefore, endoscopic surveillance strategies, aimed at early detection of dysplasia, is indicated according to a schedule in which the frequency increases according to the time elapsed since first clinical signs of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation is a key player in pathogenesis. The inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha is a well known inflammatory protein, and has been a therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis and Crohn's Disease. Obesity is a well known risk factor for developing non-insulin dependent diabetes melitus. Adipose tissue has been shown to produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which has the ability to reduce insulin secretion and induce insulin resistance. Based on these observations, we sought to investigate the impact of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid in the presence of TNF-alpha in terms of insulin production, the molecular mechanisms involved and the in vivo effect of a diet high in oleic acid on a mouse model of type II diabetes, KKAy. METHODS: The rat pancreatic beta cell line INS-1 was used as a cell biological model since it exhibits glucose dependent insulin secretion. Insulin production assessment was carried out using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and cAMP quantification with competitive ELISA. Viability of TNF-alpha and oleic acid treated cells was evaluated using flow cytometry. PPAR-gamma translocation was assessed using a PPRE based ELISA system. In vivo studies were carried out on adult male KKAy mice and glucose levels were measured with a glucometer. RESULTS: Oleic acid and peanut oil high in oleic acid were able to enhance insulin production in INS-1. TNF-alpha inhibited insulin production but pre-treatment with oleic acid reversed this inhibitory effect. The viability status of INS-1 cells treated with TNF-alpha and oleic acid was not affected. Translocation of the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor transcription factor to the nucleus was elevated in oleic acid treated cells. Finally, type II diabetic mice that were administered a high oleic acid diet derived from peanut oil, had decreased glucose levels compared to animals administered a high fat diet with no oleic acid. CONCLUSION: Oleic acid was found to be effective in reversing the inhibitory effect in insulin production of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha. This finding is consistent with the reported therapeutic characteristics of other monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, a diet high in oleic acid, which can be easily achieved through consumption of peanuts and olive oil, can have a beneficial effect in type II diabetes and ultimately reverse the negative effects of inflammatory cytokines observed in obesity and non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anaemia represents a common complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Most studies on anaemia in IBD patients have been performed in tertiary referral centres (RC) and data from gastroenterologic practices (GP) are lacking. We investigated the frequency and severity of anaemia in IBD patients from tertiary referral centres and gastroenterologic practices compared to the general population. METHODS: Data were acquired from patients included in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study. IBD activity was evaluated by CDAI and modified Truelove and Witts severity index (MTWSI). Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin </=120g/L in women and </=130g/L in men. RESULTS: 125 patients from RC (66 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 59 with ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 116 patients from GP (71 CD and 45 UC) were included and compared to 6074 blood donors. Anaemia was found in 21.2% (51/241) of the IBD patients and more frequently in patients from RC as compared to GP and healthy controls (28.8% vs. 12.9% vs. 3.4%; P<0.01). IBD patients from RC suffered more frequently from active disease compared to IBD patients in GP (36% vs. 23%, P=0.032). Supplementation therapy (iron, vitamin B12, folic acid) was performed in 40% of anaemic IBD patients in GP as compared to 43% in RC. CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia is a common complication in patients with IBD and significantly more prevalent in patients from referral centres as compared to patients from gastroenterologic practices. Physicians treating IBD patients should pay attention to the presence of anaemia and ensure sufficient supplementation therapy.},

   abstract = {Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an important regulator of inflammation implicated in the development of a variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the regulation of intestinal inflammation by COX-2 is poorly understood. We previously reported that COX-2(-/-) mice fed a cholate-containing high-fat (CCHF) diet had high mortality of unknown mechanisms attributable to severe intestinal inflammation in the ileo-ceco-colic junction that presented characteristics similar to Crohn's disease (CD). To further characterize the role of COX-2 in intestinal inflammation, we established cell-specific conditional COX-2(-/-) mice. Endothelial cell-specific (COX-2(-E/-E)) and myeloid cell-specific (COX-2(-M/-M)) COX-2(-/-) mice, but not wild-type mice, on the CCHF diet developed localized CD-like pathology at the ileo-ceco-colic junction that was associated with cellular infiltration, increased expression of myeloperoxidase and IL-5, and decreased IL-10 expression. The CD-like pathology in COX-2(-E/-E) mice was also accompanied by increased expression of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, and INF-gamma), compared with wild-type mice and COX-2(-M/-M) mice. In contrast, the ileo-ceco-colic inflammation in COX-2(-M/-M) mice was associated with more pronounced infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages than COX-2(-E/-E) mice. COX-2(-ME/-ME) (COX-2(-M/-M) x COX-2(-E/-E)) mice on the CCHF diet developed CD-like pathology in the ileo-ceco-colic junction reminiscent of total COX-2(-/-) mice on CCHF diet and wild-type mice on CCHF diet treated with COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib. The pathology of diet-mediated ileo-ceco-colic inflammation in COX-2(-/-) mice offers an excellent model system to elucidate the protective roles of endothelial and myeloid COX-2 and the molecular pathogenesis of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with relapse and remission. CD patients are admitted to hospital when bowel inflammation flares up severely, which lowers their quality of life. Enteral nutrition (EN) with an elemental diet plays an important role in the treatment for CD patients in Japan, because of its few adverse effects, and it is thought to be effective in maintaining remission. We investigated the effectiveness of EN with an elemental diet with regard to the avoidance of hospitalization. METHODS: A total of 268 patients with CD who visited hospital from 2003-2008 were enrolled. The relationship between the caloric content of an elemental diet and hospitalization as an end-point was examined retrospectively using Cox regression analysis. Cumulative non-hospitalization rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Of the 268 patients, 155 received an elemental diet providing 900 kcal/day or more. Among 237 patients with ileal involvement, 135 patients receiving an elemental diet providing 900 kcal/day or more showed a statistically significant improvement in cumulative non-hospitalization rate. Among 31 patients without ileal involvement, in contrast, the cumulative non-hospitalization rate did not differ among those receiving an elemental diet of less or more than 900 kcal/day. CONCLUSION: The use of an elemental diet of 900 kcal/day may be effective in avoiding hospitalization in CD patients with ileal lesions. This diet may be useful in improving the long-term convalescence of these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Commercially available bile-acid sequestrants are not well tolerated by >80% of patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of colesevelam hydrochloride in patients who developed bile-acid malabsorption after cancer therapy. METHODS: The present study comprised 2 parts: a retrospective chart review of the electronic patient records and a patient questionnaire assessing outcome measures. All patients included in this study had a diagnosis of cancer and were being followed up in a cancer clinic at The Royal Marsden Hospital. In addition, all had symptoms of bile-acid malabsorption for >3 months and had been prescribed colesevelam in the gastroenterology clinic at the hospital. The electronic records of patients who were prescribed colesevelam between 2004 and 2007 were obtained from the hospital pharmacy. Those patients who were prescribed colesevelam and did not take any of the prescribed medication or did not return for a follow-up clinical review were excluded. To help further assess outcomes, a questionnaire was mailed to patients who were still residing in the United Kingdom, were not terminally ill, and were not lost to follow-up. The questionnaire comprised questions that assessed medication history (ie, whether patients were still taking colesevelam or not [and the reason for not taking colesevelam]), dosage, effectiveness for symptom relief, and adverse events. RESULTS: In total, 45 patients (37 women and 8 men; median age, 58 years [range, 32-89 years]) who received treatment with colesevelam between 2004 and 2007 were included. Of these, 36 were sent a questionnaire and 30 responded. Identifiable causes of bile acid malabsorption in this sample population were pelvic radiotherapy (n = 29), small-bowel resection (12), upper gastrointestinal surgery (2), high-dose chemotherapy (1), and new-onset Crohn's disease (1). Of these patients, 67% (30/45) had not previously responded to cholestyramine treatment, but following treatment with colesevelam, this group had a recorded improvement in: diarrhea, 83% (25/30); urgency of defecation, 74% (20/27); frequency of defecation, 72% (21/29); steatorrhea, 71% (12/17); abdominal pain, 68% (15/22); and fecal incontinence, 62% (13/21). Based on the medical chart review and the patient questionnaire, after colesevelam treatment, the following proportions of all 45 patients studied experienced improvement in symptoms: loose stool (diarrhea), 88% (medical chart) and 80% (questionnaire); frequency of defecation, 77% and 83%, respectively; steatorrhea, 76% and 80%; urgency of defecation, 76% and 80%; abdominal pain, 74% and 58%; and fecal incontinence, 69% and 74%. During the study period, 15 patients discontinued colesevelam: ineffectiveness, 5; adverse events, 5 (because >or=1 of the following: bloating, constipation, heartburn, abdominal pain, flatulence, or perianal soreness); and other reasons, 7 (too many tablets or tablets difficult to swallow [3]; symptoms resolved [2]; colesevelam replaced with another medication [1]; and lost to follow-up [1]). Sixty-seven percent (30/45) of patients continued using colesevelam for up to 4 years. CONCLUSION: In view of the data found in this retrospective chart review and patient questionnaire, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of colesevelam for bile acid malabsorption are warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Iron replacement therapy is a common treatment in patients with anaemia and Crohn's disease, but oral iron supplements are less tolerated. The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease is attributed to intestinal bacteria and environmental factors that trigger disease in a genetically predisposed host. The aim of this study was to characterise the interrelationship between luminal iron sulfate, systemic iron, the gut microbiota and the development of chronic ileitis in a murine model of Crohn's disease. METHODS: Wild type (WT) and heterozygous TNF(DeltaARE/WT) mice were fed with an iron sulfate containing or iron sulfate free diet in combination with intraperitoneal control injections or iron injections for 11 weeks. RESULTS: TNF(DeltaARE/WT) mice develop severe inflammation of the distal ileum but remained completely healthy when transferred to an iron sulfate free diet, even if iron was systemically repleted. Absence of luminal iron sulfate reduced cellular markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses and pro-apoptotic mechanisms in the ileal epithelium. Phenotype or reactivity of major effector intraepithelial CD8alphabeta(+) T cells were not altered in the absence of luminal iron. Interestingly, ER stress mechanisms sensitised the small intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line Mode-K to cytotoxic function of effector T cells from TNF(ARE/WT) mice. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA tags of the caecal microbiota revealed that depletion of luminal iron sulfate induced significant compositional alterations, while total microbial diversity (Shannon's diversity index) and number of total operational taxonomic units were not affected. CONCLUSION: This study showed that an iron sulfate free diet in combination with systemic iron repletion prevents the development of chronic ileitis in a murine model of Crohn's disease. Luminal iron may directly affect IEC function or generate a pathological milieu in the intestine that triggers epithelial cell stress-associated apoptosis through changes in microbial homeostasis. These results suggest that oral replacement therapy with iron sulfate may trigger inflammatory processes associated with progression of Crohn's disease-like ileitis.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammation is strongly associated with approximately 1/5th of all human cancers. Arising from combinations of factors such as environmental exposures, diet, inherited gene polymorphisms, infections, or from dysfunctions of the immune response, chronic inflammation begins as an attempt of the body to remove injurious stimuli; however, over time, this results in continuous tissue destruction and promotion and maintenance of carcinogenesis. Here we focus on intestinal inflammation and its associated cancers, a group of diseases on the rise and affecting millions of people worldwide. Intestinal inflammation can be widely grouped into inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and celiac disease. Long-standing intestinal inflammation is associated with colorectal cancer and small-bowel adenocarcinoma, as well as extraintestinal manifestations, including lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. This article highlights potential mechanisms of pathogenesis in inflammatory bowel diseases and celiac disease, as well as those involved in the progression to associated cancers, most of which have been identified from studies utilizing mouse models of intestinal inflammation. Mouse models of intestinal inflammation can be widely grouped into chemically induced models; genetic models, which make up the bulk of the studied models; adoptive transfer models; and spontaneous models. Studies in these models have lead to the understanding that persistent antigen exposure in the intestinal lumen, in combination with loss of epithelial barrier function, and dysfunction and dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Transcriptional changes in this environment leading to cell survival, hyperplasia, promotion of angiogenesis, persistent DNA damage, or insufficient repair of DNA damage due to an excess of proinflammatory mediators are then thought to lead to sustained malignant transformation. With regards to extraintestinal manifestations such as lymphoma, however, more suitable models are required to further investigate the complex and heterogeneous mechanisms that may be at play.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor bone acquisition and increased fracture risk are significant complications associated with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to determine the effects of 8 weeks of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) therapy upon markers of bone turnover in children with newly diagnosed CD. METHODS: Twenty-three children with newly diagnosed CD and 20 controls (without CD) were enrolled. Children with CD were treated with 8 weeks of EEN. Inflammatory markers [C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), albumin, platelets], nutritional markers (height, weight), and bone markers [C-terminal telopeptides of Type-1 collagen (CTX) and bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP)] were measured prior to and following therapy. RESULTS: At diagnosis, children with CD had elevated serum CTX (2.967 +/- 0.881 ng/ml) compared to controls (2.059 +/- 0.568 ng/ml; P = 0.0003). Following the period of EEN, CTX levels fell significantly (2.260 +/- 0.547 ng/ml; P = 0.002), while serum BAP levels (51.24 +/- 31.31 microg/L at diagnosis; control serum BAP = 66.80 +/- 23.23 microg/L; P = 0.07) increased significantly (64.82 +/- 30.51 microg/L; P = 0.02), with both normalizing to control levels. CONCLUSIONS: As well as reducing inflammation, decreasing disease activity, and improving nutrition in children with newly diagnosed CD, EEN therapy also normalized serum markers of bone turnover, suggesting an improvement in bone health. Further investigations of short- and long-term effects of EEN on bone density and overall bone health are now required.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Certain urinary metabolites are the product of gut microbial or mammalian metabolism; others, such as hippurate, are mammalian-microbial 'co-metabolites'. It has previously been observed that Crohn's disease (CD) patients excrete significantly less hippurate than controls. There are two stages in the biosynthesis of this metabolite: 1) gut microbial metabolism of dietary aromatic compounds to benzoate, and 2) subsequent hepatorenal conjugation of benzoate with glycine, forming hippurate. Differences in such urinary co-metabolites may therefore reflect systemic consequences of altered gut microbial metabolism, though altered host metabolic pathways may also be involved. METHODS: It was hypothesised that reduced hippurate excretion in CD patients was due to alterations in the gut microbiota, and not differences in dietary benzoate, nor defective host enzymatic conjugation of benzoate. 5 mg/kg sodium benzoate were administered orally to 16 CD patients and 16 healthy controls on a low-benzoate diet. Baseline and peak urinary hippurate excretion were measured. RESULTS: Baseline hippurate levels were significantly lower in the CD patients (p = 0.0009). After benzoate ingestion, peak urinary levels of hippurate did not differ significantly between the cohorts. Consequently the relative increase in excretion was significantly greater in CD (p = 0.0007). CONCLUSIONS: Lower urinary hippurate levels in CD are not due to differences in dietary benzoate. A defect in the enzymatic conjugation of benzoate in CD has been excluded, strongly implicating altered gut microbial metabolism as the cause of decreased hippurate levels in CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Distinguishing between the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) is important for both management and prognostic reasons. Discrimination using noninvasive techniques could be an adjunct to conventional diagnostics. Differences have been shown between the intestinal microbiota of CD and UC patients and controls; the gut bacteria influence specific urinary metabolites that are quantifiable using proton high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This study tested the hypothesis that such metabolites differ between IBD and control cohorts, and that using multivariate pattern-recognition analysis, the cohorts could be distinguished by urine NMR spectroscopy. METHODS: NMR spectra were acquired from urine samples of 206 Caucasian subjects (86 CD patients, 60 UC patients, and 60 healthy controls). Longitudinal samples were collected from 75 individuals. NMR resonances specific for metabolites influenced by the gut microbes were studied, including hippurate, formate, and 4-cresol sulfate. Multivariate analysis of all urinary metabolites involved principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). RESULTS: Hippurate levels were lowest in CD patients and differed significantly between the three cohorts (P<0.0001). Formate levels were higher and 4-cresol sulfate levels lower in CD patients than in UC patients or controls (P=0.0005 and P=0.0002, respectively). PCA revealed clustering of the groups; PLS-DA modeling was able to distinguish the cohorts. These results were independent of medication and diet and were reproducible in the longitudinal cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Specific urinary metabolites related to gut microbial metabolism differ between CD patients, UC patients, and controls. The emerging technique of urinary metabolic profiling with multivariate analysis was able to distinguish these cohorts.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The pharmacology, uses, dosages, safety, drug interactions, and contraindications of probiotics are reviewed. SUMMARY: Probiotics are live nonpathogenic microorganisms administered to improve microbial balance, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. They consist of Saccharomyces boulardii yeast or lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, and are regulated as dietary supplements and foods. Probiotics exert their beneficial effects through various mechanisms, including lowering intestinal pH, decreasing colonization and invasion by pathogenic organisms, and modifying the host immune response. Probiotic benefits associated with one species or strain do not necessarily hold true for others. The strongest evidence for the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in the treatment of acute diarrhea, most commonly due to rotavirus, and pouchitis. More research is needed to clarify the role of probiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, travelers' diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and vulvovaginal candidiasis. There is no consensus about the minimum number of microorganisms that must be ingested to obtain a beneficial effect; however, a probiotic should typically contain several billion microorganisms to increase the chance that adequate gut colonization will occur. Probiotics are generally considered safe and well tolerated, with bloating and flatulence occurring most frequently. They should be used cautiously in patients who are critically ill or severely immunocompromised or those with central venous catheters since systemic infections may rarely occur. Bacteria-derived probiotics should be separated from antibiotics by at least two hours. CONCLUSION: Probiotics have demonstrated efficacy in preventing and treating various medical conditions, particularly those involving the gastrointestinal tract. Data supporting their role in other conditions are often conflicting.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence base for the medical (pharmaceutical and nutritional) treatment of paediatric inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Key clinical questions were formulated regarding different treatment modalities used in the treatment of paediatric (not adult-onset) IBD, in particular the induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Electronic searches were performed from January 1966 to December 2006, using the electronic search strategy of the Cochrane IBD group. Details of papers were entered on a dedicated database, reviewed in abstract form, and disseminated in full for appraisal. Clinical guidelines were appraised using the AGREE instrument and all other relevant papers were appraised using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology, with evidence levels given to all papers. RESULTS: A total of 6285 papers were identified, of which 1255 involved children; these were entered on the database. After critical appraisal, only 103 publications met our criteria as evidence on medical treatment of paediatric IBD. We identified 3 clinical guidelines, 1 systematic review, and 16 randomised controlled trials; all were of variable quality, with none getting the highest methodological scores. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive review of the evidence base for the treatment of paediatric IBD, highlighting the paucity of trials of high methodological quality. As a result, the development of clinical guidelines for managing children and young people with IBD must be consensus based, informed by the best-available evidence from the paediatric literature and high-quality data from the adult IBD literature, together with the clinical expertise and multidisciplinary experience of paediatric IBD experts.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the impact of disease and treatment on the pattern of growth in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range 6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), - 0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Crohn's disease is established in laparoscopic surgery due to partial bowel dissection and low postoperative complication rate. However, laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative colitis remains further discussed even if the trend of minimally invasive technique exists. This study is to figure out how laparoscopic surgery works for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Sixteen controlled trials were identified through the search strategy mentioned below. There was only one prospective randomized study among the studies selected. A meta-analysis pooled the outcome effects of laparoscopic surgery and open surgery was performed. Fixed effect model or random effect model was respectively used depending on the heterogeneity test of trials. RESULTS: Postoperative fasting time and postoperative hospital stay were shorter in laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative colitis (-1.37 [-2.15, -0.58], -3.22 [-4.20, -2.24], respectively, P < 0.05). Overall complication rate was higher in open surgery, compared with laparoscopic surgery (54.8% versus 39.3%, P = 0.004). However, duration of laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative colitis was extended compared with open surgery (weighted mean difference 69.29 min, P = 0.04). As to recovery of bowel function, peritoneal abscess, anastomotic leakage, postoperative bowel obstruction, wound infection, blood loss, and mortality, laparoscopic surgery did not show any superiority over open surgery. Re-operation rate was almost even (5.2% versus 7.3%). The whole conversion to open surgery was 4.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative colitis was at least as safe as open surgery, even better in postoperative fasting time, postoperative hospital stay, and overall complication rate. However, clinical value of laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative colitis needed further evaluation with more well-designed and long-term follow-up studies.},

AIM: To identify dietary constituents as risk factors for development of IBD and the therapeutic efficacy of dietary modifications or enteral nutrition in IBD. METHODS: The Medline and the Cochrane Library were searched for clinical trials and meta-analyses in the scope of diet and nutrition in IBD. RESULTS: There are many studies in small cohorts of patients that claim that intake of certain diet constituents like fat, refined sugar, fruits, vegetables and fibre affect the expression of IBD. These are often compromised by insufficient data or methodological limitations and do not provide unequivocal evidence to incriminate any particular dietary factor. Among various dietary interventions, none has shown striking efficacy with the possible exception of complete enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition appears effective in both active and quiescent Crohn's disease (CD), but independent meta-analyses have shown enteral nutrition to be inferior to corticosteroids in the management of active CD, when assessed on an intention-to-treat basis. CONCLUSIONS: The current levels of knowledge concerning dietary risk factors for IBD, and the therapeutic efficacy of dietary and nutritional interventions need to be supported by well-designed trials in large cohorts of patients.},

This prospective study was to assess the efficacy of EN on the maintenance rate of clinical remission in patients with quiescent CD receiving infliximab as maintenance therapy. METHODS: Fifty-six patients who achieved clinical remission with infliximab induction therapy received infliximab as maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg, every 8 weeks). Thirty-two of the 56 patients received concomitant EN: elemental diet infusion during night-time and a low fat diet during daytime (EN group), while the remaining 24 patients received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). All patients were followed for 56 weeks; CD activity index (CDAI) was assessed and CDAI < 150 was defined as clinical remission. RESULTS: During the 56-week observation, the mean CDAI was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Seven patients in the EN group ceased EN therapy because they maintained complete remission. On an intention-to-treat basis, 25 patients in the EN group (78%) and 16 patients in the non-EN group (67%) remained in clinical remission during the 56-week observation (P = 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this prospective study showed that concomitant EN during infliximab maintenance therapy does not significantly increase the maintenance rate of clinical remission in patients with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) is unknown. Besides immunoregulatory, genetic and environmental aspects, a nutritional impact is also encountered. Whether taste perception exerts any influence on an increased consumption of carbohydrates is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nutritional habits and taste perception in CD patients, either in active or inactive disease stages. DESIGN: A prospective study was performed with 31 active and 27 inactive CD patients, and 30 age and sex-matched healthy subjects. Nutritional behavior was determined using an extensive optical nutrition questionnaire and taste perception was assessed by a 3-drop method with exceeding dilution tests. RESULTS: Active and inactive CD patients exhibited a significant increased taste threshold for the detection of all solutions (bitter: P=0.0012; salty: P=0.0198; sour: P=0.0021; and sweet: P=0.0208). For recognition, the determination of bitter solution (P=0.0014) was significantly reduced in CD patients compared with healthy subjects. No impact of clinical or objective parameters of inflammation on taste perception could be established. The consumption of refined sugar in CD patients was higher than in healthy subjects, though not significant. CONCLUSIONS: An increased taste threshold for the detection of all 4 taste qualities in active and inactive CD patients suggests a systemic pathogenesis, such as an inflammation of the oral cavity, as a manifestation of CD. In this study, changes in taste threshold were not associated with altered sugar consumption.},
