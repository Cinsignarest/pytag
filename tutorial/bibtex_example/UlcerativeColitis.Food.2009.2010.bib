   abstract = {Gastrointestinal disturbances (particularly diarrhea) are often induced in response to cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. Oral chemotherapeutic agents can induce diarrhea by damaging the intestinal lining. Two common oral drugs used in cancer treatment that are known to have gastrointestinal side effects are capecitabine and lapatinib. In this brief communication, the authors discuss a case study of a stage IV breast cancer patient whose chemotherapy-induced diarrhea was treated successfully with a multispecies combination of probiotics. This is a unique study in which grade 3 chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (characterized by 7-9 stools per day and associated with incontinence and abdominal cramping) was treated with only a multispecies combination of probiotics. Probiotics have been used to treat diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, and Crohn's disease. More recently, probiotics have been used to treat chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in colon cancer patients. This case study demonstrates that the probiotics can also be used to treat severe cases of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in breast cancer patients. The use of different probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases is an increasingly important area of study, and more research into this area is needed. This study demonstrates that probiotics should be considered for advanced breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is the largest lymphoid organ in the body containing T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Despite the fact that these cells are constantly confronted with antigen primarily in the form of food and bacteria, immune responses in the gut are tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis. Without this balance of active immunity and tolerance, mucosal inflammation may ensue, and manifest as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pernicious anemia, or celiac sprue. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that inflammatory diseases of the gut are commonly encountered in patients with primary immune deficiencies. The exact pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases in the setting of primary immunodeficiency remains unknown, however, both humoral and cell-mediated immunity appear to play a role in preventing intestinal inflammation. Patients presenting with atypical gastrointestinal disease and/or failure to respond to conventional therapy should be evaluated for an underlying primary immune disorder in order to initiate appropriate treatment, such as immunoglobulin or in more severe cases bone marrow transplantation, to prevent long term complications.},

   abstract = {We have addressed in this study the possible protective role of the main principle of turmeric pigment; curcumin on a murine model of ulcerative colitis (UC). Colitis was induced by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) (3% W/V) in drinking water to male Swiss albino rats for 5 consecutive days. DSS challenge induced UC model that was well characterized morphologically and biochemically. DSS produced shrinkage of colon length and increased the relative colon weight/length ratio accompanied by mucosal edema and bloody stool. Histologically, DSS produced submucosal erosions, ulceration, inflammatory cell infiltration and crypt abscess as well as epithelioglandular hyperplasia. The model was confirmed biochemically, and the test battery entailed elevated serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and colonic activity of myleoperoxidase (MPO). Colonic glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity and its substrate concentration; GSH, were notably reduced, while lipid peroxidation, expressed as malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and total nitric oxide (NO) were significantly increased. Prior administration of curcumin (100mg/kg, IP) for 7 consecutive days ahead of DSS challenge mitigated the injurious effects of DSS and ameliorated all the altered biochemical parameters. These results suggest that curcumin could possibly have a protective role in ulcerative colitis probably via regulation of oxidant/anti-oxidant balance and modulation of the release of some inflammatory endocoids, namely TNF-alpha and NO.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is a probiotic strain used in the treatment of intestinal immune diseases, including ulcerative colitis. The aim of the present study was to test if this probiotic bacterium can also show systemic immunomodulatory properties after oral administration. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The probiotic strain was administered to rats or mice for 2 weeks before its assay in two experimental models of altered immune response, the trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) model of rat colitis, localized in the colon, and the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of systemic septic shock in mice. Inflammatory status was evaluated both macroscopically and biochemically after 1 week in the TNBS model or after 24 h in the LPS shock model. In addition, splenocytes were obtained from mice and stimulated, ex vivo, with concanavalin A or LPS to activate T or B cells, respectively, and cytokine production (IL-2, IL-5 and IL-10) by T cells and IgG secretion by B cells measured. KEY RESULTS: E. coli Nissle 1917 was anti-inflammatory in both models of altered immune response. This included a reduction in the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-alpha both in the intestine from colitic rats, and in plasma and lungs in mice treated with LPS. The systemic beneficial effect was associated with inhibited production of the T cell cytokines and by down-regulation of IgG release from splenocyte-derived B cells. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The anti-inflammatory effects of E. coli Nissle 1917 given orally were not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To investigate the effects of human gut micro-organisms on cytokine production by human intestinal cell lines. METHODS AND RESULTS: Quantitative real-time PCR assays were developed to measure the production of pro-inflammatory (IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-18 and TNFalpha) and anti-inflammatory (TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines in HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines. They were co-cultured with a range of mucosal bacteria isolated from ulcerative colitis patients, together with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria obtained from healthy people. HT-29 cells were also co-cultured with Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The majority of commensal bacteria tested suppressed the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA, increased IL-18, reduced IL-1alpha, and with the exception of nonpathogenic E. coli, reduced TNF-alpha. All overtly pathogenic species increased both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA. CONCLUSION: Commensal and pathogenic species induced fundamentally different cytokine responses in human intestinal epithelial cell lines. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Interactions between commensal bacteria tested in this study and the innate immune system were shown to be anti-inflammatory in nature, in contrast to the pathogenic organisms investigated. These data contribute towards our understanding of how potential probiotic species can be used to suppress the pro-inflammatory response in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dinitrofluorobenzene/dinitrosulfonic acid (DNFB/DNS) model was originally described as an experimental model of intestinal inflammation resembling human ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to the absence of acceptable UC experimental models for pharmacological preclinical assays, here we examine the immune response induced in this model. METHODS: Balb/c mice were sensitized by skin application of DNFB on day 1, followed by an intrarectal challenge with DNS on day 5. We further expanded this model by administering a second DNS challenge on day 15. The features of colonic inflammation and immune response were evaluated. RESULTS: The changes observed in colonic tissue corresponded, in comparison to the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model, to a mild mucosal effect in the colon, which spontaneously resolved in less than 5 days. Furthermore, the second hapten challenge did not exacerbate the inflammatory response. In contrast to other studies, we did not observe any clear involvement of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or other Th1 cytokines during the initial inflammatory response; however, we found that a more Th2-humoral response appeared to mediate the first contact with the hapten. An increased humoral response was detected during the second challenge, although an increased Th1/Th17-cytokine expression profile was also simultaneously observed. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results, although the DNFB/DNS model can display some features found in human UC, it should be considered as a model for the study of the intestinal hypersensitivity seen, for example, during food allergy or irritable bowel syndrome but not intestinal inflammation per se.},

Some nutrients could induce a low antigenic stimuli, regulate inflammatory and immunological responses and stimulate intestinal mucosal trophism. Present available evidence supports enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease as a primary treatment if treatment with steroids is not possible (failure or contraindication) (grade of recommendation A) or either combined treatment with drugs in malnourished patients or those with inflammatory bowel stenosis. In those patients with sustained clinical remission, no benefit of either enteral nutrition or supplements in the absence of nutritional deficits has been shown. Elemental or modified formula (glutamine, omega 3 fatty acids) could not be recommended. In ulcerative colitis, nutritional influence over the activity of the disease has not been shown, although there are some promising results regarding enteric coated W3 fatty acids and a possible role for probiotics. In the treatment and prevention of pouchitis, there could be a role for probiotics (VSL#3). Nutritional treatment should be considered an integral component in the Management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex and probably multifactorial. Nutrition has been proposed to be an important aetiological factor for development of IBD. Several components of the diet (such as sugar, fat, fibre, fruit and vegetable, protein, fast food, preservatives etc.) were examined as possible causative agents for IBD. According to some researchers infant feeding (breast feeding) may also contribute to the development of IBD. Though the importance of environmental factors is evidenced by the increasing incidence in developed countries and in migrant population in recent decades, the aetiology of IBD remained unclear. There are many theories, but as yet no dietary approaches have been proved to reduce the risk of developing IBD. The role of nutrition in the management of IBD is better understood. The prevention and correction of malnutrition, the provision of macro- and micronutrients and vitamins and the promotion of optimal growth and development of children are key points of nutritional therapy. In active disease, the effective support of energy and nutrients is a very important part of the therapy. Natural and artificial nutrition or the combination of two can be chosen for supporting therapy of IBD. The author summarises the aetiological and therapeutic role of nutrition in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inappropriate responses to normal intestinal bacteria may be involved in the development of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD, e.g. Crohn's Disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC)) and variations in the host genome may mediate this process. IL-10 gene-deficient (Il10-/-) mice develop CD-like colitis mainly in the colon, in part due to inappropriate responses to normal intestinal bacteria including Enterococcus strains, and have therefore been used as an animal model of CD. Comprehensive characterization of changes in cecum gene expression levels associated with inflammation in the Il10-/- mouse model has recently been reported. Our aim was to characterize changes in colonic gene expression levels in Il10-/- and C57BL/6J (C57; control) mice resulting from oral bacterial inoculation with 12 Enterococcus faecalis and faecium (EF) strains isolated from calves or poultry, complex intestinal flora (CIF) collected from healthy control mice, or a mixture of the two (EF.CIF). We investigated two hypotheses: (1) that oral inoculation of Il10-/- mice would result in greater and more consistent intestinal inflammation than that observed in Il10-/- mice not receiving this inoculation, and (2) that this inflammation would be associated with changes in colon gene expression levels similar to those previously observed in human studies, and these mice would therefore be an appropriate model for human CD. RESULTS: At 12 weeks of age, total RNA extracted from intact colon was hybridized to Agilent 44 k mouse arrays. Differentially expressed genes were identified using linear models for microarray analysis (Bioconductor), and these genes were clustered using GeneSpring GX and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software. Intestinal inflammation was increased in Il10-/- mice as a result of inoculation, with the strongest effect being in the EF and EF.CIF groups. Genes differentially expressed in Il10-/- mice as a result of EF or EF.CIF inoculation were associated with the following pathways: inflammatory disease (111 genes differentially expressed), immune response (209 genes), antigen presentation (11 genes, particularly major histocompatability complex Class II), fatty acid metabolism (30 genes) and detoxification (31 genes). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that colonic inflammation in Il10-/- mice inoculated with solutions containing Enterococcus strains is associated with gene expression changes similar to those of human IBD, specifically CD, and that with the EF.CIF inoculum in particular this is an appropriate model to investigate food-gene interactions relevant to human CD.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) belong to the group of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), with complex ethiopathogenic factors that include an unbalanced immune and inflammatory response to commensal and food antigens. The differential diagnosis between CD and UC is performed using clinical, endoscopic, histopathological, serological and radiological methods; however between 10-15% of IBD patients are diagnosed as "unclassified colitis". Further research into IBD is necessary in order to develop additional diagnostic tools. The aim of this work was to see if the Th1, Th17 or Th2 immune pattern, represented by CD4+ lymphocytes producing IFN-gamma, IL-17 and IL-5 or IL-13, respectively (CD4/IFN-gamma+, CD4/IL-17+,CD4/IL-5+ or, CD4/IL13+), are useful peripheral markers which can be used to differentiate between UC and CD. Peripheral blood samples were taken from IBD patients from the Clinic Hospital of the University of Chile. The percentage of IFN-gamma-, IL-17-, IL-5- or IL-13-expressing CD4+ cells was determined by flow cytometry in phorbol ester- (PMA) and calcymycin-activated blood samples. The percentages of the CD4+ cell populations producing each cytokine were compared between UC and CD. IFN-gamma production by CD4+ lymphocytes was significantly higher in CD compared to UC and the control. The percentage of IL-17-expressing cells was significantly higher in CD patients compared to to the control; however, there were no differences between UC and CD; or between UC and healthy individuals. No significant differences were observed between the different groups as regards the representative Th2 cytokines. This study suggests that, under pathogenic conditions, several immune profiles may be operating, in the development of IBD. Although peripheral IFN-gamma and IL-17 expression, as indicators of the immune pattern, may help in the diagnosis of IBD, other cytokines and adaptive immune markers should be analyzed to allow better differentiation between the two entities.},

   abstract = {In this article, the recent literature exploring the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is reviewed. Epidemiologic studies present data on disease burden, but may also provide clues to disease etiology. The emergence of IBD in developing nations warrants a systematic search for environmental changes in those countries to explain the evolution of IBD. The hygiene hypothesis suggests that an alteration in the microbial environment experienced by the host facilitates the evolution of chronic immune-mediated diseases. One complex database study suggested that areas with high species richness of human intestinal helminthes are areas with genetic changes in interleukin gene loci. In other words, over the years, the microbial ecology has affected human genetics, which in turn would have an impact on immune responses. Other factors affect the gut microbiome, and several studies have explored the increase in incidence of IBD in relation to such factors as exogenous infections, use of antibiotics, and diet.},

   abstract = {Several substances, including glutamine and propionic acid but in particular butyric acid, have been proposed to be important for colonic health. beta-Glucans lead to the formation of comparatively high amounts of butyric acid, and germinated barley foodstuff obtained from brewer's spent grain (BSG), containing high amounts of beta-glucans and glutamine, has been reported to reduce the inflammatory response in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis. The present study examines how 3 barley products, whole grain barley, malt, and BSG, affect SCFA in the hindgut and serum of rats and whether the addition of Lactobacillus rhamnosus 271 to each of these diets would have further effects. Amino acids in plasma and the cecal composition of the microbiota were also analyzed. The butyric acid concentration in the distal colon and serum was higher in the malt groups than in the other groups as was the serum concentration of propionic acid. The concentrations of propionic and butyric acids were higher in the cecum and serum of rats given L. rhamnosus than in those not given this strain. The proportion of plasma glutamine and the cecal number of bifidobacteria were lower in the malt groups than in the other groups. L. rhamnosus decreased the number of cecal bifidobacteria, whereas plasma glutamine was unaffected. We conclude that malt together with L. rhamnosus 271 had greater effects on propionic and butyric acid concentrations in rats than the other barley products. This is interesting when developing food with effects on colonic health.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Comorbidity with Clostridium difficile may cause diagnostic delay in newly presenting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, trigger relapse in established disease, confound therapies, and serve as an indicator of an underlying defect in innate immunity. Retrospective analyses have suggested community acquisition; to address this we conducted a prospective analysis of C. difficile carriage in IBD patients using molecular methods specifically in an outpatient setting. METHODS: Recruited participants had long-standing diagnoses of ulcerative colitis (n = 64) and Crohn's disease (n = 58), were in clinical remission, and had no recent exposure to antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulatory drugs or recent hospitalization. Isolates were cultured from stools and confirmed by 16S sequencing. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were tested followed by further strain characterization by toxinotyping, ribotyping, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: The frequency of toxigenic C. difficile was higher in IBD patients than in healthy volunteers at 8.2 and 1.0%, respectively (P = 0.02 Fisher's exact test). All strains belonged to toxinotype 0 with rare subtypes of this group noted in five isolates and represented by an altered repressor genotype. Patients harbored a diverse range of toxigenic ribotype groups, including those previously associated with C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD) (R015, R005, and R020) and the rarer types R062, R050, and R003. Interestingly, common nosocomial groups were not identified. The considerable nonclonal distribution of distinct strains was further demonstrated by PFGE genomic fingerprinting. None of the study subjects experienced a clinical episode of CDAD during a 6-month period of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of C. difficile is increased in IBD outpatients in remission, and strain diversity is consistent with community acquisition from a multitude of sources.},

   abstract = {The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is multifactorial and involves interactions of gut luminal content with mucosal barrier and especially immune cells. Malnutrition is a frequent issue during IBD flares, especially in Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and nutritional support is frequently used to treat malnutrition but also in an attempt to modulate intestinal inflammation. The use of oral or enteral nutrition intervention in IBDs may be effective, alone or in combination with drugs, to achieve and maintain remission. However, standard diets are less effective than new-generation biotherapies and could be improved by supplementation with specific immunomodulatory amino acids. Experimental studies evaluating glutamine, the preferential substrate for enterocytes, are promising. Some clinical studies with oral glutamine in CD are until now disappointing, but new formulations and targeting could enhance glutamine efficacy at the site of mucosal lesions. The role of arginine, involved in nitric oxide and polyamines synthesis, still remains debated. However, the effects of these amino acids in IBD have been poorly documented in humans. Other candidates like glycine, cysteine, histidine, or taurine should also be evaluated in the future.},

   abstract = {Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol that exhibits pleiotropic health beneficial effects, including anti-inflammatory, cardio-protective, and cancer-protective activities. It is recognized as one of the more promising natural molecules in the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory disease of the colon associated with a high colon cancer risk. Here, we used a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse model of colitis, which resembles human ulcerative colitis pathology. Resveratrol mixed in food ameliorates DSS-induced colitis in mice in a dose-dependent manner. Resveratrol significantly improves inflammation score, downregulates the percentage of neutrophils in the mesenteric lymph nodes and lamina propria, and modulates CD3(+) T cells that express tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IFN-gamma. Markers of inflammation and inflammatory stress (p53 and p53-phospho-Ser(15)) are also downregulated by resveratrol. Because chronic colitis drives colon cancer risk, we carried out experiments to determine the chemopreventive properties of resveratrol. Tumor incidence is reduced from 80% in mice treated with azoxymethane (AOM) + DSS to 20% in mice treated with AOM + DSS + resveratrol (300 ppm). Tumor multiplicity also decreased with resveratrol treatment. AOM + DSS-treated mice had 2.4 +/- 0.7 tumors per animal compared with AOM + DSS + 300 ppm resveratrol, which had 0.2 +/- 0.13 tumors per animal. The current study indicates that resveratrol is a useful, nontoxic complementary and alternative strategy to abate colitis and potentially colon cancer associated with colitis.},

Although there are treatments for IBD, they have frequent side effects and they are not always effective; therefore there is a need for new therapies that could alleviate this condition. Two bioactive peptides present in milk (transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and casein macropeptide, also named glycomacropeptide) have been shown to have intestinal anti-inflammatory activities. In fact, TGF-beta is currently added to formulas intended for patients with IBD, and several studies indicate that these formulas could induce clinical remission. In this paper, evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory effect of TGF-beta and bovine glycomacropeptide, as well as their mechanisms of action, is reviewed, focusing on the evidence obtained in animal models.},

In ulcerative colitis (UC) butyrate oxidation has been shown to be disturbed, but it remains unclear whether this is a primary defect. The aim of this study was to measure mucosal butyrate oxidation in UC (involved and noninvolved colon) and in pouchitis and to study the relationship with endoscopic as well as histological disease activity. METHODS: Butyrate oxidation was measured in 73 UC patients, 22 pouchitis patients, and 112 controls (95 colon, 17 ileum) by incubating biopsies with 1 mM 14C-labeled Na-butyrate and measuring the released 14CO2. RESULTS: Compared with that in normal colon, butyrate oxidation was significantly impaired in endoscopically active but not in quiescent disease or uninvolved colon segments. The severity of the metabolic defect was related to histological disease activity and decreased epithelial cell height. In active pouchitis, butyrate oxidation was significantly decreased compared with that in normal ileum and excluded pouches without inflammation. The histological pouchitis score correlated significantly with butyrate oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: Active UC and pouchitis show the same inflammation-related metabolic defect. Our data suggest that the defect is a consequence of inflammation and that pouchitis is metabolically similar to active UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary arachidonic acid, an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-6 PUFA), might be involved in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). We performed a prospective cohort study to determine whether high levels of arachidonic acid in adipose tissue samples (which reflects dietary intake) are associated with UC. METHODS: We analyzed data collected from 57,053 men and women in the EPIC-Denmark Prospective Cohort Study from 1993 to 1997. Adipose tissue biopsy samples were collected from gluteal regions at the beginning of the study, the cohort was monitored over subsequent years, and participants who developed UC were identified. A subcohort of 2510 randomly selected participants were used as controls. Concentrations of arachidonic acid were measured in adipose tissue samples. In the analysis, arachidonic acid levels were divided into quartiles; relative risks (RR) were calculated and adjusted for smoking, use of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and levels of n-3 PUFAs. RESULTS: A total of 34 subjects (56% men) developed incident UC at a median age of 58.8 years (range, 50.0-69.0 years). Those in the highest quartile for arachidonic acid concentrations in adipose tissue had an RR for UC of 4.16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.56-11.04); a trend per 0.1% increase in arachidonic acid of 1.77 in RR was observed (95% CI: 1.38-2.27). The fraction attributed the highest levels of arachidonic acid was 40.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with the highest relative concentrations of arachidonic acid in adipose tissue have a significantly greater risk of developing UC. Dietary modifications might therefore prevent UC or reduce disease symptoms.},

There is evidence to support the use of probiotics in necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants and pouchitis. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics seem to ameliorate atopic diseases, in particular atopic dermatitis. The efficacy of probiotics has been shown comparable to Mesalazine regarding the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. In addition there is evidence that probiotics are useful in the prevention of pouchitis or in therapy of irritable bowel syndrome. Recent data indicate that commensals and probiotics could play a role in nutrient fermentation and energy metabolism and may be helpful in the prevention and therapy of obesity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC) is produced by Brassica food plants. PEO is a PEITC Essential Oil containing >95% natural PEITC. PEITC is known to produce various health benefits but its effect in alleviation of ulcerative colitis signs is unknown. RESULTS: In two efficacy studies (acute and chronic) oral administration of PEO was effective at remitting acute and chronic signs of ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. Disease activity, histology and biochemical characteristics were measured in the treated animals and were compared with appropriate controls. PEO treatment significantly improved body weights and stool consistency as well as decreased intestinal bleeding. PEO treatment also reduced mucosal inflammation, depletion of goblet cells and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Attenuation of proinflammatory interleukin1beta production was observed in the colons of PEO-treated animals. Expression analyses were also carried out for immune function related genes, transcription factors and cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-activated mouse macrophage cells. PEO likely affects an intricate network of immune signaling genes including a novel concentration dependent reduction of total cellular Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) as well as nuclear phosphorylated-STAT1 (activated form of STAT1). A PEO-concentration dependent decrease of mRNA of C-X-C motif ligand 10 (a STAT1 responsive chemokine) and Interleukin 6 were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: PEO might be a promising candidate to develop as a treatment for ulcerative colitis patients. The disease attenuation by PEO is likely associated with suppression of activation of STAT1 transcription and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines.},

Although it has been suggested that probiotic supplementation is an effective approach to colitis, its effects on intestinal flora and on mucosal cytokine balance have never been explored. AIM: To evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) DG, a probiotic strain, on colonic-associated microbiota, mucosal cytokine balance, and toll-like receptor (TLR) expression. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with mild left-sided UC were randomly allocated to one of three groups for an 8-week treatment period: the first group of 7 patients received oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) alone, the second group of 8 patients received oral 5-ASA plus oral L. casei DG, and the third group of 11 patients received oral 5-ASA and rectal L. casei DG. Biopsies were collected from the sigmoid region to culture mucosal-associated microbes and to assess cytokine and TLR messenger RNA (mRNA) levels by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: 5-ASA alone or together with oral L. casei DG failed to affect colonic flora and TLR expression in a significant manner, but when coupled with rectally administered L. casei DG, it modified colonic microbiota by increasing Lactobacillus spp. and reducing Enterobacteriaceae. It also significantly reduced TLR-4 and interleukin (IL)-1beta mRNA levels and significantly increased mucosal IL-10. CONCLUSIONS: Manipulation of mucosal microbiota by L. casei DG and its effects on the mucosal immune system seem to be required to mediate the beneficial activities of probiotics in UC patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate evidence for probiotic efficacy for maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1948-November 2009) was conducted using ulcerative colitis and probiotics as terms for identifying pertinent studies. Search limits included English language and humans. Additional information was obtained from bibliographies. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Prospective trials published in English and conducted in adults were included. Two open-label and 3 double-blind randomized trials evaluated probiotic efficacy for maintaining remission of UC. Clinical and surrogate markers for maintaining remission of UC were assessed. DATA SYNTHESIS: A relationship between immune response and gastrointestinal microbials appears to be involved in the mechanism of UC. Trial results comparing the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 to mesalazine have reported equivalent rates of UC relapse. Treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG strain alone or in combination with mesalazine resulted in a nonsignificant odds ratio decrease for relapse and a significant increase in time to relapse compared to treatment with mesalazine alone. Additionally, bifidobacteria-fermented milk-supplemented patients had significant reductions in UC exacerbations when compared to nonsupplemented patients. Probiotics were well tolerated, with adverse event rates similar between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Studies evaluating probiotics for maintaining remission of UC are limited by trial design and use of different probiotics with variable bacterial contents. Thus, questions remain regarding optimal probiotic, dosing, specific patient populations, and placement in therapy. To answer these questions, large, randomized, controlled trials need to be conducted before probiotics can be routinely recommended for maintaining remission of UC.},

   abstract = {The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) is highest during the peak reproductive years, hence the increased concern with the safety of IBD drugs during pregnancy. Over the past 11 years, anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy has emerged as a treatment approach for refractory IBD patients who have failed to achieve or maintain remission with corticosteroids and immunomodulator agents. The TNF-alpha inhibitors (anti-TNFs; infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol) have proven successful in inducing and maintaining remission of moderate-to-severe IBD, but recommendations for the use of these compounds during pregnancy have lacked consensus. Balanced against the potential risk of these drugs on the fetus is the well-established fact that high disease activity has been found to poorly affect pregnancy outcomes in IBD, and the potential use of anti-TNF agents may control disease flare and severity during pregnancy. Concerns regarding the effect of anti-TNFs on the pregnancy and fetus have been assuaged by registry data which has demonstrated an overall positive safety record. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization categorize anti-TNF agents as safe during pregnancy. New knowledge regarding the physiologic timing of placental transfer of therapeutic antibody subclasses and pegylated antibody fragments from the mother into the fetus has also helped to allay concerns. This review will examine the present state of knowledge regarding the use of anti-TNFs in pregnant women with IBD.},

   abstract = {The Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are debilitating conditions, characterised by lifelong sensitivity to certain foods, and often a need for surgery and life-long medication. The anti-inflammatory effects of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated acids justify their inclusion in enteral nutrition formulas that have been associated with disease remission. However, there have been variable data in clinical trials to test supplementary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in inducing or maintaining remission in these diseases. Although variability in trial design has been suggested as a major factor, we suggest that variability in processing and presentation of the products may be equally or more important. The nature of the source, and rapidity of getting the fish or other food source to processing or to market, will affect the percentage of the various fatty acids, possible presence of heavy metal contaminants and oxidation status of the various fatty acids. For dietary supplements or fortified foods, whether the product is encapsulated or not, whether storage is under nitrogen or not, and length of time between harvest, processing and marketing will again profoundly affect the properties of the final product. Clinical trials to test efficacy of these products in IBD to date have utilised the relevant skills of pharmacology and gastroenterology. We suggest that knowledge from food science, nutrition and engineering will be essential to establish the true role of this important group of compounds in these diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Studies suggest that synbiotic therapy could prove more effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) than therapies limited to probiotics or prebiotics. This study compared the effect of each of these therapies in the treatment of UC. METHODS: One hundred twenty outpatients with UC were randomly sorted into three groups of 40 patients each for probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic therapy. The probiotic group ingested one daily capsule consisting of Bifidobacterium longum 2 x 10(9) colony-forming units and the prebiotic group ingested daily 8.0-g doses of psyllium. The synbiotic group underwent both treatments. All patients completed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaires (IBDQs) at the onset of the trial, at the 2-wk midpoint, and at the 4-wk end of the trial. Blood variables were also evaluated in a subset of 32 patients randomly selected from all groups and values were compared with IBDQ scores. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients in the probiotic group, 31 in the prebiotic group, and 32 in the synbiotic group qualified for analyses. The remaining 26 patients had incomplete questionnaires. Total IBDQ scores improved within groups by the end of the trial (probiotics 162 to 169, NS; prebiotics 174 to 182, NS; synbiotics 168 to 176, P = 0.03). Individual scores improved as follows: probiotics, emotional function (P = 0.03); prebiotics, bowel function (P = 0.04); and synbiotics, systemic and social functions (P = 0.008 and P = 0.02). C-reactive protein decreased significantly only with synbiotic therapy (from 0.59 to 0.14 mg/dL, P = 0.04). There were no adverse events. CONCLUSION: Patients with UC on synbiotic therapy experienced greater quality-of-life changes than patients on probiotic or prebiotic treatment. These data suggest that synbiotic therapy may have a synergistic effect in the treatment of UC.},

Rats were allocated to three groups, Water + Vehicle, DSS + Vehicle, and DSS + L. fermentum BR11. BR11 was administered twice daily for 14 days. DSS (2%) was provided from days 7 to 14. Small-intestinal tissue was analyzed for sucrase activity, histology, and crypt cell proliferation. Increased ileum crypt depth and cell proliferation was observed in DSS-treated rats compared to controls (P < 0.05). BR11 normalized these parameters. While DSS predominantly induces colonic damage, minor morphological alterations were also detected in the distal small intestine. L. fermentum BR11 normalized these features.},

   abstract = {The aim of this article is to critically review available data regarding the safety of immunomodulators and biological therapies during pregnancy and breast-feeding in women with inflammatory bowel disease. Methotrexate and thalidomide can cause congenital anomalies and are contraindicated during pregnancy (and breast-feeding). Although thiopurines have a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rating D, available data suggest that these drugs are safe and well tolerated during pregnancy. Although traditionally women receiving azathioprine or mercaptopurine have been discouraged from breast-feeding because of theoretical potential risks, it seems that these drugs may be safe in this scenario. Treatment with cyclosporine for steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) during pregnancy can be considered safe and effective, and the use of this drug should be considered in cases of severe UC as a means of avoiding urgent surgery. Breast-feeding is contraindicated for patients receiving cyclosporine. Biological therapies appear to be safe in pregnancy, as no increased risk of malformations has been demonstrated. Therefore, the limited clinical results available suggest that the benefits of infliximab and adalimumab in attaining response and maintaining remission in pregnant patients might outweigh the theoretical risks of drug exposure to the fetus. Stopping therapy in the third trimester may be considered, as it seems that transplacental transfer of infliximab is low prior to this. Certolizumab differs from infliximab and adalimumab in that it is a Fab fragment of an antitumor necrosis factor alpha monoclonal antibody, and therefore it may not be necessary to stop certolizumab in the third trimester. The use of infliximab is probably compatible with breast-feeding.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The pathophysiological mechanisms that generate chronic inflammatory lesions in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have, at least in part, been unveiled. Abnormal communication between gut microbial communities and the mucosal immune system is being incriminated as the core defect leading to intestinal injury in genetically susceptible individuals. The therapeutic manipulation of gut microecology has attracted high expectation as a strategic area for the control and prevention of IBD. METHOD: Literature review. RESULTS: The gut is the major site for induction of regulatory T cells, which secrete immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-beta and can regulate both Th1 and Th2 responses. Recent findings suggest that some gut commensals, including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and helminths, play a major role in the induction of regulatory T cells in gut lymphoid follicles. Such T cell-mediated regulatory pathways are essential homeostatic mechanisms by which the host can tolerate the massive burden of innocuous antigens within the gut without responding through inflammation. In clinical practice, the evidence for the use of probiotics or prebiotics is strongest in the case of pouchitis. In addition, one probiotic strain appears to be equivalent to mesalazine in maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis. However, studies of probiotics in Crohn's disease have been disappointing. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to optimize the use of probiotics, prebiotics or helminths for these indications.},

Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional bowel disorder manifested by chronic, recurring abdominal pain or discomfort associated with disturbed bowel habit in the absence of structural abnormalities likely to account for these symptoms. Recently conducted appropriately powered studies with different (combinations of) probiotics show positive results on reduction of symptoms, although a considerable placebo effect is also found. Mechanistic studies aimed at pathophysiological mechanisms of inflammatory bowel diseases can identify new targets for probiotic bacteria.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The colonic mucus layer plays an important role in the protection of the intestinal epithelium and mainly consists of mucin glycoproteins (primarily MUC2 in the colon) trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) and secretory IgA. Butyrate is a major end product of fermentation of dietary fibres and is associated with beneficial effects on colonic health. Earlier in-vitro and animal studies showed that butyrate modulates MUC2 and TFF3 expression and mucin secretion, although data from human studies are not yet available. METHODS: Sixteen healthy volunteers and 35 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients in clinical remission self-administered a 60 ml rectal enema containing 100 mmol/l butyrate or placebo once daily for 2 and 3 weeks, respectively. After each treatment, biopsies were taken from the distal sigmoid for quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis of MUC2 and TFF3. In addition, mucosal sections were stained with high iron diamine-alcian blue to distinguish between sialomucins and sulphomucins. To analyse total mucin secretion and secretory IgA concentrations, 24 h faeces were collected during the day before the endoscopic examination. RESULTS: The butyrate intervention did not significantly modulate the expression of MUC2 (fold change: 1.04 and 1.05 in healthy volunteers and ulcerative colitis patients, respectively) or TFF3 (fold change: 0.91 and 0.94 in healthy volunteers and UC patients, respectively). Furthermore, the percentage of sialomucins, mucus secretion and secretory IgA concentrations were not affected by the butyrate intervention in both the groups. CONCLUSION: Butyrate exposure in healthy volunteers and UC patients in remission did not affect the measured parameters of the colonic mucus layer.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Butyrate, produced by colonic fermentation of dietary fibers is often hypothesized to beneficially affect colonic health. This study aims to assess the effects of butyrate on inflammation and oxidative stress in subjects with chronically mildly elevated parameters of inflammation and oxidative stress. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with ulcerative colitis in clinical remission daily administered 60 ml rectal enemas containing 100mM sodium butyrate (n=17) or saline (n=18) during 20 days (NCT00696098). Before and after the intervention feces, blood and colonic mucosal biopsies were obtained. Parameters of antioxidant defense and oxidative damage, myeloperoxidase, several cytokines, fecal calprotectin and CRP were determined. RESULTS: Butyrate enemas induced minor effects on colonic inflammation and oxidative stress. Only a significant increase of the colonic IL-10/IL-12 ratio was found within butyrate-treated patients (p=0.02), and colonic concentrations of CCL5 were increased after butyrate compared to placebo treatment (p=0.03). Although in general butyrate did not affect colonic glutathione levels, the effects of butyrate enemas on total colonic glutathione appeared to be dependent on the level of inflammation. CONCLUSION: Although UC patients in remission were characterized by low-grade oxidative stress and inflammation, rectal butyrate enemas showed only minor effects on inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing-remitting condition that afflicts millions of people throughout the world and impairs their daily functions and quality of life. While the aetiology of IBD is not understood well, it appears to be driven by inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Hence, there is a strong interest in agents that can block the generation or actions of inflammatory cytokines. Curcumin is a bioactive substance present in the rhizomes of the herb "Curcuma longa" which has been used for centuries in Asia, both in traditional medicine and in cooking as turmeric which gives food an exotic natural yellow color. Further, in recent years, a large number of research papers have reported intriguing pharmacologic effects associated with curcumin. These include inhibitory effects on cyclooxygenases 1, 2 (COX-1, COX-2), lipoxygenase (LOX), TNF-alpha, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and the transcriptional nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), in addition to a strong anti-oxidant effect. NF-kappaB is a key factor in the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that have a high profile in inflammatory diseases, suggesting that curcumin could be a novel therapeutic agent for patients with IBD. Therefore, in recent years, the efficacy of curcumin has been investigated in several experimental models of IBD. The results indicate striking suppression of induced IBD colitis and changes in cytokine profiles, from the pro-inflammatory Th1 to the anti-inflammatory Th2 type. In human IBD, up to now, only one open study has achieved encouraging results. In this study, patients were given curcumin (360 mg/dose) 3 or 4 times/day for three months. Further, curcumin significantly reduced clinical relapse in patients with quiescent IBD. The inhibitory effects of curcumin on major inflammatory mechanisms like COX-2, LOX, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, NF-kappaB and its unrivalled safety profile suggest that it has bright prospects in the treatment of IBD. However, randomized controlled clinical investigations in large cohorts of patients are needed to fully evaluate the clinical potential of curcumin.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been extensively studied. However, the use of probiotics and prebiotics is poorly documented, despite evidence of efficacy of particular probiotic strains in specific forms of IBD. METHODS: A case-control study comprising interviewer-administered questionnaires was conducted in IBD patients and healthy controls. Data regarding use and knowledge of probiotics and prebiotics, demographic, and clinical information were collected. RESULTS: In total, 334 participants (234 IBD, 100 controls) were interviewed. Significantly more IBD patients than controls had ever used probiotics to manage their health (Crohn's disease [CD] 43%, ulcerative colitis [UC] 51%, controls 21%, P < 0.001). Prebiotic use was negligible. On logistic regression analysis, having UC (odds ratio [OR] 4.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.27-8.12) or CD (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.66-5.60) were the strongest predictors of probiotic use. Within IBD patients the strongest predictor of probiotic use was current steroid use (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.11-5.18). IBD patients had greater probiotic knowledge scores than controls (P = 0.003), although 20% of IBD probiotic users could not provide a definition of a probiotic. Less than half of IBD probiotic users discussed probiotic use with healthcare professionals, with commercial advertising being the primary source of information. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD use probiotics to manage their health but frequently choose strains without evidence of efficacy in IBD. Patients rely on nonclinical sources of information and often do not disclose probiotic use to healthcare professionals. Conventional healthcare providers should inquire about probiotic use among their patients and offer evidence-based advice.},

   abstract = {AIM: To demonstrate the therapeutic effect of probiotics in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and their effect on inflammatory mediators and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation in these patients. METHODS: Thirty patients with mild to moderate UC were randomly classified into two groups: sulfasalazine group, who received sulfasalazine 2400 mg/d; and probiotic group, who received sulfasalazine 2400 mg/d with probiotic. The patients were investigated before and after 8 wk of treatment with probiotic (Lactobacillus delbruekii and Lactobacillus fermentum). Colonic activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was assayed with UV spectrophotometry, the colonic content of interleukin (IL)-6 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), fecal calprotectin was determined by ELISA, and expression of NF-kappaB p65 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha proteins in colonic tissue was identified by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively. RESULTS: At the start of the study, colonic mucosal injury and inflammation were demonstrated in UC patients by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and an increase in colonic MPO activity, fecal calprotectin, and expression of colonic TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB p65 proteins. The use of probiotic for 8 wk significantly ameliorated the inflammation by decreasing the colonic concentration of IL-6, expression of TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB p65, leukocyte recruitment, as demonstrated by a decrease in colonic MPO activity, and the level of fecal calprotectin compared to sulfasalazine group and the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oral supplementation with probiotics could be helpful in maintaining remission and preventing relapse of UC.},

   abstract = {In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), epithelial barrier function is impaired contributing to diarrhea by a leak flux mechanism and perpetuating inflammation by an increased luminal antigen uptake. This barrier of the intestinal epithelium is composed of the apical enterocyte membrane and the epithelial tight junction (TJ) and can be affected by TJ alterations, induction of epithelial apoptosis and appearance of gross lesions like erosions or ulcers as well as by accelerated transcytotic antigen uptake. TJ strands are reduced in Crohn's disease (CD) and strand breaks appear. Several of the 24 claudins are concerned in CD as e.g. claudin-2, -5 and -8. The epithelial apoptotic rate has also been shown to be elevated causing focal lesions. As far as regulation is concerned, Th1 cytokines like TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma are important for CD, while Th2 responses are dominated by interleukin (IL)-13 and TNF-alpha in ulcerative colitis (UC). IL-13 does stimulate epithelial apoptosis as well as upregulates claudin-2 in UC. Together with an IL-13-dependent restitution arrest, this may explain why ulcer lesions are seen already early in UC but only in advanced stages of CD. Luminal antigen uptake occurs via TJ discontinuities, epithelial gross lesions and endocytotically. Therapeutically, anti-inflammatory remedies as e.g. TNF-alpha antibodies are most effective in improving active IBD and in parallel repairing barrier function. Again, this is assumed to be due to reduced cytokine release in active IBD, as a result of immune cell apoptosis. However, other agents can also directly affect barrier function. Glutamine is discussed as a candidate for barrier therapy but has never been shown to have a direct barrier influence in CD, although it is an important metabolic fuel for enterocytes and has been shown to preserve barrier functions in laboratory models. Also, probiotics and TGF-beta and have beneficial effects in models, but no data exist on barrier repair in IBD. In contrast, zinc has been shown to improve barrier function in CD, although the inherent mechanisms are unknown. Finally, food components can strengthen the epithelial barrier as for example the flavonoid quercetin which has been shown to upregulate claudin-4 within the epithelial TJ.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls. DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4 patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20 IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P = 0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7 ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400 microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis should be explored further.},

METHODS: BALB/c mice were administered 100 mg/kg AL powder orally each day. After 7 d, colitis was induced by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) (5% W/V) in drinking water for a further 8 consecutive days. Diarrhea and bloody stools as well as colonic histology were observed. The level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in colonic sections were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: There were significant differences in mean body weight values and disease activity indices between controls and AL-treated animals. Moreover, the histological findings showed that AL treatment can prevent mucosal edema, submucosal erosions, ulceration, inflammatory cell infiltration and colon damage. In addition, immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the levels of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were also decreased in AL-treated groups. CONCLUSION: We suggest that AL can prevent intestinal damage and decrease inflammatory cytokines in mice with DSS-induced colitis. Thus, AL could prove to be a useful food for UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that has periods of exacerbated symptoms and periods that are symptom-free. The treatment of active UC with probiotic bacteria could possibly induce remission. We evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety profile of probiotic preparation VSL#3 in the treatment of mild to moderate acute UC in the pediatric population. METHODS: Eighteen eligible patients between the ages of 3-17 with mild to moderate acute UC received open-label VSL#3 daily in 2 divided doses for 8 weeks. The disease activity pre- and post-VSL#3 therapy was assessed by the simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI); Mayo ulcerative colitis endoscopic score; inflammatory markers: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP); serum cytokine profiling; and rectal tissue microbial profiling done at baseline and at week 8. RESULTS: Thirteen patients completed 8 weeks of VSL#3 treatment and 5 patients were withdrawn due to lack of improvement. Remission (defined as SCCAI <or=3) was achieved in 56% of children (n = 10); response (decrease in SCCAI >or=2, but final score <or=5) in 6% (n = 1); and no change or worsening in 39% (n = 7). Post-VSL#3 treatments demonstrated a bacterial taxonomy change in rectal biopsy. The VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials and no biochemical and clinical adverse effects attributed to VSL#3 were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of pediatric patients diagnosed with mild to moderate UC with VSL#3 resulted in a remission rate of 56% and a combined remission/response rate of 61%.},

   abstract = {Angiogenesis is required for wound healing and repair, but dysregulated angiogenesis is involved in gastrointestinal inflammation. Bacillus polyfermenticus (B.P.) is a probiotic bacterium clinically used for a variety of intestinal disorders in East Asia. Here we investigated the effect of B.P. on angiogenesis of human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMECs) and wound healing in intestinal mucosa. Exposure of HIMECs to the conditioned medium of B.P. cultures (B.P. CM) increased cell migration, permeability, and tube formation. Production of the proangiogenic cytokine IL-8 was increased by B.P. CM, and neutralizing antibodies against IL-8 or IL-8 receptor CXCR2 reduced tube formation as well as actin stress fiber formation. B.P. CM also increased NF-kappaB activation, and inhibitors of NF-kappaB suppressed B.P. CM-induced tube formation and IL-8 production. Furthermore, B.P. facilitated recovery of mice from colitis as shown by increased body weight and reduced rectal bleeding and histological severity. B.P. also increased angiogenesis and mouse IL-8 production in the mucosal layer. Collectively, these results show that B.P. increases angiogenesis of HIMECs in a NF-kappaB/IL-8/CXCR2-dependent manner. Moreover, B.P. promotes angiogenesis in the mucosa during recovery of mice from colitis, suggesting that this probiotic may be clinically used to facilitate intestinal wound healing.},

METHODS: Drug plasma concentrations and urinary and fecal excretions after a single dose (400-4800 mg) and multiple doses (3600 mg/day for 7 days) were investigated. RESULTS: All adverse events were "not serious." The peak plasma concentration (C max) was reached at 12.3-18.0 hours after a single dose, and the C max and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of mesalazine and its N-acetyl metabolite were proportional to the doses. The C max and AUC in non-Japanese subjects reported in the literature were closely correlated to findings in Japanese subjects, and external excretions were also similar in the Japanese and non-Japanese subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Asacol was safe and well tolerated in this Japanese population, and the non-Japanese clinical data could be extrapolated to the Japanese population.},

In a randomized, double-blind trial, faeces were collected from healthy volunteers, and from patients with active CD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome before and after treatment. The levels of F. prausnitzii DNA in faecal suspensions were determined by PCR. Treatment by an elemental diet was effective, resulting in decreases in both the Harvey and Bradshaw index (P<0.001) and the concentrations of serum C-reactive protein (P<0.05). The total levels of F. prausnitzii in faecal samples from CD patients at presentation were lower than those in the other groups both before and after the treatment. There was no correlation between F. prausnitzii abundance and the severity of CD before treatment. Clinical improvement unexpectedly correlated with a significant decrease in the abundance of F. prausnitzii, especially the A2-165 subgroup (P<0.05). Our data suggest that a paucity of F. prausnitzii in the gastrointestinal microbial communities is likely to be a minor aetiological factor in CD: recovery following elemental diet is attributed to lower levels of gut flora.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mesalamine and the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) are both effective agents for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. A combined therapy may have more than additive efficacy. However, mesalamine may have antimicrobial effects on EcN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 48 healthy volunteers took EcN in a run-in phase for 17 days (5-50 x 10(9) viable bacteria od). If stool samples became positive for EcN, volunteers received combination treatment with EcN plus either mesalamine (1500 mg twice a day) or placebo for 1 week. Fecal samples were further tested for EcN in 2- to 3-day intervals until a maximum of 48 weeks after treatment. Patient diaries, blood, and urine were checked to assess safety, compliance, and tolerance. RESULTS: During run-in, viable EcN were detected in 45 of the 48 volunteers (94%); 2 volunteers were positive before taking EcN. From days 1 to 7 of combination treatment (n = 40), the number of EcN-positive volunteers varied between 70% and 80% in the mesalamine group and between 85% and 95% in the placebo group. Differences between the groups were not significant (normal approximation: day 3, P > 0.15; day 5, P > 0.25; day 7, P > 0.076). At treatment discontinuation, 16 of 20 volunteers in the mesalamine group and 15 of 20 volunteers in the placebo group were EcN positive, whereas this figure dropped continuously up to week 12 after discontinuation (mesalamine, 7 of 20; placebo, 4 of 20). No differences between the groups were seen with regard to tolerance and safety. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of EcN and mesalamine has no significant effect on the survival of EcN in healthy volunteers.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aetiology of ulcerative colitis (UC) is largely unknown, although it is plausible that dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may be protective. Metabolites derived from n-3 PUFAs are less proinflammatory than those from n-6 PUFAs. Earlier, no prospective cohort studies have investigated this hypothesis, using dietary information collected from food diaries. The aim of this study was to investigate the total dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs and the specific n-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the risk of developing incident UC. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-five thousand six hundred and thirty-nine participants, living in Norfolk UK, aged 45-74 years (median age at recruitment of 59.2 years), completed 7-day food diaries. These were interpreted using a computer programme, which converted food items into nutrients, including n-3 PUFAs. The cohort was monitored for participants who developed UC. Each case was matched with four controls and an analysis performed using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: In the cohort, 22 incident cases of UC were identified after a median follow-up time of 4.2 years (range 1.8-8.3 years). A statistically significant protective odds ratio (OR) for the trend across tertiles was found for DHA [OR = 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.22-0.86, P = 0.02] and borderline statistically significant differences for trends for total total n-3 PUFAs (OR = 0.56, 95% CI=0.28-1.13, P = 0.10) and EPA (OR = 0.53, 95% CI=0.27-1.03, P = 0.06) after adjusting for age, sex, total energy intake, smoking, and other fatty acids. CONCLUSION: Total dietary n-3 PUFAs, EPA, and DHA, particularly DHA were associated with protection from UC in a cohort aged over 45 years. If the association is causal, then increasing the population's intake of n-3 PUFAs from oily fish may help prevent UC.},

CD PBMC produced more counter-regulatory cytokines with TLR agonists, while UC PBMC produced more IL-1ss and IL-10 with TLR 7/8 agonist than controls. Cytokine production by NFA PBMC did not differ from controls. CD but not UC PBMC produced more IFN-gamma and IL-17 with candida.

   abstract = {The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are T cell-mediated diseases that are characterized by chronic, relapsing inflammation of the intestinal tract. The pathogenesis of IBD involves the complex interaction between the intestinal microflora, host genetic and immune factors, and environmental stimuli. Epidemiological analyses have implicated acute bacterial enteritis as one of the factors that may incite or exacerbate IBD in susceptible individuals. In this review, we examine how interactions between the common enteric pathogen Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), the host intestinal epithelium, and resident intestinal microflora may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD. Recent experimental evidence indicates that C. jejuni may permit the translocation of normal, noninvasive microflora via novel processes that implicate epithelial lipid rafts. This breach in intestinal barrier function may, in turn, prime the intestine for chronic inflammatory responses in susceptible individuals. Insights into the interactions between enteric pathogens, the host epithelia, and intestinal microflora will improve our understanding of disease processes that may initiate and/or exacerbate intestinal inflammation in patients with IBD and provide impetus for the development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of IBD.},

   abstract = {It is well established that intestinal microbiota play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Various methods of altering the composition of intestinal microbiota have been examined. Recent evidence suggests that the administration of select prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics may improve the clinical outcome of patients with IBD. In addition, IBD patients are well known to carry a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer due to chronic inflammation. Therefore, probiotics and/or prebiotics may be appropriate treatments for prophylactic use due to their physiologic characteristics and lack of obvious toxicity. This review summarizes the current experimental and clinical knowledge about the role of intestinal microbiota in IBD, the prevention of carcinogenesis related to IBD, and its importance as a target for new forms of neutraceutical therapy.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK), menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of these vitamins.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is only partially understood; various environmental and host (e.g. genetic, epithelial, immune, and nonimmune) factors are involved. The critical role for environmental factors is strongly supported by recent worldwide trends in IBD epidemiology. One important environmental factor is smoking. A meta-analysis partially confirms previous findings that smoking was found to be protective against ulcerative colitis and, after the onset of the disease, might improve its course, decreasing the need for colectomy. In contrast, smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease and aggravates its course. The history of IBD is dotted by cyclic reports on the isolation of specific infectious agents responsible for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The more recently published cold chain hypothesis is providing an even broader platform by linking dietary factors and microbial agents. An additional, recent theory has suggested a breakdown in the balance between putative species of 'protective' versus 'harmful' intestinal bacteria - this concept has been termed dysbiosis resulting in decreased bacterial diversity. Other factors such as oral contraceptive use, appendectomy, dietary factors (e.g. refined sugar, fat, and fast food), perinatal events, and childhood infections have also been associated with both diseases, but their role is more controversial. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that economic development, leading to improved hygiene and other changes in lifestyle ('westernized lifestyle') may play a role in the increase in IBD. This review article focuses on the role of environmental factors in the pathogenesis and progression of IBDs.},

   abstract = {Abstract Extraintestinal manifestations occur rather frequently in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), e.g. ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The present paper provides an overview of the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic process, and management of rheumatic, metabolic, dermatologic (mucocutaneous), ophthalmologic, hepatobiliary, hematologic, thromboembolic, urinary tract, pulmonary, and pancreatic extraintestinal manifestations related to IBD. Articles were identified through search of the PubMed and Embase databases, the Cochrane Library, and the web sites of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (cut-off date October 2009). The search terms 'Crohn's disease', 'inflammatory bowel disease', or 'ulcerative colitis' were combined with the terms 'adalimumab', 'anemia', 'arthritis', 'bronchiectasis', 'bronchitis', 'cutaneous manifestations', 'erythema nodosum', 'extraintestinal manifestations', 'hyperhomocysteinemia', 'infliximab', 'iridocyclitis', 'lung disease', 'ocular manifestations', 'osteomalacia', 'pancreatitis', 'primary sclerosing cholangitis', 'renal stones', 'sulfasalazine', 'thromboembolism', and 'treatment'. The search was performed on English-language reviews, practical guidelines, letters, and editorials. Articles were selected based on their relevance, and additional papers were retrieved from their reference lists. Since some of the diseases discussed are uncommon, valid evidence of treatment was difficult to obtain, and epidemiologic data on the rarer forms of extraintestinal manifestations are scarce. However, updates on the pathophysiology and treatment regimens are given for each of these disorders. This paper offers a current review of original research papers and randomized clinical trials, if any, within the field and makes an attempt to point out practical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of various extraintestinal manifestations related to IBD.},

The prevalence and incidence of both forms of IBD have historically been higher in developed countries with decreasing North-South gradient. However, more recent evidence demonstrate changing demographics as countries become more developed and immigration increases from underdeveloped countries to developed countries. Typically these changes are marked by an increase in ulcerative colitis followed by an increase in CD. Thus, most if not all human populations appear to be susceptible to IBD under certain environmental influences. Several hypothesis have been advanced to explain these changing demographics including alterations in the bowel microflora, but direct experimental evidence is lacking in most cases. Celiac disease or gluten-sensitive enteropathy is a related inflammatory condition which is induced in susceptible individuals when exposed to gluten-containing foods. Similarly, the prevalence of celiac disease is increasing as the consumption of gluten-containing foods is increasing worldwide.},

   abstract = {A number of studies have been performed examining the influence of various probiotic organisms, either alone or in combination, on immune parameters, infectious outcomes, and inflammatory conditions in humans. Some components of the immune response, including phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity and mucosal immunoglobulin A production (especially in children), can be improved by some probiotic bacteria. Other components, including lymphocyte proliferation, the production of cytokines and of antibodies other than immunoglobulin A appear less sensitive to probiotics. Probiotics, including lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, administered to children can reduce incidence and duration of diarrhoea, but the precise effects depend upon the nature of the condition. Probiotic supplementation can reduce the risk of travellers' diarrhoea in adults, but does not affect duration. The effect of probiotics on other infectious outcomes is less clear. Probiotics may benefit children and adults with irritable bowel syndrome and adults with ulcerative colitis; studies in Crohn's Disease are less clear. Probiotics have little effect in rheumatoid arthritis. Probiotic supplementation, especially with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, can reduce risk and severity of allergic disease, particular atopic dermatitis; early supplementation appears to be effective. Overall, the picture that emerges from studies of probiotics on immune, infectious and inflammatory outcomes in humans is mixed and there appear to be large species and strain differences in effects seen. Other reasons for differences in effects seen will include dose of probiotic organism used, duration of supplementation, characteristics of the subjects studied, sample size, and technical differences in how the measurements were made.},

   abstract = {Prebiotics are nondigestible fermentable fibers that are reported to have health benefits for the host. Older as well as more recent studies show beneficial effects in experimental colitis and lately also in human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and chronic pouchitis. In this review we give an overview of the benefits of prebiotics in rodent IBD models and in IBD patients and discuss their possible protective mechanisms. Commensal intestinal bacteria induce and perpetuate chronic intestinal inflammation, whereas others are protective. However, most of the current medications are directed against the exaggerated proinflammatory immune response of the host, some of them toxic and costly. Feeding prebiotics changes the composition of the intestinal microflora toward more protective intestinal bacteria and alters systemic and mucosal immune responses of the host. Therapy for IBD targeting intestinal bacteria and their function is just emerging. Prebiotics have the promise to be relatively safe, inexpensive, and easy to administer. Unraveling their protective mechanisms will help to develop rational applications of prebiotics. However, the initial promising results with dietary prebiotics in preclinical trials as well as small studies in human IBD will need to be confirmed in large randomized controlled clinical trials.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two principal forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The root causes of these chronic and acute immunological disorders are unclear, but intestinal microorganisms are known to play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of disease. However, at present, there is no clear evidence for a single transmissible agent being involved in IBD aetiology. Although marked alterations occur in faecal and mucosal bacterial communities in IBD, it is unclear whether they are responsible for causing disease, or are due to changes in the gut environment that result from inflammatory reactions and extensive tissue destruction. Despite the involvement of microorganisms in inflammatory processes, antibiotic therapy has generally been unsuccessful in IBD. However, recent studies involving the use of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics suggest that there is potential for controlling these diseases through manipulation of the composition of the gut microbiota, and direct interactions with the gut immune system.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate whether symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), before diagnosis modify dietary habits, and to investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in comparison with an age-matched healthy control group. METHODS: Overall, 83 new cases of IBD (41 ulcerative colitis, 42 Crohn's disease) and 160 healthy controls were studied. Portions per week of 34 foods and beverages before onset of symptoms were recorded using a validated questionnaire. Duration of symptoms before IBD diagnosis, presence of specific symptoms and their impact on subjective changes in usual dietary habits were also recorded. The association between diet and IBD was investigated by multiple logistic regression and dietary patterns were assessed by factor analysis. RESULTS: Changes in dietary habits, due to the presence of symptoms, were reported by 38.6% of patients and were not significantly related to specific symptoms, rather to long duration of symptoms, only in Crohn's disease patients. In IBD patients who did not change dietary habits, moderate and high consumption of margarine (OR = 11.8 and OR = 21.37) was associated with ulcerative colitis, whilst high consumption of red meat (OR = 7.8) and high intake of cheese were associated with Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: More than one third of IBD patients change dietary habits before diagnosis. Margarine, red meat and cheese increase the risk of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

However, the potential link between exposure to some mycotoxins and human chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as celiac and Crohn's diseases or ulcerative colitis, has not been investigated. Instead, several theories based on bacterial, immunological or neurological events have been elaborated to explain the etiology of these pathologies. Here we reviewed the literature on mycotoxin-induced intestinal dysfunctions and compared these perturbations to the impairments of intestinal functions typically observed in human chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases. Converging evidence based on various cellular and animal studies show that several mycotoxins induce intestinal alterations that are similar to those observed at the onset and during the progression of inflammatory bowel diseases. Although epidemiologic evidence is still required, existing data are sufficient to suspect a role of some food-associated mycotoxins in the induction and/or persistence of human chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases in genetically predisposed patients.},

Epithelial and immune cells of the intestinal mucosa recognise specific bacterial molecules via Toll like and NOD like receptors and this interaction modulates the inflammatory response (activation of the NF-kappaB pathway). It is thus rational to try treatments which could modify the intestinal microbiota i.e. antibiotics, new substrates (prebiotics) or new micro-organisms (probiotics). We review the literature on existing evidence for the efficacy of probiotic strains or combinations in patients with pouchitis (good evidence), ulcerative colitis (fair evidence), and Crohn's disease (no evidence at the present time). We also discuss the mechanisms of action, the use of microbial agents as pharmacological vectors, the development of genetically modified probiotics (including a clinical pilot trial in patients with Crohn's disease), and safety issues.},

   abstract = {Over the past decade, the analysis of metabolic data with advanced chemometric techniques has offered the potential to explore functional relationships among biological compartments in relation to the structure and function of the intestine. However, the employed methodologies, generally based on regression modeling techniques, have given emphasis to region-specific metabolic patterns, while providing only limited insights into the spatiotemporal metabolic features of the complex gastrointestinal system. Hence, novel approaches are needed to analyze metabolic data to reconstruct the metabolic biological space associated with the evolving structures and functions of an organ such as the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we report the application of multivariate curve resolution (MCR) methodology to model metabolic relationships along the gastrointestinal compartments in relation to its structure and function using data from our previous metabonomic analysis. The method simultaneously summarizes metabolite occurrence and contribution to continuous metabolic signatures of the different biological compartments of the gut tract. This methodology sheds new light onto the complex web of metabolic interactions with gut symbionts that modulate host cell metabolism in surrounding gut tissues. In the future, such an approach will be key to provide new insights into the dynamic onset of metabolic deregulations involved in region-specific gastrointestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Interleukin-6 (IL-6)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signals play key roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We previously described that both intact cells and a cell wall-derived polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (PSPG) in a strain of lactobacillus [Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS)] inhibited IL-6 production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) isolated from murine IBD. Diets with LcS improve murine IBD by suppression of IL-6 synthesis in LPMCs. Moreover, LcS supplementation with fermented milk ameliorates disease activity in patients with active ulcerative colitis. Here, we focused on the specific roles of PSPG in LcS concerning their anti-inflammatory actions. PSPG derived from LcS, and no other strain of lactobacilli, inhibited IL-6 production in LPS-stimulated murine IBD LPMCs. Purified PSPG-I from LcS inhibited IL-6 synthesis in LPS-stimulated murine IBD LPMCs through the inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB. The anti-IL-6 action of LcS PSPG was abrogated by masking with monoclonal anti-PSPG-I. Furthermore, PSPG-I-negative L. casei strains (PSPG-I-negative mutant LcS: LC(DeltaPSPG-I), L. casei ATCC 334) did not inhibit IL-6 production. Finally, we confirmed the effects of PSPG-I on LcS in the models of both IBD and colitis-associated cancer (CAC). In the IBD model, ingestion of LcS improved ileitis and inhibited activation of IL-6/STAT3 signaling, while ingestion of the LC(DeltaPSPG-I) strain did not. In the CAC model, treatment with LcS, but not the LC(DeltaPSPG-I) strain, showed tumour-suppressive effects with an inhibition of IL-6 production in the colonic mucosa. These results suggested that a specific polysaccharide component in an L. casei strain plays a crucial role in its anti-inflammatory actions in chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders.},

Clinical effectiveness and dose dependency of E. coli Nissle (EcN) enemas were investigated in ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In a double-blind study, 90 patients with moderate distal activity in UC were randomly assigned to treatment with either 40, 20, or 10 ml enemas (N = 24, 23, 23) containing 10E8 EcN/ml or placebo (N = 20). The study medication was taken once daily for at least 2 weeks. After 2, 4 and/or 8 weeks the clinical DAI was assessed together with tolerance to treatment. Patients who reached clinical DAI <or= 2 within that time were regarded as responders. RESULTS: According to ITT analysis the number of responders was not significantly higher in the EcN group than in the placebo group (p = 0.4430, 2-sided). However, the Jonckheere-Terpstra rank correlation for dose-dependent efficacy indicated a significant correlation of per-protocol responder rates (p = 0.0446, 2-sided). Time to remission was shortest with EcN 40 ml, followed by EcN 20 ml. The number of adverse events did not differ notably. CONCLUSION: In contrast to ITT analysis, efficacy of rectal EcN application was significant in PP and points to EcN as a well tolerated treatment alternative in moderate distal UC.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Several probiotic compounds have shown promise in the therapy of ulcerative colitis (UC). However, a strong sustained benefit remains to be seen. Uncontrolled pilot studies suggest that a probiotic preparation (VSL#3) maintains remission in mild to moderate UC and reduces active inflammation in adult patients. Aims of our prospective, 1-year, placebo-controlled, double-blind study were to assess the efficacy of VSL#3 on induction and maintenance of remission and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the probiotic preparation therapy in children with active UC. METHODS: A total of 29 consecutive patients (mean age: 9.8 years; range: 1.7-16.1 years; female/male: 13/16) with newly diagnosed UC were randomized to receive either VSL#3 (weight-based dose, range: 450-1,800 billion bacteria/day; n=14) or an identical placebo (n=15) in conjunction with concomitant steroid induction and mesalamine maintenance treatment. Children were prospectively evaluated at four time points: within 1 month, 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year after diagnosis or at the time of relapse. Lichtiger colitis activity index and a physician's global assessment were used to measure disease activity. At baseline, within 6 months and 12 months or at the time of relapse, all patients were assessed endoscopically and histologically. RESULTS: All 29 patients responded to the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) induction therapy. Remission was achieved in 13 patients (92.8%) treated with VSL#3 and IBD therapy and in 4 patients (36.4%) treated with placebo and IBD therapy (P<0.001). Overall, 3 of 14 (21.4%) patients treated with VSL#3 and IBD therapy and 11 of 15 (73.3%) patients treated with placebo and IBD therapy relapsed within 1 year of follow-up (P=0.014; RR=0.32; CI=0.025-0.773; NNT=2). All 3 patients treated with VSL#3 and 6 of 11 (54.5%) patients treated with placebo relapsed within 6 months of diagnosis. At 6 months, 12 months, or at time of relapse, endoscopic and histological scores were significantly lower in the VSL#3 group than in the placebo group (P<0.05). There were no biochemical or clinical adverse events related to VSL#3. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first pediatric, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that suggests the efficacy and safety of a highly concentrated mixture of probiotic bacterial strains (VSL#3) in active UC and demonstrates its role in maintenance of remission.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colonic mucosa that can dramatically increase the risk of colon cancers. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a dietary intervention of freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB), a natural food product with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bioactivities, on disease severity in an experimental mouse model of UC using 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control diet or a diet containing BRB (5 or 10%) for 7-14 days and then the extent of colonic injury was assessed. Dietary BRB markedly reduced DSS-induced acute injury to the colonic epithelium. This protection included better maintenance of body mass and reductions in colonic shortening and ulceration. BRB treatment, however, did not affect the levels of either plasma nitric oxide or colon malondialdehyde, biomarkers of oxidative stress that are otherwise increased by DSS-induced colonic injury. BRB treatment for up to 7 days suppressed tissue levels of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1beta. Further examination of the inflammatory response by western blot analysis revealed that 7 day BRB treatment reduced the levels of phospho-IkappaBalpha within the colonic tissue. Colonic cyclooxygenase 2 levels were also dramatically suppressed by BRB treatment, with a concomitant decrease in the plasma prostaglandin E(2) (276 versus 34 ng/ml). These findings demonstrate a potent anti-inflammatory effect of BRB during DSS-induced colonic injury, supporting its possible therapeutic or preventive role in the pathogenesis of UC and related neoplastic events.},

Bacterial interactions with the gastrointestinal epithelium may be a trigger for inflammatory changes which occur in the gut. Antibiotics have been shown to alter disease activity in Crohn's disease. Probiotics (live microorganisms) administered for therapeutic purposes have been proposed due to the possibility of their altering the interaction of the gut mucosa with enteric bacteria. Extensive randomized trials are lacking in this area at this time. Current trials indicate the possibility of maintaining remission in pouchitis (non-specific inflammation) and the potential for inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. Trials in Crohn's disease have shown mixed results.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rifaximin, Food and Drug Administration approved for traveler's diarrhea, has been used in adult patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This retrospective review was undertaken to determine its role in the treatment of pediatric IBD. METHODS: A review of children with IBD, who were treated with rifaximin from 2005 to 2007 at our institution, was performed. Collected data included diagnosis, age, medication history, recent therapy, symptom, and interval to improvement. Response was rated as none, moderate, or optimum relief for each symptom. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were identified, 12 with Crohn disease and 11 with ulcerative colitis (UC) with a median age of 13 years. The most common complaints were diarrhea in 20 patients (87%), abdominal pain in 17 (74%), and bloody stools in 15 (65%). Rifaximin was given at doses ranging between 10 and 30 mg/kg (Table 1). Of the 20 patients who presented with diarrhea 5 (25%) had relief of diarrhea within 1 week of starting rifaximin and total of 12 patients (60%) experienced relief within 4 weeks. Abdominal pain resolved in 3 of 17 patients (17.6%) within 1 week and in 12 of 17 (70.6%) within 4 weeks. Visible bleeding resolved in 10 of 15 patients (66.7%) within 4 weeks of therapy (Table 2). Analysis of concurrent medications showed 61% experienced relief of symptoms when addition of rifaximin was the only meaningful treatment change. CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin was well-tolerated and showed favorable results. Larger doses of rifaximin were statistically better for abdominal pain. Further studies are needed to evaluate efficacy and optimal dosing of rifaximin in this population.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal autoimmune condition with an inappropriate immune response. We investigated DNA damage induced in vitro in lymphocytes from IBD patients caused by oxidative stress through H(2)O(2) and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and whether the plant flavonoids, quercetin and epicatechin, found in fruits, tea and soybeans could effectively reduce such stress. Lymphocytes from IBD patients and healthy volunteers were treated with 50 microg/ml H(2)O(2) or IQ in the presence of quercetin (0-250 microg/ml) or epicatechin (0-100 microg/ml). Flavonoid supplementation (250 microM quercetin or 100 microM epicatechin) caused an overall significant decrease of induced DNA damage resulting in a 48.6% (P < 0.001) reduction of H(2)O(2)-induced and a 43% (P < 0.001) reduction of IQ-induced DNA damage within the patient groups; for the control groups, reductions in DNA damage were 35.2 and 57.1%, respectively (both, P < 0.001). There was less induced DNA damage within lymphocytes from UC patients compared to CD patients for both series of experiments (H(2)O(2) and quercetin, IQ and epicatechin). In conclusion, flavonoids dramatically reduced oxidative stress in vitro in lymphocytes from IBD patients and healthy individuals. Thus, flavonoids could be very effective in the treatment of oxidative stress and encouraged in the diet of IBD patients.},

   abstract = {Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has become the surgical treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) or UC with dysplasia and for the majority of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. However, UC patients with IPAA are susceptible to inflammatory and noninflammatory sequelae, such as pouchitis, Crohn's disease of the pouch, cuffitis, and irritable pouch syndrome, in addition to common surgery-associated complications, which adversely affect the surgical outcome and compromise health-related quality of life. Pouchitis is the most frequent long-term complication of IPAA in patients with UC, with a cumulative prevalence of up to 50%. Pouchitis may be classified based on the etiology into idiopathic and secondary types, and the management is often different. Pouchoscopy is the most important tool for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis in patients with pouch dysfunction. Antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for active pouchitis. Some patients may develop dependency on antibiotics, requiring long-term maintenance therapy. Although management of antibiotic-dependent or antibiotic-refractory pouchitis has been challenging, secondary etiology for pouchitis should be evaluated and modified, if possible.},

Although a complete medical cure may not be possible, UC can be treated with medications that induce and maintain remission. The medical management of this disease continues to evolve with a goal to avoid colectomy and ultimately alter the natural history of UC. Emergence of antitumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) agents has expanded the medical armamentarium. 5-Aminosalicylates continue to be used in mild to moderate UC and corticosteroids are mainly used for induction of remission with immunomodulators (6-mercaptopurine/azathiopurine/methotrexate) being applied as steroid-sparing agents for maintenance therapy. Infliximab has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and used in the treatment of moderate to severe UC; nevertheless, its use may be associated with significant adverse effects and have a negative impact on the postoperative course should the patients undergo restorative proctocolectomy. In addition, there is always a concern about patients' compliance to medical therapy, cost of medications, and risk for UC-associated dysplasia. The authors discuss the pros and cons of medications used in the treatment of UC.},

METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed for English language publications with predetermined search criteria to identify relevant studies. RESULTS: Published evidence from uncontrolled series and controlled clinical trials has been used to produce a practical approach relevant to clinical practice which incorporates the indication, optimal dose, and side effects of various therapies including tacrolimus, methotrexate, thalidomide, tioguanine, mycophenolate mofotil, leucocyte apheresis, nutritional therapy, antibiotics, probiotics, allopurinol, rectal acetarsol and ciclosporin in the treatment of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Approaches to optimise thiopurine efficacy are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines may respond to alternative anti-inflammatory chemical molecules, but the evidence base for many of these alternatives is limited and further trials are needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In ulcerative colitis (UC) gut bacteria drive inflammation. Bacterial recognition and T-cell responses are shaped by intestinal dendritic cells (DCs); therapeutic effects of probiotic bacteria may relate to modulation of intestinal DC. The probiotic mixture, VSL#3, increases interleukin (IL)-10 and downregulates IL-12p40 production by DC in vitro. We evaluated in vivo effects of oral VSL#3 and steroids on colonic DC in patients with acute UC. METHODS: Rectal biopsies were obtained from patients with active UC before and after treatment with VSL#3, corticosteroids, or placebo, and from healthy controls. Myeloid colonic DC were studied from freshly isolated lamina propria cells using multicolor flow cytometry. Surface expression of activation markers, CD40, CD86, pattern recognition receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-4 were assessed. Changed function was measured from ongoing intracellular IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-6, and IL-13 production. RESULTS: Acute UC colonic myeloid DC were producing more IL-10 and IL-12p40 than control DC (P = 0.01). In VSL#3-treated patients DC TLR-2 expression decreased (P < 0.05), IL-10 production increased and IL-12p40 production decreased (P < 0.005); 10/14 patients on VSL#3 showed a clinical response. Corticosteroids also resulted in increased IL-10 and reduced IL-12p40 production by DC. Conversely, in patients on placebo, TLR-2 expression and intensity of staining for IL-12p40 and IL-6 increased (all P < 0.05); 5/14 patients on placebo showed a clinical response (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Despite small numbers of human colonic DC available, we showed that treatment of UC patients with probiotic VSL#3 and corticosteroids induced "favorable" intestinal DC function in vivo, increasing regulatory cytokines and lowering proinflammatory cytokines and TLR expression. These effects may contribute to therapeutic benefit.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Historically, sulfasalazine (SSZ) and 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) have been a mainstay of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) remission induction and maintenance therapy. Considering the pivotal role of intestinal microbial flora in pathophysiology of UC and antimicrobial activity of sulfapyridine, we hypothesized that SSZ might be more effective than 5-ASAs in the management of UC. AIM: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of SSZ with each of the 5-ASAs (mesalamine, olsalazine, and balsalazide) by a meta-analysis technique. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies compared efficacy and/or tolerability of SSZ with 5-ASAs in the management of UC. The search terms were: "sulfasalazine" or "sulfasalazine" and "5-aminosalicylic acid," "mesalazine," "mesalamine," "olsalazine" or "balsalazide" and "ulcerative colitis." Data were collected from 1966 to April 2008. There was no language restriction. "Overall improvement," "relapse rate," "total adverse events," and "withdrawals because of adverse events" were the key outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Twenty randomized placebo controlled trials met our criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Comparison of SSZ with mesalamine yielded a nonsignificant relative risk (RR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval of 0.89-1.21, P = 0.63) for overall improvement, a nonsignificant RR of 0.98 (95% CI 0.78-1.23, P = 0.85) for relapse, a nonsignificant RR of 0.76 (95% CI 0.54-1.07, P = 0.11) for any adverse events, and a nonsignificant RR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.46-1.3, P = 0.33) for withdrawals due to adverse events. Comparison of SSZ with olsalazine yielded a nonsignificant RR of 1.14 (95% CI 0.91-1.43, P = 0.25) for overall improvement, a nonsignificant RR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.77-1.12, P = 0.42) for relapse, a nonsignificant RR of 1.21 (95% CI 0.9-1.61, P = 0.20) for any adverse events, and a nonsignificant RR of 1.53 (95% CI 0.93-2.52, P = 0.09) for withdrawals due to adverse events. Comparison of SSZ with balsalazide yielded a nonsignificant RR of 1.3 (95% CI 0.93-1.81, P = 0.12) for overall improvement, and a significant RR of 0.17 (95% CI 0.06-0.49, P = 0.001) for withdrawals because of adverse events. CONCLUSION: SSZ does not differ from mesalamine or olsalazine in terms of efficacy and tolerability in UC. Withdrawal from study due to adverse events was significantly lower for balsalazide compared with SSZ. Convincing conclusions on the comparison of effectiveness and safety of balsalazide and SSZ in UC remains to be elucidated by further clinical trials. Considering the lower cost of treatment with SSZ and the equal rate of adverse events with other 5-ASAa, it is not surprising to suggest SSZ as a first-choice treatment for UC and reserve 5-ASAs for when SSZ intolerability occurs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest a link between gut microbiota and the development of ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Our aim was to investigate any quantitative differences in faecal bacterial compositions in UC and IBS patients compared to healthy controls, and to identify individual bacterial species that contribute to these differences. METHODS: Faecal microbiota of 13 UC patients, 11 IBS patients and 22 healthy volunteers were analysed by PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) using universal and Bacteroides specific primers. The data obtained were normalized using in-house developed statistical method and interrogated by multivariate approaches. The differentiated bands were excised and identified by sequencing the V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes. RESULTS: Band profiles revealed that number of predominant faecal bacteria were significantly different between UC, IBS and control group (p < 10-4). By assessing the mean band numbers in UC (37 +/- 5) and IBS (39 +/- 6), compared to the controls (45 +/- 3), a significant decrease in bacterial species is suggested (p = 0.01). There were no significant differences between IBS and UC. Biodiversity of the bacterial species was significantly lower in UC (mu = 2.94, sigma = 0.29) and IBS patients (mu = 2.90, sigma = 0.38) than controls (mu = 3.25, sigma = 0.16; p = 0.01). Moreover, similarity indices revealed greater biological variability of predominant bacteria in UC and IBS compared to the controls (median Dice coefficients 76.1% (IQR 70.9 - 83.1), 73.8% (IQR 67.0 - 77.5) and 82.9% (IQR 79.1 - 86.7) respectively). DNA sequencing of discriminating bands suggest that the presence of Bacteroides vulgatus, B. ovatus, B. uniformis, and Parabacteroides sp. in healthy volunteers distinguishes them from IBS and UC patients. DGGE profiles of Bacteroides species revealed a decrease of Bacteroides community in UC relative to IBS and controls. CONCLUSION: Molecular profiling of faecal bacteria revealed abnormalities of intestinal microbiota in UC and IBS patients, while different patterns of Bacteroides species loss in particular, were associated with UC and IBS.},

   abstract = {The protective effect of Garcinia kola (GK) crude extract on acetic acid induced colitis in rats was investigated. Colitis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by inflammation of colon. The pathology in colitis includes disruption of crypt architecture, inflammation of crypts, frank crypt abscesses, and hemorrhage or inflammatory cells in the lamina propria. Since oxidative stress plays an important role in the etiology of Inflammatory Bowel diseases,and Garcinia kola (GK), have been shown to reduce oxidative stress in the rat stomach.The present study was designed to investigate the effects of Garcinia kola on ulcerative colitis (UC) induced by acetic acid. Albino rats were divided into five groups; Group one served as control, group two received Normal saline, group three received 2.5% ethanol while groups four and five were given 20mg/kg and 100mg/kg of crude extract of Garcinia kolarespectively. In another experiment, rats were fed for 2 weeks on normal rat diets but specially composed to contain 12.5%, 25% and 50% by weight of G kola. Colitis was induced by intra-rectal administration of 6% acetic acid. The colonic damage was elucidated by macroscopic damage scores; colon wet weight, stool consistency and colonic edema (thickness of the colon). Intra-luminal administration of 6% acetic acid resulted in observable clinical and macroscopic signs of colitis.Pre-orally administered of crude extract of GK significantly reduced the colonic damage score (p<0.001), colon weight (p<0.001), thickness of the colon (p<0.001) and diarrhea (p<0.001).Histological examinations also indicated a marked reduction in tissue injury and inhibition in neutrophil infiltration in rats pretreated with crude extract of Garcinia kola. Results of this investigation provide experimental evidence of Garcinia kola as an anti-colitis agent.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The authors present evidence published during the past 2 years of the roles of commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Rodent models conclusively implicate commensal enteric bacteria in chronic, immune-mediated, experimental colitis, and genetically determined defects in bacterial killing by innate immune cells are found in a subset of patients with Crohn's disease. There is no evidence that a single pathogen, including Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, causes Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. However, adherent/invasive Escherichia coli are associated with ileal Crohn's disease, with the mechanisms and genetics of adherent/invasive E. coli virulence being elucidated. Molecular characterization of the microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases reveals decreased biodiversity of commensal bacteria, most notably the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, including the clinically relevant Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and increased E. coli concentrations. VSL#3 is one probiotic preparation shown to be efficacious in certain clinical situations in small clinical trials. SUMMARY: Further characterization of altered microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and linking dysbiosis with host genetic alterations in immunoregulation, innate microbial killing and barrier function are critical, so that individualized treatments to increase beneficial commensals and their metabolic products (probiotic and prebiotic administration) and diminish deleterious species such as adherent/invasive E. coli can be tailored for defined patient subsets.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorder of the colon for which the etiology is currently unknown. At present, strategies to treat UC are primarily targeted to control inflammation during active phases of disease as well as maintain remission during quiescence. As such, several unmet needs in the treatment of UC still remain. In recent years, basic research has led to the recognition of several key factors in the pathogenesis of UC, translating into the development of several novel therapeutic agents. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to review emerging therapies that may advance the treatment and improve the overall care of UC patients. METHODS: An extensive literature search on published manuscripts and meeting proceedings has been performed to provide a comprehensive review of future drug therapies to treat UC. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The translational application of new discoveries in the basic understanding of UC pathogenesis is continuing and critical for the development of novel treatment strategies. Design of novel biologic therapies to treat UC has the challenge of addressing potential safety issues, while more traditional drugs should be further developed to facilitate patient compliance to treat this chronic, debilitating disease.},

   abstract = {Anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) agents have changed the way of treating inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) refractory to conventional medications (corticosteroids, immu-nomodulators). Infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab are more effective than placebo for induction and maintenance of remission in luminal Crohn's disease. Infliximab and adalimumab are also effective for maintenance of fistula closure in Crohn's disease. Only infliximab is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for ulcerative colitis. Only adalimumab has demonstrated its efficacy in a randomized controlled trial to induce remission after infliximab failure in Crohn's disease. Anti-TNF therapy leads to mucosal healing, reduces hospitalizations and surgeries, and improves patients' quality of life. Safety data indicate that serious infections occur in 2-4% of patients treated with anti-TNF therapy, with no statistical difference when compared to controls. The risk of rare events such as malignancies and lymphoma, in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF agents, will require a longer duration of follow-up. Currently, the risk-benefit ratio of anti-TNF therapy supports its use in IBD. Several questions remain to be answered: can an indiscriminate use of anti-TNF agents modify the natural course of the disease, should mucosal healing be used in clinical practice, and should anti-TNF therapy be used alone or in combination with immunomodulators in the long-term?},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet is a major factor in the etiology of colorectal cancer, with high fish consumption possibly decreasing colorectal cancer risk, as was shown in several observational studies. To date, no intervention trials have examined the possible beneficial effects of fish intake on colorectal cancer risk. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the effects of a 6-mo intervention with oil-rich or lean fish on apoptosis and mitosis within the colonic crypt. DESIGN: In a multicenter, randomized, controlled intervention trial, patients with colorectal polyps, inactive ulcerative colitis, or no macroscopic signs of disease were recruited (n = 242) and randomly allocated to receive dietary advice plus either 300 g oil-rich fish (salmon) per week (n = 82), 300 g lean fish (cod) per week (n = 78), or only dietary advice (DA) (n = 82). Apoptosis and mitosis were measured in colonic biopsy samples collected before and after intervention (n = 213). RESULTS: The total number of apoptotic cells per crypt did not increase in the salmon or cod group: -0.10 (95% CI: -0.36, 0.16) and -0.06 (95% CI: -0.32, 0.20), respectively, compared with the DA group. The total number of mitotic cells per crypt decreased nonsignificantly in the salmon group (-0.87; 95% CI: -2.41, 0.68) and in the cod group (-1.04; 95% CI: -2.62, 0.53) compared with the DA group. Furthermore, the distribution of mitosis within the crypt did not significantly change in either group. CONCLUSION: An increase in the consumption of either oil-rich or lean fish to 2 portions weekly over 6 mo does not markedly change apoptotic and mitotic rates in the colonic mucosa. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00145015.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize recent evidence on the role of intestinal bacteria in inflammatory bowel diseases, and of antibiotics and probiotics in their treatment. The implications connected with the use of antibiotics are also examined. RECENT FINDINGS: The hypothesis that Mycobacterium paratuberculosis could be a causative agent of Crohn's disease has not been confirmed by a large trial on symptomatic patients treated by a combination of antibiotics active against this bacterium. An increased number of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli have been found in the intestinal tissue of patients with Crohn's disease, but their role in the pathogenesis of this condition remains to be defined. The combination of metronidazole and azathioprine, associating the effects of a reduced bacterial load with immunosuppression, appears to be a therapeutic option to decrease the recurrence of postoperative Crohn's disease in high-risk patients. However, concerns are raised by the possibility that antibiotics may induce disease relapse due to Clostridium difficile infection. SUMMARY: Recent literature provides increasing support for the use of antibiotics in Crohn's disease, although the side effects limit their long-term use. The efficacy of antibiotics in ulcerative colitis is not confirmed by the available literature, except in severe colitis. More trials are needed to support the use of probiotics as therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and both diseases lead to high morbidity and health care costs. Complex interactions between the immune system, enteric commensal bacteria and host genotype are thought to underlie the development of IBD although the precise aetiology of this group of diseases is still unknown. The understanding of the composition and complexity of the normal gut microbiota has been greatly aided by the use of molecular methods and is likely to be further increased with the advent of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approaches, which will allow an increasingly more holistic assessment of the microbiome with respect to both diversity and function of the commensal gut microbiota. Studies thus far have shown that the intestinal microbiota drives the development of the gut immune system and can induce immune homeostasis as well as contribute to the development of IBD. Probiotics which deliver some of the beneficial immunomodulatory effects of the commensal gut microbiota and induce immune homeostasis have been proposed as a suitable treatment for mild to moderate IBD. This review provides an overview over the current understanding of the commensal gut microbiota, its interactions with the mucosal immune system and its capacity to induce both gut homeostasis as well as dysregulation of the immune system. Bacterial-host events, including interactions with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on epithelial cells and dendritic cells (DCs) and the resultant impact on immune responses at mucosal surfaces will be discussed.},

   abstract = {Probiotic bacteria, commensals selected for their presumed therapeutic properties when ingested orally, have attracted increasing attention for their possible efficacy in a range of gastrointestinal disorders, including the inflammatory bowel diseases of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Since the barrier properties of the intestinal epithelium are believed to be compromised as a consequence (or perhaps as a cause) of intestinal inflammation, we hypothesized that probiotics might ameliorate such epithelial dysfunction as part of their spectrum of beneficial effects. We have used both cell line and animal models to test this hypothesis and show that two probiotics have significant effects on epithelial barrier properties, both at baseline and when deranged by inflammatory cytokines or in the setting of inflammation in a mouse model of colitis. Moreover, the probiotics also normalize epithelial ion transport function, which could also contribute to clinical efficacy. Overall, our studies extend the spectrum of functional effects attributable to probiotics, and may provide a rationale for their use in a range of gastrointestinal disorders associated with epithelial dysfunction.},

METHODS: Sixty-five patients were studied over a period of 1 year and divided into two groups: group 1 with inflammatory disease activity (n = 24), and group 2 without disease activity (n = 41). Anthropometric measures, biochemical parameters, quantitative food intake, and qualitative food frequency were analyzed. RESULTS: A significant reduction in body mass index and weight and in the intake of energy, proteins, lipids, calcium, iron and phosphorus was observed in the group with inflammatory activity (group 1) when compared to the period of clinical remission. The most affected food groups were cereals, legumes, oils, and fats. In contrast, in group 2 significant differences in triceps and sub scapular skin fold thickness, total protein, hemoglobin and hematocrit were observed between the first and final visit. Calcium and vitamin B6 intake, as well as the consumption of legumes, meat and eggs, and sugar and sweets, was significantly higher than on the first visit. CONCLUSION: Patients with ulcerative colitis followed up on an outpatient basis tend to be well nourished. However, the nutritional aspects studied tend to worsen during the period of inflammatory disease activity.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that starch-entrapped microspheres would produce favourable fermentation profiles and microbial shifts during in vitro fermentation with the faecal microbiota from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In vitro fermentation was carried out using a validated, dynamic, computer-controlled model of the human colon (Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek gastro-intestinal model-2) after inoculation with pooled faeces from healthy individuals, patients with inactive IBD (Crohn's disease (CD)) or patients with active IBD (ulcerative colitis (UC)). Starch-entrapped microspheres fermented more slowly and produced more butyrate than fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) when fermented with the faecal microbiota from patients with active UC. When fermented with the microbiota from patients with inactive CD, starch-entrapped microspheres also fermented more slowly but produced similar amounts of butyrate compared with FOS. Starch-entrapped microspheres showed a greater ability to maintain a low pH during simulated-distal colon conditions compared with FOS. After fermentation with the microbiota from inactive CD patients, starch-entrapped microspheres resulted in lower concentrations of some potentially harmful gut bacteria, included in Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Fusobacterium and Veillonella, compared with FOS. These findings suggest that slow fermenting starch-entrapped microspheres may induce a favourable colonic environment in patients with IBD through high butyrate production, maintenance of low pH in the distal colon and inhibition of the growth of potentially harmful bacteria.},

   abstract = {Inflammation is part of the normal host response to infection and injury. However, inappropriate inflammation contributes to several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Both conditions are characterized by the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, arachidonic acid (AA)-derived eicosanoids, and other inflammatory agents (e.g., reactive oxygen species, adhesion molecules). By virtue of their anti-inflammatory action, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may be beneficial in inflammatory diseases. A large body of evidence supports a protective effect of omega-3 PUFA in experimental animal and ex-vivo models of Crohn's disease (CD), Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although fish oil supplementation in patients with IBD results in omega-3 PUFA incorporation into gut mucosal tissue and modification of inflammatory mediator profiles, the evidence of clinical benefits of omega-3 PUFA is weak. On the other hand, more convincing data support the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA in reducing pain, number of tender joints, duration of morning stiffness, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and improving physical performance in RA patients. In both IBD and RA further clinical trials with large sample size are needed to clarify the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA as a treatment.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is a nonspecific inflammatory disorder characterized by oxidative and nitrosative stress, leucocyte infiltration and upregulation of inflammatory mediators. Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound found in grapes and wine, with multiple pharmacological actions, mainly anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumour and immunomodulatory activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary resveratrol on chronic dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Six-week-old mice were randomized into two dietary groups: one standard diet and the other enriched with resveratrol at 20mg/kg of diet. After 30days, mice were exposed to 3% DSS for 5days developing acute colitis that progressed to severe chronic inflammation after 21days of water. Our results demonstrated that resveratrol group significantly attenuated the clinical signs such as loss of body weight, diarrhea and rectal bleeding improving results from disease activity index and inflammatory score. Moreover, the totality of resveratrol-fed animals survived and finished the treatment while animals fed with standard diet showed a mortality of 40%. Three weeks after DSS removal, the polyphenol caused substantial reductions of the rise of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and an increase of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Also resveratrol reduced prostaglandin E synthase-1 (PGES-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) proteins expression, via downregulation of p38, a mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signal pathway. We conclude that resveratrol diet represents a novel approach to the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for developing ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated colorectal cancer (CRC). Several studies have shown that extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) might possess anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and antiapoptotic effects. We have evaluated EVOO diet effects on the severity of repeated colitis-associated CRC. METHODS: Six-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomized into two dietary groups: sunflower oil (SFO) and EVOO diets, both at 10%. Mice were exposed to 15 cycles of 0.7% dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) for 1 week followed by distilled water for 10 days. After, the rats were sacrificed and colonic damage was both histologically and biochemically assessed. RESULTS: Disease activity index (DAI) was significantly higher on SFO vs. EVOO diet at the end of the experimental period. EVOO-fed mice showed less incidence and multiplicity of tumors than in those SFO-fed mice. beta-catenin immunostaining was limited to cell membranes in control groups, whereas translocation from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm and/or nucleus was showed in DSS-treated groups and its expression was higher in SFO-fed animals. Cytokine production was significantly enhanced in SFO-fed mice, while this increase was not significant in EVOO-fed mice. Conversely, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxidase synthase (iNOS) expression were significantly lower in the animal group fed with EVOO than in the SFO group. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that EVOO diet has protective/preventive effect in the UC-associated CRC. This beneficial effect was correlated with a better DAI, a minor number of dysplastic lesions, a lower beta-catenin immunoreactivity, a proinflammatory cytokine levels reduction, a non modification of p53 expression and, COX-2 and iNOS reduction in the colonic tissue.},

METHODS: Information was retrieved from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The induction of remission and promotion of maintenance were compared between probiotics treatment and non-probiotics treatment in ulcerative colitis. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled studies met the selection criteria. Seven studies evaluated the remission rate, and eight studies estimated the recurrence rate; two studies evaluated both remission and recurrence rates. Compared with the non-probiotics group, the remission rate for ulcerative colitis patients who received probiotics was 1.35 (95% CI: 0.98-1.85). Compared with the placebo group, the remission rate of ulcerative colitis who received probiotics was 2.00 (95% CI: 1.35-2.96). During the course of treatment, in patients who received probiotics for less than 12 mo compared with the group treated by non-probiotics, the remission rate of ulcerative colitis was 1.36 (95% CI: 1.07-1.73). Compared with the non-probiotics group, the recurrence rate of ulcerative colitis patients who received probiotics was 0.69 (95% CI: 2.47-1.01). In the mild to moderate group who received probiotics, compared to the group who did not receive probiotics, the recurrence rate was 0.25 (95% CI: 0.12-0.51). The group who received Bifidobacterium bifidum treatment had a recurrence rate of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.12-0.50) compared with the non-probiotics group. CONCLUSION: Probiotic treatment was more effective than placebo in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {The notion that the intestinal microbiota plays a key role for the development of intestinal inflammation, initially based on a series of clinical observations both in human inflammatory bowel disease and experimental colitis, has been reinforced by a growing body of evidence demonstrating that the abnormal recognition of bacterial and other microbiota antigens by the innate immune system is one of the earliest events in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. In keeping with our present knowledge of inflammatory bowel disease pathophysiology, the search for therapeutic approaches aimed at modifying the composition of the intestinal microbiota to obtain new, more targeted treatments for inflammatory bowel disease that are basically free of side effects has been a subject of intense research activity. Probiotics are defined as live organisms capable of conferring health benefits beyond their nutritional properties. Numerous micro-organisms have been evaluated to induce or maintain remission, or both, in ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and pouchitis. Overall, probiotics have successfully demonstrated some efficacy in some inflammatory bowel disease scenarios. However, a critical review of the available scientific literature shows that: (1) in spite of great expectations, reflected by a high number of review and editorial articles in top journals, the number of published, well-designed clinical trials using probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease is small, often with few patients; (2) the range of microbial agents makes it particularly difficult to draw global conclusions; (3) the quality of the evidence on the efficacy of probiotics in pouchitis is clearly better than that in ulcerative colitis, while there is virtually no evidence of probiotic efficacy in Crohn's disease. The appropriate selection of probiotic agents combined with convincing clinical trials will determine whether probiotics can jump from promise to reality in inflammatory bowel disease clinical practice.},

The effectiveness of the probiotic treatment was assessed from changes in patient's stool pattern, body composition, and selected biochemical indicators of disease activity and nutritional status. Fifty patients entered consecutively in the trial between December 2005-June 2009 (CONTROL GROUP: 29; Treatment Group: 21). Twenty of them completed treatment with probiotics. Effectiveness of regular pharmacological treatment was recorded with 24 control patients. Thirty-six days of probiotic treatment per patient were accumulated. Probiotic treatment obedience rate was 99.3%. Five days of treatment were lost due to non-availability of the product. No adverse reactions were reported after probiotic treatment. Two deaths were recorded after completion of the study, one on each group. Improvement in the quality of the stools [RR Relative risk: 1.69; 95% IC: 0.87-3.27]; frequency [RR: 1.35; 95% IC: 0.15-11.90]; and volume [RR: 1.11; 95% IC: 0.16-7.63] was observed in treated patients, although biological variability prevented these trends to become statistically significant. Probiotic treatment also resulted in reduction of occurrence of nocturnal depositions [RR: 1.75; 95% IC: 0.53-5.73]. Probiotic treatment prevented the onset of undesirable changes in stool pattern of treated patients who presented free of symptoms, but observed effect was no superior to that of medication administered. Probiotic treatment did not influence upon presence of blood in stools. Probiotic treatment also resulted in reduction of disease activity and ESR Erythro-sedimentation rate, respectively [Change in the Clinical Activity Index: CONTROL GROUP: -1.1 +/- 3.2 vs. Treatment Group: -4.1 +/- 3.3; p < 0.05; Change in ESR: CONTROL GROUP: 3.6 +/- 16.4 vs. Treatment Group: -6.7 +/- 15.6; p < 0.05]. Adjuvant probiotic treatment resulted in increase of body weight, at the expenses of increase of MAMC Mid-arm Muscle Circumference and sum of skinfolds. Probiotic effect upon body weight was not attributed to increased food intakes in treated patients. In spite of clinical heterogeneity associated to mucosal damage in UC, probiotic treatment might result in beneficial effects upon patient's stool pattern, body composition, and selected biochemical indicators of disease activity. Invariance of food intakes could imply that observed changes in response variables were not the result of a placebo effect of used probiotic combination.},

Here, we study whether the number of living probiotic bacteria in yoghurts is altered by an interruption of the cold chain. METHODS: Three commonly available probiotic yoghurts were kept at 4 degrees C or put at room temperature (RT) for 6 h or 24 h. An aliquot of each yoghurt was applied on Man-Rogosa-Sharpe agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Colony forming units (CFU) were counted by microscopy. RESULTS: The first yoghurt, containing Lactobacillus johnsonii, showed a significant decrease in CFU after 6 h of storage at RT, which was further pronounced after 24 h. The number of CFU of the second yoghurt, containing Lactobacillus GG, was also decreased after 6 h and further diminished after 24 h at RT. From the third yoghurt, containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, only 53.8% of the CFU remained after 6 h at RT; after 24 h, only about one fourth of the CFU were found. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the number of living probiotic bacteria in yoghurt products decreases dramatically after exposure to RT. This represents an important information for consumers of such products.},

Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998 as an effective therapeutic agent against inflammatory bowel disease. Malignant lymphomas of both B and T cell lineage have been described in patients undergoing therapy involving TNF-alpha blockade. To date, eight cases of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma associated with infliximab have been reported to the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, as well as several other T cell lymphoproliferative disorders with aggressive clinical outcomes. We present the histologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular features of a T cell lymphoproliferative disorder involving the axillary lymph node of a 33-year-old male following infliximab treatment for ulcerative colitis. These EBV-negative lymphomas suggest that lymphoproliferative disorders following infliximab treatment for inflammatory bowel disease may involve EBV-independent immune dysregulation. The spectrum of lymphoproliferative disorders associated with infliximab and the potential mechanisms by which they occur are discussed.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine current evidence for dietary supplementation with zinc and other micronutrients for primary prevention of multiple micronutrient deficiencies that are known to result from therapies used in the treatment of gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological observations and clinical findings have strengthened the concept that both nutritional deficiencies and nutritional excesses impair the gastrointestinal response(s) and alter susceptibility to inflammation and other diseases. The interaction of micronutrient intake, biochemical indicators of nutritional status, and four specific gastrointestinal inflammation states are reviewed. These conditions include celiac disease and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies resulting from the sustained adherence to a gluten-free diet; micronutrient nutrition as an important determinant of immunity for two major types of inflammatory bowel disease: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies which may be exacerbated by the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. SUMMARY: For each inflammation 'state', enhancement of micronutrient status can improve immunocompetance and minimize therapeutic side-effects. The impact of single-micronutrient deficiencies on immune responses, and the possible impact of uncorrected micronutrient status are discussed.},

   abstract = {The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves the production of diverse lipid mediators, namely eicosanoid, lysophospholipids, and platelet-activating factor, in which phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is the key enzyme. Thus, it has been postulated that control of lipid mediators production by inhibition of PLA2 would be useful for the treatment of IBD. This hypothesis has been tested in the present study by examining the therapeutic effect of a novel natural probitic Bacillus subtilis PB6 (ATCC- PTA 6737). B. subtilis PB6 is found to secrete surfactins (cyclic lipopeptides) which have anti-bacterial potential. These surfactins inhibit PLA2, a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the arachidonic acid associated inflammatory pathway and could downregulate the inflammatory response by regulating the eicosanoid and cytokine pathways. With this concept, an experimental animal trial has been conducted in a rat model of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. The oral administration of PB6 suppresses the colitis as measured by mortality rate, changes in the weight gain, colon morphology and the levels of plasma cytokines. The animals treated orally with PB6 at 1.5 x 10(8) CFU/kg thrice daily from day 4 to 10 significantly improve gross pathology of the colon and regain the colon weight to normal (p < 0.05), compared to TNBS-induced positive control. The plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, 1L-1beta, IL-6 and IFN-gamma) are also significantly lowered (p < 0.05) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-I0 and TGF-beta) significantly (p < 0.05) increased after the oral administration of PB6 on day 11. The present study supports the concept that PB6 inhibits PLA2 by the secreting surfactins. In a clinical investigation, it is found to be well tolerated by all the healthy volunteers.},

   abstract = {Nutrition plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) primarily in prevention and treatment of malnutrition and growth failure. Furthermore, in Crohn disease (CD), nutrition can induce remission, maintain remission, and prevent relapse. Malnutrition is common in IBD and the mechanisms involved include decreased food intake, malabsorption, increased nutrient loss, increased energy requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions. At the time of diagnosis, up to 85% of pediatric patients with CD and 65% of those with ulcerative colitis (UC) have weight loss. Growth failure occurs in 15% to 40% of children with IBD and is less common in UC compared with CD, both at diagnosis and during follow-up. In CD, nutritional therapy with enteral formulas induces remission at a rate comparable with that achieved with steroids. In adults with CD, limited information suggests that enteral nutrition (EN) may play a role in maintenance of remission. In children with CD colitis, one study suggested that children without colitis respond better to EN than children with colitis, and another study found no such difference but reported a trend toward earlier relapse in those with isolated colonic involvement. Finally, nutrition may play a role in IBD via the possible protective effect of breastfeeding against UC and CD. In summary, although only CD may benefit from nutrition as primary therapy for remission induction and possibly maintenance of remission, nutrition plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in IBD, and may have a protective role, via the effect of breast-feeding on disease occurrence.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Bone mineral density (BMD) can be adversely affected by the chronic nature of inflammatory bowel disease. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the surgical treatment of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who require proctocolectomy. There are few data on BMD in UC patients with IPAA. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors associated with low BMD in UC patients after IPAA. METHODS: A total of 327 eligible patients with UC and IPAA from the Pouchitis Clinic were enrolled. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was performed. Patients were classified as having normal or low BMD, based on the criteria by the International Society for Clinical Densitometry. A total of 39 demographic and clinical variables were evaluated with logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of 327 patients with a median of 4 years after IPAA, 105 (32.1%) had low BMD. Fragility fracture was documented in 11 patients (10.5%) in the low BMD group and in 13 of 222 patients (5.9%) in the normal BMD group (P=0.14). In the multivariable analysis, covariate-adjusted factors associated with a low BMD were advanced age (odds ratio (OR) =1.64 per 5 years; 95% CI, 1.44-1.87), low body mass index (OR=0.43 per 5 kg/m(2); 95% CI, 0.30-0.62), and non-use of daily calcium supplement (OR=0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.96). Pouch-associated factors were not found to be significantly associated with the bone loss. CONCLUSIONS: Low BMD was common in patients with UC, even after colectomy and IPAA. Low BMD in this patient population was associated with certain risk factors, some of which may be modifiable.},

Tormentil rhizomes have also been used as part of alcoholic beverages in Germany, the Ukraine, and Russia. Acute toxicity of an aqueous P. erecta rhizome extract was evaluated with a single dose administered by the intragastric route to rats and mice in dosages of 2.5 g/kg and 6.8 g/kg of body weight, respectively. Further, a single dose of this extract was applied intraperitoneally to rats and mice in dosages of 3.8 and 14.5 g/kg of body weight, respectively. After an observation period of 2 weeks after intragastric administration and 3 days following intraperitoneal administration, no mortality or any changes in appearance, behavior, or body weight occurred for both rats and mice in the high dosages mentioned. Macroscopic and microscopic studies of the internal organs of these rodents revealed no pathological changes. The data are in line with the long-time traditional use of P. erecta rhizome extracts and results from recent clinical trials in which no signs of any toxic effects have been known after the administration of a P. erecta rhizome extract for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in adults and rotavirus-induced diarrhea in children. Thus P. erecta rhizome extracts should be considered safe with respect to acute toxicity when applied to humans.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotics can maintain ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission effectively, but little is known of their ability to induce remission. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a high-potency probiotic, VSL#3, for the treatment of mild-to-moderately active UC. METHODS: Adult patients with mild-to-moderate UC were assigned randomly to groups that were given 3.6 x 10(12) CFU VSL#3 (n = 77) or placebo (n = 70), twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary end point was a 50% decrease in the Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UCDAI) at 6 weeks. The secondary end points included remission by 12 weeks and reduction in total individual UCDAI parameters from baseline at 12 weeks. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. RESULTS: At week 6, the percentage of patients with an improvement in UCDAI score that was greater than 50% was significantly higher in the group given VSL#3 (25; 32.5%) than the group given placebo (7; 10%) (P = .001). At week 12, there were 33 patients given VSL#3 (42.9%) who achieved remission, compared with 11 patients given placebo (15.7%) (P < .001). Furthermore, significantly more patients given VSL#3 (40; 51.9%) achieved a decrease in their UCDAI that was greater than 3 points, compared with those given placebo (13; 18.6%) (P < .001). The VSL#3 group had significantly greater decreases in UCDAI scores and individual symptoms at weeks 6 and 12, compared with the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3 is safe and effective in achieving clinical responses and remissions in patients with mild-to-moderately active UC.},

   abstract = {Data from the literature suggest that the availability of the amino acids threonine, cysteine, or both, is limiting for mucin synthesis under conditions of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Unlike casein, cheese whey protein is rich in these amino acids. The protective effect of cheese whey protein was examined using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced inflammation of the large intestine in rats that were fed a diet containing casein, cheese whey protein, or casein supplemented with threonine and cysteine. The clinical markers diarrhea and fecal blood were determined using biochemical assays, and gene expression of inflammation markers was used to quantify inflammation. The effect of dairy protein on mucin production was determined by gene expression of rat mucin 2 (MUC2) and by quantifying fecal mucin excretion. Fecal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were determined using quantitative PCR. Dietary cheese whey protein reduced DSS-induced gene expression of the inflammation markers interleukin 1beta, calprotectin, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and diminished the clinical symptoms diarrhea and fecal blood loss. Moreover, cheese whey protein increased fecal mucin secretion without affecting gene expression of MUC2, suggesting enhanced mucin synthesis. In addition, cheese whey protein increased fecal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria counts. Supplementation of threonine and cysteine showed comparable effects. In conclusion, cheese whey protein protected rats against DSS-induced gut inflammation. This can most likely be explained by its threonine and cysteine content. Protection can be the result of both the stimulation of intestinal mucin synthesis and modification of microflora composition.},

   abstract = {The intestinal flora harbors varies pathogens. Clostridium perfringens (gas gangrene), Enterococci (endocarditis), Enterobacteriaceae (sepsis), Bacteroides (abscesses) are present in the large intestine of every healthy person in high concentrations. These bacteria are, however, separated from the colonic wall by an impenetrable mucus layer and are tolerated by the host. This separation is disturbed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where bacteria adhere to the mucosa and invade epithelial cells with concomitant inflammatory response. This chronic bowel inflammation can not subside as long as the mucus barrier remains defective. The inflammatory response interferes with the state of tolerance to the intestinal bacteria and leads to characteristic changes in the biostructure of the faecal microbiota. These changes in the biostructure of faecal microbiota are specific for active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) and can be longitudinally monitored. The reason for the defect of the mucus barrier in IBD patients is unclear. Epidemiologic studies indicate a negative role of western lifestyle and foods and document the rise in the incidence of IBD in the industrialized countries during the 20(th) century. In parallel to this, detergents were introduced in households and emulsifiers were increasingly added to food. The cleaning effect of these on the colonic mucus has to be investigated. The present contribution summarizes new data on the biostructure of the intestinal microbiota.},

An extract of the herb, HMPL-004, inhibits TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, and prevents colitis in animal models. AIM: To determine the efficacy and safety of HMPL-004 in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, multicentre, 8-week parallel group study was conducted using HMPL-004 1200 mg/day compared with 4500 mg/day of slow release mesalazine (mesalamine) granules in patients with mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis. Disease activity was assessed at baseline and every 2 weeks for clinical response, and at baseline and 8 weeks by colonoscopy. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients at five centres in China were randomised and dosed. Clinical remission and response were seen in 21% and 76% of HMPL-004-treated patients, and 16% and 82% of mesalazine-treated patients. By colonoscopy, remission and response were seen in 28% and 74% of HMPL-004-treated patients and 24% and 71% of mesalazine-treated patients, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: HMPL-004 may be an efficacious alternative to mesalazine in ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and 1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants. Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dietary linoleic acid, an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is metabolised to arachidonic acid, a component of colonocyte membranes. Metabolites of arachidonic acid have pro-inflammatory properties and are increased in the mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis. The aim of this investigation was to conduct the first prospective cohort study investigating if a high dietary intake of linoleic acid increases the risk of developing incident ulcerative colitis. DESIGN AND SETTING: Dietary data from food frequency questionnaires were available for 203 193 men and women aged 30-74 years, resident in the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Germany or Italy and participating in a prospective cohort study, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). These participants were followed up for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Each case was matched with four controls and the risk of disease calculated by quartile of intake of linoleic acid adjusted for gender, age, smoking, total energy intake and centre. RESULTS: A total of 126 participants developed ulcerative colitis (47% women) after a median follow-up of 4.0 years (range, 1.7-11.3 years). The highest quartile of intake of linoleic acid was associated with an increased risk of ulcerative colitis (odds ratio (OR) = 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.23 to 5.07, p = 0.01) with a significant trend across quartiles (OR = 1.32 per quartile increase, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.66, p = 0.02 for trend). CONCLUSIONS: The data support a role for dietary linoleic acid in the aetiology of ulcerative colitis. An estimated 30% of cases could be attributed to having dietary intakes higher than the lowest quartile of linoleic acid intake.},

   abstract = {Probiotics as dietary supplements have been readily accepted by Asian populations. Use of certain probiotic preparations is widespread and the number of clinical trials undertaken with such products is unparalleled in western scientific literature. One such preparation, containing a combination of Enterococcus faecium R0026 and Bacillus subtilis R0179, has 23 publications on post-market clinical studies involving over 1,800 adults. The majority of these publications are printed in Chinese and Korean journals. This review examines the clinical findings with this probiotic combination. As mono-therapy, it has been used to overcome symptoms associated with chronic diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome. It has been used as co-adjuvant therapy with sulfasalazine and mesalazine to improve remission times in mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis and to improve compliance with conventional triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication. While the much of the data is preliminary and the study designs require refinement, the contribution of these trials should not be ignored. The information derived in this review will provide practitioners with practical information on appropriate applications for probiotic supplements, expected outcomes, dosing regimes, safety and reported adverse events. Furthermore, identification of problems in these trials should help researchers design better clinical trials when investigating probiotic products.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: VSL#3 is a high-potency probiotic mixture that has been used successfully in the treatment of pouchitis. The primary end point of the study was to assess the effects of supplementation with VSL#3 in patients affected by relapsing ulcerative colitis (UC) who are already under treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) and/or immunosuppressants at stable doses. METHODS: A total of 144 consecutive patients were randomly treated for 8 weeks with VSL#3 at a dose of 3,600 billion CFU/day (71 patients) or with placebo (73 patients). RESULTS: In all, 65 patients in the VSL#3 group and 66 patients in the placebo group completed the study. The decrease in ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI) scores of 50% or more was higher in the VSL#3 group than in the placebo group (63.1 vs. 40.8; per protocol (PP) P=0.010, confidence interval (CI)(9)(5)(%) 0.51-0.74; intention to treat (ITT) P=0.031, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.47-0.69). Significant results with VSL#3 were recorded in an improvement of three points or more in the UCDAI score (60.5% vs. 41.4%; PP P=0.017, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.51-0.74; ITT P=0.046, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.47-0.69) and in rectal bleeding (PP P=0.014, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.46-0.70; ITT P=0.036, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.41-0.65), whereas stool frequency (PP P=0.202, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.39-0.63; ITT P=0.229, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.35-0.57), physician's rate of disease activity (PP P=0.088, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.34-0.58; ITT P=0.168, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.31-0.53), and endoscopic scores (PP P=0.086, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.74-0.92; ITT P=0.366, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.66-0.86) did not show statistical differences. Remission was higher in the VSL#3 group than in the placebo group (47.7% vs. 32.4%; PP P=0.069, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.36-0.60; ITT P=0.132, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.33-0.56). Eight patients on VSL#3 (11.2%) and nine patients on placebo (12.3%) reported mild side effects. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3 supplementation is safe and able to reduce UCDAI scores in patients affected by relapsing mild-to-moderate UC who are under treatment with 5-ASA and/or immunosuppressants. Moreover, VSL#3 improves rectal bleeding and seems to reinduce remission in relapsing UC patients after 8 weeks of treatment, although these parameters do not reach statistical significance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are considered important pharmaconutrients for modulating mucosal immunity and therapeutic responses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We investigated the influence of diet therapy involving the use of an "n-3 PUFA food exchange table" (n-3DP) on the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membranes of IBD patients and its remission-maintaining effects. METHODS: We analyzed the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membrane before and after n-3DP intervention in 20 initial-onset IBD patients who had not undergone any dietary intervention. We then analyzed it again and evaluated disease activity after 12-18 months intervention in 230 IBD patients (168 ulcerative colitis, 62 Crohn's disease; follow-up group) in whom n-3DP was introduced after remission had been achieved. The follow-up group was divided into remission and relapse groups. RESULTS: In the 20 initial-onset patients, the mean n-3/n-6 ratio significantly increased after intervention (0.41 +/- 0.16 versus 0.70 +/- 0.20; P < 0.001). In the follow-up group the ratio in the remission group (n = 145) was significantly higher than that in the relapse group (n = 85) (0.65 +/- 0.28 versus 0.53 +/- 0.18; P < 0.001). The ratio significantly decreased in those who suffered a relapse after the beginning of treatment (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: N-3DP significantly increased the erythrocyte membrane n-3/n-6 ratio in IBD patients, and this ratio was significantly higher in the remission group, suggesting that n-3DP alters the fatty acid composition of the cell membrane and influences clinical activity in IBD patients.},

   abstract = {Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract commonly denoted as inflammatory bowel diseases. It has been proposed that these diseases result from aberrant mucosal immune responses to nonpathogenic microbial residents of the intestines. Recently, it was established that continuous interactions between the innate and the adaptive intestinal immune cells and the microbiota are directly involved in maintaining the physiological noninflammatory state of the intestinal mucosa. In light of the complexity of this mucosal homeostasis, it is astonishing that the inflammatory bowel diseases are relatively rare. Recently, altered functions of the innate immune system have been identified. As such, both hyperresponsiveness and hyporesponsiveness of innate cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {Intestinal health requires the coexistence of eukaryotic self with the gut microbiota and dysregulated host-microbial interactions can result in intestinal inflammation. Here, we show that colitis improved in T-bet(-/-)Rag2(-/-) mice that consumed a fermented milk product containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DN-173 010 strain. A decrease in cecal pH and alterations in short chain fatty acid profiles occurred with consumption, and there were concomitant increases in the abundance of select lactate-consuming and butyrate-producing bacteria. These metabolic shifts created a nonpermissive environment for the Enterobacteriaceae recently identified as colitogenic in a T-bet(-/-)Rag2(-/-) ulcerative colitis mouse model. In addition, 16S rRNA-based analysis of the T-bet(-/-)Rag2(-/-) fecal microbiota suggest that the structure of the endogenous gut microbiota played a key role in shaping the host response to the bacterial strains studied herein. We have identified features of the gut microbiota, at the membership and functional level, associated with response to this B. lactis-containing fermented milk product, and therefore this model provides a framework for evaluating and optimizing probiotic-based functional foods.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: High-fat diets have been shown to be a risk factor for ulcerative colitis (UC). Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered to increase lipid peroxidation, while the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid exerts a chemopreventative effect. We evaluated the effect of high-fat diets (20%) enriched with fish or soybean oil on colonic inflammation and DNA damage in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (28-30 days) were fed an American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-93 diet for 47 days and divided into five groups: control normal fat non-colitic (C) or control colitis (CC), high soybean fat group (HS) colitis, high fish fat group colitis, or high-fat soybean plus fish oil colitis. UC was induced from day 35 until day 41 by 3% dextran sulfate sodium. On day 47, the rats were anesthetized; blood samples collected for corticosterone determination, and the distal colon was excised to quantify interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-10, and interferon-gamma levels, myeloperoxidase activity, histological analyses, and DNA damage. The disease activity index was recorded daily. RESULTS: The disease activity index, histological analysis, myeloperoxidase activity, IL-4, interferon-gamma, and corticosterone levels did not differ among the colitic groups. IL-10 was significantly increased by the high fish fat group diet in relation to HS, but only the high soybean-fish fat diet increased the IL-10/IL-4 ratio (anti-inflammatory/pro-inflammatory) to levels closer to the C group and reduced DNA damage compared to the HS group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The data show that high-fat diets did not exacerbate UC and suggest that the soybean and fish oil mixture, more than the fish oil alone, could be a complementary therapy to achieve a cytokine balance in UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anaemia represents a common complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Most studies on anaemia in IBD patients have been performed in tertiary referral centres (RC) and data from gastroenterologic practices (GP) are lacking. We investigated the frequency and severity of anaemia in IBD patients from tertiary referral centres and gastroenterologic practices compared to the general population. METHODS: Data were acquired from patients included in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study. IBD activity was evaluated by CDAI and modified Truelove and Witts severity index (MTWSI). Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin </=120g/L in women and </=130g/L in men. RESULTS: 125 patients from RC (66 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 59 with ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 116 patients from GP (71 CD and 45 UC) were included and compared to 6074 blood donors. Anaemia was found in 21.2% (51/241) of the IBD patients and more frequently in patients from RC as compared to GP and healthy controls (28.8% vs. 12.9% vs. 3.4%; P<0.01). IBD patients from RC suffered more frequently from active disease compared to IBD patients in GP (36% vs. 23%, P=0.032). Supplementation therapy (iron, vitamin B12, folic acid) was performed in 40% of anaemic IBD patients in GP as compared to 43% in RC. CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia is a common complication in patients with IBD and significantly more prevalent in patients from referral centres as compared to patients from gastroenterologic practices. Physicians treating IBD patients should pay attention to the presence of anaemia and ensure sufficient supplementation therapy.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of undergoing emergency subtotal colectomy with hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery in patients with severe ulcerative colitis. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 60 patients who underwent emergency subtotal colectomy with hand-assisted laparoscopic technique (30 cases) or open technique (30 cases) for severe ulcerative colitis. RESULTS: No intraoperative complications occurred in either group. One patient in the laparoscopic group required conversion to open surgery. The median operative time was significantly longer in the laparoscopic group (242 vs. 191 minutes; P < 0.001). The rate of early postoperative complications in the laparoscopic group was significantly less than that in the open group (37 percent vs. 63 percent; P = 0.041). In the open group, four patients required relaparotomy because of peritoneal abscess or strangulation ileus, whereas no patient required relaparotomy in the laparoscopic group (P = 0.040). In the laparoscopic group, the median duration of postoperative food prohibition was significantly shorter (4.8 vs. 5.9 days; P = 0.007), and the median length of hospital stay was significantly shorter (23.0 vs. 33.0 days; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although the operative time was elongated in the laparoscopic group, intraoperative safety and postoperative recovery were satisfactory. For severe ulcerative colitis, hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery can be an alternative to conventional open surgery.},

   abstract = {Defensins are endogenous antibiotics with microbicidal activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, enveloped viruses and protozoa. A disturbed antimicrobial defense, as provided by Paneth- and other epithelial cell defensins, seems to be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. Conspicuously, there is a relative lack of Paneth cell beta-defensins HD-5 and HD-6 in ileal Crohn's disease, both in the absence of a pattern recognition receptor NOD2 mutation and, even more pronounced, in its presence. This deficit is independent of concurrent active inflammation and results in a diminished antibacterial killing by the mucosa. The Crohn's disease mucosa has not only a significant lack in killing different Escherichia coli but also an impaired ability in clearing Staphylococcus aureus as well as anaerobic micro-organisms. Thus, this dysfunction in antibacterial barrier seems to be broad and is not restricted to a single bacterial strain. In addition to directly controlling barrier function, Paneth cell defensins also regulate the composition of the bacterial stool flora. In the majority of patients, the Paneth cell deficiency is mediated by WNT signalling which suggests a disturbed Paneth cell differentiation in ileal Crohn's disease. In contrast, colonic Crohn's disease is characterised by an impaired induction of mucosal beta-defensins, partly due to a low copy number of the beta-defensin gene cluster. Therefore it seems plausible that bacteria take advantage of a niche formed by defensin deficiency. This would represent a paradigm shift in understanding Crohn's disease and provides a target for future therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The pharmacology, uses, dosages, safety, drug interactions, and contraindications of probiotics are reviewed. SUMMARY: Probiotics are live nonpathogenic microorganisms administered to improve microbial balance, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. They consist of Saccharomyces boulardii yeast or lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, and are regulated as dietary supplements and foods. Probiotics exert their beneficial effects through various mechanisms, including lowering intestinal pH, decreasing colonization and invasion by pathogenic organisms, and modifying the host immune response. Probiotic benefits associated with one species or strain do not necessarily hold true for others. The strongest evidence for the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in the treatment of acute diarrhea, most commonly due to rotavirus, and pouchitis. More research is needed to clarify the role of probiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, travelers' diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and vulvovaginal candidiasis. There is no consensus about the minimum number of microorganisms that must be ingested to obtain a beneficial effect; however, a probiotic should typically contain several billion microorganisms to increase the chance that adequate gut colonization will occur. Probiotics are generally considered safe and well tolerated, with bloating and flatulence occurring most frequently. They should be used cautiously in patients who are critically ill or severely immunocompromised or those with central venous catheters since systemic infections may rarely occur. Bacteria-derived probiotics should be separated from antibiotics by at least two hours. CONCLUSION: Probiotics have demonstrated efficacy in preventing and treating various medical conditions, particularly those involving the gastrointestinal tract. Data supporting their role in other conditions are often conflicting.},

   abstract = {The influence of fungal colonization on the course of ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been thoroughly studied. We determined the activity of the disease using clinical, endoscopic and histological index (IACH) criteria in UC patients with fungal colonization and the healing process of UC induced by an intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in rats infected with Candida, without and with antifungal (fluconazole) or probiotic (lacidofil) treatment. The intensity of the healing of the colonic lesions was assessed by macro- and microscopic criteria as well as functional alterations in colonic blood flow (CBF). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) content and plasma proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels were evaluated. Candida more frequently colonized patients with a history of UC within a 5-year period, when compared with those of shorter duration of IBS. Among Candida strains colonizing intestinal mucosa, Candida albicans was identified in 91% of cases. Significant inhibition of the UC activity index as reflected by clinical, endoscopical and histological criteria was observed in the Candida group treated with fluconazole, when compared to that without antifungal treatment. In the animal model, Candida infection significantly delayed the healing of TNBS-induced UC, decreased the CBF and raised the plasma IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels, with these effects reversed by fluconazole or lacidofil treatment. We conclude that 1) Candida delays healing of UC in both humans and that induced by TNBS in rats, and 2) antifungal therapy and probiotic treatment during Candida infection could be beneficial in the restoration and healing of colonic damage in UC.},
