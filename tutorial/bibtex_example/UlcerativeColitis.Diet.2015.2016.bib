   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence and factors associated with transaminasemia in celiac disease are poorly known. AIMS: To investigate these issues in paediatric celiac patients and controls. METHODS: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was studied in 150 children with untreated celiac disease, 161 disease controls and 500 population-based controls. The association between ALT and clinical and histological variables and the effect of a gluten-free diet were investigated in celiac patients. RESULTS: ALT was >30U/l: celiac disease 14.7%, ulcerative colitis 37.2%, Crohn's disease 16.7%, reflux disease 16.2%, functional gastrointestinal symptoms 8.9%, and controls 3.6%. Factors associated with increased ALT were poor growth (45.5% vs 24.2%, P=0.039) and severe villous atrophy (median 23.0U/l vs partial atrophy 19.0U/l, P=0.008), but not age, sex, body-mass index, type or severity of symptoms and co-morbidities. ALT had a moderate correlation with endomysial (r=0.334, P<0.001) and transglutaminase antibodies (r=0.264, P=0.002) and ferritin (r=-0.225, P=0.03), but not with other laboratory values. On gluten-free diet median ALT decreased from 22.0U/l to 18.0U/l (P=0.002) and 80% of the high values normalized. CONCLUSION: Increased ALT is associated with more advanced serological and histological celiac disease. Adherence to a gluten-free diet appears to result in normalization or reduction of ALT levels.},

   abstract = {We aim to review the literature and provide guidance on preventive health measures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Structured searches were performed in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from January 1976 to June 2016 using the following keywords: (inflammatory bowel disease OR Crohn's disease OR ulcerative colitis) AND (health maintenance OR preventive health OR health promotion). Abstracts of the articles selected from each of these multiple searches were reviewed, and those meeting the inclusion criteria (that is, providing data regarding preventive health or health maintenance in IBD patients) were recorded. Reference lists from the selected articles were manually reviewed to identify further relevant studies. Patients with IBD are at increased risk of developing adverse events related to the disease course, therapeutic interventions, or non-adherence to medication. Recent studies have suggested that IBD patients do not receive preventive services with the same thoroughness as patients with other chronic diseases. Preventive health measures can avert morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients with IBD. Gastroenterologists and primary care physicians (PCPs) should have an up to date working knowledge of preventive health measures for IBD patients. A holistic approach and better communication between gastroenterologists and PCPs with explicit clarification of roles will prevent duplication of services and streamline care.},

During Crohn's Disease (CD) or Ulcerative Colitis (UC), two components of the human IBD, distinct stages define the disease onset, severity, progression and remission. Epigenetic, environmental (microbiome, metabolome) and nutritional factors are important in IBD pathogenesis. While the dysbiotic microbiota has been proposed to play a role in disease pathogenesis, the data on IBD and diet are still less convincing. Nonetheless, studies are ongoing to examine the effect of pre/probiotics and/or FODMAP reduced diets on both the gut microbiome and its metabolome in an effort to define the healthy diet in patients with IBD. Knowledge of a unique metabolomic fingerprint in IBD could be useful for diagnosis, treatment and detection of disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {Background. Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) is a diagnostic test with relatively rare usage. In this study, we aimed to evaluate both the optimal cleaning regimen for CCE and the diagnostic value of test in the study group. Methods. A total of 62 patients were enrolled in this study. In the first step, 3 different colon preparing regimens were given to 30 patients [Group A: 3 days of liquid diet, sodium phosphate (NaP) (90 mL), and NaP enema; Group B: 3 days of liquid diet, 4 L of polyethylene glycol (PEG), and metoclopramide; Group C: 3 days of liquid diet, 4 L of PEG, NaP (45 mL), and bisacodyl after capsule ingestion] (10 patients in each group). The other consecutive 32 patients were cleaned with the best regimen which was NaP + PEG and CCE was performed. The results of CCE were controlled with colonoscopy in 28 patients. Results. Group C had the highest cleaning score, compared with the other groups (2.2 +/- 0.4 versus 2.7 +/- 0.4 versus 3.7 +/- 0.4, p value = 0.000). The CCE findings were as follows in 28 patients who were also examined with colonoscopy: polyp (range: 5-10 mm) in 6 patients, internal hemorrhoids in 3 patients, angiodysplasia in 1 patient, diverticula in 1 patient, and ulcerative colitis in 1 patient. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of CCE were 100%, 92%, 93%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusions. Low dosage NaP combined with PEG provides optimal bowel preparation for CCE. CCE appears to be a highly sensitive diagnostic modality for detecting colonic pathologies.},

   abstract = {Recently, increasing interest in natural dietary and therapeutic preparations used as dietary supplements has been observed. One of them is frankincense. This traditional medicine of the East is believed to have anti-inflammatory, expectorant, antiseptic, and even anxiolytic and anti-neurotic effects. The present study aims to verify the reported therapeutic properties of Boswellia resin and describe its chemical composition based on available scientific studies. The main component of frankincense is oil (60%). It contains mono- (13%) and diterpenes (40%) as well as ethyl acetate (21.4%), octyl acetate (13.4%) and methylanisole (7.6%). The highest biological activity among terpenes is characteristic of 11-keto-ss-acetyl-beta-boswellic acid, acetyl-11-keto-ss-boswellic acid and acetyl-alpha-boswellic acid. Contemporary studies have shown that resin indeed has an analgesic, tranquilising and anti-bacterial effects. From the point of view of therapeutic properties, extracts from Boswellia serrata and Boswellia carterii are reported to be particularly useful. They reduce inflammatory conditions in the course of rheumatism by inhibiting leukocyte elastase and degrading glycosaminoglycans. Boswellia preparations inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and prevent the release of leukotrienes, thus having an anti-inflammatory effect in ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, bronchitis and sinusitis. Inhalation and consumption of Boswellia olibanum reduces the risk of asthma. In addition, boswellic acids have an antiproliferative effect on tumours. They inhibit proliferation of tumour cells of the leukaemia and glioblastoma subset. They have an anti-tumour effect since they inhibit topoisomerase I and II-alpha and stimulate programmed cell death (apoptosis).},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic immunologically mediated diseases. The key mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of these diseases is a dysregulated immune response to commensal flora in a genetically susceptible host. Thus intestinal microbial dysbiosis, host genetics, and the external environment all play an important role in the development of incident disease and in determining subsequent disease behavior and outcomes. There are several well-defined or putative environmental risk factors including cigarette smoking, appendectomy, diet, stress and depression, vitamin D as well as hormonal influence. The effect of some of the risk factors appears to differ between CD and UC suggesting that despite shared genetic and immunologic mechanisms, distinct pathways of pathogenesis exist. There is a growing body of literature identifying risk factors for incident disease. There is less rigorous literature defining triggers of relapse, and few controlled clinical trials examining if modification of such risk factors results in an improvement in patient outcomes. This is an area of considerable patient, physician, and scientific interest, and there is an important unmet need for rigorous studies of the external environment in disease pathogenesis and subsequent course.},

   abstract = {IBD, comprising Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic immunologically mediated disease at the intersection of complex interactions between genetics, environment and gut microbiota. Established high-prevalence populations of IBD in North America and Europe experienced the steepest increase in incidence towards the second half of the twentieth century. Furthermore, populations previously considered 'low risk' (such as in Japan and India) are witnessing an increase in incidence. Potentially relevant environmental influences span the spectrum of life from mode of childbirth and early-life exposures (including breastfeeding and antibiotic exposure in infancy) to exposures later on in adulthood (including smoking, major life stressors, diet and lifestyle). Data support an association between smoking and Crohn's disease whereas smoking cessation, but not current smoking, is associated with an increased risk of ulcerative colitis. Dietary fibre (particularly fruits and vegetables), saturated fats, depression and impaired sleep, and low vitamin D levels have all been associated with incident IBD. Interventional studies assessing the effects of modifying these risk factors on natural history and patient outcomes are an important unmet need. In this Review, the changing epidemiology of IBD, mechanisms behind various environmental associations and interventional studies to modify risk factors and disease course are discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet plays a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Dietary zinc may influence risk of disease through effects on autophagy, innate and adaptive immune response and maintenance of the intestinal barrier. METHODS: We analysed data from 170 776 women from the Nurses Health Study I and Nurses Health Study II, who were followed for 26 years. Zinc intake was assessed using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires administered every 4 years. Incident CD and UC were ascertained by medical record review. Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders determined the independent association between zinc intake and incident disease. RESULTS: Over 3 317 550 person-years (p-y) of follow-up, we identified 269 incident cases of CD and 338 incident cases of UC. Zinc intake ranged from 9 mg/day in the lowest quintile to 27 mg/day in the highest quintile. Compared with women with the lowest quintile of intake, the multivariate hazard ratios (HR) for CD were 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65 - 1.29) for women in the second quintile of intake, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.40 - 0.89) for the third quintile, 0.57 (95% CI, 0.38 - 0.86) for fourth quintile and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.50 - 1.10) for the highest quintile (Ptrend = 0.003). The association was stronger for dietary zinc (HR 0.63, 95% CI, 0.43 - 0.93, comparing extreme quintiles) than for zinc intake from supplements. Neither dietary nor supplemental zinc modified risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: In two large prospective cohorts of women, intake of zinc was inversely associated with risk of CD but not UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC); yet, there are few prospective studies of dietary factors. None have examined the association between adolescent diet and risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (CD and UC). METHODS: This study included women enrolled in Nurses' Health Study II who completed a validated high school dietary questionnaire in 1998. We examined the effect of dietary patterns (prudent or Western diet) and individual components of each patterns. We documented incident cases of CD and UC through 2011 based on physician review of medical records and used Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for confounders to estimate hazard ratios and confidence intervals for CD and UC. RESULTS: Over 763,229 person-years of follow-up, we identified 70 incident cases of CD and 103 cases of UC. Compared with women in the lowest quartile of a prudent diet score (characterized by greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and fish), women in the highest quartile had a 53% lower risk of CD (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.98; P trend = 0.04). Specifically, greater intake of fish (P trend = 0.01) and fiber (P trend = 0.06) were associated with lower risk of CD. In contrast, Western diet score was not associated with risk of CD. Neither dietary patterns nor individual food or nutrient groups was associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent diet is associated with risk of CD, but not UC, offering insights into disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in colonic pathophysiology as they had recently been related to colorectal cancer (CRC) development. METHODS: Literature search was conducted on PubMed using combinations of the following terms: ABC transporters, ATP binding cassette transporter proteins, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative, colitis, Crohn's disease, colorectal cancer, colitis, intestinal inflammation, intestinal carcinogenesis, ABCB1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp/CD243/MDR1), ABCC2/multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) and ABCG2/breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), Abcb1/Mdr1a, abcc2/Mrp2, abcg2/Bcrp, knock-out mice, tight junction, membrane lipid function. RESULTS: Recently, human studies reported that changes in the levels of ABC transporters were early events in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence leading to CRC. A link between ABCB1, high fat diet and gut microbes in relation to colitis was suggested by the animal studies. The finding that colitis was preceded by altered gut bacterial composition suggests that deletion of Abcb1 leads to fundamental changes of host-microbiota interaction. Also, high fat diet increases the frequency and severity of colitis in specific pathogen-free Abcb1 KO mice. The Abcb1 KO mice might thus serve as a model in which diet/environmental factors and microbes may be controlled and investigated in relation to intestinal inflammation. Potential molecular mechanisms include defective transport of inflammatory mediators and/or phospholipid translocation from one side to the other of the cell membrane lipid bilayer by ABC transporters affecting inflammatory response and/or function of tight junctions, phagocytosis and vesicle trafficking. Also, diet and microbes give rise to molecules which are potential substrates for the ABC transporters and which may additionally affect ABC transporter function through nuclear receptors and transcriptional regulation. Another critical role of ABCB1 was suggested by the finding that ABCB1 expression identifies a subpopulation of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells which were resistant to treatment with glucocorticoids. The evidence for the involvement of ABCC2 and ABCG2 in colonic pathophysiology was weak. CONCLUSION: ABCB1, diet, and gut microbes mutually interact in colonic inflammation, a well-known risk factor for CRC. Further insight may be translated into preventive and treatment strategies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Imbalances in a variety of factors, including genetics, intestinal flora, and mucosal immunity, can contribute to the development of ulcerative colitis and its side effects. This study evaluated the effects of pretreatment or treatment with arginine by oral administration on intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation (BT), and mucosal intestinal damage due to colitis. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were distributed into 4 groups: standard diet and water (C: control group), standard diet and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) solution (Col: colitis group), 2% L-arginine supplementation for 7 days prior to DSS administration and during disease induction (PT: pretreated group), and 2% L-arginine supplementation during disease induction (T: treated group). Colitis was induced by administration of 1.5% DSS for 7 days. After 14 days, intestinal permeability and BT were evaluated; colons were collected for histologic analysis and determination of cytokines; feces were collected for measurement of immunoglobulin A (IgA). RESULTS: The Col group showed increased intestinal permeability (C vs Col: P < .05) and BT (C vs Col: P < .05). In the arginine-supplemented groups (PT and T), this amino acid tended to decrease intestinal permeability. Arginine decreased BT to liver during PT (P < .05) and to blood, liver, spleen, and lung during T (P < .05). Histologic analysis showed that arginine preserved the intestinal mucosa and tended to decreased inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Arginine attenuates weight loss and BT in mice with colitis.},

   abstract = {Diet and nutritional factors have emerged as possible interventions for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which are characterised by chronic uncontrolled inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Microalgal species are a promising source of n-3 PUFA and derived oxylipins, which are lipid mediators with a key role in the resolution of inflammation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of an oxylipin-containing lyophilised biomass from Chlamydomonas debaryana on a recurrent 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis mice model. Moderate chronic inflammation of the colon was induced in BALB/c mice by weekly intracolonic instillations of low dose of TNBS. Administration of the lyophilised microalgal biomass started 2 weeks before colitis induction and was continued throughout colitis development. Mice were killed 48 h after the last TNBS challenge. Oral administration of the microalgal biomass reduced TNBS-induced intestinal inflammation, evidenced by an inhibition of body weight loss, an improvement in colon morphology and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-17. This product also down-regulated colonic expressions of inducible nitric oxide, cyclo-oxygenase 2 and NF-kappaB, as well as increased PPAR-gamma. In addition, lyophilised microalgal biomass up-regulated the expressions of the antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 and the target gene heme oxygenase 1. This study describes for the first time the prophylactic effects of an oxylipin-containing lyophilised microalgae biomass from C. debaryana in the acute phase of a recurrent TNBS-induced colitis model in mice. These findings suggest the potential use of this microalga, or derived oxylipins, as a nutraceutical in the treatment of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity and the associated use of a gluten-free diet (GFD) are perceived to belong to the spectrum of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, recent reports suggest substantial use of a GFD in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We assessed the bidirectional relationship between IBD and self-reported non-celiac gluten sensitivity (SR-NCGS). METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire screened for SR-NCGS and the use of a GFD in 4 groups: ulcerative colitis (n = 75), Crohn's disease (n = 70), IBS (n = 59), and dyspeptic controls (n = 109). We also assessed diagnostic outcomes for IBD in 200 patients presenting with SR-NCGS. RESULTS: The prevalence of SR-NCGS was 42.4% (n = 25/59) for IBS, followed by 27.6% (n = 40/145) for IBD, and least among dyspeptic controls at 17.4% (n = 19/109); P = 0.015. The current use of a GFD was 11.9% (n = 7/59) for IBS, 6.2% (n = 9/145) for IBD, and 0.9% (1/109) for dyspeptic controls; P = 0.02. No differences were established between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. However, Crohn's disease patients with SR-NCGS were significantly more likely to have stricturing disease (40.9% versus 18.9%, P = 0.046), and higher mean Crohn's Disease Activity Index score (228.1 versus 133.3, P = 0.002), than those without SR-NCGS. Analysis of 200 cases presenting with SR-NCGS suggested that 98.5% (n = 197) could be dietary-related IBS. However, 1.5% (n = 3) were found to have IBD; such patients had associated alarm symptoms, and/or abnormal blood parameters, prompting colonic investigations. CONCLUSIONS: SR-NCGS is not only exclusive to IBS but also associated with IBD, where its presence may be reflecting severe or stricturing disease. Randomized studies are required to further delineate the nature of this relationship and clarify whether a GFD is a valuable dietetic intervention in selected IBD patients.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic, relapsing and remitting set of conditions characterized by an excessive inflammatory response leading to the destruction of the gastrointestinal tract. While the exact etiology of inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests that the human gastrointestinal microbiome plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Manipulation of the gut microbiome has therefore emerged as an attractive alternative for both prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against inflammation. Despite its growing popularity among patients, review of the current literature suggests that the adult microbiome is a highly stable structure resilient to short-term interventions. In fact, most evidence to date demonstrates that therapeutic agents targeting the microflora trigger rapid changes in the microbiome, which then reverts to its pre-treatment state once the therapy is completed. Based on these findings, our ability to treat inflammatory bowel disease through short-term manipulations of the human microbiome may only have a transient effect. Thus, this review is intended to highlight the use of various therapeutic options, including diet, pre- and probiotics, antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplant, to manipulate the microbiome, with specific attention to the alterations made to the microflora along with the duration of impact.},

   abstract = {Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies are successfully used in the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, the molecular mechanism of action of these agents is still a matter of debate. Apart from neutralization of TNF, influence on the intestinal barrier function, induction of apoptosis in mucosal immune cells, formation of regulatory macrophages as well as other immune modulating properties have been discussed as central features. Nevertheless, clinically effective anti-TNF antibodies were shown to differ in their mode-of-action in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the anti-TNF agent etanercept is effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis but failed to induce clinical response in Crohn's disease patients, suggesting different contributions of TNF in the pathogenesis of these inflammatory diseases. In the following, we will review different aspects regarding the mechanism of action of anti-TNF agents in general and analyze comparatively different effects of each anti-TNF agent such as TNF neutralization, modulation of the immune system, reverse signaling and induction of apoptosis. We discuss the relevance of the membrane-bound form of TNF compared to the soluble form for the immunopathogenesis of IBD. Furthermore, we review reports that could lead to personalized medicine approaches regarding treatment with anti-TNF antibodies in chronic intestinal inflammation, by predicting response to therapy.},

   abstract = {The inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consisting of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are defined as idiopathic, chronic and relapsing intestinal disorders occurring in genetically predisposed individuals exposed to environmental risk factors such as diet and microbiome changes. Since conventional drug therapy is expensive and not fully efficient, there is a need for alternative remedies that can improve the outcome in patients suffering from IBD. Whether exercise, which has been proposed as adjunct therapy in IBD, can be beneficial in patients with IBD remains an intriguing question. In this review, we provide an overview of the effects of exercise on human IBD and experimental colitis in animal models that mimic human disease, although the information on exercise in human IBD are sparse and poorly understood. Moderate exercise can exert a beneficial ameliorating effect on IBD and improve the healing of experimental animal colitis due to the activity of protective myokines such as irisin released from working skeletal muscles. CD patients with higher levels of exercise were significantly less likely to develop active disease at six months. Moreover, voluntary exercise has been shown to exert a positive effect on IBD patients' mood, weight maintenance and osteoporosis. On the other hand, depending on its intensity and duration, exercise can evoke transient mild systemic inflammation and enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine release, thereby exacerbating the gastrointestinal symptoms. We discuss recent advances in the mechanism of voluntary and strenuous exercise affecting the outcome of IBD in patients and experimental animal models.},

We studied the effect high-fat diet (HFD; cholesterol up to 70%), low-fat diet (LFD; cholesterol up to 10%), and the normal diet (total fat up to 5%) in rats with TNBS colitis forced to treadmill running exercise (5 days/week) for 6 weeks. In nonexercising HFD rats, the area of colonic damage, colonic tissue weight, the plasma IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, TWEAK, and leptin levels, and the expression of IL-1beta-, TNF-alpha-, and Hif1alpha mRNAs were significantly increased and a significant fall in plasma adiponectin and irisin levels was observed as compared to LFD rats. In HFD animals, the exercise significantly accelerated the healing of colitis, raised the plasma levels of IL-6 and irisin, downregulated the expression of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and Hif1alpha, and significantly decreased the plasma IL-1beta, TNF alpha, TWEAK, and leptin levels. We conclude that HFD delays the healing of colitis in trained rats via decrease in CBF and plasma IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, TWEAK, and leptin levels and the release of protective irisin.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) have been associated with an abnormal mucosal response to the gastrointestinal microbiota. Although dietary fiber affects the gastrointestinal microbiota, there is limited information on the role of fiber on IBD activity. We investigated factors associated with fiber consumption and whether it was associated with flares in patients with IBD. METHODS: We collected a completed 26-item dietary survey from 1619 participants in the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Partners Internet cohort (Crohn's disease, 1130; ulcerative colitis/indeterminate colitis, 489). Eligible individuals were in remission based on disease activity index at baseline and completed a follow-up survey 6 months later. Fiber and whole grain consumption were categorized into quartiles and deciles. Disease flare at 6 months was defined as a disease activity index score exceeding remission cutoff values, and/or an IBD-related surgical procedure or hospitalization since baseline. RESULTS: Participants with longer duration of disease, past history of surgery, and past IBD hospitalization ate less fiber. The risks for disease flare differed by disease type. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of fiber consumption, participants with Crohn's disease in the highest quartile were less likely to have a flare (adjusted odds ratios [OR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.90). Participants with Crohn's disease who reported that they did not avoid high-fiber foods were approximately 40% less likely to have a disease flare than those who avoided high-fiber foods (adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.43-0.81). There was no association between fiber intake and flares in patients with ulcerative colitis (adjusted OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.92-3.60). CONCLUSIONS: Intake of dietary fiber is associated with reduced disease flares in patients with Crohn's disease, but not UC. Recommendations to limit dietary fiber should be re-evaluated.},

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate long-term health-related quality of life outcomes among patients who had a colectomy within the previous 10 years. A cross-sectional survey was administered to consecutive patients >/=18 years of age with ulcerative colitis who had a colectomy within the last 10 years from centers in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Data were extracted from medical chart reviews to confirm selected self-reported patient characteristics. Of 351 survey respondents, 49 % were male and the median age was 40 years (interquartile range 30-52). Respondents were diagnosed with UC a median of 9.2 (5.7-15.1) years prior to the survey and first surgery occurred a median of 3.7 (2.1-5.8) years ago. Although most respondents (84 %) reported improved quality of life compared to the status before surgery, 81 % experienced problems in at least one of the following areas: depression, work productivity, restrictions in diet, body image, and sexual function. According to HADS scores, 30 and 17 % of survey respondents experienced anxiety and depression, respectively. Among moderate to severe UC patients pre-colectomy, 27 % of men and 28 % of women reported that their sexual life was worse now than before surgery. The mean EQ-5D utility index score overall was 0.79 (95 % confidence interval 0.77-0.81). Quality of life after colectomy for UC is generally good, but there are persistent quality of life issues that impact multiple domains, including psychological and sexual functioning.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can arise at any age, with peak incidence in adolescence and young adulthood. A registry of pediatric cases of IBD offers the opportunity to document their diagnosis and treatment, with the ultimate aim of improving diagnosis and treatment in the future. METHODS: In the German-language CEDATA-GPGE registry, 3991 cases of IBD in patients less than 18 years of age were documented from 2004 to 2014. The 1257 patients who were prospectively included in the registry upon diagnosis and whose further course was documented for at least three months were analyzed in two separate groups--under 10 years old, and 10 years and above--with respect to the type and duration of their symptoms until diagnosis, the completeness of the diagnostic evaluation, the disease phenotype, and the initial treatment. RESULTS: Of the 958 patients for whom full documentation was available, 616 (64.3%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 278 (29%) had ulcerative colitis (UC), 64 (6.7%) had an unclassified IBD, and 23.2% were under 10 years old. The latency to diagnosis was longer for CD than for UC (0.5 versus 0.3 years), regardless of age. 62.5% of the CD patients had ileocolonic involvement, and more than half had involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract. 71% of the patients with UC had subtotal colitis or pancolitis. Continuous improvement was seen in diagnostic assessment according to published guidelines. For example, in 2004/2005, 69% of patients were evaluated endoscopically with ileocolonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy; this fraction had risen to nearly 100% by 2013/2014. Similarly, the percentage of patients who underwent a diagnostic evaluation of the small intestine, as recommended, rose from 41.2% to 60.9% over the same period. The most common initial treatments were 5- amino - salicylates (86.8% CD, 100% UC) and glucocorticoids (60.6% CD, 65.6% UC). 32% of the patients with CD received exclusive enteral nutrition therapy. CONCLUSION: Most of these pediatric patients with IBD, whether in the younger or the older age group, had extensive bowel involvement at the time of diagnosis. The registry data imply that improvement in clinical course may be achieved by shortening the time to diagnosis and by closer adherence to the diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines.},

Environmental factors such as dietary patterns may increase symptoms in UC patients. AIM: To validate and implement a questionnaire to identify foods that exacerbates symptoms in UC patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted to validate and to assess the relationship of food and symptoms in Mexican UC patients. RESULTS: The IVC obtained was 0.56 in the questionnaire and kappa = 0.03 in foods from animal origin, 0.5 cereals and tubers, 0.2 legumes, 0.4 vegetables and fruits, 0.4 fats and 0.3 in others. The evaluation was carried out in UC patients (n = 233), 65% active and 35% in UC remission, the current age was 45 (SD; 15) years in active UC and 40 (SD; 15) years in UC remission. Three food groups were made based on the frequency of symptoms: Group A; symptoms more often, especially the active vs remission (P <0.05); Group B caused more symptoms in remission UC vs active UC (P = 0.07) and Group C caused more symptoms in the active UC (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Foods with higher frequency of symptoms in patients with UC were: beans, whole milk, plum, lima beans and spicy sauce.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prebiotic dietary fibers resist digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract and allow for stimulation of bacteria in the distal intestine and colon. Stimulation of bacteria among different individuals varies greatly, depending on a wide range of variables. OBJECTIVE: To determine the range of differences in response between individuals, a preclinical in vitro fermentation was conducted with six fecal donors. The primary objective was to compare the fecal microbiota of six individuals at baseline, 12 h and 24 h post-exposure to partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG). METHOD: Fecal donations were collected from six healthy individuals consuming a non-specific Western diet, free of antibiotic treatments in the past year, not affected by any GI diseases and not consuming any probiotic or prebiotic supplements. Fecal samples were exposed to 0.5 g of PHGG and measured for bacterial changes at 0, 12 and 24 h based on 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Parabacteroides increased from 3.48% of sequence reads to 10.62% of sequence reads after 24 h (p = 0.0181) and Bacteroidetes increased from 45.89% of sequence reads to 50.29% of sequence reads (p = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: PHGG stimulates growth of Parabacteroides, a genus of bacteria that have been inversely associated with IBS and ulcerative colitis. PHGG provides stimulation of beneficial Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides and Parabacteroides), which may be correlated with many positive health markers and outcomes. PHGG is a prebiotic dietary fiber that is readily fermentable.},

The prevalence of IBD in celiac patients has been reported as 5-10 times higher than in the general population. The possibility of the presence of CD in IBD should be considered in IBD patients with long-term iron deficiency anemia (IDA) not responsive to iron supplementation. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterized by intestinal and extra intestinal symptoms due to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in subject without CD and/or wheat allergy. Patients with Crohn's disease and SR-NCGS were more significantly affected by joint pains compared to UC patients (50% versus 11.1%). In Crohn's patients, a higher percentage of fatigue (50% versus 38.9%) and headache (27.3% versus 22.2%) was evident. For the association between NCGS and IBD new studies are warranted and, at this moment, a gluten free diet (GFD) may be useful more in CrD than in UC.},

BACKGROUND: Despite the impact of UC on different aspects of daily life, patient's and physician's satisfaction with clinical management has been poorly evaluated. STUDY: A Delphi study involving 22 patients and 20 clinicians was conducted. The patient's questionnaire included 285 items regarding diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, whereas the physician's questionnaire added 32 specific items for clinicians. Relevance of items was scored from 1 (not at all important) to 9 (very important). Recommendations were based on very highly rated items. RESULTS: Most items were rated consistently by patients and physicians with some exceptions. Patients emphasized the choice of moderate flare-ups to be followed at the hospital setting rather than in primary care as well as to be informed on aspects, such as diet and impact of UC on their health and lifestyle. Treatment-related efficacy, safety, and improved quality of life were relevant for both patients and physicians. Physicians believed that to reduce pill burden was a crucial aspect to improve patient's satisfaction. Patients preferred oral administration treatment over rectal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified specific aspects related to the management of mild-to-moderate UC that both patients and physicians considered to be highly relevant for patient satisfaction. Recommendation based on these factors would be important at the time of designing and implementing strategies targeting satisfaction in UC patients.},

The antioxidant mineral selenium (Se) was measured in serum samples from 106 IBD patients (53 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 53 with Crohn's disease (CD)) and from 30 healthy controls. Serum Se concentrations were significantly lower in UC and CD patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001) and significantly lower in CD patients than in UC patients (p = 0.006). Se concentrations in patients were significantly influenced by sex, body mass index (BMI), the inflammatory biomarker alpha-1-antitrypsin, surgery, medical treatment, the severity, extent, and form of the disease and the length of time since onset (p < 0.05). Se concentrations in IBD patients were positively and linearly correlated with nutritional (protein, albumin, prealbumin, cholinesterase and total cholesterol) and iron status-related (hemoglobin, Fe and hematocrit) parameters (p < 0.05). A greater impairment of serum Se and cardiovascular status was observed in CD than in UC patients. An adequate nutritional Se status is important in IBD patients to minimize the cardiovascular risk associated with increased inflammation biomarkers, especially in undernourished CD patients, and is also related to an improved nutritional and body iron status.},

METHODS: A total of 7305 sequential subjects of both sexes were screened, collecting clinical data through the FRAX questionnaire, and measuring heel bone stiffness by Quantitative Ultrasonography (QUS). The 10-year risk for hip and major osteoporotic fractures was calculated taking into account personal or family history of fragility fracture, smoking, alcohol abuse, rheumatoid arthritis, prolonged steroids assumption. Additional risk factors were evaluated, including early menopause, poor sunlight exposure, low dietary calcium intake, physical inactivity, number of pregnancies, months of lactation, tobacco cigarettes smoked per year, specific causes of secondary osteoporosis. Through a correlation study, the influence of each factor on the development of osteoporosis was analyzed. RESULTS: As many as 18 % of women suffer from osteoporosis, as defined by QUS T-score. The calculation of FRAX confirmed the weight of the already known risk factors. The correlation study revealed the significance of some additional factors, such as hyperthyroidism, nephrolithiasis, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, poor sun exposure, and oophorectomy before age 50. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of secondary osteoporosis in the Italian population clearly indicates the importance of additional risk factors not yet included in the FRAX algorithm, for which preventive measures should be considered. Screening campaigns may allow both early diagnosis and access to treatment.},

This study aimed to systematically review all published clinical trials evaluating the effects of a regular diet on symptoms of IBD. Three medical databases were searched for clinical trials evaluating an intervention that involved dietary manipulation using a regular diet on adults with IBD whose symptoms were objectively measured before and after the intervention. The most common types of regular diet interventions that we observed in the literature fell into the following three categories: low residue/low fiber diets, exclusion diets, or other specific diets. Of all included studies, the few that were of higher quality and that observed a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the diet group compared to the control group fell under the exclusion diet group or the other specific diet group. We were able to identify several high quality clinical trials evaluating dietary manipulations on symptoms of IBD. Exclusion diets and the low FODMAP diet are two areas identified in this review that show promise for having therapeutic benefits for patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Plant-based diets (PBDs) are a healthy alternative to westernized diets. A semivegetarian diet, a PBD, has been shown to prevent a relapse in Crohn disease. However, there is no way to measure adherence to PBDs. OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple way of evaluating adherence to a PBD for Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). DESIGN: PBD scores were assigned according to the frequency of consumption provided on a food-frequency questionnaire, obtained on hospitalization for 159 patients with ulcerative colitis and 70 patients with Crohn disease. Eight items considered to be preventive factors for IBD were scored positively, and 8 items considered to be IBD risk factors were scored negatively. The PBD score was calculated from the sum of plus and minus scores. Higher PBD scores indicated greater adherence to a PBD. The PBD scores were evaluated on hospitalization and 2 years after discharge for 22 patients with Crohn disease whose dietary pattern and prognosis were established. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Plant-Based Diet score. RESULTS: The PBD scores differed significantly, in descending order, by dietary type: pro-Japanese diet, mixed type, and pro-westernized diet (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test). The PBD scores in the ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease groups were 10.9 +/- 9.5 and 8.2 +/- 8.2, respectively. For patients with Crohn disease, those with long-term remission and normal C-reactive protein concentration were significantly more likely to have PBD scores of 25 or greater than below 25 (chi2). CONCLUSION: The PBD score is a valid assessment of PBD dietary adherence.},

   abstract = {Overweight and obesity are global health concerns. Various effective weight-loss diets have been developed, including the Atkins diet. The Atkins diet is known as an extreme low-carbohydrate diet. This diet reduces body weight and has gained widespread popularity. However, the metabolite profiles of such a diet have been shown to be detrimental to colonic health. Therefore, a concern for the long-term health effects of this diet exists. We encountered a case in which ulcerative colitis developed while the patient was following the Atkins diet.A man, 172 cm in height and weighing 72 kg, at age 36 years followed a low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet. His weight decreased to 66 kg as desired. Thereafter he noticed bloody stool. Colonoscopy revealed diffuse inflammation limited to the rectum, and he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. He underwent an educational hospitalization for ulcerative colitis. A plant-based/semivegetarian diet was provided during hospitalization. Bloody stool disappeared during hospitalization and he achieved remission without medication for inflammatory bowel disease.This case indicates that an onset of ulcerative colitis can be an adverse event to a low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet.},

   abstract = {In Japan, Helicobacter pylori eradication has been approved since 2013 for treatment of H pylori-induced chronic gastritis, in an attempt to reduce the prevalence of gastric cancer, a leading cancer in Japan. H pylori infection affects more than 50% of the world's population. H pylori eradication therapy is generally safe. To our knowledge, no case of newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis occurring immediately after H pylori eradication therapy has previously been reported.A 63-year-old man received a diagnosis of chronic gastritis and H pylori infection. In early March 2014, primary H pylori eradication therapy was initiated; lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin were administered for 1 week. Beginning on the fourth day, he had watery diarrhea twice a day. From the 11th day, bloody stools and watery diarrhea increased to 6 times a day. Colonoscopy, performed on the 40th day after termination of drug therapy, revealed diffuse inflammation in the distal aspect of the colon, with histologic findings consistent with ulcerative colitis. He was admitted to the hospital and was provided with a semivegetarian diet and metronidazole. He noticed a gradual decrease in the amount of blood in his feces then a disappearance of the blood. A fecal occult blood test on the 11th hospital day recorded 337 ng/mL. Fecal occult blood test is not indicated during macroscopic bloody stool but is indicated after disappearance of bloody stool. Therefore, he achieved clinical remission by the 11th hospital day. He was in remission on discharge.New onset of ulcerative colitis should be added to a list of adverse events of H pylori eradication therapy.},

   abstract = {A careful selection of the probiotic agent, standardization of the dose and detailed characterization of the beneficial effects are essential when considering use of a probiotic for the dietary management of serious diseases. However, changes in the manufacturing processes, equipment or facilities can result in differences in the product itself due to the live nature of probiotics. The need to reconfirm safety and/or efficacy for any probiotic product made at a different factory is therefore mandatory. Recently, under the brand VSL#3(R), a formulation produced by a manufacturer different from the previous one, has been commercialized in some European countries (the UK and Holland). VSL#3 is a high concentration multi-strain preparation which has been recognized by the main Gastroenterology Associations for the dietary management of pouchitis as well as ulcerative colitis. We have compared the "original" VSL#3 produced in USA with the "newfound" VSL#3 produced in Italy. According to our results, the "newfound" VSL#3 has 130-150% more "dead bacteria" compared to the "original" product, raising concerns for the well-known association between dead microbes with adverse effects. The abilities of bacterial lysates from the two formulations to influence in vitro viability and proliferation of different tumor cell lines also resulted different. The repair of previously scratched monolayers of various adherent tumor cell lines (i.e. HT1080, and Caco-2 cells) was inhibited more significantly by the "original" VSL#3 when compared to the "newfound" VSL#3. Tumor cell cycle profile, in particular cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death of the cancer cells, further confirms that the "original" VSL#3 has a better functional profile than the "newfound" VSL#3, at least in in vitro. Our data stress the importance of the production conditions for the "newfound" VSL#3 considering that this product is intended to be used for the dietary management of patients with very serious diseases, such as chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: L-arginine (L-Arg) is the substrate for both inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS2) and arginase (ARG) enzymes. L-Arg is actively transported into cells by means of cationic amino acid transporter (SLC7) proteins. We have linked L-Arg and arginase 1 activity to epithelial restitution. Our aim was to determine if L-Arg, related amino acids, and metabolic enzymes are altered in ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Serum and colonic tissues were prospectively collected from 38 control subjects and 137 UC patients. Dietary intake, histologic injury, and clinical disease activity were assessed. Amino acid levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured by real-time PCR. Colon tissue samples from 12 Crohn's disease patients were obtained for comparison. RESULTS: Dietary intake of arginine and serum L-Arg levels were not different in UC patients versus control subjects. In active UC, tissue L-Arg was decreased, whereas L-citrulline (L-Cit) and the L-Cit/L-Arg ratio were increased. This pattern was also seen when paired involved (left) versus uninvolved (right) colon tissues in UC were assessed. In active UC, SLC7A2 and ARG1 mRNA levels were decreased, whereas ARG2 and NOS2 were increased. Similar alterations in mRNA expression occurred in tissues from Crohn's disease patients. In involved UC, SLC7A2 and ARG1 mRNA levels were decreased, and NOS2 and ARG2 increased, when compared with uninvolved tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with UC exhibit diminished tissue L-Arg, likely attributable to decreased cellular uptake and increased consumption by NOS2. These findings combined with decreased ARG1 expression indicate a pattern of dysregulated L-Arg availability and metabolism in UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of current smoking on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) course has been studied extensively; smoking is deleterious in Crohn's disease (CD), and beneficial in ulcerative colitis (UC). Except for enteral nutrition, there are only limited data regarding the impact of diet on disease course. KEY MESSAGES: Current smoking worsens the course of CD, increasing the incidence of flares, the need for steroids, immunosuppressants and re-operations. Conversely, smoking cessation has a rapid beneficial effect on disease course, decreasing the risk of flares and of post-operative recurrences. From 3 months after the quit date, quitters have a disease course similar to that of never smokers. Achieving smoking cessation in CD is thus an important goal of therapy. On the contrary, smoking improves the course of UC and in particular, is associated with a decreased need for colectomy. Smoking cessation increases the risk of flare and the need for steroids or immunosuppressants. However, patients with UC should not be discouraged to quit, because the beneficial effect of smoking for their disease is counterbalanced by the deleterious systemic effects of tobacco. Among dietary interventions, only exclusive enteral nutrition was shown to induce remission and achieve mucosal healing in some patients with CD. The beneficial effect of liquid-defined diet is observed whatever be the type of administration (orally or by tube), the type of diet regarding protein and fat content and resulting alterations in the gut microbiota. In UC, enteral nutrition has no effect. Finally, popularized restrictive diets in IBD as the specific-carbohydrate diet and the gluten-free diet have not been rigorously tested. In a small trial, a semi-vegetarian diet was shown to be effective in maintaining remission over 2 years in CD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD should not smoke and avoid passive smoking. Aside from the defined liquid diets, there is no rationale for advising particular diets.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at a high risk of malnutrition and retain an altered body composition. We hypothesized that anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) alpha therapy may improve dietary intake and have a beneficial influence on body composition in these patients. METHODS: Our study involved 40 IBD outpatients (33 Crohn's disease, 7 ulcerative colitis); 24 of these received adalimumab (160/80/40EOW) and 16 were treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg at week 0, 2, 6, and subsequently every 8 weeks). Body composition was measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis, while dietary intake was recorded prior to initiating biologicals and 3 months afterwards. Body composition indexes: fat-free mass index [FFMI], body fat mass index [BFMI]) were calculated in kg/m2. RESULTS: Baseline BMI (kg/m2) and muscle parameters increased significantly at the end of the observational period (BMI: 23.81+/-7.19 vs. 24.52+/-7.34, p<0.001; FFMI: 17.64+/-3.00 vs. 18.14+/-3.08, p<0.001; at week 0 vs. 12, respectively). However, no significant changes were detected in the fat parameters (BFMI: 6.21+/-5.20 vs. 6.44+/-5.27, respectively). We found no significant difference between the effects of adalimumab vs. infliximab on body composition (deltaFFMI: 0.55+/-0.82 vs. 0.43+/-0.69; deltaBFMI: 0.23+/-0.85 vs. 0.21+/-1.01, respectively). No significant difference was observed in the extent of changes in parameters whether the patients were on corticosteroids (n=15) or not (n=25) at week 0 (deltaFFMI: 0.44+/-0.84 vs 0.59+/-0.72; deltaBFMI: 0.36+/-1.12 vs. 0.09+/-0.71, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that muscle parameters improved during the anti-TNF induction therapy, while fat parameters did not change significantly. Thus, induction anti-TNF therapy might have a beneficial effect on body composition.},

   abstract = {AIM: To analyze the changes of different Lactobacillus species in ulcerative colitis patients and to further assess the therapeutic effects of selected Lactobacillus strains on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis in BALB/c mice. METHODS: Forty-five active ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 45 population-based healthy controls were enrolled. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and real-time PCR were performed for qualitative and quantitative analyses, respectively, of the Lactobacillus species in UC patients. Three Lactobacillus strains from three species were selected to assess the therapeutic effects on experimental colitis. Sixty 8-week-old BALB/c mice were divided into six groups. The five groups that had received DSS were administered normal saline, mesalazine, L. fermentum CCTCC M206110 strain, L. crispatus CCTCC M206119 strain, or L. plantarum NCIMB8826 strain. We assessed the severity of colitis based on disease activity index (DAI), body weight loss, colon length, and histologic damage. RESULTS: The detection rate of four of the 11 Lactobacillus species decreased significantly (P < 0.05), and the detection rate of two of the 11 Lactobacillus species increased significantly (P < 0.05) in UC patients. Relative quantitative analysis revealed that eight Lactobacillus species declined significantly in UC patients (P < 0.05), while three Lactobacillus species increased significantly (P < 0.05). The CCTCC M206110 treatment group had less weight loss and colon length shortening, lower DAI scores, and lower histologic scores (P < 0.05), while the CCTCC M206119 treatment group had greater weight loss and colon length shortening, higher histologic scores, and more severe inflammatory infiltration (P < 0.05). NCIMB8826 improved weight loss and colon length shortening (P < 0.05) with no significant influence on DAI and histologic damage in the colitis model. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of an L. crispatus CCTCC M206119 supplement aggravated DSS-induced colitis. L. fermentum CCTCC M206110 proved to be effective at attenuating DSS-induced colitis. The potential probiotic effect of L. plantarum NCIMB8826 on UC has yet to be assessed.},

   abstract = {p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that is overexpressed in colorectal cancer. PAK1 is a target of mesalamine [5-aminosylicylic acid (5-ASA)], a common drug for the treatment of ulcerative colitis with prospective chemopreventive properties. Here, we investigated whether PAK1 deletion impedes tumorigenesis in murine intestinal cancer models. Ten-week-old APC(min) or APC(min)/PAK1(-/-) mice were monitored for 8 weeks, euthanized, and assessed for tumor number and size. Six- to 8-week-old PAK1(-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice received one 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane (AOM) and four cycles of 1.7% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 4 days followed by 14 days of regular water. Mice also received 5-ASA via diet. Tumor incidence and size was assessed via colonoscopy and pathology. Molecular targets of PAK1 and 5-ASA were evaluated via immunohistochemistry (IHC) in both models. PAK1 deletion reduced tumor multiplicity and tumor burden but did not alter average tumor size in APC(min) mice. IHC revealed that PAK1 deletion reduced p-AKT, beta-catenin, and c-Myc expression in APC(min) adenomas. Colonoscopy and pathologic analysis revealed that PAK1 deletion reduced tumor multiplicity without affecting tumor size in AOM/DSS-treated mice. 5-ASA treatment and PAK1 deletion impeded tumor multiplicity and dysplastic lesions in AOM/DSS mice. IHC further revealed that 5-ASA blocked beta-catenin signaling via inhibition of PAK1/p-AKT. These data indicate that PAK1 contributes to initiation of intestinal carcinogenesis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an entity that mainly includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn s disease (CD). Improved health care, diet changes, and higher industrialization are associated with an increase in IBD prevalence. This supports the central role of environmental factors in the pathology of this disease. However, IBD also shows a relevant genetic component as shown by high heritability. Classic genetic studies showed relevant associations between IBD susceptibility and genes involved in the immune response. This is consistent with prior theories about IBD development. According to these, contact of the immune system with a high number of harmless antigens from the diet and the bacterial flora should originate tolerance while preserving response against pathogens. Failure to achieve this balance may originate the typical inflammatory response associated with IBD. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have confirmed the implication of the immune system, particularly the Th17 immune response, previously associated to other autoimmune diseases, and of autophagy. In this paper, the mechanisms involved in these two relevant pathways and their potential role in the pathogenesis of IBD are reviewed.},

   abstract = {Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC). Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.},

   abstract = {Numerous environmental factors have been linked with inflammatory bowel disease. These include smoking, diet, hygiene, drugs, geographical and psychosocial factors. These factors may either increase the risk of or protect against developing this condition and can also affect the course of illness in a positive or negative manner. A number of studies have examined the influence of environmental factors on inflammatory bowel diseases as a whole as well as on ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease separately. As there are differences in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the effect of environmental factors on their onset and course is not always similar. Some factors have shown a consistent association, while reports on others have been conflicting. In this article we discuss the current evidence on the roles of these factors on inflammatory bowel disease, both as causative/protective agents and as modifiers of disease course.},

   abstract = {The present study investigated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of dietary protocatechuic acid (PCA), a simple hydrophilic phenolic compound commonly found in many edible vegetables, on dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis and its associated hepatotoxicity in rats. PCA was administered orally at 10 mg kg(-1) to dextran sulphate sodium exposed rats for five days. The result revealed that administration of PCA significantly (p < 0.05) prevented the incidence of diarrhea and bleeding, the decrease in the body weight gain, shortening of colon length and the increase in colon mass index in DSS-treated rats. Furthermore, PCA prevented the increase in the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, markers of liver toxicity and markedly suppressed the DSS-mediated elevation in colonic nitric oxide concentration and myeloperoxidase activity in the treated rats. Administration of PCA significantly protected against colonic and hepatic oxidative damage by increasing the antioxidant status and concomitantly decreased hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation levels in the DSS-treated rats. Moreover, histological examinations confirmed PCA chemoprotection against colon and liver damage. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that PCA significantly inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression in the colon of DSS-treated rats. In conclusion, the effective chemoprotective role of PCA in colitis and the associated hepatotoxicity is related to its intrinsic anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties.},

   abstract = {AIMS: The maintenance of heme homeostasis, mucosa cell renewal, and redox environment in the intestine is essential to permit digestion, absorption, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and immune response and to avoid the development of gut disorders. The feline leukemia virus, subgroup C, receptor 1a (FLVCR1a) is a heme exporter expressed in almost all cell types, including intestinal cells. This work investigates the role of FLVCR1a in the intestine, taking advantage of an intestine-specific conditional Flvcr1a-knockout mouse and of FLVCR1a-depleted Caco2 cells. RESULTS: The data show that FLVCR1a does not participate in the absorption of dietary heme, whereas it is involved in the export of de novo synthesized heme from intestinal cells. The loss of Flvcr1a is associated with a decrease of intestinal cell proliferation and with alterations in the peculiar homeostasis of proliferating cells, including the maintenance of their redox status. The involvement of FLVCR1a in these processes renders this exporter crucial for the survival of mice in a model of ulcerative colitis. INNOVATION: These findings shed light on the role of heme export in the dietary heme absorption process and unravel a new role for heme export in the control of mucosal renewal and in proliferating cell redox status and metabolic activity, demonstrating a crucial role for FLVCR1a in maintaining intestinal homeostasis in both physiologic and pathologic situations. CONCLUSION: By exporting the excess of de novo synthesized heme from intestinal cells, FLVCR1a participates in the control of intestinal mucosa homeostasis.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The ESPEN guideline presents a multidisciplinary focus on clinical nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODOLOGY: The guideline is based on extensive systematic review of the literature, but relies on expert opinion when objective data were lacking or inconclusive. The conclusions and 64 recommendations have been subject to full peer review and a Delphi process in which uniformly positive responses (agree or strongly agree) were required. RESULTS: IBD is increasingly common and potential dietary factors in its aetiology are briefly reviewed. Malnutrition is highly prevalent in IBD - especially in Crohn's disease. Increased energy and protein requirements are observed in some patients. The management of malnutrition in IBD is considered within the general context of support for malnourished patients. Treatment of iron deficiency (parenterally if necessary) is strongly recommended. Routine provision of a special diet in IBD is not however supported. Parenteral nutrition is indicated only when enteral nutrition has failed or is impossible. The recommended perioperative management of patients with IBD undergoing surgery accords with general ESPEN guidance for patients having abdominal surgery. Probiotics may be helpful in UC but not Crohn's disease. Primary therapy using nutrition to treat IBD is not supported in ulcerative colitis, but is moderately well supported in Crohn's disease, especially in children where the adverse consequences of steroid therapy are proportionally greater. However, exclusion diets are generally not recommended and there is little evidence to support any particular formula feed when nutritional regimens are constructed. CONCLUSIONS: Available objective data to guide nutritional support and primary nutritional therapy in IBD are presented as 64 recommendations, of which 9 are very strong recommendations (grade A), 22 are strong recommendations (grade B) and 12 are based only on sparse evidence (grade 0); 21 recommendations are good practice points (GPP).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) occur worldwide with differences in epidemiology, etiology and phenotype between regions. Breakthroughs have occurred in IBD genetics, although the genes that predispose to IBD differ between racial groups. What do we know about the 'envirotype' of those who develop IBD, and are there differences between the East and the West? KEY MESSAGES: The strongest IBD risk factor identified to date is a family history of IBD. Whilst likely representing an underlying genetic predisposition, it may also reflect shared environmental factors amongst family members. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of developing CD, whilst smoking is less common in those who develop UC. Having ceased smoking increases the risk of developing UC subsequently. Unlike the West, cigarette smoking appears to play a lesser role in the East. Other environmental risk factors are inconsistent. Studies of migrant populations moving from regions of low to high IBD incidence point to early life as a key time for environmental triggers. In these populations, it is the second generation (those born in the high incidence region) with higher IBD incidence rates than their parents. Early life environmental exposures have been studied exhaustively but, except for having been breastfed, few putative early childhood environmental risk factors have been shown consistently to alter the risk of developing IBD. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of IBD environmental risk factors remains elusive in both the East and West. In the West, case-control studies are unlikely to move the field forward without multi-level (phenotype, genotype, diet history, 'envirotype' and microbiome) data, ideally collected prospectively. Cohort studies (such as the Genes, Environment, Microbiome project) may address some of these issues. However, in the East where IBD incidence is still increasing, well-designed comprehensive case-control studies may identify differences that give an insight into the 'envirotype' driving IBD incidence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The main symptom of ulcerative colitis is diarrhoea, which is often accompanied by painful tenesmus and faecal blood and mucus. It sometimes co-occurs with abdominal pain, fever, feeling of fatigue, loss of appetite and weight loss. Some dietary factors have been indicated as important in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The aim of the study was to analyse the association between retinoid intake (total vitamin A, retinol, beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin) and ulcerative colitis symptoms (abdominal pain, faecal blood, faecal mucus, faecal pus) in individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission. METHODS: Assessment of diet was based on self-reported data from each patient's dietary records taken over a period of three typical, random days (2 weekdays and 1 day of the weekend). RESULTS: A total of 56 individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission (19 males and 37 females) were recruited for the study. One in every four individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission was characterised as having inadequate vitamin A intake. Higher lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin intakes in individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission were associated with lower faecal blood, mucus and pus but not with lower incidence of abdominal pain. Higher carotene intake in individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission may contribute to higher incidence of faecal mucus. CONCLUSIONS: Optimising intake of specific retinoids may enhance disease control in individuals with ulcerative colitis. Prospective studies, including patient reported and objective outcomes, are required to confirm this.},

   abstract = {Oral prescription medical foods have long been used in hospital settings but are also appropriate therapies for gastrointestinal disorders in outpatient medical practice. Oral serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) has been shown in clinical studies to reduce loose stools and improve stool consistency as well as other symptoms (i.e., abdominal pain, bloating, and urgency) in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and human immunodeficiency virus-associated enteropathy. This case series reports the outcomes of 14 IBS patients who received SBI as an addition to standard of care at an individual physician's clinical practice. The patients: 2 IBS with constipation (IBS-C), 7 IBS-D, 2 mixed diarrhea and constipation IBS (IBS-M) and 3 undefined IBS (IBS-U; also described by some physicians as IBS-Bloating), ranged in age from 22-87 years. SBI (5 g or 10 g daily dose) was added to the patient's current standard care and followed for several weeks to determine if symptoms were improved with the addition of SBI. Overall, 12 of the 14 patients indicated some level of improvement through direct questioning of the patients regarding changes from the prior visit. One IBS-Bloating patient had a resolution of symptoms and two patients (1 IBS-Bloating and 1 IBS-C) discontinued therapy because of insufficient relief. The 12 patients who continued on therapy reported an overall improvement in symptoms with better stool consistency, decreased frequency as well as reductions in abdominal pain, bloating, distention, and incontinence. In most cases, therapeutic effects of SBI were seen within the first four weeks of therapy with continued improvements at subsequent visits. SBI has a multifaceted mechanism of action and may help to manage IBS by providing a distinct protein source required to normalize bowel function, gastrointestinal microbiota, and nutritionally enhance tight junction protein expression between intestinal epithelial cells. SBI as a medical food provides a safe option for patients with IBS-D but may have application in other forms of IBS.},

   abstract = {Fish oil rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has beneficial effects on human health. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are precursors of eicosanoids and docosanoids, signaling molecules that control inflammation and immunity, and their dietary uptake improves a range of disorders including cardiovascular diseases, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. The unsaturated nature of these fatty acids, however, makes them prone to oxidation, especially when they are incorporated into (membrane) phospholipids. The skin is an organ strongly exposed to oxidative stress, mainly due to solar ultraviolet radiation. Thus, increased levels of PUFA in combination with oxidative stress could cause increased local generation of oxidized lipids, whose action spectrum reaches from signaling molecules to reactive carbonyl compounds that can crosslink biomolecules. Here, we investigated whether PUFA supplements to fibroblasts are incorporated into membrane phospholipids and whether an increase of PUFA within phospholipids affects the responses of the cells to UV exposure. The redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2 is the major regulator of the fibroblast stress response to ultraviolet radiation or exposure to oxidized lipids. Here we addressed how Nrf2 signaling would be affected in PUFA-supplemented human dermal fibroblasts and mouse dermal fibroblasts from Nrf2-deficient and wild type mice. We found, using HPLC-tandem MS, that DHA supplements to culture media of human and murine fibroblasts were readily incorporated into phospholipids and that subsequent irradiation of the supplemented cells with UVA resulted in an increase in 1-palmitoyl-2-(epoxyisoprostane-E2)-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine and Oxo-DHA esterified to phospholipid, both of which are Nrf2 agonists. Also, induction of Nrf2 target genes was enhanced in the DHA-supplemented fibroblasts after UVA irradiation. In Nrf2-deficient murine fibroblasts, the expression of the target genes was, as expected, decreased, but surprisingly, expression of TNFalpha and MMP13 was strongly induced in DHA-supplemented, UVA-irradiated cells. Also, Nrf2-deficient cells had increased levels of oxidized phospholipids relative to the unoxidized precursors after UVA irradiation. Our data suggest that under ultraviolet stress a functioning Nrf2 system is required to prevent DHA-induced inflammation and matrix degradation in dermal fibroblasts.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of unknown etiology that is thought to result from a combination of genetic, immunologic and environmental factors. The incidence of IBD has been increasing in recent decades, especially in developing and developed nations, and this is hypothesized to be in part related to the change in dietary and lifestyle factors associated with modernization. The prevalence of obesity has risen in parallel with the rise in IBD, suggesting a possible shared environmental link between these two conditions. Studies have shown that obesity impacts disease development and response to therapy in patients with IBD and other autoimmune conditions. The observation that adipose tissue produces pro-inflammatory adipokines provides a potential mechanism for the observed epidemiologic links between obesity and IBD, and this has developed into an active area of investigative inquiry. Additionally, emerging evidence highlights a role for the intestinal microbiota in the development of both obesity and IBD, representing another potential mechanistic connection between the two conditions. In this review we discuss the epidemiology of obesity and IBD, possible pathophysiologic links, and the clinical impact of obesity on IBD disease course and implications for management.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children with congenital malformations, mental retardation, and complex early medical history frequently have feeding problems. Although tube feeding is effective in providing the necessary energy and nutrients, it decreases the child's motivation to eat and may lead to oral aversion. In this study, we sought to confirm our previous results, showing that a multidisciplinary clinical hunger provocation program may lead to quick resumption of oral feeding. METHODS: In a crossover study, 22 children of 9 to 24 months of age who were fully dependent on tube feeding were randomly assigned to one of two groups: group A, intervention group (2-week multidisciplinary clinical hunger provocation program); and group B, control group (4-week outpatient treatment by the same multidisciplinary team). Patients failing one treatment were reassigned to the other treatment group. Primary outcome measures were at least 75% orally fed at the conclusion of the intervention and fully orally fed and gaining weight 6 months after the intervention. RESULTS: In group A, 9/11 patients were successfully weaned from tube feeding (2 failures: 1 developed ulcerative colitis, 1 drop-out). In group B, only 1 patient was weaned successfully; 10/11 were reassigned to the clinical hunger provocation program, all being weaned successfully. Six months after the intervention, 1 patient had to resume tube feeding. In total, in the control group, 1/11 (9%) was weaned successfully as compared with 18/21 (86%) in the hunger provocation group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary clinical hunger provocation is an effective short-term intervention for weaning young children from tube feeding.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Diet assessment is essential in the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to study food intake in children with IBD and evaluated the relation of dietary intake with disease activity and nutritional status in these children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study investigated 68 children and adolescents with IBD (57 Crohn disease, 11 ulcerative colitis). Evaluation included clinical, laboratory, and nutritional assessment including 3 days diet record. RESULTS: Compared with recommended daily allowance, the intake of patients with IBD was significantly poor for carbohydrates (75%, P = 0.016), calcium (49%, P < 0.05), magnesium (76%, P < 0.05), vitamin A (72%, P < 0.05), vitamin E (57%, P < 0.05), and fiber (44%, P < 0.05) and higher for protein (175%, P < 0.05), iron (112%, P < 0.05), and water-soluble vitamins (118%-189% P < 0.05). Compared with the intakes of healthy children from National Nutritional Survey, the intake of IBD group was lower for calories (78%, P = 0.012), carbohydrates (61% P < 0.05), magnesium (67% P < 0.05), vitamin C (34%, P < 0.05), and fiber (54%, P < 0.05) and high for B12 (141%, P < 0.05). Fifty subjects ate ordinary diets, 7 of 68 children were on exclusive enteral nutrition and 11 of 68 consumed regular food with different polymeric formulas supplements. Compared with children without supplements, children on exclusive enteral nutrition and nutritional supplements (18/68) had significantly better intakes of energy (1870 +/- 755 vs 2267 +/- 432, P < 0.05), carbohydrates (223 +/- 97 vs 292 +/- 99, P < 0.05), and all minerals (P < 0.05) and micronutrients (P < 0.05). Dietary intake was not different by disease status (remission or relapse). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of nutritional supplements, food intake is inadequate for many nutrients in many children with IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The interaction between a disturbed microbial composition, the intestinal mucosal barrier and the mucosal immune system plays an important role in IBD and its chronicity. It has been indicated that due to the altered microbial composition the balance between T regulatory cells (Treg) and T helper cells (Th) 17 is disturbed, leading to an inflammatory state. The present study shows that oral intake of a specific multi fibre mix (MF), designed to match the fibre content of a healthy diet, counteracts IBD-like intestinal inflammation and weight loss in dextran sodium sulphate treated mice. This reduction in inflammation might be brought about, at least in part, by the MF-induced decrease in inflammatory cytokines, increase in IL-10 and the relative increase in Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Moreover, the Treg percentage in the MLN correlates with the percentage of tolerogenic lamina propria derived CD103+RALDH+dendritic cells in the MLN, suggesting that these play a role in the observed effects. In children with CD exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a widely used safe and effective therapy. Optimizing enteral nutritional concepts with the tested fibre mix, know to modulate the gut microbiota composition, SCFA production and inflammatory status (as indicated by the present study) could possibly further improve efficacy in inducing remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet and body composition play unclear roles in the pathogenesis, activity and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Evidence-based guidance regarding dietary modification in IBD is lacking. We aimed to determine the attitudes of IBD patients and clinicians to diet. METHODS: The present cross-sectional study comprised an online questionnaire distributed to members of a national IBD patient organisation, assessing demographics, anthropometry, disease phenotype and dietary beliefs. Dietitians, gastroenterologists and surgeons were targeted for a similar questionnaire as a result of membership of national professional bodies. RESULTS: Nine hundred and twenty-eight patients (72.2% female; mean age 39.5 years; age range 5-91 years) responded. Two-thirds of the patients had Crohn's disease. The mean reported body mass index was 24.9 kg m-2 and was significantly skewed to the right. Patients who had taken >10 courses of steroids were had a greater probability of being overweight or obese, independent of disease complications. Most patients (71%) assumed that their diet affected their IBD; 61% considered their IBD specialist disregarded the importance of diet. Of the 136 clinicians who responded, the majority felt that diet was a factor in symptoms and intestinal microbiota. More gastroenterologists (44%) than dietitians (17%) considered that diet had a role in the pathogenesis of IBD (P = 0.003). Twenty-six percent of patients reported receiving dietary advice from their IBD specialist, whereas 98% of gastroenterologists reported advice provision. Patients received diverse advice. Half of the patients followed recommendations provided by a clinician. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that IBD patients consider diet to be important in their disease. IBD clinicians from different disciplines have diverse views of the role of diet. Advice given to patients is heterogeneous, often perceived as inadequate and poorly followed.},

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of IBD patients with an established diagnosis of IBD longer than 3 mo prior to enrollment. The Crohn's and colitis knowledge score (CCKNOW) and short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) were self-administered to assess patient knowledge of IBD and HRQoL, respectively. Demographic and disease characteristics were abstracted from the electronic medical record. The correlation between CCKNOW and SIBDQ scores was assessed by a linear regression model. Associations of patient knowledge and the variables of interest were calculated using ANOVA. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were recruited. Caucasian race, younger age at diagnosis, and having a college or post-graduate degree were significantly associated with higher CCKNOW scores. Patients with CD had higher CCKNOW scores compared to patients with ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease type unclassified, P < 0.01. There was no significant correlation between overall CCKNOW and SIBDQ scores (r (2) = 0.34, P = 0.13). The knowledge sub-domain of diet in CCKNOW was negatively correlated with HRQoL (r (2) = 0.69, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: IBD diagnosis at a younger age in addition to Caucasian race and higher education were significantly associated with higher knowledge about IBD. However, patient knowledge of IBD was not correlated with HRQoL. Further studies are required to study the effect of patient knowledge of IBD on other clinical outcomes.},

Rats were fed a control diet or diets containing 10% RS, 0.5% GTE or a combination of the two (RS + GTE). CAC was initiated with 2 weekly azoxymethane (AOM) injections (10mg/kg) followed by 2% dextran sodium sulphate in drinking water for 7 days after 2 weeks on diets. Rats were killed 20 weeks after the first AOM. Colon tissues and tumours were examined for histopathology by H&E, gene/protein expression by PCR and immunohistochemistry and digesta for analyses of fermentation products and microbiota populations. RS and RS + GTE (but not GTE) diets significantly (P< 0.05) decreased tumour multiplicity and adenocarcinoma formation, relative to the control diet. Effects of RS + GTE were not different from RS alone. RS diet caused significant shifts in microbial composition/diversity, with increases in Parabacteroides, Barnesiella, Ruminococcus, Marvinbryantia and Bifidobacterium as primary contributors to the shift. RS-containing diets increased short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and expression of the SCFA receptor GPR43 mRNA, and reduced inflammation (COX-2, NF-kB, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA) and cell proliferation P< 0.05. GTE had no effect. This is the first study that demonstrates chemopreventive effects of RS (but not GTE) in a rodent CAC model, suggesting RS might have benefit to patients with ulcerative colitis who are at an increased risk of developing CRC.},

   abstract = {AIM: To explore the preventive and therapeutic effects of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) supernatant on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis in mice. METHODS: Forty C57BL/6J male mice were randomly divided into four groups: control group, model group, treatment group, and prevention group. Mice were weighed daily. On day 10, the colon length was measured, the colorectal histopathologic damage score (HDS) was assessed, and plasma interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-6, and IL-4 levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of transcription factor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-gammat (RORgammat) and IL-17A in colon inflammatory mucosa tissue were determined by immunohistochemical assay, and the expression levels of RORgammat mRNA, IL-17A mRNA, and IL-6 mRNA were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The proportion of Th17 in mononuclear cells in spleen was assayed by fluorescence activated cell sorter. RESULTS: When compared with the model group, the colon length (P < 0.05) and body weight (P < 0.01) in the treatment and prevention groups were significantly increased, and the colon HDS was decreased (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). There was no statistical difference between the treatment group and prevention group. After treatment with F. prausnitzii supernatant, the plasma levels of IL-17A and IL-6 (P < 0.05), the protein and mRNA expression of IL-17A and RORgammat, and the Th17 cell ratio of spleen cells (P < 0.01) were significantly decreased compared to the model group. Plasma IL-4 level in the prevention group was significantly higher than that in the model group (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between these two groups in the expression of IL-6 in both the plasma and colon mucosa tissues. CONCLUSION: F. prausnitzii supernatant exerts protective and therapeutic effects on DSS-induced colitis in mice, probably via inhibition of Th17 differentiation and IL-17A secretion in the plasma and colon mucosa tissues. It can also improve colitis in mice by downregulating IL-6 and prevent colitis by upregulating IL-4.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In ulcerative colitis (UC), dietary supplements may have anti-inflammatory properties and improve disease course. We investigated the effects of casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP), a fraction of bovine whey protein, in active UC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized open-label intervention study, 24 patients with active UC involving 10-40 cm of the distal colon were randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio into two groups. The first group was administered their usual treatment plus a daily supplement of CGMP 30 g, and the second group was administered a dose escalation to 4800 mg oral mesalamine daily (standard treatment) for 4 weeks. Clinical, endoscopic, mucosal and circulating disease activity markers were monitored. Acceptance of and adherence to CGMP up to 8 weeks were documented. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of treatment, 10 of 16 (63%) patients who received CGMP had an unchanged or decreased Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI), which was similar to the four of eight (50%) (P = 0.67) patients on the standard treatment. The number of patients in which SCCAI decreased by three or more did not differ between the two groups: nine of 16 (56%) in the CGMP group vs. four of eight (50%) in the standard treatment group (P = 0.77). Changes in disease extent and severity were similar between the two groups. CGMP was well tolerated and accepted by the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of CGMP as a nutritional therapy to standard treatment was safe and accepted by patients with active distal UC. The disease-modifying effect of CGMP was similar to that of the mesalamine dose escalation.},

   abstract = {Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), an isoprenoid compound, is an anti-ulcer drug developed in Japan. GGA protects a variety of cells and tissues against numerous stresses via induction of heat shock protein (HSP) 70, and it has recently been reported to protect mice from experimental ulcerative colitis (UC). However, it is unknown whether GGA exhibits a preventive effect on UC-associated neoplasia. In the present study, we evaluated the preventive effects of GGA on colitis-related carcinogenesis in the mouse colon. Mice were administered 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) subcutaneously three times within a week, followed by 2 cycles of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) (each cycle, 3% DSS for 7 days and then distilled water for 14 days) and they were sacrificed 28 days after the completion of the 2 cycles. The mice were divided into the following groups according to the diet received during the experiment: group A, which received a standard diet and served as a disease control; group B, which received a diet mixed with 0.25% GGA; group C, which received a diet mixed with 0.5% GGA; group D, which received a diet mixed with 1.0% GGA; group E, which received a diet mixed with 2.0% GGA; and group F, which received a diet containing no agents, including DSS and served as a normal control. The incidence of neoplasia was assessed. The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was also determined. In addition, the expression of HSP70 in the colon tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. The mean number of tumors was 16.6, 11.0, 9.4, 5.8, 5.4 and 0 in groups A-F, respectively. GGA significantly suppressed the occurrence of neoplasia in a dose-dependent manner. GGA treatment enhanced the expression of HSP70 and suppressed the oxidative damage in the background mucosa (i.e. lesion-free colon). These results suggest that GGA could be useful in the prevention of UC-associated neoplasia.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Colonic fermentation in patients with UC in remission was compared with that in matched healthy subjects on habitual diets and when dietary fibre was increased. DESIGN: Fibre intake, faecal output of fibre (measured as non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)), starch, microbiota and fermentation products, and whole gut transit time (WGTT) were assessed in association with habitual diet and when dietary intake of wheat bran (WB)-associated fibre and high amylose-associated resistant starch (RS) was increased in an 8-week, randomised, single-blind, cross-over study. RESULTS: Despite a tendency to lower habitual fibre intake in UC patients, faecal NSP and starch concentrations were threefold higher than in controls, whereas concentrations of phenols and short-chain fatty acids, pH and WGTT were similar. Increasing RS/WB intake was well tolerated. In controls (n=10), it more than doubled faecal NSP and starch excretion (p=0.002 for both), had no effect on NSP usage and reduced WGTT (p=0.024). In UC patients (n=19), high intake of RS/WB tended to normalise gut transit, but did not increase the proportion of NSP fermented. Increasing intake of RS/WB had little effect on faecal fermentation patterns or the structure of the microbiota. However, faeces from the UC cohort had lower proportions of Akkermansia muciniphila and increased diversity within Clostridium cluster XIVa compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Gut fermentation of NSP and starch is diminished in patients with UC. This cannot be explained by abnormal gut transit and was not corrected by increasing RS/WB intake, and may be due to abnormal functioning of the gut microbiota.

   abstract = {AIM: The aim was to study the feasibility of the laparoscopic approach in the management of ulcerative colitis, to assess the functional results at 1-year and to review of literature on the topic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients presenting for surgical management of histopathologically proven ulcerative colitis during the study period were included in the study. All patients presenting in a non-emergency setting were offered a two-stage procedure (Group A). The first-stage consisted of laparoscopic total proctocolectomy (TPC) with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) with a diverting split end ileostomy. Ileostomy was closed in the second stage. For patients presenting in acute setting (Group B), the first-stage consisted of laparoscopic TPC with end ileostomy followed by IPAA with diverting split end ileostomy in the second-stage and finally ileostomy closure in the third-stage. The technique is described. RESULTS: A total of 31 cases underwent laparoscopic TPC-IPAA, of which 28 belonged to Group A and 3 were included in Group B. All surgeries were successfully completed laparoscopically without need for conversion. The average operating time was 375 min in Group A (range: 270-500 min) and 390 min in Group B (range: 250-480 min). Oral diet was resumed at a mean of 3.4 days (range: 1.5-6 days) and the mean hospital stay was 8.2 days (range: 4-26 days). Overall morbidity rate was 16.2%; re-operation rate was 9.7% while mortality was nil. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic TPC-IPAA is feasible in acute as well as non-acute setting in patients needing surgical management of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology. It has been proposed that modifying the bacterial flora in intestine with probiotics may decrease the inflammatory process and prevent relapses in UC. We investigated the possible protective and therapeutic effects of a single strand of probiotic, Bifidobacterium infantis (BI), on colonic inflammation, in rats with regular feedings. Two groups of Lewis rats were prepared (n = 8). The first group was the control, sham-fed group (n = 4). The other group was the experimental BI-fed group (n = 4). Colitis was induced in both groups by intrarectal administration of TNBS under light anesthesia. The sham-fed colitis induced groups received a daily oral gavage feeding of 1.0 mL distilled water, whereas the B. infantis-fed group received 0.205 g of B. infantis dissolved in 1.0 mL distilled water daily. The change in body weight and food and water intake was recorded over the course of each study and analyzed. The rats were euthanized and tissues from the descending colon were harvested and analyzed microscopically and histologically. Results of our study indicated significant reduction in inflammation, mucosal damage, and preservation of goblet cells, as compared to the control animals. Modulation of gastrointestinal (GI) flora suggests a promising field in developing strategies for prevention and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases by dietary modifications.},

   abstract = {Goji berry (Lycium barbarum) exerts immune modulation and suppresses inflammation in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesized that Goji berry had beneficial effects on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice through suppressing inflammation. Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were supplemented with a standard AIN-93G diet with or without 1% (w/w) Goji berry for 4 weeks. Then, colitis was induced by supplementing 3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days, followed by 7 days of remission period to mimic ulcerative colitis symptoms. Goji berry supplementation ameliorated DSS-induced body weight loss, diminished diarrhea and gross bleeding, and resulted in a significantly decreased disease activity index, as well as DSS-associated colon shortening. Moreover, 30% mortality rate caused by DSS-induced colitis was avoided because of Goji berry supplementation. Histologically, Goji berry ameliorated colonic edema, mucosal damage and neutrophil infiltration into colonic intestinal tissue in response to DSS challenge, which was associated with decreased expression of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, as well as inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 and cyclooxygenase-2. In conclusion, Goji supplementation confers protective effects against DSS-induced colitis, which is associated with decreased neutrophil infiltration and suppressed inflammation. Thus, dietary Goji is likely beneficial to inflammatory bowel disease patients as a complementary therapeutic strategy.},

A healthy gut environment is regulated by the exquisite balance of intestinal microbiota, metabolites, and the host's immune system. Imbalance of these factors in genetically susceptible persons may promote a disease state. Manipulation of the intestinal microbiota with prebiotics, which can selectively stimulate growth of beneficial bacteria, might help to maintain a healthy intestinal environment or improve diseased one. In this review, analytical methods for identification of intestinal bacteria and an update on the correlation of the intestinal microbiota with human health and disease were discussed by introducing our recent studies to determine the prebiotic effects of a fiber-rich food in animal model and on healthy people and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC).},

   abstract = {Oral cancer is historically linked to well-known behavioural risk factors such as tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. Other risk factors include age over 40, male sex, several dietary factors, nutritional deficiencies, viruses, sexually transmitted infections, human papillomavirus, chronic irritation, and possibly genetic predisposition. Precancerous lesions in the oral cavity include leukoplakia, erythroplakia, and lichen planus. Histology of oral cancer varies widely but the great majority are squamous cell carcinomas.Epidemiological studies and cancer registries have shown a consistently increased risk of oral malignancies in kidney, bone marrow, heart, or liver transplantation, in graft vs host disease, and in patients with HIV infection. Because of the increasing use of immunosuppressive drugs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, it is useful to more accurately delineate the consequences of chronic immunosuppression to the oral cavity. Oral cancer and precancerous oral lesions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] have been scarcely reported and reviews on the topic are lacking.We conducted a literature search using the terms and variants of all cancerous and precancerous oral manifestations of inflammatory bowel diseases. By retrieving the existing literature, it is evident that patients with IBD belong to the high-risk group of developing these lesions, a phenomenon amplified by the increasing HPV prevalence. Education on modifiable risk behaviours in patients with oral cancer is the cornerstone of prevention.Oral screening should be performed for all IBD patients, especially those who are about to start an immunosuppressant or biological drug.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent animal studies have identified that dietary salt intake may modify the risk and progression of autoimmune disorders through modulation of the IL-23/TH17 pathway, which is critical in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of U.S. women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHSII who provided detailed and validated information on diet and lifestyle beginning in 1984 in NHS and 1991 in NHSII. We confirmed incident cases of UC and CD reported through 2010 in NHS and 2011 in NHSII. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. In a case-control study nested within these cohorts, we evaluated the interaction between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in TH17 pathway and dietary potassium on risk of CD and UC. In a cohort of healthy volunteers, we also assessed the effect of supplemental potassium on development of naive and memory T cells, differentiated with TGFbeta1 or TH17 conditions. RESULTS: Among a total of 194,711 women over a follow-up of 3,220,247 person-years, we documented 273 cases of CD and 335 cases of UC. Dietary intake of potassium (Ptrend = 0.005) but not sodium (Ptrend = 0.44) was inversely associated with risk of CD. Although, both dietary potassium and sodium were not significantly associated with risk of UC, there was a suggestion of an inverse association with dietary potassium (Ptrend = 0.08). The association of potassium with risk of CD and UC appeared to be modified by loci involved in the TH17 pathway that have previously been associated with susceptibility to CD, particularly SNP rs7657746 (IL21) (Pinteraction = 0.004 and 0.01, respectively). In vitro, potassium enhanced the expression of Foxp3 in both naive and memory CD4+ T cells via activating Smad2/3 and inhibiting Smad7 in TH17 cells. CONCLUSION: Dietary potassium is inversely associated with risk of CD with both in vitro and gene-environment interaction data suggesting a potential role for potassium in regulating immune tolerance through its effect on Tregs and TH17 pathway.},

She had a relatively benign course over the subsequent 12 years. In 2009, she had increased left-sided abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea and progressive weight loss, due to a severe exacerbation. In spite of a variety of standard treatments, her condition continued to decline with a significant impact on normal life and functioning. In December of 2010, repeat colonoscopy and microscopy confirmed pancolitis, without diverticulitis. The Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) was initiated due to failure of conventional therapies. Following this highly restricted diet, within a period of 3-6 months, improvement was noted, and within a year, no abdominal pain or diarrhea were present, and she returned to her baseline functioning and career. Two years later, repeat colonoscopy showed resolution of the pancolitis, confirmed with microscopic evaluation. Successful use of the SCD in children with UC has been documented. We describe previously unreported, highly beneficial results with both symptomatic and clinical improvement and complete remission of UC in an adult female with the SCD.},

   abstract = {Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due to the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can reach 30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of many bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pyloriinfection, and colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from the Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with a potential use in the prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal tract disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely important studies regarding the possibility of using probiotics to promote a balanced microbiota composition, and a sufficient immunological surveillance system as a way to prevent cancer. Considering the fact that the human intestines host 100 trillion bacteria, including more than 1,000 species, there is still need to perform more in depth investigations in order to find probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat cancerous diseases, adding a very promising effect to this already successful panorama. This revision aims to conduct a review of the most recent studies correlating probiotics and its cancer preventing and treatment potential.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies outside the United States have described a lower prevalence of diverticulosis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) than in patients without IBD. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of diverticulosis and associated risk factors in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) at a U.S. tertiary care center. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients over 50 years of age who underwent screening or surveillance colonoscopy from January 2006 to December 2013. We first assessed the prevalence of diverticulosis in patients with UC compared with patients without IBD. Then, we performed a nested case-control study comparing UC patients with diverticulosis (cases) with UC patients without diverticulosis (controls). RESULTS: We identified 544 patients with UC and 16,705 patients without IBD who underwent colonoscopy. On univariate analysis, 23.5% of patients with UC had diverticulosis, and 46.7% of patients without IBD had diverticulosis, P < 0.01 and relative risk = 0.50 (95% CI, 0.43-0.58). Multivariate analysis adjusting for age and gender found a relative risk of diverticulosis in UC = 1.02 (95% CI, 1.02-1.03). In the nested case-control study, there were no differences between UC cases and UC controls in disease duration (16.7 versus 18.7 yr; P = 0.27), extent of disease (pancolitis 50% versus 60.1%; P = 0.24), obesity (34.5% versus 29.2%; P = 0.40), or ethnicity (86.3% white versus 79.8%; P = 0.20). There was a trend toward history of smoking in patients with UC and diverticulosis (49.5% versus 35.5%; P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: In this U.S.-based study, patients with UC had a slightly increased of diverticulosis compared with patients without IBD undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy. There were no identified predictors for diverticular disease in patients with UC, but there was a trend toward previous smoking status and development of diverticulosis. These results are different than previously reported data in patients with IBD in other countries and may represent unique dietary differences that contribute to the development of diverticulosis.},

A cross-sectional postal questionnaire was sent to people with IBD who were booked into an adult IBD or Gastroenterology clinic over a 6-week period. There were 416 eligible people and 168 (40%) responded. Sixty-four (42%) people indicated that food affects their symptoms a lot or severely. Eighty (51%) respondents indicated that diet was important or extremely important in controlling symptoms. Significantly more people with CD reported meat, fatty foods, chocolate and salad as a trigger than people with UC. Significantly more people with UC reported wheat as a trigger. More people with CD avoided meat and chocolate than UC. This survey highlights the importance of nutrition and diet to people with IBD. Frequent food avoidance was reported.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation with respect to dosage and patient compliance. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 167 Crohn disease/ulcerative colitis outpatients. Patients were screened for serum vitamin D (25OHD2+3) at the end of summer and in late winter. Demographic data, history of vitamin D supplementation were recorded and matched with prescription records. RESULTS: A total of 57 subjects used vitamin D supplementation (mean dose 1104 IU/day). 25OHD2+3 levels were lower (p < 0.001) in winter both in substituted and unsubstituted group, without any differences between groups within the same season. 25OHD2+3 levels did not correlate with the substitution dose. 52.1 % of subjects were fully compliant with substitution. 25OHD2+3 and prevalence of vitamin D deficit in this group were comparable with unsubstituted subjects except a higher prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (p < 0.02). CONCLUSION: Fixed dosage of 1100 IU/day of vitamin D was insufficient to correct the deficiency. Patient compliance with vitamin D supplementation was low, however this fact did not significantly contribute to the degree of vitamin D deficiency in this dosage (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 21).},

Recent findings highlight anti-inflammatory and anti-septic potentials of catechin-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (CGP) isolated from PHCR seeds. We investigated the intestinal anti-inflammatory activity and associated mechanisms of CGP using a rat model of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Oral treatment with CGP (10mg/kg body weight) suppressed body weight loss and intestinal inflammatory damages in TNBS-induced colitic rats. This treatment reduced myeloperoxidase activity and malondialdehyde level, but increased glutathione level in the TNBS colitic rats. CGP treatment also inhibited the TNBS-mediated increases in nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 proteins or mRNA levels. This inhibition was accompanied by the increased mRNA levels of mucins MUC2 and MUC3. The CGP treatment prevented phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, IkappaB-alpha, and DNA-nuclear factor-kappaB binding, all of which were increased in the inflamed colons of TNBS-treated rats. Furthermore, oral administration with a crude PHCR butanol extract (100mg/kg body weight) which contains 1.5% of CGP showed intestinal anti-inflammatory potentials similar to that of CGP. Collectively, our current findings suggest that CGP or CGP-containing PHCR seeds may have favorable effects on intestinal inflammatory diseases.},

One of the questions often raised is vitamin D deficiency. Calcitriol acts on cells, tissues and organs through a vitamin D receptor. The result of this action is the multi-directional effect of vitamin D. The reasons for vitamin D deficiency are: decreased exposure to sunlight, inadequate diet, inflammatory lesions of the intestinal mucosa and post-gastrointestinal resection states. This leads not only to osteomalacia but also to osteoporosis. Of significance may be the effect of vitamin D on the course of the disease itself, through modulation of the inflammatory mechanisms. It is also necessary to pay attention to the role of vitamin D in skeletal pathology in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and thus take measures aimed at preventing and treating these disorders through the supplementation of vitamin D.},

   abstract = {Dietary intake of the micronutrient selenium is essential for normal immune functions. Selenium is cotranslationally incorporated as the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine, into selenoproteins that function to modulate pathways involved in inflammation. Epidemiological studies have suggested an inverse association between selenium levels and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis that can potentially progress to colon cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we summarize the current literature on the pathophysiology of IBD, which is multifactorial in origin with unknown etiology. We have focused on a few selenoproteins that mediate gastrointestinal inflammation and activate the host immune response, wherein macrophages play a pivotal role. Changes in cellular oxidative state coupled with altered expression of selenoproteins in macrophages drive the switch from a proinflammatory phenotype to an anti-inflammatory phenotype to efficiently resolve inflammation in the gut and restore epithelial barrier integrity. Such a phenotypic plasticity is accompanied by changes in cytokines, chemokines, and bioactive metabolites, including eicosanoids that not only mitigate inflammation but also partake in restoring gut homeostasis through diverse pathways involving differential regulation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappaB and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. The role of the intestinal microbiome in modulating inflammation and aiding in selenium-dependent resolution of gut injury is highlighted to provide novel insights into the beneficial effects of selenium in IBD.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to investigate the relationship between TMAO and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and its clinical characteristics. METHODS: Serum TMAO was measured in 305 PSC patients, 90 ulcerative colitis patients and 99 healthy controls. RESULTS: In PSC patients with normal liver function (n = 197), TMAO was higher in patients reaching liver transplantation or death during follow-up than those who did not, with an optimal TMAO cut-off of 4.1 microM (AUC = 0.64, p < 0.001). PSC patients with high TMAO (>4.1 microM, n = 77) exhibited shorter transplantation-free survival than patients with low TMAO (n = 120, log-rank test: p < 0.0001). High TMAO (>4.1 microM) was associated with reduced transplantation-free survival (HR 1.87, p = 0.011), independently of the Mayo risk score (HR 1.74, p < 0.001). Overall, PSC patients demonstrated reduced TMAO values compared with ulcerative colitis and healthy controls, mainly caused by PSC patients with reduced liver function (INR > 1.2), suggesting impaired oxidation of trimethylamine to TMAO. PSC patients with and without inflammatory bowel disease had similar TMAO levels. CONCLUSION: In PSC patients with normal liver function, elevated TMAO was associated with shorter transplantation-free survival, potentially reflecting clinically relevant metabolic changes resulting from dietary interactions with the gut microbiota.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinicopathologic features of adult-onset autoimmune enteropathy (AIE). METHODS: A case of adult-onset AIE was described along with a literature review. RESULTS: A 41-year-old male patient was admitted for intractable diarrhea for more than three months despite of any dietary restriction or anti-inflammatory therapy. Fat globule was observed by stool examination and Sudan III staining of the stool was positive. Enteroclysis showed weak movement and few plica of small intestine, while colonoscopy appeared normal. Small bowel biopsies revealed villus atrophy and increased crypt apoptotic bodies and lymphocytic infiltration in deep crypt. Although without significant surface intro-epithelial lymphocytosis, there were a large number of monocytes, lymphocytes, plasmacytes and neutrophilic granulocytes infiltrating in the lamina propria. Morphologically, the colonic mucous was similar to the small intestine although cryptitis and crypt abscess were significant in the former. Serum IgG anti-goblet cell antibody was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. Other causes of diarrhea were excluded on the base of medical history, histopathology and other accessory examinations before the diagnosis of AIE was made. The patient had a complete remission after steroid treatment without recurrence for eight months during the follow-up even after steroid withdrawal for five months. CONCLUSIONS: AIE is exceedingly rare and timely diagnosis is important for successful therapy. Histological differential diagnoses should include ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, lymphocytic colitis, etc. The final diagnosis should be based on histological examination combined with the patient history, clinical manifestation, endoscopy finding and serological testing.},

METHODS: A computerized search of databases [Cochrane Library, Pubmed/Medline, PsychINFO, and Scopus] through March 2014 was performed. We screened the reference sections of original studies and systematic reviews in English language for CAM in IBD, CD and UC. Randomized controlled trials [RCT] and controlled trials [CT] were referred and assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: A total of: 26 RCT and 3 CT for herbal medicine, eg aloe-vera gel, andrographis paniculata, artemisia absinthium, barley foodstuff, boswellia serrata, cannabis, curcumin, evening primrose oil, Myrrhinil intest(R), plantago ovata, silymarin, sophora, tormentil, wheatgrass-juice and wormwood; 1 RCT for trichuris suis ovata; 7 RCT for mind/body interventions such as lifestyle modification, hypnotherapy, relaxation training and mindfulness; and 2 RCT in acupuncture; were found. Risk of bias was quite heterogeneous. Best evidence was found for herbal therapy, ie plantago ovata and curcumin in UC maintenance therapy, wormwood in CD, mind/body therapy and self-intervention in UC, and acupuncture in UC and CD. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary and alternative therapies might be effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases; however, given the low number of trials and the heterogeneous methodological quality of trials, further in-depth research is necessary.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon with unclear pathogenesis. A dysbiotic intestinal microbiota is regarded as a key component in the disease process and there has been significant interest in developing new treatments which target the microbiota. AIM: To give an overview of the studies to date investigating prebiotics and synbiotics for the treatment of UC. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed and related search engines was carried out using the terms "ulcerative colitis" in combination with "prebiotic", "synbiotic" or "dietary fibre". RESULTS: In total 17 studies on humans examining the effect of prebiotics in UC were found. Five major groups could be distinguished. Fructo-oligosaccharides were tried in six studies (mean 35 patients included, range 9-121). One study found a clinical response while two demonstrated indirect evidence of an effect. Germinated barley foodstuff was used in 8 studies (mean 38 patients, range 10-63). One study found an endoscopic response, while four noted a clinical response and two some indirect effects. Galacto-oligosaccharides, lactulose and resveratrol were used in one study each (mean 48 patients, range 41-52). One study found an endoscopic response and one a clinical response. CONCLUSION: There is yet inadequate evidence - especially in humans - to support any particular prebiotic in the clinical management of UC. However, due to the bulk of evidence supporting the effect of the microbiota on colonic inflammation, there is enough potential to justify further high-quality clinical trials investigating this subject.},

   abstract = {Some of the most common symptoms of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, which include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. It is therefore not surprising that clinicians and patients have wondered whether dietary patterns influence the onset or course of IBD. The question of what to eat is among the most commonly asked by patients, and among the most difficult to answer for clinicians. There are substantial variations in dietary behaviors of patients and recommendations for them, although clinicians do not routinely endorse specific diets for patients with IBD. Dietary clinical trials have been limited by their inability to include a placebo control, contamination of study groups, and inclusion of patients receiving medical therapies. Additional challenges include accuracy of information on dietary intake, complex interactions between foods consumed, and differences in food metabolism among individuals. We review the roles of diet in the etiology and management of IBD based on plausible mechanisms and clinical evidence. Researchers have learned much about the effects of diet on the mucosal immune system, epithelial function, and the intestinal microbiome; these findings could have significant practical implications. Controlled studies of patients receiving enteral nutrition and observations made from patients on exclusion diets have shown that components of whole foods can have deleterious effects for patients with IBD. Additionally, studies in animal models suggested that certain nutrients can reduce intestinal inflammation. In the future, engineered diets that restrict deleterious components but supplement beneficial nutrients could be used to modify the luminal intestinal environment of patients with IBD; these might be used alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents, or as salvage therapy for patients who do not respond or lose responsiveness to medical therapies. Stricter diets might be required to induce remission, and more sustainable exclusion diets could be used to maintain long-term remission.},

   abstract = {Idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are multifactorial diseases that are manifested after disruption of a genetic predisposed individual and its intestinal microflora through an environmental stimulus. Urbanization and industrialization are associated with IBD. Epidemiological data, clinical observations and family/immigrants studies indicate the significance of environmental influence in the development of IBD. Some environmental factors have a different effect on the subtypes of IBD. Smoking and appendectomy is negatively associated with UC, but they are aggravating factors for CD. A westernized high fat diet, full of refined carbohydrates is strongly associated with the development of IBD, contrary to a high in fruit, vegetables and polyunsaturated fatty acid-3 diet that is protective against these diseases. High intake of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug and oral contraceptive pills as well as the inadequacy of vitamin D leads to an increased risk for IBD and a more malignant course of disease. Moreover, other factors such as air pollution, psychological factors, sleep disturbances and exercise influence the development and the course of IBD. Epigenetic mechanism like DNA methylation, histone modification and altered expression of miRNAS could explain the connection between genes and environmental factors in triggering the development of IBD.},

   abstract = {To date, associations between consumption of vegetables and fruit and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease have been a controversial subject. Therefore, we carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the associations. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure to identify all relevant studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from random-effects or fixed-effects models were calculated. Publication bias was estimated using Egger's test and the funnel plot. A total of 14 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. On the basis of the highest versus the lowest analysis, consumption of vegetables was associated inversely with the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) (OR=0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.88, n=9 studies), but not with Crohn's disease (CD) (OR=0.66, 95% CI 0.40-1.09, n=8 studies). Higher consumption of fruit was associated inversely with the risk of UC (OR=0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.96, n=8 studies) and CD (OR=0.57, 95% CI 0.44-0.74, n=10 studies). For intake of vegetables and the risk of CD, subgroup analysis showed a significant association for studies carried out in Europe (OR=0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.57), but not in Asia (OR=1.00, 95% CI 0.50-2.03). No significant publication bias was found for the analysis of intake of vegetables and the risk of UC, intake of fruit and the risk of UC, and intake of vegetables and the risk of CD. This meta-analysis indicates that consumption of vegetables and fruit might be associated inversely with the risk of UC and CD, and the results need to be further confirmed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An epidemiological association implicating diet in IBD risk or protection is widely accepted. Patients with IBD often make links to diet, but there is a dearth of literature exploring dietary perceptions and practices in this population. Our objective was to evaluate dietary beliefs and behaviors in IBD patients. METHODS: We developed a questionnaire assessing demographics, dietary beliefs and habits in IBD patients. This was prospectively administered to 400 consecutive patients attending our IBD clinics. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 48.4 years; 55% were female, 88% white, 39% had Crohn's disease and 51% had ulcerative colitis. Around 48% felt that diet could be the initiating factor in IBD and 57% felt it could trigger a flare. Worsening symptoms with certain foods was reported by 60%. About 66% deprived themselves of their favorite foods in order to prevent relapse. Three-fourth of patients believed that IBD affects appetite, more so during a relapse. Nearly half had never received any formal dietary advice, and two-thirds requested for further dietary advice. After adjusting for other predictors, the IBD subtype and ethnicity of the patients remained as significant factors for influencing beliefs held by patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that patients hold beliefs pertaining to the role of diet in IBD, with a high level of consistency around key perceived triggers. Whether all the symptoms reported are due to active inflammation cannot be ascertained, but the potential exists for dietary components triggering active disease and perpetuating gut injury, impacting on quality of life and health care costs.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is a major inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), characterized by inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract through chronic or relapsing immune system activation. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential protective effect of oat beta-glucan (betaG) against colitis induced by DSS in mice. Eighty mice were randomly divided into the control group (no DSS, no betaG), DSS group (DSS only), DSS + L-betaG group (DSS plus 500 mg per kg betaG), and DSS + H-betaG group (DSS plus 1000 mg per kg betaG). Compared with the DSS group, administration of betaG significantly reduced clinical symptoms with less weight loss, diarrhea and shortening of the colon, the severity of colitis was significantly inhibited as evidenced by the reduced disease activity index (DAI) and degree of histological damage in colon. Moreover, treatment with betaG not only decreased myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), and nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, but also inhibited mRNA and protein expression of pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and iNOS. This suggests that oat betaG in diet might exhibit an anti-inflammatory function against colitis through inhibition of expression of pro-inflammatory factors.},

   abstract = {Several epidemiological investigations have been conducted to evaluate the relationship between dietary fiber intake and inflammatory bowel diseases, but the results are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively summarize the evidence from observational studies. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Knowledge were searched for relevant articles published up to November 2014. The combined relative risks were calculated with the fixed- or random-effects model. Dose-response relationship was assessed using restricted cubic spline model. We hypothesized that the meta-analysis could yield a summary effect, which would indicate that dietary fiber intake could decrease the risk of ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease (CD). Overall, 8 articles involving 2 cohort studies, 1 nested case-control study, and 5 case-control studies were finally included in this study. The pooled relative risks with 95% confidence intervals of ulcerative colitis and CD for the highest vs lowest categories of dietary fiber intake were 0.80 (0.64-1.00) and 0.44 (0.29-0.69), respectively. A linear dose-response relationship was found between dietary fiber and CD risk, and the risk of CD decreased by 13% (P < .05) for every 10 g/d increment in fiber intake. The results from this meta-analysis indicated that the intake of dietary fiber was significantly associated with a decreased risk of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Short-term results after ileo-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) are well established; data are conflicting in long-standing patients. We retrospectively evaluated long-term complications and functional results after follow-up longer than 20 years. METHODS: Two hundred five patients with follow-up longer than 20 years have been identified out of 1112 IPAA performed in our institution; of these, 20 cases were lost at follow-up or decline to take part at the study. We evaluated long-term complications and failure rate also according to changes in histological diagnosis. Changes in functional results and quality of life (QoL) were analyzed at 5 and 20 years after IPAA. RESULTS: Pouch failure rate was 10.8 % (35 % due to misdiagnosed Crohn). Incidences of fistulas, anastomotic stenosis, chronic pouchitis, and pre-pouch ileitis were 17.3, 12.9, 28.6, and 7.6 %, respectively. Most of the patients reported good functional outcomes. Day-time evacuations at 5 and after 20 years were 4.3 and 4.8 (p = n.s.) while during night-time were 0.8 and 1.2 (p < 0.05). Urgency was 6 and 9.4 % (p = n.s.), respectively; need of antimotility drugs was 16 and 35 % (p < 0.001). Dietary limitations and work restrictions were similar over time. Only sexuality got worse during follow-up. Satisfaction for surgery was always high and it did not change over time. CONCLUSION: IPAA is still an excellent surgical option for UC with a low rate of pouch failure even after more than 20 years. Despite a slight worsening of functional results over time, the QoL remained high and most patients expressed satisfaction with the procedure and were willing to recommend it to others.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes a spectrum of diseases from ulcerative colitis (UC) to Crohn's disease (CD). Many studies have addressed the changes in the microbiota of individuals affected by UC and CD. A decrease in biodiversity and depletion of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes has been reported, among others. Changes in microbial composition also result in changes in the metabolites generated in the gut from microbial activity that may involve the amount of butyrate and other metabolites such as H2 S being produced. Other factors such as diet, age, or medication need to be taken into consideration when studying dysbiosis associated with IBD. Diverse bacterial species have been associated specifically or non-specifically to IBD, but none of them have been demonstrated to be its ethiological agent. Recent studies also suggest that micro-eukaryotic populations may also be altered in IBD patients. Last, but not least, viruses, and specially bacteriophages, can play a role in controlling microbial populations in the gastrointestinal tract. This may affect both bacterial diversity and metabolism, but possible implications for IBD still remain to be solved. Dysbiosis in the oral microbiome associated with IBD remains an emerging field for future research.},

METHODS: Literature retrieval was conducted by using English databases (PubMed, Cochrane and Embase) and Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang, SinoMed and VIP) to collect the studies on the influencing factors of UC published both at home and abroad from January 2000 to October 2014. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, data were extracted and methodological quality was assessed. Then, a Meta-analysis was performed with Stata 12.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 24 case-control studies were included, involving 5 653 patients and 20 218 controls. The results of Meta-analysis showed that the influencing factors of UC would include family history of inflammatory bowel disease, ex-smoker, gastrointestinal infections, regular consumption of milk, fat diet, appendectomy, smoking and high educational level, with the pooled OR values as 4.68 (95%CI:3.59-6.11) , 1.81 (95%CI: 1.58-2.09) , 5.10 (95%CI: 2.38-10.92) , 2.26 (95%CI: 1.65-3.09) , 2.21 (95%CI: 1.49-3.27) , 0.40 (95%CI:0.32-0.51) , 0.44 (95%CI:0.32-0.60) and 0.50 (95%CI:0.36-0.69) , respectively. CONCLUSION: Current evidence showed that the risk factors influencing the incidence of UC were family history of inflammatory bowel disease, ex-smoker, gastrointestinal infections, regular consumption of milk and fat diet, whereas appendectomy, smoking and high educational level were protective factors for UC.},

The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of food intolerance in the UC patients in this area and to discuss some of the possible risk factors leading to the condition. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Food antibodies in serum of 80 patients with active UC were determined by standard enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). This study examined the risk factors contributing to high titers of food antibodies and the dietary patterns correlating with food intolerance in these demographics. RESULTS: 83.8% of patients (67/80) were found to be seropositive for food intolerance. Patients of female, aged between 20 to 40 and the one who tended to have a high fat diet were tested to be highly seropositive (p<0.05). Neither spicy food intake nor the course the disease manifested any relationship with the presence of food intolerance (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Active UC patients in southwestern region of China have showed to be high seropositive in food intolerance, particularly in female and young patients. Dietary patterns with high in fat intake seem to have caused high prevalence of seropositivity in food intolerance. Although rice has been taken as staple food and the spicy food has been popular among citizen in this region, these foods have indicated to no effect on food intolerance in this study.},

   abstract = {AIM: To assess knowledge acquired by adolescents about their inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was given during consultation to adolescents followed for IBD by pediatricians from 13 hospitals between 1 September 2012 and 1 July 2013. After parental consent, these physicians completed a form at the inclusion of each patient, in which the characteristics of IBD were detailed. The patients mailed back their questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 124 patients from 12 to 19 years of age were included with a response rate of 82% (all anonymous); 23% of the patients thought that diet was a possible cause of IBD and 22% that one of the targets of their treatment was to cure their disease for good. Of the patients reported having Crohn disease, 46% knew the anoperineal location and 14% knew that Crohn disease can affect the entire digestive tract. Twenty-five percent of the patients were able to name one side effect of azathioprine (88% had already received this treatment), 24% were able to name one side effect of infliximab (54% had already received this treatment), 70% of the adolescents knew that smoking worsens Crohn disease, 68% declared they had learned about their IBD from their pediatrician, and 81% said they would like to receive more information. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with IBD have gaps in their general knowledge and the different treatments of their disease. Their main source of information is their pediatrician, warranting the implementation of customized patient education sessions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Both science and patients associate diet with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. There is no doubt that links between IBD and diet are numerous, based on both epidemiological studies and experimental studies. However, scientific evidence to support dietary advice is currently lacking, and dietary counselling for IBD patients is often limited in clinical practice to the improvement of nutrient intake. This review aimed to focus on both patient's beliefs about and molecular mechanisms for crosstalk between nutrients and inflammation. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed was performed to identify relevant studies on diet and/or nutrients and their role in IBD. Pubmed [from inception to January 20, 2016] was searched using the terms: 'Crohn', 'colitis',' intestinal epithelial cells', and a list of terms relating to diet or numerous specific nutrients. Terms associated with nutrients were individually tested in the context of IBD. Reference lists from studies selected were manually searched to identify further relevant reports. Manuscripts about diet in the context of IBD from basic science, epidemiological studies, or clinical trials were selected and reviewed. Only articles published in English were included. RESULTS: Epidemiological studies highlight the key role of diet in IBD development, and many IBD patients report diet as a triggering factor in relapse of disease. In addition, we present research on the impact of nutrients on innate immunity. CONCLUSION: Diet may offer an alternative approach to restoring deficient innate immunity in IBD, and this may be the scientific rationale for providing dietary counselling for IBD patients.},

Inflammatory mediators and the possible role of canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathways in the beneficial effects of API under chronic inflammatory conditions were also explored. Six-week-old mice were randomized in four dietary groups: sham and control groups received standard diet (SD), and other two groups were fed with API at 0.1%. After 30days, all groups except sham received 3% DSS in drinking water for 5days followed by a regime of 21days of water. Our results revealed that dietary API supplementation decreased the macroscopic and microscopic damage signs of colitis; also, it was capable to down-regulate mPGES, COX-2 and iNOS enzyme colonic expressions and to decrease serum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-3) levels. Similarly, API diet reduced IL-1beta and TNF-alpha proinflammatory cytokine secretions in primary LPS-stimulated splenocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that API anti-inflammatory activity was related with an inhibition of both canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathways by decreasing proinflammatory IL-1beta and IL-18 cytokine levels as a consequence of regulation of cleaved caspase-1 and caspase-11 enzymes. We conclude that API supplement might provide a basis for developing a new dietary strategy for the prevention of chronic ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis presently have no cure and are treated with anti-inflammatory drugs or monoclonal antibodies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines. A variety of rodent models have been used to model chronic and acute colitis. Dietary polyphenols in foods and botanicals are of considerable interest for prevention and treatment of colitis. Many dietary polyphenols have been utilized for prevention of colitis in rodent models. Berries, green tea polyphenols, curcumin, and stilbenes have been the most extensively tested polyphenols in rodent models of colitis. The majority of polyphenols tested have inhibited colitis in rodents, but increasing doses of EGCG and green tea, isoflavones, flaxseed, and alpha-mangostin have exacerbated colitis. Few studies have examined combination of polyphenols or other bioactives for inhibition of colitis. Translating polyphenol doses used in rodent models of colitis to human equivalent doses reveals that supplemental doses are most likely required to inhibit colitis from a single polyphenol treatment. The ability to translate polyphenol treatments in rodent models is likely to be limited by species differences in xenobiotic metabolism and microbiota. Given these limitations, data from polyphenols in rodent models suggests merit for pursuing additional clinical studies for prevention of colitis.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The causes of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are largely unknown. This paper reviews the epidemiological and clinical data on how medications (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogens and antibiotics), lifestyle factors (smoking, psychological stress, diet and air pollution) may precipitate clinical relapses and recurrence. Potential biological mechanisms include: increasing thrombotic tendency, imbalances in prostaglandin synthesis, alterations in the composition of gut microbiota, and mucosal damage causing increased permeability. RESULTS: The clinical epidemiological data consistently reports positive associations between smoking and relapses in CD, and inverse ones with UC. For NSAIDs and estrogens, the epidemiological findings are inconsistent, although general antibiotic use was associated with a reduced risk of relapse in CD. High levels of stress were positively associated with relapse, although psychological interventions did not have therapeutic benefits. The limited work on diet has reported sulphur-containing foods are positively associated with relapse in UC, but there is no work in CD. Ecological data reported positive correlations between air pollution levels and IBD hospitalisations. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, to clarify this area, more clinical epidemiological work is required where detailed drug types and doses, and complete dietary intakes are measured, in specific forms of IBD. Such work could provide guidance to both patients and doctors to help maintain remission.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic intestinal illness of autoimmune origin affecting millions across the globe. The most common subtypes include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. While many medical treatments for IBD exist, none come without the risk of significant immunosuppression and in general do not have benign side effect profiles. Surgical intervention exists only as radical resection for medically refractory UC. There exists a dire need for novel treatments that target the inherent pathophysiologic disturbances of IBD, rather than global immune suppression. One avenue of investigation that could provide such an agent is the interaction between certain dietary elements and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The AHR is a cytosolic transcription factor with a rich history in environmental toxicant handling, however, recently a role has emerged for the AHR as a modulator of the gastrointestinal immune system. Studies have come to elucidate these effects to include the enhancement of Th cell subset differentiation, interactions between enteric flora and the luminal wall, and modulation of inflammatory interleukin and cytokine signaling. This review highlights advancements in our understanding of AHR activity in the digestive tract and how this stimulation may be wrought by certain dietary "micronutriceuticals", namely indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its derivatives. Greater clarity surrounding these dynamics could lead to a novel diet-derived agonist of the AHR which is not only non-toxic, but also efficacious in the amelioration of clinical IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies reveal associations between intestinal ganglioside content and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since a low level of ganglioside is associated with higher production of proinflammatory signals in the intestine, it is important to determine safety and bioavailability of dietary ganglioside for application as a potential therapeutic agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy volunteers (HVs; n = 18) completed an 8-week supplementation study to demonstrate safety and bioavailabity of ganglioside consumption. HVs were randomized to consume a milk fat fraction containing 43 mg/d ganglioside or placebo, and patients with IBD (n = 5) consumed ganglioside supplement in a small pilot study. Plasma gangliosides were characterized using reverse-phase liquid chromatography-QQQ mass spectrometry. Intestinal permeability was assessed by oral lactulose/mannitol, and quality of life was assessed by quality of life in the IBD questionnaire. RESULTS: There were no adverse events associated with dietary ganglioside intake. Ganglioside consumption increased ( P < .05) plasma content of total GD3 by 35% over 8 weeks. HVs consuming ganglioside exhibited a 19% decrease in intestinal permeability ( P = .04). Consumption of ganglioside was associated with a 39% increase ( P < .01) in emotional health and a 36% improvement ( P < .02) in systemic symptoms in patients with IBD. CONCLUSION: Impaired intestinal integrity characteristic of IBD results in increased permeability to bacterial antigens and decreased nutrient absorption. Intestinal integrity may be improved by dietary treatment with specific species of ganglioside. Ganglioside is a safe, bioavailable dietary compound that can be consumed to potentially improve quality of life in patients with IBD and treat other disorders involving altered ganglioside metabolism. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02139709.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Environmental factors are supposed to play a decisive role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases [IBDs]. Increased dietary salt intake has been linked with the development of autoimmune diseases, but the impact of a salt-enriched diet on the course of IBD remains unknown. In this study, we examined whether high salt intake alters mucosal cytokine production and exacerbates colitis. METHODS: Normal intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells [LPMCs] were activated with anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of sodium chloride [NaCl] and/or SB202190, a specific inhibitor of p38/MAP Kinase. For in vivo experiments, a high dose of NaCl was administered to mice 15 days before induction of trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid [TNBS]-colitis or dextran sulfate sodium [DSS]-colitis. In parallel, mice were given SB202190 before induction of TNBS-colitis. Transcription factors and effector cytokines were evaluated by flow-cytometry and real-time PCR. RESULTS: IL-17A, IL-23R, TNF-alpha, and Ror-gammaT were significantly increased in human LPMCs following NaCl exposure, while there was no significant change in IFN-gamma, T-bet or Foxp3. Pharmacologic inhibition of p38/MAPK abrogated the NaCl-inducing effect on LPMC-derived cytokines. Mice receiving the high-salt diet developed a more severe colitis than control mice, and this effect was preventable by SB202190. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that exposure of intestinal mononuclear cells to a high-NaCl diet enhanced effector cytokine production and contributed to the exacerbation of experimental colitis in mice.},

This study aims to evaluate the action of LA and/or NAC, on oxidative stress and inflammation markers in colonic and hepatic rat tissues with mild UC, induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) (2% w/v). LA and/or NAC (100 mg.kg.day-1, each) were given, once a day, in the diet, in a pretreatment phase (7 days) and during UC induction (5 days). Colitis induction was confirmed by histological and biochemical analyses (high performance liquid chromatography, spectrophotometry, and Multiplex(R)). A redox imbalance occurred before an immunological disruption in the colon. NAC led to a decrease in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and myeloperoxidase activity. In the liver, DSS did not cause damage but treatments with both antioxidants were potentially harmful, with LA increasing MDA and LA + NAC increasing H2O2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, and transaminases. In summary, NAC exhibited the highest colonic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, while LA + NAC caused hepatic damage.},

   abstract = {Dietary influences may affect microbiome composition and host immune responses, thereby modulating propensity toward inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs): Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Dietary n-6 fatty acids have been associated with UC in prospective studies. However, the critical developmental period when (n-6) consumption may induce UC is not known. We examined the effects of transiently increased n-6 consumption during pediatric development on subsequent dextran-sulfate-sodium (DSS)-induced acute murine colitis. The animals transiently became obese then rapidly lost this phenotype. Interestingly, mice were protected against DSS colitis 40 days after n-6 consumption. The transient high n-6-induced protection against colitis was fat type- and dietary reversal-dependent and could be transferred to germ-free mice by fecal microbiota transplantation. We also detected decreased numbers of chemokine receptor (Cxcr)5(+) CD4(+) T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of transiently n-6-fed mice. Further experiments revealed that anti-chemokine ligand (Cxcl)13 (the ligand of Cxcr5) antibody treatment decreased DSS colitis severity, implicating the importance of the Cxcr5-Cxcl13 pathway in mammalian colitis. Consecutively, we found elevated CXCL13 concentrations (CD: 1.8-fold, P = 0.0077; UC: 1.9-fold, P = 0.056) in the serum of untreated pediatric IBD patients. The human serologic observations supported the translational relevance of our findings.},

   abstract = {More than a decade ago, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is rare in Asia. Today, the importance of IBD in Asia is exemplified by its rapidly increasing incidence, complicated disease behavior, and substantial morbidity. In the first large-scale population-based epidemiologic study in Asia, the incidence of IBD varied from 0.60 to 3.44 per 100,000. There has been a twofold to threefold increase in the incidence of IBD in several countries in Asia. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is more prevalent than Crohn's disease (CD), although CD incidence is rapidly increasing. A positive family history is much less common than in the West, as are extra-intestinal disease manifestations. Complicated and penetrating CD are common in Asia. These epidemiologic changes may relate to increased contact with the West, westernization of diet, improved hygiene, increasing antibiotics use, or changes in the gut microbiota. Asian patients with CD have altered gut microbiota compared with their healthy counterparts and Caucasian CD subjects. Mucosa-associated microbiota in IBD may differ geographically. In a population-based case-control study, breast-feeding, having pets, and better sanitary conditions were protective of IBD, suggesting that childhood environment plays an important role in modulating disease development. Genetic factors also differ between Asians and Caucasians. Nucleotide oligomerization domain-2 (NOD2) and autophagy variants were not associated with CD, but tumor necrosis factor superfamily gene-15 polymorphisms were strongly associated with CD in East Asians. Research in Asia, an area of rapidly changing IBD epidemiology, may lead to the discovery of critical etiologic factors that lead to the development of IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Asia supports the importance of environmental risk factors in disease aetiology. This prospective population-based case-control study in Asia-Pacific examined risk factors prior to patients developing IBD. DESIGN: 442 incident cases (186 Crohn's disease (CD); 256 UC; 374 Asians) diagnosed between 2011 and 2013 from eight countries in Asia and Australia and 940 controls (frequency-matched by sex, age and geographical location; 789 Asians) completed an environmental factor questionnaire at diagnosis. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted ORs (aOR) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: In multivariate model, being breast fed >12 months (aOR 0.10; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.30), antibiotic use (aOR 0.19; 0.07 to 0.52), having dogs (aOR 0.54; 0.35 to 0.83), daily tea consumption (aOR 0.62; 0.43 to 0.91) and daily physical activity (aOR 0.58; 0.35 to 0.96) decreased the odds for CD in Asians. In UC, being breast fed >12 months (aOR 0.16; 0.08 to 0.31), antibiotic use (aOR 0.48; 0.27 to 0.87), daily tea (aOR 0.63; 0.46 to 0.86) or coffee consumption (aOR 0.51; 0.36 to 0.72), presence of hot water tap (aOR 0.65; 0.46 to 0.91) and flush toilet in childhood (aOR 0.71; 0.51 to 0.98) were protective for UC development whereas ex-smoking (aOR 2.02; 1.22 to 3.35) increased the risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: This first population-based study of IBD risk factors in Asia-Pacific supports the importance of childhood immunological, hygiene and dietary factors in the development of IBD, suggesting that markers of altered intestinal microbiota may modulate risk of IBD later in life.},

Malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies among IBD patients result in poor clinical outcomes such as growth failure, reduced response to pharmacotherapy, increased risk for sepsis, and mortality.

This report describes the case of a 24-year-old man with a 7-year history of recurrent, steroid-dependent UC. He received FMT via PEC once per day for 1 month in the hospital. After the remission of gastrointestinal symptoms, he was discharged from the hospital and continued FMT via PEC twice per week for 3 months at home. The frequency of stools decreased, and the characteristics of stools improved soon thereafter. Enteral nutrition was regained after 1 week, and an oral diet was begun 1 month later. Two months after the FMT end point, the patient resumed a normal diet, with formed soft stools once per day. The follow-up colonoscopy showed normal mucus membranes; then, the PEC set was removed. On the subsequent 12 months follow-up, the patient resumed orthobiosis without any gastrointestinal discomfort and returned to work. This case emphasizes that FMT via PEC can not only induce remission but also shorten the duration of hospitalization and reduce the medical costs; therefore, this approach should be considered an alternative option for patients with UC.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease thought to arise from an inappropriate immune response to commensal bacteria in a genetically susceptible person that results in chronic, cyclical, intestinal inflammation. Dietary and environmental factors are implicated in the initiation and perpetuation of IBD; however, a singular causative agent has not been identified. As of now, the role of environmental priming or triggers in IBD onset and pathogenesis are not well understood, but these factors appear to synergize with other disease susceptibility factors. In previous work, we determined that the polysaccharide dietary additive, maltodextrin (MDX), impairs cellular anti-bacterial responses and suppresses intestinal anti-microbial defense mechanisms. In this addendum, we review potential mechanisms for dietary deregulation of intestinal homeostasis, postulate how dietary and genetic risk factors may combine to result in disease pathogenesis, and discuss these ideas in the context of recent findings related to dietary interventions for IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Barwon area in Australia has one of the highest incidence rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and therefore is an ideal location to study the impact of environmental exposures on the disease's development. AIM: To study these exposures prior to the development of IBD in a population-based cohort. METHOD: One hundred and thirty-two incident cases (81 Crohn disease (CD) and 51 ulcerative colitis (UC)) from an IBD registry and 104 controls replied to the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases environmental questionnaire. This included 87 questions about pre-illness exposures that included childhood illnesses, vaccinations, breastfeeding, house amenities, pets and swimming, diet and smoking. RESULTS: The factors associated with CD included smoking (odds ratio (OR): 1.42, confidence interval (CI): 1-2.02, P = 0.029); childhood events, including tonsillectomy (OR: 1.74, CI: 1.15-2.6, P = 0.003) and chicken pox infection (OR: 3.89, CI: 1.61-9.4, P = 0.005) and pre-diagnosis intake of frequent fast food (OR: 2.26, CI: 1.76-4.33, P = 0.003). In UC, the risk factors included smoking (OR: 1.39, CI: 1.1-1.92, P = 0.026) and pre-diagnosis intake of frequent fast food (OR: 2.91, CI: 1.54-5.58, P < 0.001), and high caffeine intake was protective (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.3-0.87, P = 0.002). Other protective exposures for UC included high fruit intake (OR: 0.59, CI: 0.4-0.88, P = 0.003) and having pets as a child (OR: 0.36, CI: 0.2-0.79, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This first Australian population-based study of environmental risk factors confirms that smoking, childhood immunological events and dietary factors play a role in IBD development; while high caffeine intake and pet ownership offer a protective effect.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine environmental factors associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Yunnan Province, a southwestern highland region of China. METHODS: In this nested case-control study, newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis (UC) cases in 2 cities in Yunnan Province and Crohn's disease (CD) cases in 16 cities in Yunnan Province were recruited between 2008 and 2013. Controls were matched by geography, sex and age at a ratio of 1:4. Data were collected using the designed questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: A total of 678 UC and 102 CD cases were recruited. For UC, various factors were associated with an increased risk of developing UC: dietary habits, including frequent irregular meal times; consumption of fried foods, salty foods and frozen dinners; childhood factors, including intestinal infectious diseases and frequent use of antibiotics; and other factors, such as mental labor, high work stress, use of non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and allergies (OR > 1, p < 0.05). Other factors showed a protective effect: such as consumption of fruits, current smoking, physical activity, and drinking tea (OR < 1, p < 0.05). For CD, appendectomy and irregular meal times increased the disease risk (OR >1, p < 0.05), whereas physical activity may have reduced this risk (OR < 1, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first nested case-control study to analyze the association between environmental factors and IBD onset in a southwestern highland region of China. Certain dietary habits, lifestyles, allergies and childhood factors may play important roles in IBD, particularly UC.},

Based on emerging data, Seattle Children's Hospital IBD Center has developed an integrated dietary program incorporating the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) into its treatment paradigm. This treatment paradigm uses the SCD as primary therapy as well as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of the SCD on clinical outcomes and laboratory studies of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with IBD on SCD. RESULTS: We analyzed 26 children on the SCD: 20 with CD and 6 with UC. Duration of the dietary therapy ranged from 3 to 48 mo. In patients with active CD (Pediatric Crohn's Disease activity index [PCDAI] >10), PCDAI dropped from 32.8 +/- 13.2 at baseline to 20.8 +/- 16.6 by 4 +/- 2 wk, and to 8.8 +/- 8.5 by 6 mo. The mean Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for patients with active UC decreased from a baseline of 28.3 +/- 10.3 to 20.0 +/- 17.3 at 4 +/- 2 wk, to 18.3 +/- 31.7 at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring, nonpenetrating CD as well as UC. Further prospective studies are needed to fully assess the safety and efficacy of the SCD in pediatric patients with IBD.},

Three controls were matched for each patient. Copeptin, midregional fragments of adrenomedullin, pro-atrial natriuretic peptide, and proenkephalin A, as well as N-terminal protachykinin A and proneurotensin were analyzed in the plasma. Sixty-two IBD patients were identified. The only difference between patients and controls was higher copeptin levels in the patients compared with controls (P = 0.006), with higher copeptin levels in resected than unresected patients (P = 0.020). There was no difference in any precursor levels between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, between different distributions of disease lesions, or between different treatments.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dairy products may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease by modulating gut microbiota and immune responses, but data from epidemiological studies examining this relationship are limited. We investigated the association between prediagnostic intake of these foods and dietary calcium, and the subsequent development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In total, 401,326 participants were enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. At recruitment, consumption of total and specific dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and dietary calcium was measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. Cases developing incident CD (n = 110) or UC (n = 244) during follow-up were matched with 4 controls. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for total energy intake and smoking. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quartile, the ORs for the highest quartile of total dairy products and dietary calcium intake were 0.61 (95% CI, 0.32-1.19, p trend = 0.19) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.28-1.42, p trend = 0.23) for CD, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.50-1.30, p trend = 0.40) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49-1.34, p trend = 0.60) for UC, respectively. Compared with nonconsumers, individuals consuming milk had significantly reduced odds of CD (OR 0.30, 95% CI, 0.13-0.65) and nonsignificantly reduced odds of UC (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.49-1.47). CONCLUSIONS: Milk consumption may be associated with a decreased risk of developing CD, although a clear dose-response relationship was not established. Further studies are warranted to confirm this possible protective effect.},

Our objective was to examine the impact of prior consumption of LAM and/or FUC on pathology and inflammation following a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) challenge in pigs. Pigs (n 7/group) were assigned to one of five experimental groups for 56 d. From 49-55 d, distilled water or DSS was administered intragastrically. The experimental groups were: (1) basal diet + distilled water (control); (2) basal diet + DSS (DSS); (3) basal diet + FUC + DSS (FUC + DSS); (4) basal diet + LAM + DSS (LAM + DSS); and (5) basal diet + LAM + FUC + DSS (LAMFUC + DSS). The DSS group had decreased body-weight gain (P < 0.05) and serum xylose (P < 0.05), and increased proximal colon pathology score (P < 0.05), diarrhoeal score (P < 0.001) and colonic Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.05) relative to the control group. The FUC + DSS (P < 0.01), LAM + DSS (P < 0.05) and LAMFUC + DSS (P < 0.05) groups had improved diarrhoeal score, and the LAMFUC + DSS (P < 0.05) group had improved body weight relative to the DSS group. The FUC + DSS group (P < 0.001), LAM + DSS group (P < 0.05) and LAMFUC + DSS group (P < 0.001) had lower IL-6 mRNA abundance relative to the DSS group. The LAM + DSS group had reduced Enterobacteriaceae in proximal colon digesta relative to the DSS group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, FUC or a combination of FUC and LAM improved body-weight loss, diarrhoeal scores and clinical variables associated with a DSS challenge in pigs, in tandem with a reduction in colonic IL-6 mRNA abundance.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development is affected by complex interactions between environmental factors, changes in intestinal flora, various predisposing genetic properties and changes in the immune system. Dietary factors seem to play an underestimated role in the etiopathogenesis and course of the disease. However, research about food and IBD is conflicting. An excessive consumption of sugar, animal fat and linoleic acid is considered a risk factor for IBD development, whereas a high fiber diet and citrus fruit consumption may play a protective role. Also, appropriate nutrition in particular periods of the disease may facilitate achieving or prolonging remissions and most of all, improve the quality of life for patients. During disease exacerbation, a low fiber diet is recommended for most patients. In the remission time, an excessive consumption of alcohol and sulfur products may have a negative effect on the disease course. Attempts are also made at employing diets composed in detail in order to supplement IBD therapy. A diet with a modified carbohydrate composition, a semi-vegetarian diet and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols are under investigation. Due to chronic inflammation as well as side effects of chronically used medications, patients with IBD are also at increased risk of nutritional factor deficiencies, including iron, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, folic acid, zinc, magnesium and vitamin A. It should also be remembered that there is no single common diet suitable for all IBD patients; each of them is unique and dietary recommendations must be individually developed for each patient, depending on the course of the disease, past surgical procedures and type of pharmacotherapy.},

   abstract = {In this review, the authors discuss the etiology, pathogenesis, and clinical presentations of colitis in children, and provide current recommendations for the approach to a child with colitis. In addition, they discuss in detail one of the important and emerging causes of chronic colitis in children; inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Diagnostic and management approaches to colitis in children vary considerably based on several factors, including if the colitis is acute in onset or chronic, the age of the child, and the geographical region of the affected child. Broader classification or differential diagnosis of colitis falls under infectious, inflammatory, allergic, and less commonly, immune-mediated and ischemic colitis. Recent epidemiologic reports have elucidated a shift in our understanding of ethnicities and geographic regions affected by IBD. The incidence and prevalence of IBD has been steadily increasing in developing countries, including South-East Asia/India. Also, the risk of developing IBD among the second-generation South-Asians immigrants has greatly increased, with rates approaching those in the Western country to which they immigrated. Current research is focusing on genetic, environmental, and dietary factors to understand the increased incidence of IBD in developing countries and immigrants from developing nations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) share some pathogenetic features. To provide new steps on the role of altered gene expression, and the involvement of gene networks, in the pathogenesis of these diseases, we performed a genome-wide analysis in 15 patients with CD and 14 patients with UC by comparing the RNA from inflamed and noninflamed colonic mucosa. METHODS: Two hundred ninety-eight differentially expressed genes in CD and 520 genes in UC were identified. By bioinformatic analyses, 34 pathways for CD, 6 of them enriched in noninflamed and 28 in inflamed tissues, and 19 pathways for UC, 17 in noninflamed and 2 in inflamed tissues, were also highlighted. RESULTS: In CD, the pathways included genes associated with cytokines and cytokine receptors connection, response to external stimuli, activation of cell proliferation or differentiation, cell migration, apoptosis, and immune regulation. In UC, the pathways were associated with genes related to metabolic and catabolic processes, biosynthesis and interconversion processes, leukocyte migration, regulation of cell proliferation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. CONCLUSIONS: In UC, the pattern of inflammation of colonic mucosa is due to a complex interaction network between host, gut microbiome, and diet, suggesting that bacterial products or endogenous synthetic/catabolic molecules contribute to impairment of the immune response, to breakdown of epithelial barrier, and to enhance the inflammatory process. In patients with CD, genes encoding a large variety of proteins, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules may lead to uncontrolled inflammation with ensuing destruction of epithelial cells, inappropriate stimulation of antimicrobial and T cells differentiation, and inflammasome events.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber intake leading to short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production could be a strategy to combat intermittent bouts of inflammation during ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate dietary potato fiber (PF) in attenuating inflammation using a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. We hypothesized that PF would show anti-inflammatory effects compared with cellulose due in part to SCFA production. METHODS: Male C57Bl/6J mice were fed diets containing either 8% cellulose or 14.5% PF for a 22-d feeding study. Starting on study day 14, mice were provided either distilled water (control) or 2% (wt:vol) DSS in drinking water for 5 d (cellulose+control, n = 17; PF+control, n = 16; cellulose+DSS, n = 17; and PF+DSS, n = 16). Body weights and food and water intakes were collected daily from day 14 through day 22. Distal colon tissue was analyzed for histologic outcomes and changes in gene expression, and cecal contents were analyzed for SCFA concentrations. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, with repeated measures applied where necessary. RESULTS: At day 5 post-DSS induction, cellulose+DSS mice exhibited a 2% reduction (P < 0.05) in body weight compared with PF+DSS and PF+ and cellulose+control mice. PF+DSS mice had greater (P < 0.05) cecal butyrate concentrations [24.5 mumol/g dry matter (DM)] than did cellulose+DSS mice (4.93 mumol/g DM). Mice fed PF+DSS had lower (P < 0.05) infiltration of leukocytes in the distal colon than did mice fed cellulose+DSS (mean histology scores of 1.22 and 2.30, respectively). Furthermore, mice fed cellulose+DSS exhibited 1.42, 11.5, 8.48, and 35.5 times greater (P < 0.05) colon mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfa) and interleukin (Il) 1b, Il6, and Il17a, respectively, and 7.10 times greater (P < 0.05) expression of C-X-C motif ligand 1 (Cxc1) compared with mice fed PF+DSS. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PF fed to mice before and during DSS colitis attenuates inflammation, potentially through SCFA production; however, future studies are needed to understand the role of dietary fiber intake and immune activation.},

   abstract = {The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of allicin (10 mg/kg body weight, orally) in an experimental murine model of UC by administering 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water to BALB/c mice. DSS-induced mice presented reduced body weight, which was improved by allicin administration. We noted increases in CD68 expression, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, and Malonaldehyde (MDA) and mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) alpha, interleukin- (IL-) 1beta, IL-6, and IL-17, and decrease in the activities of enzymic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione reductase (GR), and Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in DSS-induced mice. However, allicin treatment significantly decreased CD68, MPO, MDA, and proinflammatory cytokines and increased the enzymic antioxidants significantly (P < 0.05). In addition, allicin was capable of reducing the activation and nuclear accumulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), thereby preventing degradation of the inhibitory protein IkappaB and inducing inhibition of the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-p65 in the colonic mucosa. These findings suggest that allicin exerts clinically useful anti-inflammatory effects mediated through the suppression of the NF-kappaB and IL-6/p-STAT3(Y705) pathways.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) encompass at least two forms of intestinal inflammation: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). Both conditions are chronic and inflammatory disorders in the gastrointestinal tract, with an increasing prevalence being associated with the industrialization of nations and in developing countries. Patients with these disorders are 10 to 20 times more likely to develop cancer of the colon. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of a naturally occurring polyphenol, gallic acid (GA), in an experimental murine model of UC. A significant blunting of weight loss and clinical symptoms was observed in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-exposed, GA-treated mice compared with control mice. This effect was associated with a remarkable amelioration of the disruption of the colonic architecture, a significant reduction in colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and a decrease in the expression of inflammatory mediators, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, GA reduced the activation and nuclear accumulation of p-STAT3(Y705), preventing the degradation of the inhibitory protein IkappaB and inhibiting of the nuclear translocation of p65-NF-kappaB in colonic mucosa. These findings suggest that GA exerts potentially clinically useful anti-inflammatory effects mediated through the suppression of p65-NF-kappaB and IL-6/p-STAT3(Y705) activation.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a nonspecific inflammatory disorder characterized by oxidative and nitrosative stress, leucocyte infiltration, and upregulation of inflammatory mediators. Boldine is an alkaloid compound found in Boldo tree, with multiple pharmacological actions, mainly anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, and immunomodulatory activities. Hence, the effect of boldine for its anti-inflammatory properties against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in BALB/c mice was studied. Administration of boldine to DSS-induced mice protects colon damage by reduced disease activity index, spleen weight, and increased colon length. Also administration of boldine showed a reduction in the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD 68+ expression. Boldine reduced the colon damage, with significant reductions in both the extent and the severity of the inflammation as well as in crypt damage and leukocyte infiltration in the mucosa. Analysis in vivo showed clear decrease in the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-(p-STAT3)(Y705) with nuclear factor (p65-NF-kappaB) production being reduced significantly. Moreover, p65-NF-kappaB activation was reduced in mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells in vitro. The data demonstrated that boldine may be beneficial in colitis through selective immunomodulatory effects, which may be mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of p65-NF-kappaB and STAT3 signaling pathways.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic conditions attributed to an aberrant immune response to luminal triggers. Recently, published work suggests a pathogenic role for bile acids in this context. AIM: To perform a systematic review of studies investigating the role of bile acids in intestinal inflammation and present potentially relevant clinical implications. METHODS: Pubmed search for English language articles published up to May 2015. Terms used were: 'bile', 'bile acid', 'barrier', 'small bowel injury', 'Crohn's' and 'colitis'. RESULTS: Experimental studies support a variable role for bile acids in intestinal barrier homoeostasis. This may be attributed to different physicochemical properties, variable effects on epithelia and immune cells via bile acids-specific receptors, or through a cross-talk with the gut microbiome. A reduction in the bile acids pool, with lower concentrations of secondary forms, has been recognised for some time in Crohn's disease and associated to ileal dysfunction and bile acids malabsorption. Recent work suggests that these changes, including an increase in sulphated forms, are related to inflammatory activity in both Crohn's disease and UC. The detrimental effects of 'western diet' elements such as emulsifiers and fat, which have been implicated in the development of the current IBD and obesity epidemics, may also be bile acid-mediated. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are only a few observational clinical studies to support an interaction, in vivo human and animal studies support an association between bile acids metabolism, the gut microbiome and intestinal inflammation. This may well prove to have significant diagnostic and therapeutic implications.},

In coeliac patients there is higher incidence of other autoimmune disorders like type 1 diabetes or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The coexistence of coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease is rare. The spectrum of presentation of coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease may be similar. However, those disorders require various therapeutic approaches. Thus, early recognition of the overlap between coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease is crucial to apply appropriate treatment and to prevent possible complications. We report a case of a 6-year-old boy with a delay in physical and psychomotor development, rickets, severe anaemia and bloody diarrhoea. He was diagnosed with coeliac disease and ulcerative disease. The coexistence of both disorders is extremely rare in childhood. However, ulcerative colitis should be considered in coeliac children on restrictive gluten-free diet with persistent diarrhoea or bleeding from lower gastrointestinal tract. Screening for coeliac disease should be considered in children with ulcerative colitis with impaired physical development and lack of remission despite of proper treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are chronic gastrointestinal disorders of unknown aetiology of increasing incidence and changing disease activity or severity. Approximately 60-80% of IBD patients suffer from IBS. Monitoring and treatment goals of IBD are to optimise the disease course by prolonging remission periods and preventing or shortening periods of active disease. Constant-care web-monitoring and treatment approaches with active patient involvement have been proven effective in UC, increasing patients' adherence and improving the disease outcomes. AIM: To assess the feasibility and efficacy of the novel constant-care eHealth applications in: i) CD patients treated with infliximab (IFX), ii) UC patients with active disease on mesalazine, iii) IBS patients and iv) IBD patients with IBS on a low FODMAP diet (LFD). METHODS: New constant-care web applications www.cd.constant-care.dk, www.meza.constant-care.dk and www.ibs.constant-care.dk in IBD patients were developed and assessed in this thesis. An integrated inflammatory burden measure of disease activity, consisting of a subjective (clinical indices) and of an objective (faecal calprotectin) part and a treatment guide to drug doses and intervals, was incorporated into the web applications and used by patients. RESULTS: Web-guided IFX treatment in CD demonstrated patients' inter- and intra-individual variability in infusion intervals and provided patients with individualised treatment according to their needs. Web-guided treatment with multimatrix mesalazine was efficacious in a majority of UC patients with mild-to-moderate disease activity. Web-guided IBS-monitoring in IBD and in IBS patients on LFD was shown to be a feasible method that actively involved patients in their disease management and had a positive short-term impact on the disease. Moreover, the new constant-care concepts were demonstrated to be safe and to have a positive impact on quality of life and adherence to treatment and helped to reduce the costs. CONCLUSIONS: The novel constant-care web applications have proven feasible in improving the disease outcomes in CD patients on IFX, in UC patients on mesalazine, and in monitoring IBS. These applications are expected to be implemented in the clinical practice of gastroenterology in Denmark in the coming years. Future studies will help to assess whether the natural disease course can be improved in the long-term.},

   abstract = {The immune response is a very complex interplay of specific and nonspecific branches that have evolved to distinguish between nondangerous and dangerous or nontolerated factors. In the past, research has focused on the specific immune system much more than the host's innate defense. Studies have shown that a key component of the immune response involves activation of the inflammasome. A direct relationship between the presence of the inflammasome and the onset of disease has already been characterized for a variety of chronic and food-related diseases, including arthrosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and chronic bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The leukocyte activation (ALCAT test), an immunological blood test for food intolerance reactions, is ideal to identify and eliminate individual food stimuli that may act as triggers for the cellular nonspecific immune response. Although the test is not diagnostic, studies have established that it can be a useful screening tool for the identification of foreign substances that may trigger immune cell activation, particularly of neutrophils, leading to inflammatory disorders. The ALCAT test, coupled with a targeted diet that is individually tailored according to the test's results, may support immune homeostasis and provide a valuable complementary approach for therapy and overall health.},

Among genetic, environmental, and immunological factors, changes in the composition of the intestinal microflora and diet are indicated as very important in initiating and sustaining inflammation in patients with IBD. Above all nutrients dietary fibre is an especially important component of diet in the context of IBD. A potentially protective effect of high-fibre diet on intestinal disorders was described as early as in 1973. Several trials performed in animal models of IBD and human studies have reported that supplementation of some types of dietary fibre can prolong remission and reduce lesions of the intestinal mucosa during the course of the disease. This paper presents the current state of knowledge on the effects of dietary fibre in IBD.},

There is little research investigating the availability and quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional implications of IBD.},

   abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit impaired control of the microbiome in the gut, and 'dysbiosis' is commonly observed. Western diet is a risk factor for the development of IBD, but it may have different effects on gut microbiota between IBD and non-IBD individuals. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) can induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease with a decrease in gut microbial diversity. Although there are some theoretical benefits, actual treatment effects of prebiotics and probiotics in IBD vary. High-quality studies have shown that VSL#3 (a high-potency probiotic medical food containing eight different strains) exhibits benefits in treating ulcerative colitis, and gut microbial diversity is reduced after treated with VSL#3 in animal models. The effect of fecal microbiome transplantation on IBD is controversial. Increasing microbial diversity compared with impaired handling of bacteria presents a dilemma. Antibiotics are the strongest factors in the reduction of microbiome ecological diversity. Some antibiotics may help to induce remission of the disease. Microbiome alteration has been suggested to be an intrinsic property of IBD and a potential predictor in diagnosis and prognosis. However, the effects of therapeutic modulations are variable; thus, more questions remain to be answered.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Specific nutrients or foods have been inconsistently associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) risks. Thus, we investigated associations between diet as a whole, as dietary patterns, and UC and CD risks. METHODS: Within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer) study, we set up a nested matched case-control study among 366,351 participants with inflammatory bowel disease data, including 256 incident cases of UC and 117 of CD, and 4 matched controls per case. Dietary intake was recorded at baseline from validated food frequency questionnaires. Incidence rate ratios of developing UC and CD were calculated for quintiles of the Mediterranean diet score and a posteriori dietary patterns produced by factor analysis. RESULTS: No dietary pattern was associated with either UC or CD risks. However, when excluding cases occurring within the first 2 years after dietary assessment, there was a positive association between a "high sugar and soft drinks" pattern and UC risk (incidence rate ratios for the fifth versus first quintile, 1.68 [1.00-2.82]; Ptrend = 0.02). When considering the foods most associated with the pattern, high consumers of sugar and soft drinks were at higher UC risk only if they had low vegetables intakes. CONCLUSIONS: A diet imbalance with high consumption of sugar and soft drinks and low consumption of vegetables was associated with UC risk. Further studies are needed to investigate whether microbiota alterations or other mechanisms mediate this association.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The role of dietary fatty acids in ulcerative colitis (UC) pathogenesis has been shown in animal models; however, human studies are rare. We hypothesized that there might be a relationship between dietary fatty acid composition and the risk of developing incident UC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall, 62 new cases of UC and 124 healthy age and sex-matched controls were studied. Information on usual diet was measured by a validated country-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounding variables was carried out to compare dietary fatty acid intakes between cases and controls. RESULTS: We found positive associations between dietary intake of total fat (P value for trend <0.01), oleic acid (P value for trend <0.01), saturated fatty acid (SAFA) (P value for trend = 0.02), total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (P value for trend = 0.04), and trans fat (P value for trend <0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that higher consumptions of total fats, oleic acid, SAFAs, total PUFAs, trans fat, MUFAs, and linoleic acid are significantly associated with increased risk for UC; however, no statistically significant associations were detected between the risk of disease and n-3 PUFAs and cholesterol intake.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is rising in populations with western-style diet, rich in fat and protein, and low in fruits and vegetables. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the association between dietary protein intakes and the risk of developing incident UC. METHODS: Sixty two cases of UC and 124 controls were studied using country-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Group comparisons by each factor were done using chi2 test, and significance level was set at alpha= 0.05. Logistic regression adjusted for potential confounding variables was carried out. RESULTS: Univariate analysis suggested positive associations between processed meat, red meat and organ meat with risk of ulcerative colitis. Comparing highest versus lowest categories of consumption, multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis accounting for potential confounding variables indicated that patients who consumed a higher amount of processed meat were at a higher risk for developing UC (P value for trend= 0.02). Similarly, patients who consumed higher amounts of red meat were at a higher risk for UC (P value for trend= 0.01). The highest tertile of intake of organ meat was associated with an increased risk of ulcerative colitis with a statistically significant trend across tertiles (P value for trend= 0.01) when adjusted. CONCLUSION: In this case-control study we observed that higher consumptions of processed meat, red meat and organ meat were associated with increased risk for UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The imbalance of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the maternal diet impairs intestinal barrier development and sensitizes the colon response to inflammatory insults in the young rats. With a view to overcoming this issue, we designed this study to investigate the effect of maternal and neonatal intake of different proportions of n-6/n-3 fatty acids on colon inflammation in the young adult rats. METHODS: Female Wistar rats were assigned into four groups, and each group fed one of four semisynthetic diets, namely n-6, low n-3, n-6/n-3 and n-3 fatty acids for 8 weeks prior to mating, during gestation and lactation periods. At weaning, the pups were separated from the dams and fed diet similar to the mothers. Colitis was induced on postnatal day 35, by administering 2 % dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for 10 days. Colitis was assessed based on the clinical and inflammatory markers in the colon. Fatty acid analysis was done in liver, RBC, colon and spleen. RESULTS: A balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA diet significantly improved the body weight loss, rectal bleeding and mortality in rats. This was associated with lower myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, TNF-alpha and IL-6, IL-8, COX-2 and iNOS levels in the colon tissues. Fatty acid analysis has shown that the arachidonic acid/docosahexaenoic acid ratio was significantly lower in liver, RBC, colon and spleen in n-6/n-3 and n-3 diet groups. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA supplementation in maternal and neonatal diet alters systemic AA/DHA ratio and attenuates colon inflammation in the young adult rats.},

   abstract = {Our recent study has demonstrated that medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and monounsaturated fatty acids potentiate the beneficial effects of fish oil on risk factors of cardiovascular disease. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of MCT or olive oil on the protective and mucosal healing ability of fish oil in ulcerative colitis using cell simulation and animal models. Caco-2 cells grown in medium chain fatty acids enriched medium has exaggerated t-butyl hydroperoxide induced cell damage, GSH depletion, and IL-1beta induced IL-8 synthesis, compared to the cells grown in oleic acid & hydroxytyrosol (OT) enriched medium. Further, combined treatment of cells with eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and OT has remarkably attenuated the cell damage, and IL-8 synthesis, compared to individual treatments. To evaluate the effect of these lipid formulations in vivo, adult Wistar rats were fed diet enriched with high amount of medium chain triglycerides (MCT), virgin olive oil, or their combination with fish oil. Colitis was induced in rats using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7days followed by 10-days of recovery period. Rats of MCT group exhibit severe disease activity, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in the colon compared to the olive oil group. Furthermore, there was persistent body weight loss, loose stools, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in the rats of MCT group, even after DSS was withdrawn from drinking water. Conversely, fish oil has remarkably attenuated the DSS induced alterations in both MCT and olive oil diet groups with significantly greater effect in the olive oil group. Thus, MCT increase the susceptibility to colitis through oxidative damage and IL-8 synthesis in intestinal epithelial cells. The beneficial effects of virgin olive oil could be partially attributed to hydroxytyrosol. Combined treatment of hydroxytyrosol, oleic acid and n-3 fatty acids exhibit huge therapeutic benefits in colitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To document the quality of colonoscopy practice and the pattern of colonic disease including polyp detection rate at Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan. STUDY DESIGN: An observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan, from May 2013 to June 2014. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective study recorded demographics of patients, indications and quality indices of 505 colonoscopies performed during the study period. Preparation was done with low residue diet and polyethylene glycol. Conscious sedation was generally used. Quality indices studied were compared with guideline standard. RESULTS: Out of 505 colonoscopy patients, 305 were males and 200 were females. The indications for colonoscopic examination were lower gastrointestinal bleeding (26.5%, n=134), screening for colorectal cancer (14.1%, n=71), chronic diarrhea (12.9%, n=65), abdominal pain (10.9%, n=55), anemia (9.1%, n=46), constipation (7.3%, n=37), hematochezia and diarrhea (6.3%, n=32), altered bowel habits (5.1%, n=26), weight loss (3.6%, n=18), colonic thickening on CT scan (3.0%, n=15) and others (1.2%, n=6). Bowel preparation was adequate (in 92%, n=465) cases. Cecal intubation rate was 88.71% (n=448). Endoscopic diagnoses were hemorrhoids (36.2%, n=183), normal (22%, n=111), polyps (11.3%, n=57), ulcerative colitis (8.7%, n=44), cancer (4%, n=20), diverticulosis (3.4%, n=17), infective colitis (2.6%, n=13), intestinal TB (2.6%, n=13), non-specific colitis (2.2%, n=11), proctitis (1.8%, n=9) and others (5.3%, n=27). CONCLUSION: There is room for improvement in quality of colonoscopy, cecal intubation rate is slightly below the recommended standard and polyp detection rate is quite low however, it is not clear if the low rate of polyp detection is due to missed lesions or low population incidence. Time to reach caecum and withdrawal time should clearly be documented in the notes which can help to evaluate quality of the procedure in a better way.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a 'prototype disease' for chronic auto-inflammatory disorders with a polygenic background and important multifaceted environmental trigger components. The environmental factors contribute both to pathogenesis and disease flares. Thus, IBD is a disease par excellence to study the interactions between host genetics, environmental factors (such as infections or smoking) and 'in-vironmental' factors - for example, our intestinal microbiota. Longitudinal intercurrent events, including the impact of long-term medication on disease progression or stabilization, can exemplarily be studied in this disease group. Whilst alterations in the human genome coding relevant variant protein products have most likely not emerged significantly over the last 50 years, the incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has dramatically increased in Western countries and more recently in the Asia Pacific area. An interesting concept indicates that 'Western lifestyle factors' trigger chronic intestinal inflammation or disease flares in a genetically susceptible host. To understand the disease pathogenesis as well as triggers for flares or determinants of disease courses, we must further investigate potential en(in)vironmental factors. As environmental conditions, in contrast to genetic risk factors, can be influenced, knowledge on those risk factors becomes crucial to modulate disease incidence, disease course or clinical presentation. It is obvious that prevention of environmentally triggered disease flares would be a goal most relevant for IBD patients. An increased prevalence of IBD in urban environment has been documented in Switzerland by the Swiss IBD cohort study. Several studies have attempted to identify such factors; however, only a few have been validated. The best investigated environmental factor identified in IBD cohort analyses is smoking. Other environmental factors that have been associated with clinical presentation or risk of inflammatory flares as well as increased incidence are diet and food additives. The so-called 'hygiene hypothesis' suggests that increased hygiene in childhood associated with reduced exposure to pathogens may leave the mucosal immune system insufficiently trained and thus prone to uncontrolled inflammation. Oral contraceptives and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the 2 main classes of frequently taken drugs that have been attributed to have the potential to cause flares of the disease. What is likely to be the connection between the genetic susceptibility and the environmental triggers? There is broad evidence for a critical role of the commensal enteric microbiota as a modulator of immunologic responses relevant during onset and chronification of IBD.},

This study was designed to evaluate dietary HTy-Ac supplementation effects on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: DBA-1/J mice were fed from weaning with 0.05% HTy-Ac. After 6 weeks, arthritis was induced by type II collagen. Mice were sacrificed 42 days after first immunization. Blood was recollected and paws were histological and biochemically processed. HTy-Ac diet significantly prevent edarthritis development and decreased serum IgG1 and IgG2a, cartilage olimeric matrix protein (COMP) and metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) levels, as well as, pro-inflammatory cytokines levels (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-17A). The activation of Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathways were drastically ameliorated whereas nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expressions were significantly up-regulated in those mice fed with HTy-Ac. CONCLUSION: HTy-Ac improved the oxidative events and returned pro-inflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through JAK/STAT, MAPKs and NF-kappaB pathways. HTy-Ac supplement might provide a basis for developing a new dietary strategy for the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis.},

This modality of diets provides all essential nutrients, and contains protein in the form of free amino acids that are theoretically easily absorbed. High output ileostomies are a rare but important complications of stoma formation following bowel surgery. Treatments could be challenging and include anti-diarrhoeals, octreotide and proton pump inhibitors. There is very little research regarding the use of elemental diets in the treatment of patients with post-operative high ileostomy outputs. Adequate management of high output ileostomies might prevent significant morbidity. In this case report, we describe a patient who underwent a subtotal colectomy for ulcerative colitis complicated by refractory high ileostomy output despite maximal standard medical therapy for years. The ileostomy output was dramatically reduced following the introduction of an elemental diet. This case suggests a possible role for the introduction of an elemental diet in the management of high output ileostomies. Besides presenting this case with high output ileostomy, we reviewed the role of ED in other gastrointestinal disorders.},

   abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for developing ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC). The interleukin-6 (IL-6)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 signaling regulates survival and proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD and CRC. Cocoa is enriched with polyphenols that known to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities. Here, we explored the antitumor effects and mechanisms of cocoa diet on colitis-associated cancer (CAC) using the azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium model, with a particular focus on whether cocoa exerts its anticancer effect through the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. We found that cocoa significantly decreased the tumor incidence and size in CAC-induced mice. In addition to inhibiting proliferation of tumor epithelial cells, cocoa suppressed colonic IL-6 expression and subsequently activation of STAT3. Thus, our findings demonstrated that cocoa diet suppresses CAC tumorigenesis, and its antitumor effect is partly mediated by limiting IL-6/STAT3 activation. In addition, cocoa induces apoptosis by increased the expressions of Bax and caspase 3 and decreased Bcl-xl. Thus, we conclude that cocoa may be a potential agent in the prevention and treatment of CAC.},

   abstract = {Fisetin, a dietary flavonoid, is commonly found in many fruits and vegetables. Although studies indicate that fisetin has an anti-inflammatory property, little is known about its effects on intestinal inflammation. The present study investigated the effects of the fisetin on dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis, an animal model that resembles human inflammatory bowel disease. Fisetin treatment to DSS-exposed mice significantly reduced the severity of colitis and alleviated the macroscopic and microscopic signs of the disease. Moreover, fisetin reduced the levels of myeloperoxidase activity, the production of proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the expressions of COX-2 and iNOS in the colon tissues. Further studies revealed that fisetin suppressed the activation of NF-kappaB (p65) by inhibiting IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and NF-kappaB (p65)-DNA binding activity and attenuated the phosphorylation of Akt and the p38, but not ERK and JNK MAPKs in the colon tissues of DSS-exposed mice. In addition, DSS-induced decline in reduced glutathione (GSH) and the increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly restored by oral fisetin. Furthermore, the results from in vitro studies showed that fisetin significantly reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokine and mediator release and suppressed the degradation and phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha with subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB (p65) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse primary peritoneal macrophages. These results suggest that fisetin exerts anti-inflammatory activity via inhibition of Akt, p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling in the colon tissues of DSS-exposed mice. Thus, fisetin may be a promising candidate as pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Oxidative stress is involved in both pathogenesis and exacerbation of ulcerative colitis (UC). This study was designed to evaluate whether resveratrol, an excellent anti-oxidant agent, can help in treatment of UC and its related oxidative stress. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty six patients with active mild to moderate disease were randomized to receive either 500 mg/day resveratrol capsules or the same amount of placebo for 6 weeks. Before and after the intervention, disease activity, quality of life, and oxidative stress were assessed using the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index Questionnaire (SCCAIQ), Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-9 (IBDQ-9), and serum level of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC), respectively. Serum SOD (122.28 +/- 11.55 to 125.77 +/- 10.97) and TAC (9.87 +/- 1.51-11.97 +/- 1.61) increased, whereas serum MDA (5.62 +/- 1.18-3.42 +/- 1.01) decreased significantly in resveratrol group (p <0.001). Moreover, resveratrol supplementation significantly decreased disease activity and increased the quality of life (p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that 500 mg/day resveratrol supplementation can improve the disease activity and quality of life in patients with UC at least partially through reduction of oxidative stress. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dosage of supplementation for these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory disease in which reducing pro-inflammatory and/or increasing anti-inflammatory molecules is the mainstay of treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementation with resveratrol as an antiinflammatory and antioxidant agent on inflammation and quality of life in patients with active UC. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 50 eligible patients with active mild to moderate UC were supplemented with either a 500-mg resveratrol or placebo capsule for 6 weeks. Serum inflammatory markers, activity of NF-kappaB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and quality of life were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. Resveratrol supplementation led to a significant reduction in plasma levels of TNF-alpha (19.70 +/- 12.80 to 17.20 +/- 10.09 pg/mL) and hs-CRP (4764.25 +/- 2260.48 to 2584.50 +/- 1792.80 ng/mL) and activity of NF-kappaB in PBMCs (0.19 +/- 0.05 to 0.10 +/- 0.04 OD) (p <0.001), whereas there were no significant changes of these factors in placebo group. Also, the score of inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire -9 (IBDQ-9) increased, whereas the clinical colitis activity index score decreased significantly in the resveratrol group (32.72 +/- 7.52 to 47.64 +/- 8.59) (p <0.001) and when compared with the placebo group (35.54 +/- 9.50 to 41.08 +/- 6.59) (p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that 6 weeks supplementation with 500 mg resveratrol can improve quality of life and disease clinical colitis activity at least partially through inflammation reduction in patients with UC. Whether these effects will be continued in longer duration of treatment remains to be determined.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Fiber definition includes all those carbohydrates which are not digested nor absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract allowing them to reach the colon with no previous processing. Traditionally fiber has been classified according to their solubility into soluble and insoluble and different physiological properties have been defined for each type. The physiologic role of the fiber intake has been studied in diabetes, dyslipidemia or obesity. Fiber intake has also demonstrated to be beneficial in the prevention of many neoplastic diseases like colorectal cancer. It s also known that fiber plays an important role in the faecal excretion of nitrogen. AIM: To evaluate the current evidence that fiber intake plays in the management and prevention of several different diseases, being able to determine, if possible, the most recommended fiber type for each clinical condition. METHODS: A non-systematic review by searching the Medline and Pubmed was made and studies which met the inclusion criteria were identified and selected for analysis. RESULTS: Different fiber types can be useful for the treatment of several gastrointestinal diseases like constipation, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis remission or short bowel syndrome. Patients diagnosed with diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and other cardiometabolic diseases can get a clinical improvement with soluble fiber intake. Dietary fiber has demonstrated to play a role in the prevention of colorrectal cancer and other neoplastic diseases. Patients with hepatic encephalopathy or chronic kidney disease will also benefit from fermentable fiber intake. DISCUSSION: Fiber plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of many clinical conditions. However further investigations are needed to establish specific fiber intake recommendations.},

   abstract = {Hydroxytyrosol, a polyphenolic compound from extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has exhibited an improvement in a model of DSS-induced colitis. However, other phenolic compounds present such as hydroxytyrosyl acetate (HTy-Ac) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) need to be explored to complete the understanding of the overall effects of EVOO on inflammatory colon mucosa. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of both HTy-Ac and DHPG dietary supplementation in the inflammatory response associated to colitis model. Six-week-old mice were randomized in four dietary groups: sham and control groups received standard diet, and other two groups were fed with HTy-Ac and DHPG, respectively, at 0.1%. After 30 days, all groups except sham received 3% DSS in drinking water for 5 days followed by a regime of 5 days of water. Acute inflammation was evaluated by Disease Activity Index (DAI), histology and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Colonic expression of iNOS, COX-2, MAPKs, NF-kB and FOXP3 were determined by western blotting. Only HTy-Ac-supplemented group showed a significant DAI reduction as well as an improvement of histological damage and MPO. COX-2 and iNOS protein expression were also significantly reduced. In addition, this dietary group down-regulated JNK phosphorylation and prevented the DSS-induced nuclear translocation level of p65. However, no significant differences were observed in the FOXP3 expression. These results demonstrated, for the first time, that HTy-Ac exerts an antiinflammatory effect on acute ulcerative colitis. We concluded that HTy-Ac supplement might provide a basis for developing a new dietary strategy for the prevention of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: Squalene is a polyunsaturated triterpene, which has exhibited anticancer and antioxidant activities among others. We investigated dietary squalene supplementation effect on an acute colitis model induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in C57BL/6 mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice were fed from weaning with squalene at 0.02% and 0.1%. After 4 weeks, mice were exposed to 3% DSS for 5 days developing acute colitis. After DSS removal (5 days), colons were histological and biochemically processed. Our results showed that dietary squalene treatment exerts anti-inflammatory action in DSS-induced acute colitis. Western blot revealed that squalene downregulated COX-2 (where COX is cyclooxygenase) and inducible nitric oxide synthase system by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways, preventing an increase in the cytokines levels. Under our experimental conditions, STAT3 and FOXP3 (where FOXP3 is forkhead box P3) were not modified and the transcriptional regulation of antioxidant and/or detoxifying enzymes, Nrf2 (where Nrf2 is nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2), was reduced in DSS-induced colitis. However, any change could be observed after squalene supplementation. CONCLUSION: Squalene was able to improve the oxidative events and returned proinflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways. However, supplementary studies are needed in order to provide a basis for developing a new dietary supplementation strategy.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An increasing body of evidence has linked diet to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Most of our current knowledge pertains to the link between diet and Crohn's disease. Exclusive enteral nutrition and partial enteral nutrition are the best known dietary intervention for the induction of remission and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease both in children and in adults, but the mechanism whereby these interventions may cause or maintain remission and mucosal healing has remained elusive. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shed light on the possible mechanisms of response to dietary intervention. Epidemiological and rodent model studies over the last year have supplied us with several dietary candidates for an effect of diet on inflammation and disease pathogenesis. Others have shed insight into the effect of diet on dysbiosis and the microbiota. An elimination diet based on some of these candidates has shown clinical efficacy, and bridged the knowledge obtained from rodent models to a human intervention. SUMMARY: These studies may allow better understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD and provide new tools to treat these difficult diseases. Elimination diets based on the identification of deleterious dietary components may pave the way for an improved control of the disease in the future. VIDEO ABSTRACT: http://links.lww.com/COG/A10.},

We review the mechanisms by which these gut bacteria, fungi, and viruses mediate mucosal homeostasis via their composite genes (metagenome) and metabolic products (metabolome). We explain how alterations to their profiles and functions under conditions of dysbiosis contribute to inflammation and effector immune responses that mediate inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in humans and enterocolitis in mice. It could be possible to engineer the intestinal environment by modifying the microbiota community structure or function to treat patients with IBD-either with individual agents, via dietary management, or as adjuncts to immunosuppressive drugs. We summarize the latest information on therapeutic use of fecal microbial transplantation and propose improved strategies to selectively normalize the dysbiotic microbiome in personalized approaches to treatment.},

The present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum 21 (LAB 21) on inflammatory mediators in trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats. The inflammatory response was assessed by changes in colon morphology, histopathology, and measurement of reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (TBARS), nitric oxide (NO), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 10 (IL-10) mRNA and protein levels by ELISA. Besides, protein expressions of IL-1beta and IL-10 were also evaluated by western blot. Treatment with LAB 21 (1x10(10)CFU/rat/day) and sulfasalazine (500mgkg(-1) body weight) for 14days after induction of colitis, significantly decreased TBARS, NO and increased GSH concentration. The protein and mRNA expressions of IL-1beta and TNFalpha were down-regulated, whereas, protein and mRNA expression of IL-10 was up-regulated in LAB 21-treated rats. Moreover, LAB 21 attenuated the macroscopic colonic damage, histopathological changes induced by TNBS. These results suggest that LAB 21 may be effective in the treatment of UC by immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties.},

In this study we analyzed the pharmacokinetic profile of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as the free fatty acid (FFA), in an enteric-coated preparation, in 10 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 10 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 15 healthy volunteers (HV). Subjects received 2 g daily of EPA-FFA for 8 weeks. Plasma phospholipid and red blood cell (RBC) membrane fatty acid content were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. There was a rapid incorporation of EPA into plasma phospholipids by 2 weeks and a slower, but highly consistent, incorporation into RBC membranes (4% total fatty acid content; coefficient of variation 10-16%). There was a concomitant reduction in relative n-6 PUFA content. Elongation and desaturation of EPA into docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) via docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) were apparent and DHA content also increased in membranes. EPA-FFA is well tolerated and no difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of n-3 PUFA incorporation was detected between IBD patients and HV. Our data support the concept that EPA can be considered the "universal donor" with respect to key n-3 PUFAs and that this enteric-coated formulation allows long term treatment with a high level of compliance.},

   abstract = {Mucosal surfaces represent the largest areas of interactions of the host with its environment. Subsequently, the mucosal immune system has evolved complex strategies to maintain the integrity of the host by inducing protective immune responses against pathogenic and tolerance against dietary and commensal microbial antigens within the broad range of molecules the intestinal epithelium is exposed to. Among many other specialized cell subsets, myeloid cell populations - due to their strategic location in the subepithelial lamina propria - are the first ones to scavenge and process these intestinal antigens and to send consecutive signals to other immune and non-immune cell subsets. Thus, myeloid cell populations represent attractive targets for clinical intervention in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) as they initiate and modulate inflammatory or regulatory immune response and shape the intestinal T cell pool. Here, we discuss the interactions of the intestinal microbiota with dendritic cell and macrophage populations and review in this context the literature on four promising candidate molecules that are critical for the induction and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis on the one hand, but also for the initiation and propagation of chronic intestinal inflammation on the other.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Total proctocolectomy (TPC) and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) have become the standard of care for patients with ulcerative colitis refractory to medical management. The purpose of our study is to show our single-site approach and to identify maneuvers that improve efficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent single-site three-stage TPC-IPAA for ulcerative colitis at our institution. Primary outcomes included operative time, conversion from single site to standard laparoscopy, time to oral intake and stoma function, postoperative complications, and length of stay. The GelPOINT() Advanced Access Platform (Applied Medical, Santa Margarita, CA) was used. RESULTS: Eight patients were identified who had undergone single-site surgery with the GelPOINT platform. Six of the 8 patients underwent the first stage, total abdominal colectomy (TAC), and all 8 underwent the second stage (proctectomy/IPAA). The mean operating time for TAC was 242 +/- 32 minutes. The mean time until tolerance of clear diet was 1.2 +/- 0.4 days, and time until tolerance of regular diet was 3.3 +/- 1.2 days. The mean time to stoma function was 1.5 +/- 0.55 days, and that for postoperative opioid use was 4.0 +/- 1.3 days. The median length of stay was 5 days (range, 3-10 days). There was one postoperative complication. The mean operating time for the proctectomy/IPAA was 283 +/- 50 minutes. The mean time until tolerance of clear diet was 1.0 +/- 0.5 days, and time until tolerance of regular diet was 3.3 +/- 1.1 days. The mean time to stoma function was 1.6 days +/- 0.52 days, and that for postoperative opioid use was 3.3 +/- 1.4 days. Median length of stay was 4 days (range, 3-9 days). There was one postoperative complication. Technical adaptations that included extracorporeal mesenteric division, rectal eversion, and rotation of the GelPOINT device served to improve the ease and efficiency of the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Single-site TPC-IPAA is both feasible and safe. Incorporation of adapted technical maneuvers can increase efficiency.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Scottish Government's ambition is to ensure that health services are co-designed with the communities they serve. Crohn's and Colitis UK and the Scottish Government acknowledged the need to review and update the current IBD care model. An online survey was conducted asking IBD patients about their experiences of the NHS care they receive. This survey was the first step of co-designing and developing a national strategy for IBD service improvement in Scotland. AIM: To explore IBD patients' experiences of current services and make recommendations for future service development. METHODS: This study was part of a wider cross-sectional on-line survey. Participants were patients with IBD across Scotland. 777 people with IBD took part in the survey. Thematic analysis of all data was conducted independently by two researchers. RESULTS: Three key themes emerged: Quality of life: Participants highlighted the impact the disease has on quality of life and the desperate need for IBD services to address this more holistically. IBD clinicians and access: Participants recognised the need for more IBD nurses and gastroenterologists along with better access to them. Those with a named IBD nurse reported to be more satisfied with their care. An explicit IBD care pathway: Patients with IBD identified the need of making the IBD care pathway more explicit to service users. CONCLUSIONS: Participants expressed the need for a more holistic approach to their IBD care. This includes integrating psychological, counselling and dietetic services into IBD care with better access to IBD clinicians and a more explicit IBD care pathway.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases are thought to develop as a result of dysregulation of the relationship that exists between the gut microbiota, host genetics and the immune system. The advent of culture-independent techniques has revolutionised the ability to characterise the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease based on the microbiota's genetic make-up. Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterised by dysbiosis which is an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory bacteria and a reduction in bacterial diversity. Emerging data suggest that it is not only the presence of the gut microbiota but the functional activity of the microbiota that appears to play an important role in health and disease. Current strategies to manipulate therapeutically the gut microbiota using dietary modification, prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation aim to restore the balance to a state of normobiosis. However, the ability of such strategies to correct dysbiosis and thereby achieve therapeutic benefit is yet to be fully characterised.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is considered the procedure of choice in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) refractory to medical therapy. The incidence of pouchitis is 40% at 5 years. Ten to 15% of patients with pouchitis experience chronic pouchitis. AIM: To determine the efficacy of medical therapies for the treatment of chronic refractory pouchitis in patients undergoing IPAA for UC. METHODS: A systematic computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic database MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed between 1966 and February 2016. All original studies reporting remission rates following medical treatment for chronic pouchitis were included. All study designs were considered. Remission was defined according to the individual study. Remission endpoints ranged from 15 days to 10 weeks. Chronic pouchitis was defined by each study. RESULTS: Twenty-one papers were considered eligible. Results from all studies combined suggested that overall remission was obtained in 59% of patients (95% CI: 44-73%). Antibiotics significantly induced remission in patients with chronic pouchitis with 74% remission rate (95% CI:56-93%), (P < 0.001). Biologics significantly induced remission in patients with chronic pouchitis with 53% remission rate (95% CI:30-76%), (P < 0.001). Steroids, bismuth, elemental diet and tacrolimus all can induce remission but failed to achieve significance. Faecal microbiota transplantation in a single study was not found to achieve remission. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of chronic refractory pouchitis remains difficult and is largely empirical. Larger randomised controlled trials will help aid the management of chronic pouchitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several cases of chronic infection by hepatitis E virus (HEV) in immunocompromised patients have been described recently. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are frequently immunocompromised because of the disease itself or due to therapy. Our aims were to determine HEV seroprevalence in patients with IBD and to detect possible chronic forms. METHODS: We prospectively selected a random sample of 87 patients from our local IBD clinic database at the Gastroenterology Service, Hospital Ramon y Cajal, in Madrid, Spain. Patients completed an oral epidemiologic interview. Anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies and HEV-RNA were determined. Medical records were reviewed, focusing on drug exposure. RESULTS: We included 87 patients, with a mean age of 44.7 years (SD 16) and a mean of 10.4 years (SD 8.4) with IBD. Fifty-seven percent were diagnosed with Crohn's disease, 41.4% with ulcerative colitis and 1.1% with unclassified IBD. A total of 41.4% had received systemic glucocorticoids for more than 3 months, 32.2% had been treated with thiopurines, 16.1% with biological drugs, and 3.4% with methotrexate. Anti HEV-IgM was determined in 75 patients and IgG in 80, and were positive in 2.7% and 1.3%, respectively. HEV-RNA was analyzed in a random subset of 46 patients, and all determinations were negative. Therefore, no case of chronic HEV infection was detected. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low HEV seroprevalence of just 1.14% in patients with IBD, similar to that in the general population. This could be due to the lower degree of immunosuppression in this group, or to different dietary habits.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and unclassified IBD, continues to cause significant morbidity. While its incidence is increasing, no clear etiology and no cure have yet been discovered. Recent findings suggest that IBD may have a multifactorial etiology, where complex interactions between genetics, epigenetics, environmental factors (including diet but also infections, antibiotics, and sanitation), and host immune system lead to abnormal immune responses and chronic inflammation. Over the past years, the role of altered gut microbiota (in both composition and function) in IBD pathogenesis has emerged as an outstanding area of interest. According to new findings, gut dysbiosis may appear as a key element in initiation of inflammation in IBD and its complications. Moreover, complex metagenomic studies provide possibilities to distinguish between IBD types and appreciate severity and prognosis of the disease, as well as response to therapy. This review provides an updated knowledge of recent findings linking altered bacterial composition and functions, viruses, and fungi to IBD pathogenesis. It also highlights the complex genetic, epigenetic, immune, and microbial interactions in relation to environmental factors (including diet). We overview the actual options to manipulate the altered microbiota, such as modified diet, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal transplantation. Future possible therapies are also included. Targeting altered microbiota could be the next therapeutic personalized approach, but more research and well-designed comparative prospective studies are required to formulate adequate directions for prevention and therapy.},

It has been proposed that Vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial role in IBD. AIM: To characterize the effects of Vitamin D on cathelicidin (hCAP/LL37) gene expression, ESR, and serum hs-CRP levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety UC patients on remission were randomized to receive 300,000 IU intramuscular Vitamin D or 1 mL normal saline as placebo, respectively. Before and 90 days after intervention, serum levels of 25 (OH)-Vitamin D3, PTH, Calcium, ESR, and hs-CRP were measured. Cathelicidin gene expression was also quantified using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Baseline serum 25-OH-Vitamin D3 levels were not different between the two groups and after intervention, increased only in Vitamin D group (P < 0.001). Hs-CRP levels were lower in Vitamin D group after intervention (Before: 3.43 +/- 3.47 vs 3.86 +/- 3.55 mg/L, P = 0.56; after: 2.31 +/- 2.25 vs 3.90 +/- 3.97 mg/L, P= 0.023). ESR decreased significantly in Vitamin D group (Before: 12.4 +/- 6.1 vs 12.1 +/- 5.3 mm/h, P= 0.77; after: 6.7 +/- 4.5 vs 11.4 +/- 5.5 mm/h, P< 0.001). The mean fold change in hCAP18 gene expression in Vitamin D group was significantly higher than placebo group. (Mean +/- SD: 3.13 +/- 2.56 vs 1.09 +/- 0.56; median +/- interquartile range: 2.17 +/- 3.81 vs 0.87 +/- 0.53, P< 0.001). CONCLUSION: Decreases in ESR and hs-CRP levels and increase in LL37 gene expression support the hypothesis that Vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial role in UC patients.},

   abstract = {This study investigated the preventive effects of vinegar and acetic acid (the active component of vinegar) on ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. Vinegar (5% v/v) or acetic acid (0.3% w/v) treatment significantly reduced the disease activity index and histopathological scores, attenuated body weight loss, and shortened the colon length in a murine experimental colitis model induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Further mechanistic analysis showed that vinegar inhibited inflammation through suppressing Th1 and Th17 responses, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and MAPK signaling activation. Vinegar also inhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis in the colitis mouse model. Surprisingly, pretreatment with vinegar for 28 days before DSS induction increased levels of the commensal lactic acid-producing or acetic acid-producing bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacteria, and Enterococcus faecalis, whereas decreased Escherichia coli levels were found in the feces of mice. These results suggest that vinegar supplementation might provide a new dietary strategy for the prevention of UC.},

The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of stoss therapy on vitamin D levels during a period of 6 months in children with IBD and vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/L). METHODS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken, focusing upon children managed in the IBD clinic at Sydney Children's Hospital between 2006 and 2010. Those with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level <50 nmol/L and those who received stoss therapy were included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 76 children received stoss therapy. There was a significant and sustained increase in 25-OHD levels at all of the time points compared with baseline (40.8 +/- 7.5 nmol/L), 1 month (145.6 +/- 51.8 nmol/L), 3 months (87.1 +/- 28.4 nmol/L), and 6 months 69.2 +/- 31.3 nmol/L). There were no significant changes in serum calcium, phosphate, or parathyroid hormone at any time points. CONCLUSIONS: Stoss therapy safely and effectively achieved and maintained a level of 25-OHD >50 nmol/L during 6 months in these children with IBD. Further prospective studies are now required to confirm this finding and establish whether this intervention has other benefits.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Colitis is a serious health problem, and chronic obesity is associated with the progression of colitis. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of natural raw meal (NRM) on high-fat diet (HFD, 45%) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 2% w/v)-induced colitis in C57BL/6J mice. MATERIALS/METHODS: Body weight, colon length, and colon weight-to-length ratio, were measured directly. Serum levels of obesity-related biomarkers, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), insulin, leptin, and adiponectin were determined using commercial kits. Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 were detected using a commercial ELISA kit. Histological study was performed using a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining assay. Colonic mRNA expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were determined by RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: Body weight and obesity-related biomarkers (TG, TC, LDL, HDL, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin) were regulated and obesity was prevented in NRM treated mice. NRM significantly suppressed colon shortening and reduced colon weight-to-length ratio in HFD+DSS induced colitis in C57BL/6J mice (P < 0.05). Histological observations suggested that NRM reduced edema, mucosal damage, and the loss of crypts induced by HFD and DSS. In addition, NRM decreased the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 and inhibited the mRNA expressions of these cytokines, and iNOS and COX-2 in colon mucosa (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that NRM has an anti-inflammatory effect against HFD and DSS-induced colitis in mice, and that these effects are due to the amelioration of HFD and/or DSS-induced inflammatory reactions.},

In this case-control study conducted in Iran, we examined the ability of the dietary inflammatory index (DII) to predict UC. This study included 62 UC cases and 124 controls hospitalized for acute non-neoplastic diseases. The DII was computed based on dietary intake assessed by a previously validated food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and the DII was analyzed as both continuous and as tertiles. Energy was adjusted using the residual method. Subjects with higher DII scores (i.e., with a more pro-inflammatory diet) had a higher risk of UC, with the DII being used as both a continuous variable (OR(continuous) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-2.32; one unit increase corresponding to approximately 8% of its range in the current study) and as tertiles (OR(tertile3vstertile1) 2.58, 95% CI 1.03-6.48, P(trend)| = |0.04). These results indicate that a pro-inflammatory diet is associated with increased risk of UC.},

   abstract = {The healthy human intestine is colonized by as many as 1014 bacteria belonging to more than 500 different species forming a microbial ecosystem of unsurpassed diversity, termed the microbiota. The microbiota's various bacterial members engage in a physiological network of cooperation and competition within several layers of complexity. Within the last 10 years, technological progress in the field of next-generation sequencing technologies has tremendously advanced our understanding of the wide variety of physiological and pathological processes that are influenced by the commensal microbiota (1, 2). An increasing number of human disease conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), type 2 diabetes, obesity, allergies and colorectal cancer are linked with altered microbiota composition (3). Moreover, a clearer picture is emerging of the composition of the human microbiota in healthy individuals, its variability over time and between different persons and how the microbiota is shaped by environmental factors (i.e., diet) and the host's genetic background (4). A general feature of a normal, healthy gut microbiota can generate conditions in the gut that disfavor colonization of enteric pathogens. This is termed colonization-resistance (CR). Upon disturbance of the microbiota, CR can be transiently disrupted, and pathogens can gain the opportunity to grow to high levels. This disruption can be caused by exposure to antibiotics (5, 6), changes in diet (7, 8), application of probiotics and drugs (9), and a variety of diseases (3). Breakdown of CR can boost colonization by intrinsic pathogens or increase susceptibility to infections (10). One consequence of pathogen expansion is the triggering of inflammatory host responses and pathogen-mediated disease. Interestingly, human enteric pathogens are part of a small group of bacterial families that belong to the Proteobacteria: the Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, Yersinia spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp.), the Vibrionaceae (Vibrio cholerae) and the Campylobacteriaceae (Campylobacter spp.). In general, members of these families (be it commensals or pathogens) only constitute a minority of the intestinal microbiota. However, proteobacterial "blooms" are a characteristic trait of an abnormal microbiota such as in the course of antibiotic therapy, dietary changes or inflammation (11). It has become clear that the gut microbiota not only plays a major role in priming and regulating mucosal and systemic immunity, but that the immune system also contributes to host control over microbiota composition. These two ways of mutual communication between the microbiota and the immune system were coined as "outside-in" and "inside-out," respectively (12). The significance of those interactions for human health is particularly evident in Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). The symptoms of these recurrent, chronic types of gut inflammation are caused by an excessive immune response against one's own commensal microbiota (13). It is assumed that deregulated immune responses can be caused by a genetic predisposition, leading to, for example, the impairment of intestinal barrier function or disruption of mucosal T-cell homeostasis. In CD or UC patients, an abnormally composed microbiota, referred to as "dysbiosis," is commonly observed (discussed later). This is often characterized by an increased relative abundance of facultative anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaeceae, Bacilli) and, at the same time, depletion of obligate anaerobic bacteria of the classes Bacteroidia and Clostridia. So far, it is unclear whether dysbiosis is a cause or a consequence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In fact, both scenarios are equally conceivable. Recent work suggests that inflammatory immune responses in the gut (both IBD and pathogen-induced) can alter the gut luminal milieu in a way that favors dysbiosis (14). In this chapter, I present a survey on our current state of understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms underlying gut inflammation-associated dysbiosis. The role of dysbiosis in enteric infections and human IBD is discussed. In addition, I will focus on competition of enteric pathogens and the gut microbiota in the inflamed gut and the role of dysbiotic microbiota alterations (e.g., "Enterobacterial blooms" (11)) for the evolution of pathogenicity.},

   abstract = {Colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) is a pathological condition defined by the development of colon cancer in patients afflicted by Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC), two idiopathic diseases of the gut which together comprise the disease group called inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). When IBD involves the colon, affected patients face an increased risk of developing colon cancer compared to the general population. The phenomenon of CAC represents one of the most convincing forms of evidence linking the processes of inflammation, oxidative stress and carcinogenesis. A greater understanding of the molecular events driving CAC could reveal new strategies to treat IBD and reduce the incidence of CAC. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid produced through degradation of endogenous and dietary mammalian sphingolipids containing the long chain base sphingosine. S1P signals through a family of five G protein-coupled receptors. In addition, it activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), two transcriptional regulators that serve as master switches in inflammation and carcinogenesis. Through these and other mechanisms, a causal role for S1P in inflammatory conditions including colitis and CAC has been implicated. In contrast to S1P, dietary sphingolipids called sphingadienes derived from plant food sources cannot be converted to S1P and exhibit anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive activities, reducing colitis and CAC in mouse models. In this review, we summarize recent findings implicating S1P signaling and metabolism in the pathogenesis of IBD and CAC. The potential role of oxidative stress in modulating S1P is also discussed. Further, we propose the hypothesis that dietary sphingolipids may promote or prevent CAC depending on their ability to be converted to S1P.},

BACKGROUND: IBD is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory intestinal disorder associated with fecal dysbiosis. Diet is a potential therapeutic option for IBD based on the hypothesis that changing the fecal dysbiosis could decrease intestinal inflammation. STUDY: Pediatric patients with mild to moderate IBD defined by pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI 10-45) or pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index (PUCAI 10-65) were enrolled into a prospective study of the SCD. Patients started SCD with follow-up evaluations at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. PCDAI/PUCAI, laboratory studies were assessed. RESULTS: Twelve patients, ages 10 to 17 years, were enrolled. Mean PCDAI decreased from 28.1+/-8.8 to 4.6+/-10.3 at 12 weeks. Mean PUCAI decreased from 28.3+/-23.1 to 6.7+/-11.6 at 12 weeks. Dietary therapy was ineffective for 2 patients while 2 individuals were unable to maintain the diet. Mean C-reactive protein decreased from 24.1+/-22.3 to 7.1+/-0.4 mg/L at 12 weeks in Seattle Cohort (nL<8.0 mg/L) and decreased from 20.7+/-10.9 to 4.8+/-4.5 mg/L at 12 weeks in Atlanta Cohort (nL<4.9 mg/L). Stool microbiome analysis showed a distinctive dysbiosis for each individual in most prediet microbiomes with significant changes in microbial composition after dietary change. CONCLUSIONS: SCD therapy in IBD is associated with clinical and laboratory improvements as well as concomitant changes in the fecal microbiome. Further prospective studies are required to fully assess the safety and efficacy of dietary therapy in patients with IBD.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

AIM: To evaluate the perspective of IBD patients using the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted using REDCap, a Web-based survey tool. Survey links were sent to known Web sites as well as support groups in an attempt to characterize patient utilization of the SCD and perception of efficacy of the SCD. RESULTS: There were 417 respondents of the online survey on the SCD with IBD. Mean age for individuals on the SCD was 34.9 +/- 16.4 years. Seventy percent were female. Forty-seven percent had Crohn's disease, 43 % had ulcerative colitis, and 10 % had indeterminate colitis. Individuals perceived clinical improvement on the SCD. Four percent reported clinical remission prior to the SCD, while 33 % reported remission at 2 months after initiation of the SCD, and 42 % at both 6 and 12 months. For those reporting clinical remission, 13 % reported time to achieve remission of less than 2 weeks, 17 % reported 2 weeks to a month, 36 % reported 1-3 months, and 34 % reported greater than 3 months. For individuals who reported reaching remission, 47 % of individuals reported associated improvement in abnormal laboratory values. CONCLUSIONS: The SCD is utilized by many patients as a primary and adjunct therapy for IBD. Most patients perceive clinical benefit to use of the SCD.},

   abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to examine the lived experiences of women with inflammatory bowel disease, by specifically exploring their management of their illness after diagnosis. BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic autoimmune disease that has no known cause or cure. It is composed of two types of conditions: Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis which have similar signs and symptoms, but have distinct physiological properties. Currently, Canada has the highest reported prevalence and incidence rates of inflammatory bowel disease in the world (Molodecky et al. 2012). Despite these increasing rates, there is a lack of knowledge and understanding of the burdens associated with inflammatory bowel disease, in particular from the participant's perspective. DESIGN & METHODS: Heuristic phenomenology was the theoretical orientation used for this study. Eight women (aged 30-50 years) with inflammatory bowel disease who resided in Southern Ontario were recruited. Each participant completed background questionnaires and a one-on-one semi-structured interview. RESULTS: Several salient themes were identified; however, this paper will solely focus on one theme, balancing my disease. To achieve balance, the women described changing dietary behaviours, adjusting daily routines and managing symptoms through medications. These modifications were described as being important in controlling inflammatory bowel disease symptomatology on a day-to-day basis. CONCLUSION: There are many triggers for inflammatory bowel disease symptomatology. As such, the means in which those with inflammatory bowel disease manage their conditions varies. Participants discussed using a combination of strategies to control their condition. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This information is important for patients living with inflammatory bowel disease, their support people, and healthcare professionals to identify various key strategies to improve the quality of life and well-being of those affected by inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, this research provided a voice to women diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease by allowing them to openly convey their experiences of living with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Geographic patterns with diminishing rates from north to south toward the equator have been described for a number of diseases, putatively related largely to "western" lifestyle. Among these the inflammatory bowel diseases; Crohn's (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) have been prominent in sharing distributions with a number of autoimmune diseases. One of the interesting associations is the epidemiologic similarity with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, in addition, at least some of these diseases also correlated inversely with lactase non persistent population (LNP) distributions. It is hypothesized that MS should also have an inverse relationship with LNP. We provide support for this by comparing published MS, CD, UC and LNP national rates to the beginning of the new millennium. Possible links among these diseases may be an evolutionary signature of new genes which may have accompanied emergence of lactase persistence millennia ago. The emergent phenotypic dichotomy also forced different assimilation responses to lactose digestion. While intestinal retention of lactase results in direct host enzymatic digestion, in LNP persons intestinal bacterial metabolism of lactose impacts on the host micro-flora. These microbial changes may play some role in altering rates of diseases including IBD and MS. However, since the late 20th century previously observed patterns are changing. Although industrialization is considered to play an important modifying role, the rising rates of obesity with an emphasis on diet, and microfloral pathogenesis, but with an independent geographic pattern may also facilitate altering rates and geographic distributions of both of these and other diseases.},

   abstract = {The study objective was to investigate the nature and perceived effectiveness of strategies that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) use in response to worsening symptoms. Questionnaires to investigate the use and perceived effectiveness of 11 types of strategies for coping with possible flare-ups were mailed to 1,641 members of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Japan. The responses were analyzed separately by disease type: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). A total of 400 questionnaires were analyzed from 260 UC and 140 CD patients. The strategies used most by both patient groups were "change contents of meals" and "get more sleep." In addition, "skip some meals" was commonly used by CD patients. The most effective strategies were "use extra topical corticosteroids" (30 of the 56 subjects, 53.6%) among UC patients, and "skip some meals" (70 of the 114 subjects, 61.4%), and "take/add to the elemental diet" (53 of 89 subjects, 59.6%) among CD patients. The coping strategies used most by patients with IBD involved lifestyle modifications. However, the additional use of medications was regarded as the most effective, despite the small number of patients who used this strategy. Additional use of topical medications for UC patients and diet modifications for CD patients should be emphasized in self-management education for patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with weight loss, growth restriction and malnutrition. Bone mass deficits are well described, little is known about other body composition compartments. AIMS: To define the alterations in non-bone tissue compartments in children with IBD, and explore the effects of demographic and disease parameters. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in the PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and Web of Science databases in May 2014 (limitations age <17 years, and composition measurements compared with a defined control population). RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in this systematic review, reporting on a total of 1479 children with IBD [1123 Crohn's disease, 243 ulcerative colitis], pooled mean age 13.1 +/- 3.2 years, and 34.9% female. Data were highly heterogeneous, in terms of methodology and patients. Deficits in protein-related compartments were reported. Lean mass deficits were documented in 93.6% of Crohn's disease and 47.7% of ulcerative colitis patients when compared with healthy control populations. Lower lean mass was common to both sexes in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, deficits in females with persisted for longer. Fat-related compartment findings were inconsistent, some studies report reductions in body fat in new diagnosis/active Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that almost all children with Crohn's disease and half with ulcerative colitis have reduced lean mass, however, body fat alterations are not well defined. To understand what impact this may have on health and disease in children with IBD, further studies are needed to identify in which tissues these deficits lie, and to quantify body fat and its distribution.},

Two presentations explored different aspects of probiotic intervention: the small intestine as a probiotic target and inclusion of probiotics into integrative approaches to gastroenterology. Probiotic recommendations in gastroenterology guidelines and current data on probiotic efficacy in paediatric patients were reviewed. Updates were given on probiotic and gut microbiota research in obesity and obesity-related diseases, the gut-brain axis and development of psychobiotics, and the protective effects of equol-producing strains for prostate cancer. Recent studies were presented on probiotic benefit for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and people with HIV, as well as protection against the adverse effects of a short-term high-fat diet. Aspects of probiotic mechanisms of activity were discussed, including immunomodulatory mechanisms and metabolite effects, the anti-inflammatory properties of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the relationship between periodontitis, microbial production of butyrate in the oral cavity and ageing, and the pathogenic mechanisms of Campylobacter. Finally, an insight was given on a recent expert meeting, which re-examined the probiotic definition, advised on the appropriate use and scope of the term and outlined different probiotic categories and the prevalence of different mechanisms of activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microbiota refers to the population of microorganisms (bacteria, viruses and fungi) that inhabit the entire gastrointestinal tract, more particularly the colon whose role is to maintain the integrity of the intestinal mucosa and control the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria. Alteration in the composition of the gut microbiota is called dysbiosis. Dysbiosis redisposes to inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease and indeterminate colitis. METHODS: The purpose of this literature review is to elucidate the influence of diet on the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota in the healthy gut and the role of diet in the development of dysbiosis. CONCLUSION: The "Western diet", in particular a low - fiber high fat/high carbohydrate diet is one factor that can lead to severe dysbiosis. In contrast, "mediterranean" and vegetarian diets that includes abundant fruits, vegetables, olive oil and oily fish are known for their anti-inflammatory effects and could prevent dysbiosis and subsequent inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orally administered iron can induce colonic inflammation in healthy animals and aggravate experimental colitis. AIM: To investigate the influence of the biologic agents infliximab and adalimumab on the severity of TNBS colitis following orally supplemented iron. MATERIALS-METHODS: 204 Wistar rats were allocated into 14 groups. Colitis was induced by TNBS. Iron was administered via a mouth catheter at a dose of 0.027, 0.3, and 3%/kg diet per day, respectively. Infliximab was subcutaneously administered on the 2nd and 6th day in a dose of 5 mg/kgBW, while adalimumab was administered on the 2nd day in a dose of 2 mg/kgBW. On the 8th day, all animals were euthanatized. Activity of colitis and extent of tissue damage were assessed histologically. Tissue Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (t-TNF-alpha) and malondialdehyde (t-MDA) were estimated. RESULTS: In normal rats both agents significantly worsen the degree of inflammation induced by moderate or high iron supplementation despite the disappearance of t-TNF-alpha, and reduction of t-MDA. In the groups of TNBS colitis and moderate or high iron administration, both agents again significantly worsen the degree of inflammation despite the significant reduction in the t-TNF-alpha and t-MDA. CONCLUSION: Adalimumab and infliximab do not ameliorate the inflammation in TNBS-induced colitis aggravated by orally administered iron. These findings might be clinically relevant in patients with active IBD under concurrent treatment with biologic agents and per oral iron.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis; Crohn's disease) are debilitating relapsing inflammatory disorders affecting the gastrointestinal tract, with deleterious effect on quality of life, and increasing incidence and prevalence. Mucosal inflammation, due to altered microbiota, increased intestinal permeability and immune system dysfunction underlies the symptoms and may be caused in susceptible individuals by different factors (or a combination of them), including dietary habits and components. In this review we describe the influence of the Western diet, obesity, and different nutraceuticals/functional foods (bioactive peptides, phytochemicals, omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, probiotics and prebiotics) on the course of IBD, and provide some hints that could be useful for nutritional guidance. Hopefully, research will soon offer enough reliable data to slow down the spread of the disease and to make diet a cornerstone in IBD therapy.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are multifactorial, relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. However, the etiology is still poorly understood but involves altered immune responses, epithelial dysfunction, environmental factors, and nutrition. Recently, we have shown that the diet supplement corabion has cardioprotective effects due to reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation. Since oxidative stress and inflammation are also prominent risk factors in IBD, we speculated that corabion also has beneficial effects on experimental colitis. Colitis was induced in male mice by administration of 3.5% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for a period of 3 or 7 days with or without daily gavage feeding of corabion consisting of vitamin C, vitamin E, L-arginine, and eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid. We found that corabion administration attenuated DSS-induced colon shortening, tissue damage, and disease activity index during the onset of colitis. Mechanistically, these effects could be explained by reduced neutrophil recruitment, oxidative stress, production of proinflammatory cytokines, and internalization of the junctional proteins ZO-1 and E-cadherin leading to less edema formation. Thus, corabion may be a useful diet supplement for the management of chronic inflammatory intestinal disorders such as IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIM: Dietary carbohydrate and protein intake is generally thought as risk factors for onset of ulcerative colitis (UC), while epidemiological data had been controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the role of carbohydrate and protein intake in the development of UC. METHODS: Comprehensive search in PubMed and Embase was conducted to identify all relevant studies, and the role of carbohydrate and protein intake in the development of UC was quantitatively assessed by dose-response meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine studies (5 case-control and 4 prospective cohort) were identified with a total of 975 UC cases and 239352 controls. The summary relative risks (RR) for per 10 g increment/day were 1.005 (95%CI: 0.991-1.019, I2 = 31.5%, n = 5) for total carbohydrate intake, 1.001 (95%CI: 0.971-1.032, I2 = 0.0%, n = 7) for the subtype of fiber intake, 1.029 (95%CI: 0.962-1.101, I2 = 68.9%, n = 2) for the subtype of sugar intake, and 1.010 (95%CI: 0.975-1.047, I2 = 12.4%, n = 7) for total protein intake. Among sugar subtypes, only sucrose intake was found positively related with UC risk (RR for per 10 g increment/day: 1.098, 95%CI: 1.024-1.177, I2 = 0.0%, n = 3). No evidence of a non-linear dose-response association was found between the nutrient intake and UC risk, except for the subtype of sucrose (P for non-linear trend = 0.032). Subgroup analyses showed consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggested a lack of association between dietary carbohydrate or protein intake and the risk of UC, except for the subtype of sucrose which played a significant role in the development of UC. Large-scale prospective designed studies are needed to confirm our findings.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are chronic, life-long, and relapsing diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Currently, there are no complete cure possibilities, but combined pharmacological and nutritional therapy may induce remission of the disease. Malnutrition and specific nutritional deficiencies are frequent among IBD patients, so the majority of them need nutritional treatment, which not only improves the state of nutrition of the patients but has strong anti-inflammatory activity as well. Moreover, some nutrients, from early stages of life are suspected as triggering factors in the etiopathogenesis of IBD. Both parenteral and enteral nutrition is used in IBD therapy, but their practical utility in different populations and in different countries is not clearly established, and there are sometimes conflicting theories concerning the role of nutrition in IBD. This review presents the actual data from research studies on the influence of nutrition on the etiopathogenesis of IBD and the latest findings regarding its mechanisms of action. The use of both parenteral and enteral nutrition as therapeutic methods in induction and maintenance therapy in IBD treatment is also extensively discussed. Comparison of the latest research data, scientific theories concerning the role of nutrition in IBD, and different opinions about them are also presented and discussed. Additionally, some potential future perspectives for nutritional therapy are highlighted.},

   abstract = {The biogenic amine serotonin (5-HT) is a multi-faceted hormone that is synthesized from dietary tryptophan with the rate limiting step being catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). The therapeutic potential of peripheral 5-HT synthesis inhibitors has been demonstrated in a number of clinical and pre-clinical studies in diseases including carcinoid syndrome, lung fibrosis, ulcerative colitis and obesity. Due to the long half-life of 5-HT in blood and lung, changes in steady-state levels are slow to manifest themselves. Here, the administration of stable isotope labeled tryptophan (heavy "h-Trp") and resultant in vivo conversion to h-5-HT is used to monitor 5-HT synthesis in rats. Dose responses for the blockade of h-5-HT appearance in blood with the TPH inhibitors L-para-chlorophenylalanine (30 and 100 mg/kg) and telotristat etiprate (6, 20 and 60 mg/kg), demonstrated that the method enables robust quantification of pharmacodynamic effects on a short time-scale, opening the possibility for rapid screening of TPH1 inhibitors in vivo. In the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis rat model, the mechanism of lung 5-HT increase was investigated using a combination of synthesis and steady state 5-HT measurement. Elevated 5-HT synthesis measured in the injured lungs was an early predictor of disease induced increases in total 5-HT.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammation is strongly associated with approximately one-fifth of all human cancers. Arising from combinations of factors such as environmental exposures, diet, inherited gene polymorphisms, infections, or from dysfunctions of the immune response, chronic inflammation begins as an attempt of the body to remove injurious stimuli; however, over time, this results in continuous tissue destruction and promotion and maintenance of carcinogenesis. Here, we focus on intestinal inflammation and its associated cancers, a group of diseases on the rise and affecting millions of people worldwide. Intestinal inflammation can be widely grouped into inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and celiac disease. Long-standing intestinal inflammation is associated with colorectal cancer and small-bowel adenocarcinoma, as well as extraintestinal manifestations, including lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. This article highlights potential mechanisms of pathogenesis in inflammatory bowel diseases and celiac disease, as well as those involved in the progression to associated cancers, most of which have been identified from studies utilizing mouse models of intestinal inflammation. Mouse models of intestinal inflammation can be widely grouped into chemically induced models; genetic models, which make up the bulk of the studied models; adoptive transfer models; and spontaneous models. Studies in these models have lead to the understanding that persistent antigen exposure in the intestinal lumen, in combination with loss of epithelial barrier function, and dysfunction and dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Transcriptional changes in this environment leading to cell survival, hyperplasia, promotion of angiogenesis, persistent DNA damage, or insufficient repair of DNA damage due to an excess of proinflammatory mediators are then thought to lead to sustained malignant transformation. With regard to extraintestinal manifestations such as lymphoma, however, more suitable models are required to further investigate the complex and heterogeneous mechanisms that may be at play.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with increased dietary intake of fat and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Modification of fat metabolism may alter inflammation and disease severity. Our aim was to assess differences in dietary and serum fatty acid levels between control and UC subjects and associations with disease activity and inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: Dietary histories, serum, and colonic tissue samples were prospectively collected from 137 UC subjects and 38 controls. Both histologic injury and the Mayo Disease Activity Index were assessed. Serum and tissue cytokines were measured by Luminex assay. Serum fatty acids were obtained by gas chromatography. RESULTS: UC subjects had increased total fat and oleic acid (OA) intake, but decreased arachidonic acid (AA) intake vs controls. In serum, there was less percent saturated fatty acid (SFA) and AA, with higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), linoleic acid, OA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) in UC. Tissue cytokine levels were directly correlated with SFA and inversely correlated with PUFA, EPA, and DPA in UC subjects, but not controls. 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy blunted these associations. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we found differences in serum fatty acids in UC subjects that correlated with pro-inflammatory tissue cytokines. We propose that fatty acids may affect cytokine production and thus be immunomodulatory in UC.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), 2 conditions characterized by chronic inflammation. Approximately 1.17 million people in the United States are affected by these 2 conditions. It is theorized that a genetic susceptibility coupled with environmental factors, such as smoking, antibiotics, oral contraceptives, appendectomy, or diet, may influence the development of IBD. Patients with UC and CD may exhibit similar symptoms, and the conditions are often misclassified, as there is a lack of standard criteria for diagnosing IBD. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to rule out any diarrhea-related conditions for an accurate diagnosis. UC and CD typically manifest in early adulthood, and the chronic nature of these conditions greatly impacts a patient's perception, body image, and quality of life. The inability to participate in social activities due to UC and CD impacts not only patients, but also those with whom they have close relationships.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome is recognized for potential clinical relevance in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Data suggest that there is a disease-dependent loss of microbial diversity in IBD. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is generated by GI anaerobes through the digestion of dietary phosphatidylcholine and carnitine in a microbial-mammalian co-metabolic pathway. IBD-related changes in the gut microbiome may result in disease-specific changes in TMAO plasma concentrations. AIM: To determine whether TMAO plasma levels in IBD are altered compared to controls and whether they correlate with disease presence or activity. METHODS: Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure TMAO, choline, and carnitine plasma levels in 479 subjects (373 non-IBD controls, 106 IBD). Subjects were also genotyped for the flavin monooxygenase (FMO)3 variants, E158K and E308G. RESULTS: Plasma TMAO levels were 2.27 microM lower in the IBD population compared to the control population (p = 0.0001). Lower TMAO levels were similarly seen in active ulcerative colitis (UC) (1.56 microM) versus inactive disease (3.40 microM) (p = 0.002). No difference was seen in active Crohn's disease (CD) versus inactive CD. No intergroup variation existed in plasma TMAO levels based on FMO3 genotype. Choline levels were higher in IBD, while carnitine levels were similar between the two groups, suggesting that lower TMAO levels in IBD were not due to dietary differences. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased TMAO levels are seen in IBD compared to a non-IBD population. These data suggest that TMAO may have potential as a biomarker to support IBD diagnosis as well as to assess disease activity in UC.},

   abstract = {Intestinal dysbiosis is thought to be an important cause of disease progression and the gastrointestinal symptoms experienced in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Inflammation appears to be a major contributor in perpetuating a dysregulated gut microbiota. Although current drug therapies can significantly induce and maintain disease remission, there is no cure for these diseases. Nevertheless, ongoing human studies investigating dietary fibre interventions may potentially prove to exert beneficial outcomes for IBD. Postulated mechanisms include direct interactions with the gut mucosa through immunomodulation, or indirectly through the microbiome. Component species of the microbiome may degrade dietary-fibre polysaccharides and ferment the products to form short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate. Prebiotic dietary fibres may also act more directly by altering the composition of the microbiome. Longer term benefits in reducing the risk of more aggressive disease or colorectal cancer may require other dietary fibre sources such as wheat bran or psyllium. By critically examining clinical trials that have used dietary fibre supplements or dietary patterns containing specific types or amounts of dietary fibres, it may be possible to assess whether varying the intake of specific dietary fibres may offer an efficient treatment for IBD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Beneficial effects of carbohydrate fermentation on gastrointestinal health are well established. Conversely, protein fermentation generates harmful metabolites but their relevance to gastrointestinal health is poorly understood. AIM: To review the effects of increased protein fermentation on biomarkers of colonic health, factors influencing fermentative activity and potential for dietary modulation to minimise detrimental effects. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Google scholar for clinical and pre-clinical studies using search terms - 'dietary protein', 'fermentation', 'putrefaction', 'phenols', 'sulphide', 'branched-chain fatty acid', 'carbohydrate fermentation', 'gastrointestinal'. RESULTS: High protein, reduced carbohydrate diets alter the colonic microbiome, favouring a potentially pathogenic and pro-inflammatory microbiota profile, decreased short-chain fatty acid production and increased ammonia, phenols and hydrogen sulphide concentrations. These metabolites largely compromise the colonic epithelium structure, causing mucosal inflammation but may also directly modulate the enteric nervous system and intestinal motility. Increased protein fermentation as a result of a high-protein intake can be attenuated by addition of oligosaccharides, resistant starch and nonstarch polysaccharides and a reduction in total protein or specifically, aromatic and sulphur-containing amino acids. These factors may have clinical importance as novel therapeutic approaches to problems, in which protein fermentation may be implicated, such as malodorous flatus, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and prevention of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The direct clinical relevance of excessive protein fermentation in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome, malodorous flatus and ulcerative colitis are underexplored. Manipulating dietary carbohydrate and protein intake have potential therapeutic applications in such settings and warrant further clinical studies.},

METHODS: The genetic polymorphisms of MIF -173G/C and GPX1 594C/T were determined with a polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-endonuclease method in peripheral blood leukocytes derived from 1500 UC cases and 1500 healthy controls. RESULTS: The frequencies of MIF -173CC and GPX1 594TT were 55.60% and 55.73% in the UC cases and 16.67% and 16.47% in the healthy controls, respectively. Statistical tests also showed a significant difference in the frequencies between the two groups (P<0.01; P<0.01, respectively). Individuals carrying MIF -173CC also had a significantly higher risk of UC compared with those with MIF -173GG (OR=6.8662, 95%CI: 4.5384-9.6158). Individuals carrying GPX1 594TT had a high risk of UC (OR=7.0854, 95%CI: 4.4702-10.5283). Combined analysis showed that the percentages of MIF -173CC/GPX1 594TT in the UC and control groups were 31.00% and 2.73%, respectively (P<0.01). Individuals carrying MIF -173CC/GPX1 594TT had a high risk of UC (OR=49.0113, 95%CI: 31.7364-61.8205). The high-fat diet rate of the case group was significantly higher than that of the control group (OR=3.3248, 95%CI: 1.9461-5.0193, P<0.01), and statistic analysis suggested an interaction between high-fat diet and MIF -173CC and GPX1 594TT which increase risk of UC (gamma =6.9293; gamma =6.9942). CONCLUSION: MIF -173CC and GPX1 594TT and high-fat diet are the risk factors for UC, and the significant interactions between genetic polymorphisms of MIF -173G/C, GPX1 594C/T and high-fat diet may increase the risk for UC.},

METHODS: The genetic polymorphisms of COX-2-1195G/A and MnSOD9Ala/Val were analyzed by polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from 750 UC patients (UC group) and 750 healthy subjects (control group). RESULTS: The frequencies of COX-2-1195G/A(A/A) and MnSOD9Ala/Val(V/V) were 49.07% and 50.13% in UC group and 21.20% and 22.40% in control group, respectively (P<0.01). The risk of UC significantly increased in subjects with COX-2-1195G/A(A/A) genotype (OR=3.5808,95%CI=1.8062-5.3478) and in those with MnSOD9Ala/Val(V/V) genotype(OR=3.4828,95%CI=1.9137-5.5496).

A total of 70 BALB/c female mice were randomly allocated into seven equal groups: Group A, blank control; group B, normal saline injection; group C, propylene glycol injection; group D (TL1), 0.2 mg/kg TL; group E (TL2), 0.4 mg/kg TL; group F (TL3), 0.6 mg/kg TL; and group G, dexamethasone injection. Mice activity, diet and stool characteristics were recorded daily. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on day 8, and disease activity indices, colon tissue histological scores and colonic histopathological scores were subsequently calculated. Serum levels of IL-1beta were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and IL-1beta expression levels were examined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction with colonic mucosa specimen at the gene level and western blot analysis at the protein level. The IL-1beta mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly elevated in the normal saline injection and propylene glycol injection groups compared with the blank control group and (P<0.01). In TL (TL2 and TL3)- and dexamethasone-treated mice, IL-1beta expression levels were significantly decreased, as compared with the normal saline and propylene glycol injection groups (P<0.05). No significant difference was detected between TL (TL2 and TL3) and dexamethasone treatments. The results of the present study indicated that IL-1beta expression was upregulated in the UC mouse model, which may be associated with the development and progression of UC. Furthermore, TL inhibited IL-1beta expression, suggesting that TL may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of UC.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most commonly ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients affected with IBD experience symptoms including abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. There is no cure for IBD; thus treatments typically focus on preventing complications, inducing and maintaining remission, and improving quality of life. During IBD, dysregulation of the intestinal immune system leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and recruitment of activated immune cells to the intestine, causing tissue damage and perpetuating the inflammatory response. Recent biological therapies targeting specific inflammatory cytokines or pathways, in particular TNF-alpha, have shown promise, but not all patients respond to treatment, and some individuals become intolerant to treatment over time. Dietary peptides and amino acids (AAs) have been shown to modulate intestinal immune functions and influence inflammatory responses, and may be useful as alternative or ancillary treatments in IBD. This review focuses on dietary interventions for IBD treatment, in particular the role of dietary peptides and AAs in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the gut, as well as recent advances in the cellular mechanisms responsible for their anti-inflammatory activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Butyrate is an energy source for colonocytes that is formed by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber in the colon and that exerts broad anti-inflammatory activities. Although the administration of butyrate improves homeostasis in patients and ameliorates IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease)-related lesions and symptoms, the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of butyrate still remain unclear. To explore the impact of butyrate on Treg (Regulatory T cell)/Th17 (T helper 17 cell) differentiation and colitis in rats. METHODS: The effect of butyrate on the expression of markers related to both Tregs and Th17 cells were determined in human monocytes as well as a rat model of colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Rats were treated with butyrate in vivo, whereas the rat splenocytes and human monocytes were treated in vitro. RESULTS: We found that butyrate administration increased peripheral blood Treg cell levels as well as plasma levels of anti-Th17 cytokines (IL-10 and IL-12). Butyrate administration further suppressed IL-17 levels in both plasma and colonic mucosa, and ameliorated colonic colitis lesions in rats. This promotion of Treg activity and inhibition of IL-17 release was also observed in human venous monocytes and rat splenocytes in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that butyrate plays a key role in regulating the Treg/Th17 balance and ultimately protects the colon mucosa against the development of IBD.},

   abstract = {Zanthoxylum bungeanum, which belongs to the Zanthoxylum genus of the Rutaceae family, is now wildly distributed in most parts of China and some Southeast Asian countries. The pericarp of Zanthoxylum bungeanum has been known to exhibit antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and other important therapeutic activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of Zanthoxylum bungeanum pericarp extract (ZBE) on DSS-induced experimental colitis in mice. The results demonstrated that the major flavonoid composition of ZBE includes rutin (32.36%), quercetin (13.61%) and isoquercitrin (24.89%). ZBE alleviated DSS-induced body weight loss, colon length shortening and colonic pathological damage. Furthermore, ZBE inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 via the regulation of TLR4 and TLR4-related pathways in DSS-induced experimental colitis in mice and LPS-triggered inflammation in J774.1 cells. Our findings suggest that ZBE is effective in ameliorating experimental colitis, and further investigation is necessary on the use of ZBE as a new dietary strategy to lower the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC).},

   abstract = {Emerging evidence shows that dietary agents and phytochemicals contribute to the prevention and treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). We first reported the effects of dietary caffeic acid (CaA) on murine experimental colitis and on fecal microbiota. Colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by administration of 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Mice were fed a control diet or diet with CaA (1 mM). Our results showed that dietary CaA exerted anti-inflammatory effects in DSS colitis mice. Moreover, CaA could significantly suppress the secretion of IL-6, TNFalpha, and IFNgamma and the colonic infiltration of CD3+ T cells, CD177+ neutrophils and F4/80+ macrophages via inhibition of the activation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Analysis of fecal microbiota showed that CaA could restore the reduction of richness and inhibit the increase of the ratio of Firmicute to Bacteroidetes in DSS colitis mice. And CaA could dramatically increase the proportion of the mucin-degrading bacterium Akkermansia in DSS colitis mice. Thus, CaA could ameliorate colonic pathology and inflammation in DSS colitis mice, and it might be associated with a proportional increase in Akkermansia.},
