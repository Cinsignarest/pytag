   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the role of esophagogastroduodenoscopy in the evaluation of children with suspected inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: All children with inflammatory bowel disease who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy during their initial evaluation at our institution during a 7-year period (December 1993 to November 2000) were included in the study. RESULTS: The study included 115 patients: 81 with Crohn disease (mean age, 11.34 years; 42 males) and 34 with ulcerative colitis (mean age, 11.79 years; 20 males). Abnormal findings on esophagogastroduodenoscopy were noted in 64% of patients with Crohn disease and 50% of children with ulcerative colitis; histologic abnormalities were found in 81.6% and 70.6% of the patients, respectively. Granulomas were found in the upper gastrointestinal tracts of 23 of 81 patients (28.4%), with the most common site being the gastric mucosa. Nine of these 23 patients had granulomas solely in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Additional unsuspected pathology noted included: candidiasis, hiatal hernia, Helicobacter pylori infection, and giardiasis. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic and histologic abnormalities were found in the upper gastrointestinal tracts of a significant number of children with inflammatory bowel disease. While the mechanism(s) underlying these abnormalities in patients with ulcerative colitis is unclear, the pathology can contribute to the patient's clinical condition. Pathology in the upper gastrointestinal tract should not exclude a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Granulomas, confirming the diagnosis of Crohn disease, were found in the upper gastrointestinal tracts of 28% of our patients with Crohn disease. In some cases, granulomas were found solely in the upper gastrointestinal tracts. Based on our data, esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy should be performed in all pediatric patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease.},

The syndrome almost always develops during the early stages of refeeding. It can be associated with a severe derangement in electrolyte and fluid balance, and result in significant morbidity and mortality. It is most often reported in adults receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), although refeeding with enteral feeds can also precipitate this syndrome. We report what we believe to be the first case of refeeding syndrome in an adolescent with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease. This developed within a few days of starting exclusive polymeric enteral nutrition. A systematic literature review revealed 27 children who developed refeeding syndrome after oral/enteral feeding. Of these, nine died as a direct result of complications of this syndrome. We discuss the implications of this syndrome on clinical practice and propose evidence-based guidelines for its management.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which patients with Crohn's disease develop intestinal failure and, in particular, to assess the relative importance of severe primary disease, repeated uncomplicated elective small intestine resection, and resection performed as a consequence of intra-abdominal septic surgical complications. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 41 patients with Crohn's disease referred to a specialized intestinal failure unit between January 1987 and September 1998 for permanent home parenteral nutrition. To compare the surgical activity in patient groups, a resection index was calculated by dividing the number of intestinal resections by the interval in years between the first resection for Crohn's disease and referral for management of intestinal failure. RESULTS: Extensive primary Crohn's disease was responsible for intestinal failure in 7 cases (17 percent). The remainder (n = 34, 83 percent) developed intestinal failure after intestinal resection. Nine of the "surgical" Crohn's patients developed intestinal failure after uncomplicated sequential resection, (median small-bowel length 65 (range, 60-120) cm) after a median of 3 (range, 2-8) operations over a median of 17 (range, 3-27) years. By contrast, the other 25 surgical Crohn's patients developed intestinal failure after multiple unplanned laparotomies for intra-abdominal sepsis (median small-bowel length 70 (range, 60-200) cm), with a median of 4 (range, 2-7) laparotomies performed over a median of 0.5 (range, 0.1 to 1.5) years (P < 0.001). The resection index for the 25 Crohn's patients undergoing laparotomies for intra-abdominal sepsis was significantly greater than that of the 9 patients who had planned sequential resections (2.1 (0.27-25) vs. 0.23 (0.1-1.0); P < 0.002, Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSION: Intestinal failure develops in Crohn's disease primarily as a result of complications of surgical treatment. The largest group of patients at risk consists of those who are undergoing multiple unplanned laparotomies to control intra-abdominal sepsis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the value of leukocyte-labeled scintigraphy, ultrasonography, and contrast radiography compared with endoscopy in children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Twenty-eight children (17 boys; mean age, 10.2 years) with IBD based on standard colonoscopic, histologic, and radiologic criteria (16 with Crohn's disease, 5 with ulcerative colitis, 5 with nonspecific colitis, I with granulomatous disease, and I with Beh,cet's disease) were included. Endoscopic, ultrasonographic, and contrast radiologic examinations were realized for 28, 23, and 19 children respectively. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity were 75% and 92% for leukocyte-labeled scintigraphy, 39% and 90% for ultrasonography, and 58% and 83% for contrast radiography. The authors noted discontinuous uptake for 14 of 15 true-positive results for patients with Crohn's disease and continuous uptake for 4 of 4 true-positive results for patients with ulcerative colitis. A negative correlation between scan activity index and Lloyd-Still clinical score was found for 11 patients with Crohn's disease (r = -0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Leukocyte-labeled scintigraphy, a noninvasive and reproducible technique, is a useful tool in the diagnosis and therapeutic strategy of IBD, and provides information on the presence, the intensity, and the extent of the disease, particularly in the terminal ileum. Leukocyte-labeled scintigraphy may not replace colonoscopy with biopsies for diagnosis confirmation. Its reliability seems higher than that of ultrasonography.},

   abstract = {The provision of food is thought to promote the maintenance of gut integrity. Nutrients are able to elicit and affect both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Enteral diet therapy has long been known to be efficacious in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in childhood Crohn's disease. However, the mechanisms of action of these diets are not clear. Nutritional repletion, direct effects on the gut mucosa or decreased intestinal permeability have all been postulated as being important in nutritional therapy. There is some evidence that the enteral diet has a direct effect on the gut mucosa by reducing cytokine production and the accompanying inflammation, thus leading to decreased intestinal permeability. Modifications of enteral diet composition have been evaluated in many studies. Such modifications include fat and/or protein content and the addition of bioactive peptides. The fatty acid composition of the enteral diet seems to have a much greater impact on its efficacy than modification of the N source. As specific fatty acids are precursors of inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid, the reduction in these components may be beneficial in nutritional therapy for IBD. Addition of bioactive peptides to enteral diet formulas may also have a role; such peptides may have specific growth factor or anti-inflammatory actions. There is still much work to be done to define disease-specific enteral diet formulas that are effective as therapies for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Growth failure is common in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and has been attributed chiefly to undernutrition. Liquid enteral feeding can reverse the calorie deficit and increase growth velocity. The inflammatory process per se may also directly inhibit linear growth. After institution of enteral nutrition, significant changes in serum growth factors and inflammatory indices have been observed before any changes in nutritional parameters [Bannerjee et al., Gastroenterology 2000;118:A526]. In rats with trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis, about 60% of the final growth impairment can be attributed to undernutrition, inflammation accounting for the remaining growth deficit. Young patients with Crohn's disease and growth failure have normal stimulated and spontaneous growth hormone (GH) secretion and reduced plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), suggesting a degree of GH resistance. Rats with TNBS colitis also have normal plasma GH and reduced IGF-I concentrations, mediated by a combination of undernutrition and active inflammation. Immunoneutralization of interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases hepatic IGF-I mRNA expression, plasma concentrations of IGF-I and linear growth. In contrast, administration of anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha antibodies (TNF-ab) had no effect on IGF-I in this model. TNFab did, however, increase linear growth, suggesting inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha on the growth axis by mechanisms other than reduction in IGF-I. Preliminary data suggests that TNF-alpha inhibits maturation of growth plate chondrocytes. We have identified IL-6 receptors on growth plate chondrocytes but to date have not identified the effect, if any, of IL-6 directly at the growth plate.},

It is related both to undernutrition and to direct effects of the inflammatory process on the growth axis. Enteral nutrition (elemental, semi-elemental or polymeric diet) employed as the sole source of nutrition remains a mainstay of treatment of active Crohn's disease because it corrects nutritional deficits, has anti-inflammatory effects, heals mucosal inflammation and stimulates growth. Conventional corticosteroids have adverse effects on growth and preliminary data suggest that an ileal-release preparation of budesonide may also suppress linear growth. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its prodrug azathioprine maintain remission in children with Crohn's disease. These treatments thus have the potential to improve growth velocity and final adult height.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Altered appetite and early satiety may promote anorexia associated with Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of disease activity on subjective appetite parameters in Crohn's disease patients. METHODS: Seventeen patients with Crohn's disease and 15 healthy controls (8 M: 7 F, 34 (20-35) years) were studied. Subjects rated their hunger, desire to eat, fullness and level of satiety using visual analogue scales after an overnight fast. Subjects were reassessed after ingestion of 500 and 1000 ml water. Anthropometry was used to determine percentage body fat. Serum leptin & TNF- alpha levels were assessed using immunoassay. Disease activity was determined using the Harvey-Bradshaw index. RESULTS: Hunger ratings for active Crohn's disease patients were significantly lower than controls at baseline (P<0.05). Desire to eat was lower in patients with active Crohn's disease than controls both at baseline (95% CI, 0.3 mm, 40.7 mm) and after ingestion of 500 ml water (95% CI, 1.25 mm, 51.9 mm) (P<0.05). Serum leptin concentrations were significantly associated with percent body fat (r=0.57;P<0.001) and, after correcting for body fat status, tended to be higher in patients with active Crohn's disease (mean 0.9 ng/ml/% body fat; SD 0.8 ng/ml/% body fat) compared with either patients with inactive disease (mean 0.4 ng/ml/% body fat; SD 0.3 ng/ml/% body fat) or healthy controls (mean 0.3 ng/ml/% body fat; SD 0.2 ng/ml/% body fat) (P=0.15, ns). Appetite parameters and serum leptin concentrations showed no significant correlation. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective appetite parameters were altered in patients with active Crohn's disease. At baseline, patients with active Crohn's disease were less hungry than healthy controls and had less desire to eat. After ingestion of 500 ml of water, desire to eat was significantly less in patients with active disease as compared with healthy controls. Serum leptin concentration corrected for percent body fat tended to be higher in patients with active Crohn's disease compared with inactive Crohn's disease and healthy controls, but the differences did not reach statistical significance.},

Immunologic, environmental, infective and genetic factors equally can play role in their development. Antibodies to an oligomannose epitope of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated in 60-70% of the patients with Crohn's disease. The origin and the clinicopathological role are not clarified. It is important that there are no surveys with patients suffering in gluten sensitive enteropathy in the literature. As there are no ASCA survey in Hungary, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the ASCA. The authors examined at their patients the ASCA's occurrence and compared with the clinical picture of the Crohn's disease. The results supported the theory that ASCA positivity correlates with small intestines' Crohn's disease and in these cases both the IgG and IgA type antibodies proved. The antibodies in the sera at the analyzed ASCA positive cases prove a systemic immune response against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the authors suggest the end of the oral tolerance against the yeast's antigens. The diet restriction (elemental diet, total parenteral nutrition, and fecal diversion) may ameliorate the status of the patients with Crohn's disease. It is speculated that the yeast-free diet as a part of the therapy for the ASCA positive patients can be reasonable: moreover the permanent "forbidding" of the yeast can be an acceptable alternative in case of getting well.},

The reasons for the discrepancies in the findings could be related to the different study designs, different treatments, overlapping of treatment effects, as well as the variety of treatment formulations and doses used, which have led to results that are, in certain instances, very difficult to explain. Emphasis on a treatment formulation which reduces the incidence of side effects, together with careful selection of patients and experimental design, seems to be associated with benefits, and these studies point to the therapeutic potential for these lipids in the therapy of IBD. It is possible that these fatty acids act by reducing low-grade active inflammation rather than by preventing reinitiation of the inflammatory process from a truly quiescent state. Whether this treatment is applicable to all IBD patients has not been fully elucidated. Nevertheless, taken together, all these studies suggest the effectiveness of these new therapeutic approaches, not only when conventional treatment fails or when it is not possible to treat chronically, but also, in some instances, as first choice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Obesity is unusual in Crohn's disease and the particularities of the disease in obese patients have not been studied. METHODS: 2065 patients were studied retrospectively. Obesity was defined by a BMI value >25.0 at disease onset and >30.0 at any time during the course of the disease. Disease characteristics, therapeutic needs, and year-by-year disease activity were determined in patients with and without obesity. RESULTS: 62 patients (3%) were obese. When compared with non-obese patients, obese patients did not show differences regarding sex, intestinal disease location, and disease behavior, but at diagnosis they were older (32 vs 28 years, P = 0.01) and a larger proportion had anoperineal disease (35 vs 24%, P = 0.03). When the 62 obese patients were paired for sex, location of disease at onset, date of birth, and date of diagnosis with 124 non-obese patients, the disease severity assessed by the importance of medical therapy and excisional surgery did not differ in the two groups but time to development of anoperineal abscess or fistula was shorter in obese patients, and obese patients were more prone to develop an active disease (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.07-2.11) and to require hospitalization (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.56-3.52) CONCLUSION: Obesity in Crohn's disease is associated with more frequent anoperineal complications and a more marked year-by-year disease activity, but does not alter significantly the long-term course of the disease.},

The frequency is 1.6-21.4% among patients with ulcerative colitis and 0.3-2% in those with Crohn's disease. The main characteristics of toxic megacolon are toxemia, sepsis and distension of the colon due to the diminished muscular tone, loss of motor activity and increased amount of colonic gas. Sepsis and/or perforation of the large bowel can complicate this situation. The most important diagnostic procedure is the abdominal X-ray. Should the diameter of colonic distension exceed 60 mm, the diagnosis of toxic megacolon has been confirmed. Conservative treatment of toxic megacolon consists of water and electrolyte replacement, total parenteral nutrition, administration of corticosteroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics and repeat patient's prone positioning. If medical therapy is not successful during the first 72 hours, surgical intervention is indicated. The most common procedure is subtotal colonic resection with creation of an ileostomy. Patients with toxic megacolon should be managed at specialised centers, where cooperation of experienced gastroenterologists, surgeons and intensive care experts is possible.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises two chronic, tissue-destructive, clinical entities Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) both apparently caused by immunological overreaction (hypersensitivity) to commensal gut bacteria. Under normal conditions the intestinal immune system shows a down-regulating tone ('oral tolerance') against dietary antigens and the indigenous microbiota. This local homeostasis is disturbed in IBD, leading to hyperactivation of T helper 1 (Th1) cells with abundant secretion of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and production of IgG antibodies against commensal bacteria. In addition, UC includes genetically determined autoimmunity, particularly IgG1-mediated cytotoxic epithelial attack. Breaching of the epithelium is the best-defined event underlying abrogation of oral tolerance, but immune deviation caused by cytokines fiom irritated epithelial cells or subepithelial elements (for example, mast cells, natural killer cells, macrophages) may also be involved. Endogenous infection with local hypersensitivity likewise causes periodontal disease, reflecting 'frustrated' immune elimination mechanisms entertained by antigens from dental plaque. Altogether, perturbation of a tightly controlled cytokine network, with abnormal crosstalk between several cell types, apparently explains the progressive immunopathology of chronic inflammatory mucosal diseases in general. This adverse development will be influenced by numerous immunity genes, the dosage and potential pathogeniciy of commensal bacteria, general health, nutritional status, and psychological factors. Several targets for new therapy have tentatively been identified to block immunopathological mechanisms in IBD, and inhibition of TNF has a striking beneficial effect in CD, supporting a central role of this cytokine.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Understanding cytokine production patterns in early mucosal lesions of pediatric patients newly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be critical to understanding IBD pathogenesis. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has a central role in a multitude of immune system reactions; however, inconsistent lamina propria and serum IL-6 has been reported in IBD patients. Newly diagnosed pediatric IBD patients have not previously been evaluated for lamina propria or serum IL-6. METHODS: Serum and intestinal lamina propria biopsy whole organ culture supernatants were evaluated by ELISA for IL-6 obtained from newly diagnosed IBD patients, before initiation of immunomodulatory therapies. RESULTS: Levels of lamina propria IL-6 demonstrated significant correlation with graded severity of histological inflammation (p < 0.001). Log-transformed serum and organ culture IL-6 levels demonstrated significant correlation (p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.6226). Assigning a demarcation level of >400 pg/ml, serum IL-6 concentrations were a superior marker for the presence of microscopic intestinal inflammation than erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), with a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 82%. When evaluating subtypes of IBD, serum IL-6 levels were correlated more significantly with active disease in ulcerative colitis patients (p = 0.01, R2 = 0.74) than in Crohn's disease patients (p = 0.21, R2 = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS: This study outlines graded production of IL-6 in intestinal lamina propria and serum of newly diagnosed pediatric IBD patients, confirming the presence of IL-6 in early IBD patients. In addition, serum IL-6 may be a good predictor of IBD in pediatric patients with suspected or newly diagnosed IBD.},

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of fecal calprotectin as a noninvasive measure of disease activity in childhood inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by comparison to a modified Lloyd-Still and Green score and laboratory inflammatory indices. METHODS: Spot fecal samples from 37 children with IBD and 31 control children were sent by ordinary mail to the laboratory. Fecal calprotectin concentration was measured by an in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A modified Lloyd-Still & Green score (mLSS) was calculated for each child with IBD within 10 days of obtaining the fecal sample. RESULTS: Compared with control values (median, range) (2.1, 0.5-6.3 mg/L), fecal calprotectin was increased in 16 children with ulcerative colitis, (11.5, 0.6-272.5 mg/L, P < 0.001) and in 21 children with Crohn disease, (14.0, 0.7-59.7 mg/L, P < 0.001). Twelve "moderately affected" children (mLSS of 35-65) had higher fecal calprotectin concentrations (22.2, 2.7-141.7 mg/L) than 25 "mildly affected" children (mLSS > 65), (10.3, 0.6-272.5 mg/L, P = 0.002). For the total IBD group, fecal calprotectin concentration correlated negatively with the mLSS (r = -0.61, P < 0.001). It also correlated negatively with serum albumin concentration (r = -0.49, P = 0.002) and positively with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r = 0.40, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Fecal calprotectin seems to reflect bowel inflammation in children with IBD. As a simple, safe, noninvasive test, it has the potential to reduce the number of invasive investigations performed in these children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Calprotectin is an abundant neutrophil protein, which is extremely stable in feces. This study aimed to validate fecal calprotectin as a marker of bowel inflammation against invasive measures in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including colitis and small bowel Crohn disease. METHODS: Fecal calprotectin was measured using a simple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 36 spot stool samples from 22 children before colonoscopy and from 14 children before technetium-99 (99Tc) scanning. Using standard scoring systems, the severity of inflammation was assessed macroscopically and histologically at six standard sites in those who underwent colonoscopy and also at six standard sites in those who underwent 99Tc scanning. The subscores from each site were summated to give combined severity and extent scores for macroscopic and for histologic inflammation in the group undergoing colonoscopy and total inflammation in the group undergoing 99Tc scanning. RESULTS: In the 22 children who underwent colonoscopy, median fecal calprotectin was 4.9 mg/L (0.1-272.5 mg/L) (range). Disease groups included six normal cases, nine ulcerative colitis cases, two isolated Crohn colitis cases, two indeterminate colitis cases, and three allergic colitis cases. Fecal calprotectin correlated closely with colonic macroscopic inflammation (r = 0.75, P < 0.001) and histologic inflammation (r = 0.85, P < 0.001). Of the 14 children undergoing 99Tc scanning, 10 had Crohn disease, 3 had ulcerative colitis, and 1 had allergic colitis. Median fecal calprotectin was 9.1 mg/L (0.3-141.7 mg/L), and this correlated closely with the 99Tc scanning score (r = 0.80, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Fecal calprotectin correlates closely with the best invasive measures of colonic and small bowel inflammation in childhood inflammatory bowel disease. As a sensitive objective measure of bowel inflammation that is risk-free and noninvasive, fecal calprotectin lends itself particularly to the monitoring of and assessment of therapeutic interventions in children with inflammatory bowel disease.},

Both hypoalbuminemia and malnutrition are observed in Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVES: To correlate the serum albumin values to disease activity and also to nutritional status in patients with Crohn's disease. PATIENTS/METHODS: Thirty six patients were studied. Nutritional status was assessed by anthropometry measures and inflammatory activity determined by Harvey's simple clinical index and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. RESULTS: No correlation was found between malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia. The serum albumin levels correlated inversely with the disease activity. Hypoalbuminemia was 100% sensitive for detection of disease activity. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that serum albumin concentration is a very sensitive marker of inflammatory activity and not good indicator of the nutritional status in Crohn's disease. It is necessary a suitable laboratorial parameter for routine nutrition assessment in patients with this inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Nutritional derangements are frequent in inflammatory bowel disease. In the last year, significant work was published examining the mechanisms of impaired food intake in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, which allow a better understanding of these processes. These data have shed new light on the relative role of underfeeding and inflammation on the growth retardation associated with intestinal inflammation. Other studies have provided further information on the risk factors and predictive biomarkers of bone loss in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The potential role of enteral nutrition as primary therapy for Crohn disease is particularly addressed in the present review. Recent contributions emphasized the special importance of this therapeutic modality in pediatric patients, but the possible mechanisms for such therapeutic effect are still not well understood. Other nutrients may have a therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, recent data on the in vivo antiinflammatory action of butyrate merit special mention. Finally, novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease, such as transforming growth factor-beta2-enriched enteral feeding or hydrothermally processed cereals, have recently been explored.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory Bowel Diseases - ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease- are chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases of unknown etiology. Decreased oral intake, malabsorption, accelerated nutrient losses, increased requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions cause nutritional and functional deficiencies that require proper correction by nutritional therapy. The goals of the different forms of nutritional therapy are to correct nutritional disturbances and to modulate inflammatory response, thus influencing disease activity. Total parenteral nutrition has been used to correct and to prevent nutritional disturbances and to promote bowel rest during active disease, mainly in cases of digestive fistulae with high output. Its use should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing clinical remission in adults and promoting growth in children. Due to its low complication rate and lower costs, enteral nutrition should be preferred over total parenteral nutrition whenever possible. Both present equal effectiveness in primary therapy for remission of active Crohn's disease. Nutritional intervention may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the costs and complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted, especially in patients presumed to need total parenteral nutrition. Recent research has focused on the use of nutrients as primary treatment agents. Immunonutrition is an important therapeutic alternative in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases, modulating the inflammation and changing the eicosanoid synthesis profile. However, beneficial reported effects have yet to be translated into the clinical practice. The real efficacy of these and other nutrients (glutamine, short-chain fatty acids, antioxidants) still need further evaluation through prospective and randomized trials.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Practical aspects and impact on daily life of short bowel syndrome (SBS) and an ostomy were explored in people with SBS. Interest was focused on nutrition and excretion, ostomy problems, associated medical and surgical problems, socioeconomic situation, and social and leisure activities. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Six subjects (range, 38-68 years) with Crohn's disease were included from the University Short Bowel Clinic at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Average disease duration was 25 years, and mean small intestinal length was 107 cm; 4 subjects were receiving parenteral nutrition at home. METHODS: Subjects were interviewed in their homes using a semistructured interview divided into the areas of focus. Data were transcribed by shorthand and were rewritten into the computer the same day. A questionnaire on nutrition and excretion was answered by the subjects in writing and mailed to the interviewer. RESULTS: The most significant observation was the limited ability to act spontaneously, because all daily activities involved considerable planning. Three subjects said they had never accepted the ostomy; the others would not return to their pre-stoma lifestyle. The 2 subjects with a colostomy described special emptying patterns that caused limitations in social life that had not been reported previously. Fistulas were reported as having been the most trying part of the disease. Three subjects worked part time, which was of utmost importance for quality of life. Fatigue influenced social and leisure activities. CONCLUSION: People with SBS are bothered by a number of demanding problems in various aspects of life. Therefore, a team approach toward care is critical to allow for coordination of action toward the various needs. It also seems unlikely that standard instruments of quality of life can capture the complicated situations with which these subjects live. It appears that coping mechanisms also need to be considered.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To validate bio-electric impedance spectroscopy (BIS) by comparison with other methods for determination of body water compartments in stable subjects with an ileostomy and no or minor small bowel resection for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). SUBJECTS: Twenty-one subjects were included, age range 36-65 y (female/male=12/9), Crohn's disease (CD), n=14, ulcerative colitis (UC), n=6 and indeterminate colitis (IDC), n=1. METHODS: Fluid compartments were assessed by the use of three independent methods: BIS, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and dilution techniques (DIL); tritiated water (total body water, TBW); and bromide (extracellular water, ECW), respectively. Intra-cellular water (ICW) was calculated as TBW-ECW. For comparison TBW was also predicted according to an empirical formula. Differences were analysed using Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS: The mean TBW values obtained from the impedance measurement differed in the order of -2.21 (DIL) to 1.41 (DXA) in women and -2.01 (DIL) to 2.61 (DXA) in men, from the measured and derived values of total body water. Prediction of TBW gave values that were close to BIS, with a mean difference of -0.31 in male subjects and +0.51 in female subjects. Assessment of ECW revealed that the mean difference between dilution and impedance was less in women than in men (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The differences between all methods to assess fluid compartments are pronounced. To further investigate the use of the method in clinical practice for dynamic monitoring of rehydration in ileostomates with acute diarrhoea, repeated measurements together with comparison with weight fluid-balance charts are suggested. SPONSORSHIP: The study was supported by grants from the Swedish Medical Research Council (17X-03117), Goteborgs Lakarsallskap and IB and A Lundbergs forskningsstiftelse.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the second cause of death in Spain, reaching the first place in non-smoking population. It is also the tumour with the greatest one-year incidence. The last few years some reduction in its incidence along with a greater 5-year average survival has been observed. PATHOGENESIS: Most CRCs develop from benign polyps. Vogelstein's hypothesis suggests an orderly progression from normal mucosa, to a small polyp, to a large polyp and finally to a CRC. In this progression transforming cells will be increasingly charged with molecular alterations. GENETIC FACTORS: 20% of CRCs have a genetic background although only a fourth of these are genetically based. The APC (or FAP) gene mutation is one of the earlier events that can be seen in tumour progression. When this mutation appears in the germ line it renders Familial Adenomatose Polyposis Syndrome (that evolves to CRC in a 100% of cases) or to the Gardner Syndrome (if it has extracolonic expressions). The p53 mutation is a late event in cellular transformation but it makes a rapid accumulation of mutations an easier process and it confers advantages for survival of the tumour cells. Mutations in the genes implicated in microsatellite instability are related to DNA error repair; their clinical correlates are the Lynch I and II syndromes. Other important genes related to CRC are DCC and ras. CLINICAL FACTORS: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (particularly Crohn's disease) is the most important clinical factor, it may enhance basal risk 30 times. Other risk factors are: previous malignant conditions, pelvic irradiation and previous surgery (cholecystectomy and ureterosigmoidostomy). The endocrinologic factors have a rising importance and so hormonal substitution therapy for menopause and multiparity can provide some protection. The use of NSAIDs can also be protective (specially COX-2 inhibitors). CONCLUSIONS: It is important that people who are identified as having a high risk for developing a CRC are subjected to a strict clinical and endoscopic follow-up in order to be able to identify an incipient tumour or to practice prophylactic surgery. The use of hormonal substitution therapy or anti COX-2 NSAIDs can be future useful chemoprophylactic agents.},

   abstract = {Proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)-2, a G-protein-coupled receptor for trypsin and mast cell tryptase, is highly expressed in the intestine. Luminal trypsin and tryptase are elevated in the colon of inflammatory bowel disease patients. We hypothesized that luminal proteinases activate PAR-2 and induce colonic inflammation. Mice received intracolonically PAR-2 agonists (trypsin, tryptase, and a selective PAR-2-activating peptide) or control drugs (boiled enzymes, inactive peptide) and inflammatory parameters were followed at various times after this treatment. Colonic administration of PAR-2 agonists up-regulated PAR-2 expression and induced an inflammatory reaction characterized by granulocyte infiltration, increased wall thickness, tissue damage, and elevated T-helper cell type 1 cytokine. The inflammation was maximal between 4 and 6 hours and was resolved 48 hours after the intracolonic administration. PAR-2 activation also increased paracellular permeability of the colon and induced bacterial trans-location into peritoneal organs. These proinflammatory and pathophysiological changes observed in wild-type mice were not detected in PAR-2-deficient mice. Luminal proteinases activate PAR-2 in the mouse colon to induce inflammation and disrupt the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Because trypsin and tryptase are found at high levels in the colon lumen of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, our data may bear directly on the pathophysiology of human inflammatory bowel diseases.},

The faltering is temporary in 40-50% of cases and prolonged in 10-20% in Crohn's disease (CD). Such failure is rare in children with ulcerative colitis (5%). This complication is often associated with retarded bone development and delayed onset of sexual maturation. The delayed linear growth has a variety of causes including insufficient intake due to anorexia and the inflammatory process with increased energy and protein expenditure. Other factors are increased intestinal loss, secondary hypopituitarism and treatment with steroids. Therapeutic strategies of CD in children have changed this last decade by introducing new therapeutic agents such as topic steroids, immunosuppressors, anti-TNF (antibody and notably in children enteral nutrition which has shown its efficacy in inducing remissions of active CD, restoring nutritional status and stimulation of linear growth. The results of a recent prospective multicentric study over 2 years in 82 CD show that severe GF (-2 SD) is initially present in 15% (n = 12), among them 11 remain < -2SD after 2 years of follow-up. Six patients who were on the normal range initially increased their GF during the follow-up (< -2SD) (total 21% < -2SD (n = 17) at 2 years). At inclusion in this group there was no difference in growth velocity, used of steroids, enteral nutrition or severity of CD as compared to the group with no GF. It suggests that new treatment strategy should be developed in the future for this specific complication of paediatric CD.},

Unfortunately, presenting signs and symptoms in children with dyspepsia are nonspecific and can occur as a result of many diseases, such as parasitic infections, esophagitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pylori infection, Crohn's disease, biliary tract or hepatic disease, pancreatitis, and lactose intolerance. This lack of specificity makes the evaluation of dyspepsia more difficult.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Ileal malabsorption of bile salts is observed in Crohn's ileitis. We define the transcriptional mechanisms involved in cytokine-mediated repression of the rat apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT). METHODS: ASBT regulation was studied in IL-1beta-treated IEC-6 and Caco-2 cells and in indomethacin-treated rats. RESULTS: Indomethacin-induced ileitis in Lewis rats leads to specific reductions in ileal ASBT messenger RNA and protein levels, whereas c-jun and c-fos are induced. The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor repress the activity of the ASBT promoter in Caco-2 and intestinal epithelial cell-6 cells. This effect is blocked by the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, or by the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. Indomethacin (in vivo) or proinflammatory cytokine (in vitro) treatment leads to serine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of c-fos. Mutation of a 5' activated protein (AP)-1 site inactivates the ASBT promoter, whereas mutation of the 3' site abrogates the proinflammatory cytokine-mediated repression. The 5' site binds a c-jun homodimer, whereas the 3' site binds a c-jun/c-fos heterodimer. c-Jun overexpression enhances ASBT promoter activity, whereas a dominant negative c-jun construct inactivates the promoter. c-Fos overexpression represses promoter activity. A 27 base pair cis-element from the 3' site in the ASBT promoter imparts cytokine-mediated down-regulation to a heterologous SV40 promoter construct. CONCLUSIONS: The ASBT promoter contains 2 distinct cis AP-1 elements; the 5' element binds homodimeric c-jun and mediates basal transcription. Inflammation is associated with up-regulation, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of c-fos, which then represses ASBT promoter activity via binding of the 3' AP-1 element by a c-fos/c-jun heterodimer.},

   abstract = {Platelet-activating factor (PAF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. However, neither the physiologic role of PAF in the intestine, nor the mechanisms by which PAF participates in the pathogenesis of disease are well understood. The aim of the present study was to determine the direct effect of PAF on intestinal epithelial cell ion transport, and to delineate the mechanisms of regulation. Ion transport was evaluated by measuring short circuit current (I(sc)) in HT29-CL19A cell monolayers using Ussing chambers. PAF receptor polarity was assessed using domain-selective biotinylation followed by immunoprecipitation and streptavidin blotting of intact epithelial monolayers. PAF (1-200 microM) stimulated I(sc) that followed the direction of a Cl(-) gradient and was specifically inhibited by the Cl(-) channel blockers glybenclamide, 2,2' iminodibenzoic acid and 4,4' diisothiocyanostilbene-2, 2' disulfonic acid, but was unaffected by the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin. Stimulated I(sc) was only detected after apical addition of PAF, correlating with the results of biotinylation experiments indicating an exclusive apical polarity of the PAF receptor. PAF receptor antagonists CV6209 and octylonium bromide abolished PAF-stimulated I(sc). Thus, mucosal acting PAF directly and specifically stimulates ion transport via activation of an apical Cl(-) channel in intestinal epithelial cell monolayers independent of prostaglandin biosynthesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To evaluate the benefit of smoking cessation in individuals with Crohn's disease, we performed an intervention study in a large cohort of smokers with the disease. METHODS: Repeated counseling to stop smoking, with easy access to a smoking cessation program, was given to 474 consecutive smokers with Crohn's disease. Patients who stopped smoking for more than 1 year (quitters) were included in a prospective follow-up study, which compared disease course and therapeutic needs with 2 control groups, continuing smokers and nonsmokers, paired for age, gender, disease location, and activity. RESULTS: There were 59 quitters (12%). Predictors of quitting were the physician, previous intestinal surgery, high socioeconomic status, and in women, oral contraceptive use. During a median follow-up of 29 months (1-54 months), the risk of flare-up in quitters did not differ from that in nonsmokers and was less than in continuing smokers (P < 0.001). Need for steroids and for introduction or reinforcement of immunosuppressive therapy, respectively, were similar in quitters and nonsmokers and increased in continuing smokers. The risk of surgery was not significantly different in the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Crohn's disease who stop smoking for more than 1 year have a more benign disease course than if they had never smoked.},

Our aim was to assess the long-term evolution of the disease behavior of CD and to determine the predictive factors and prognostic implications of this evolution. METHODS: Occurrence and predictive factors of a stricturing and/or a penetrating complication were searched for in 2,002 patients with CD studied retrospectively. In addition, the 1995-2000 disease course was assessed prospectively in a cohort of 646 patients with disease duration >5 years, classified according to their previous disease behavior. RESULTS: 1,199 patients (60%) developed a stricturing (n = 254) or a penetrating (n = 945) complication. Twenty-year actuarial rates of inflammatory, stricturing, and penetrating disease were 12, 18, and 70%, respectively. The initial location of lesions was the main determinant of the time and type of the complication. In the cohort study, year-by-year activity and therapeutic requirements did not show significant sustained differences between behavioral subgroups. CONCLUSION: Most patients with CD will eventually one day develop a stricturing or a perforating complication. Initial location determines the type of the complication. Classification of patients into a behavioral group from previous history has no impact upon activity during the following years.},

Corticosteroids, commonly used to control exacerbations, appear to be a major risk factor for subsequent development of osteoporosis. Exclusion diets, avoiding foods that precipitate symptoms, frequently allow control of the disease avoiding the use of corticosteroids and may thereby reduce the risk of osteoporosis. To investigate this we performed bone mineral density measurements of the proximal femur and spine in 95 patients, 31 treated predominately by corticosteroids, 33 by dietary manipulation with a low life-time corticosteroid dose and 31 by treatments other than diets but also with a low life-time corticosteroid dose. In both groups with a low life-time corticosteroid dose bone mineral density was comparable to that of age-matched normal controls, whereas bone mineral density was significantly reduced in those treated predominately by corticosteroids. We conclude that corticosteroid therapy is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis in patients with Crohn's disease and should be used as little as possible.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract constitutes one of the largest sites of exposure to the outside environment. The function of the gastrointestinal tract in monitoring and sealing the host interior from intruders is called the gut barrier. A variety of specific and nonspecific mechanisms are in operation to establish the host barrier; these include luminal mechanisms and digestive enzymes, the epithelial cells together with tight junctions in between them, and the gut immune system. Disruptions in the gut barrier follow injury from various causes including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oxidant stress, and involve mechanisms such as adenosine triphosphate depletion and damage to epithelial cell cytoskeletons that regulate tight junctions. Ample evidence links gut barrier dysfunction to multiorgan system failure in sepsis and immune dysregulation. Additionally, contribution of gut barrier dysfunction to gastrointestinal disease is an evolving concept and is the focus of this review. An overview of the evidence for the role of gut barrier dysfunction in disorders such as Crohn's disease, celiac disease, food allergy, acute pancreatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcoholic liver disease is provided, together with critical insight into the implications of this evidence as a primary disease mechanism.},

We evaluated our experience with this procedure in the adolescent population. METHODS: All adolescents undergoing ileocolic resection for Crohn disease during a 3-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Intraoperative and early postoperative results were analyzed, comparing those undergoing the laparoscopic-assisted approach with those having open resection. RESULTS: Eleven patients (mean age, 15.6 years) underwent open and 12 patients (mean age, 16.5 years) underwent laparoscopic-assisted resection. None had undergone previous resection. The two groups did not differ with respect to time from diagnosis to surgery, indications for surgery, preoperative medical therapy, operative time, or length of intestine resected. One patient in the laparoscopic-assisted group was converted to an open procedure. There were no intraoperative complications in either group. Although no statistically significant differences were noted for number of days on narcotic, total dosage of narcotic, and time to regular diet, patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted resection were discharged 2.2 days earlier (5.4 vs. 7.6; P < 0.05). There was one wound infection and one intraabdominal abscess in the open resection group, and a single patient in the laparoscopic-assisted group with postoperative fever and a wound infection. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection is a safe alternative to open surgery in adolescent patients with Crohn disease.},

However, the long-term durability of the procedure and its safety have not been confirmed. The purpose of this study was to report our experience with strictureplasty for diffuse Crohn's jejunoileitis. METHODS: Between 1984 and 1999, 123 patients underwent a laparotomy that included an index strictureplasty for diffuse jejunoileitis. Patient history, operative details, and postoperative morbidities were obtained by chart review. Nineteen patients (15 percent) were receiving total parenteral nutrition for short-bowel syndrome, and 81 (66 percent) were taking chronic steroids. Total number of strictureplasties performed was 701 (median, 5/patient). Seventy percent of patients underwent a synchronous bowel resection. Follow-up information was determined by personal or phone interviews. Recurrence was defined as the need for reoperation, and risk was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients with diffuse jejunoileitis were also compared with 219 patients with limited small-bowel Crohn's disease undergoing strictureplasty. RESULTS: The overall morbidity rate was 20 percent, with septic complications occurring in 6 percent. The surgical recurrence rate was 29 percent with a median follow-up period of 6.7 (range, 1-16) years. The recurrence rate in diffuse jejunoileitis patients did not differ from that seen in patients with limited small-bowel Crohn's disease (P = 0.38). Short duration of disease and short interval since last surgery were significant predictors of accelerated recurrence (P = 0.008 and 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Strictureplasty is a safe and durable alternative to resection in diffuse Crohn's jejunoileitis. Patients with a short duration of disease and short interval since last surgery are at higher risk for accelerated recurrence. Patients with diffuse jejunoileitis do not appear to be at higher risk for recurrence than patients with more limited Crohn's disease.},

Functional candidate gene association studies during the past few decades have revealed only modest associations between IBD and genetic variants in the HLA genes and a limited number of other genes that are involved in immune regulation and the inflammatory response. Important advances in IBD genetics research have come about from systematic genome searches for IBD loci. The identification of Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 genetic variants that appear to alter the innate immune response to bacteria is a seminal finding that perhaps is the greatest advance toward understanding the pathogenesis of IBD in decades. The future discovery of other IBD genetic risk factors, facilitated by the completion of the human genome sequencing and annotation, may allow the development of better therapies, possibly including preventive therapies, for patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two major forms of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are heritable, complex traits that appear to share some but not all susceptibility loci. We report that transmission/disequilibrium test analysis of a Crohn's disease genome scan dataset has detected an inflammatory bowel disease locus on chromosome 3p26 (nominal P=0.000052 and genome-wide corrected P=0.039 at D3S1297). An allele sharing method shows significant linkage (multipoint lod=3.69) in a larger, independent sample of inflammatory bowel disease-affected sibling pairs. A survey of 16 chromosome 3p26 short tandem repeat polymorphisms in a combined sample of 234 independent nuclear families with 324 IBD-affected sibling pairs shows significant linkage to chromosome 3p26 (multipoint lod=3.78) and significant transmission/disequilibrium test results at two adjacent markers (nominal P values in two different transmission/disequilibrium analysis methods=0.00011 and 0.0011 for the first marker, and 0.00071 and 0.00013 for the second marker). There is highly significant under-transmission of a common allele and modest over-transmission of other alleles at both markers. Families with no transmission to affected individuals of the under-transmitted alleles show significant linkage (multipoint lod=4.50) that is significantly greater in four simulation studies (P=0.0001, 0.0000625, 0.0000625 and 0.0000625, respectively) than the linkage evidence in families with transmission of the under-transmitted alleles (multipoint lod=0.12). Thus, the existence of an inflammatory bowel disease locus on chromosome 3p26 is supported by significant linkage, transmission/disequilibrium and partitioning of linkage evidence.},

However, the resident bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease). The objectives of the Probiotic Research Group based at University College Cork were to isolate and identify lactic acid bacteria exhibiting beneficial probiotic traits, such as bile tolerance in the absence of deconjugation activity, acid resistance, adherence to host epithelial tissue, and in vitro antagonism of pathogenic microorganisms or those suspected of promoting inflammation. To isolate potentially effective probiotic bacteria, we screened the microbial population adhering to surgically resected segments of the gastrointestinal tract (the environment in which they may subsequently be reintroduced and required to function). In total, 1500 bacterial strains from resected human terminal ilea were assessed. From among these organisms, Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius strain UCC118 was selected for further study. In mouse feeding trials, milk-borne L. salivarius strain UCC118 could successfully colonize the murine gastrointestinal tract. A human feeding study conducted in 80 healthy volunteers showed that yogurt can be used as a vehicle for delivery of strain UCC118 to the human gastrointestinal tract with considerable efficacy in influencing gut flora and colonization. In summary, we developed criteria for in vitro selection of probiotic bacteria that may reflect certain in vivo effects on the host such as modulation of gastrointestinal tract microflora.},

It is essential to provide an accurate diagnosis in children suspected of IBD, as the initial treatment of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in children is not the same as it is in adults. While the role of enteral feeding in the treatment of Crohn disease in adults continues to be controversial, there is firm evidence to support the use of enteral feeding as primary therapy for Crohn disease in children. Nutrition is improved by enteral feeding, and growth and pubertal development are promoted, while the systemic toxicity of corticosteroid therapy is avoided. Supplementary nocturnal enteral nutrition (with daytime intake of normal diet) after primary therapy and remission induction may be associated with the prolongation of remission. Drug treatment in children with IBD is characterized by a lack of evidence from controlled trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several proinflammatory cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. A significant role has been given to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) as a guide proinflammatory cytokine. Thalidomide selectively reduces TNF-alpha production by inflammatory cells. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of thalidomide to induce and maintain remission in refractory Crohn disease. METHODS: The decision to administer thalidomide was made on the basis of patient intolerance or resistance to conventional medical treatment or as the last medical resort before surgical intervention. Only 5 of 96 patients with inflammatory bowel disease satisfied these criteria. All five patients had Crohn disease (male: mean age, 17 years). Thalidomide was administered at night at a dose of 1.5-2 mg/kg/day. The Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index, modified Harvey-Bradshaw scores, and steroids reduction were used to assess clinical response. RESULTS: Disease activity decreased consistently in four patients with a reduction of mean Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index from 36,9 to 2,5 and the mean Harvey-Bradshaw from 8.5 to 0.75 after 3 months of treatment. Steroid treatment (mean dose, 35 mg/day before treatment) was tapered and then discontinued, in four patients, within 1-3 months. Four patients are in remission after 19-24 months of treatment. The fifth patient discontinued thalidomide after 1 week because of distal paresthesia. CONCLUSION: Thalidomide seems to be an effective and safe treatment in patients with refractory Crohn disease. This is the first report of long-term use of thalidomide in refractory Crohn disease in pediatric patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in adults with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is characterized by pancolonic involvement, a high frequency of rectal sparing, and an increased risk of pouchitis and colorectal neoplasia. The clinical features of IBD in pediatric patients with PSC have not been well described. The aim of this study was to characterize the frequency, clinical features, and natural history of IBD in pediatric patients diagnosed with PSC. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients 18 years of age or younger diagnosed with PSC seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1975 and 1999. Endoscopic and histologic features and surgical and postsurgical outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Fifty-two children with PSC were identified. Forty-three patients (84%) were also diagnosed with IBD. In 36 of 43 cases, there was a sufficient diagnostic evaluation to allow a detailed review. Thirty-two of 36 patients (89%) had ulcerative colitis and 4 of 36 patients (11%) had Crohn's disease. In 4 of 36 patients (11%), IBD was asymptomatic. Although the most frequent endoscopic presentation of IBD was universal colitis, endoscopic rectal sparing was frequently noted (27% of colonoscopic studies). Of the four patients diagnosed with Crohn disease, in none did perianal, fistulizing, or stricturing disease develop. Proctocolectomy was performed in six patients (17%); three operations were performed for dysplasia. Pouchitis complicated four of the five ileal pouch-anal anastomoses procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Among pediatric patients (1) PSC without IBD is uncommon; (2) asymptomatic IBD may be associated with PSC; (3) because the time to dysplasia may be accelerated, once the diagnosis of IBD is made in the setting of PSC, heightened endoscopic surveillance may be indicated; (4) pouchitis occurs frequently in these patients.},

   abstract = {Maintenance of adequate nutrition is of obvious importance in the management of patients with Crohn's disease. Exclusive parenteral nutrition can achieve high rates of remission, but this is not usually necessary since exclusive elemental and polymeric enteral regimes can yield similarly good results. Comparison of exclusive enteral formula feeding with steroid treatment favours steroids only because compliance is less complete for the restrictive nutritional regimes, and formula feeds should always be the first choice in the growing child with active Crohn's disease. It is probable that the nature of the lipid provided in Crohn's diets is clinically important, and there is some evidence that the n-3 fatty acids are beneficial. Continuation of nutritional supplements once remission has been obtained appears valuable even when malnutrition is not a major consideration.},

   abstract = {In the last years the research on the etiopathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is focused around immunological aspects. Many authors consider that the intestinal inflammation is due to an inappropriate immunological response to normally present antigens in the gut. Two aspects must to be considered between IBD: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD's diagnosis is based on the symptomatology, (cramps, liquid feces with mucus and blood, anorexia and weight loss), hemato-clinical tests (ESR, PCR, blood platelet, mucoprotein, sideremia) and radiological tests (tenuis Rx, abdominal echography, fibro endoscophy and scintigraphy). Principal aim of the therapy is the clinical remission. Following the remission starts a maintenance protocol. Parenteral nutrition is used in paediatric and adolescent age. Diets have been used to provide a convenient nutritious contribution with growth improvement and partial remission of activity index of the disease. Pharmacology therapy represents a valid instrument to obtain the remission. Colectomy is performed on unsuccessful medical therapy. Early studies on IBD's pathogenesis bring to the use of biological therapies that show beneficial effects on the disease.},

Antitumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) antibodies have recently been used in order to treat Crohn's disease, but their effect on cholestasis in humans has not been previously described. CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old woman had complicated Crohn's disease with multiple fistulae and only 1 m of residual small bowel. She had been receiving TPN for 2.5 years when she developed cholestasis which worsened despite adjustments to her TPN regimen. Infliximab, an anti-TNFalpha antibody, was given with the aim of treating an enterocutaneous fistula, but it also produced a marked biochemical and histological improvement in the TPN-related cholestasis. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNFalpha antibodies appeared in this case to improve TPN-related cholestasis. This implies that TNFalpha may play an important role in the development of this condition.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: No study has yet compared the respective psychological impact of corticotherapy and enteral nutrition in the treatment of Crohn's disease, and especially, the psychological problems linked to the wearing of a nasogastric tube 24 hours a day. The goal of this study was to collect comparative information regarding the real-life experience and the feeling of these two treatments. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From September 1997 to February 1998 at the clinic of inflammatory bowel diseases of the hospital Necker-Enfants malades, 51 patients aged 12 to 18 (average 15) participated in this study. Thirty [15 on corticotherapy (CT); 15 on enteral nutrition (EN)] answered a questionnaire inspired by a similar Canadian questionnaire (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire), and 21 passed Spielberger's anxiety tests, Beck's depression tests and a psychological interview. RESULTS: TREATMENT: According to the 30 questionnaires the appreciation of the therapeutic results was similar in the two treatments, the majority of patients respected their treatment (only one patient on EN ate secretly and two on CT stopped their corticotherapy). Of the 15 EN questionnaires: nine out of 15 patients responded well to the suspension of oral feeding, two were hungry, nine experienced cravings and ten avoided meals during their treatment. From a cosmetic point of view, six/14 (43%) found it difficult putting up with the nasogastric tube 24 hours a day, and eight/15 (53%) on CT found the facial swelling difficult to bear. According to the 21 psychological interviews, eight patients deemed EN efficient, while only four felt the same about CT. Of the 11 EN psychological interview, no adolescent patients were hungry, eight had cravings and nine avoided meals during their treatment, seven mentioned they felt different and seven described how EN had upset the family's routine. Nine (82%) talked about how difficult it was to put up with the nasogastric tube 24 hours a day from a cosmetic standpoint while eight/ten (80%) on CT found the facial swelling difficult to live with. Seven complained that they had been the victims of verbal abuse. Quality of life: According to the 30 questionnaires, eight/15 patients on EN missed an average of 15 days of school against five/15 patients on CT, ten patients judged that EN restricted their daily lives and nine mentioned the daily difficulties to wear a tube 24 hours a day. TESTS: Spielberger's test of anxiety revealed that on average, the 11 patients on EN who were interviewed suffered the first level of anxiety, while the ten patients on CT felt the second level. As for the Beck's depression test, the 11 patients on NE suffered the first level of depression on average, while those on CT were subject to the second level. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that EN was perceived as being more disruptive to patients daily lives than CT and defines the difficulties linked to the suspension of oral feeding and the wearing of a naso-gastric tube. The study also describes the difficulties involved in coping with the side effects of CT, one example being facial swelling which can be as unpleasant from a cosmetic point of view as wearing of a naso-gastric tube.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases of unknown etiology. Unspecific immunosuppressive therapy represents current standard treatment and is often associated with severe side effects. Several treatment regimens have been evaluated to identify alternative therapeutic options. Among these different diet therapies were investigated. Objective of this paper is to review the results of diet therapy in chronic inflammatory bowel disease on the basis of randomised controlled trials and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: Medline and Cochrane Library were searched for meta-analysis and randomised controlled trials investigating this question. Additionally reference lists of identified articles and text books were checked for further trials. RESULTS: Four meta-analyses investigated the treatment of acute Crohn's disease with elemental-, semi-elemental-, and polymeric diets in comparison to corticosteroids or to another form of enteral diet. All meta-analyses show a superiority of corticosteroids and no difference in the effect of the compared enteral diets. Randomised controlled trials investigating diet therapy in ulcerative colitis have not been summarised in a meta-analysis yet. Eleven randomised trials were identified which evaluated diets in ulcerative colitis patients: Dietary supplementation with n-3-fatty acids (6 trials), elemental diet [2], dietary supplementation with dietary fiber [1], elimination diet [1], and dietary supplementation with olestra [1]. Only for the elimination diet a significant positive effect on the course of disease was found in one trial which investigated only 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutritional therapy of acute Crohn's disease is less effective than treatment with corticosteroids. In case of severe steroid induced side effects diet treatment can present a promising alternative. Superiority of one of the investigated different formulations was not found. Meta-analyses of randomised trials provide a clear and easy to understand presentation of the effect of this intervention. Eleven published trials investigating the effect of diets in ulcerative colitis show only for elimination diet a positive treatment effect. The trials do find a positive effect of one of the other interventions but the trials are very small and cannot exclude a treatment effect. Meta-analysis of these trials would be helpful for a better presentation and understanding of these results.},

In the past year significant work has been published examining the mechanisms of impaired food intake in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, which allow a better understanding of these processes. Data from the same laboratory have shed further light on the relative role of underfeeding and inflammation on the growth retardation associated with intestinal inflammation. Other studies have provided further data on the risk factors and predictive biomarkers of bone loss in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The potential role of enteral nutrition as primary therapy for Crohn's disease is particularly addressed in this review. Recent contributions to the field emphasized the special importance of this modality of therapy in paediatric patients. The possible mechanisms for such a therapeutic action are not well understood. Other nutrients may have a therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, recent data on the in-vivo anti-inflammatory actions of butyrate merit special mention. Finally, novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease, such as transforming growth factor-beta2-enriched enteral feeding, or hydrothermally processed cereals have recently been explored.},

AIM: To assess the efficacy of two whole protein based diets with different fat compositions (n6 polyunsaturated fatty acids v monounsaturated fatty acids) in inducing clinical remission in active Crohn's disease compared with steroids. METHODS: Sixty two patients with active Crohn's disease were randomised to receive, for not more than 4 weeks: (a) a polymeric enteral diet containing 35 g of lipids per 1000 kcal, high in oleate (79%) and low in linoleate (6.5%) (PEN1), (b) an identical enteral diet except for the type of fat which was high in linoleate (45%) and low in oleate (28%) (PEN2), or (c) oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). Diets were double blindly administered. The steroid group received a conventional ward diet. Treatment failure was considered when remission was not achieved at week 4. Clinical activity and biological and nutritional parameters were monitored. Independent predictors of remission were identified by stepwise logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall remission rates (by intention to treat) were 20% (4/20) for PEN1, 52% (12/23) for PEN2, and 79% (15/19) for steroids (overall p=0.001; p<0.0005 steroids v PEN1, and p=0.056 PEN2 v PEN1). After excluding those patients who were non-compliant during the first week (per protocol analysis), remission rates were 27%, 63%, and 79%, respectively (p=0.008, steroids and PEN2 v PEN1).

CONCLUSION: The type of dietary fat may be of importance for the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in active Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Sexually differentiated responses occur in molecular, cellular, physiologic, and organismic aspects of immune-system function in relation to acquired and innate immunities. These sex differences apparently include activational effects, which depend on gonadal hormone levels in adults, and lifelong effects, which arise directly from genetic differences or organizational effects of gonadal hormones early in development that lead to lifelong sex differences. Sex differences in immune function also can have great biological significance. Despite this, the mechanisms of these effects rarely have been analyzed extensively. This is especially true of anorexia during illness or disease. Therefore, this review briefly considers 1) the biological mechanisms of sex differences; 2) sex differences in immune function; 3) clinical and experimental data related to sex differences in four diseases or disease models that involve anorexia, Crohn's inflammatory-bowel disease, cancer, turpentine inflammation, and lipopolysaccharide bacteremia; and 4) sex differences in anorexia after interleukin-1 administration.},

Patients with celiac disease can present cerebellar ataxia, progressive myoclonic ataxia, myelopathy, or cerebral, brainstem and peripheral nerve involvement. Antigliadin antibodies can be found in subjects with neurological dysfunction of unknown cause, particularly in sporadic cerebellar ataxia ("gluten ataxia"). Patients with Whipple's disease can develop mental and psychiatric changes, supranuclear gaze palsy, upper motoneuron signs, hypothalamic dysfunction, cranial nerve abnormalities, seizures, ataxia, myorhythmia and sensory deficits. Neurological manifestations can complicate inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) due to vascular or vasculitic mechanisms. Cases with both Crohn's disease and MS or cerebral vasculitis are described. Epilepsy, chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy, muscle involvement and myasthenia gravis are also reported. The central nervous system can be affected in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection because of vasculitis associated with HCV-related cryoglobulinemia. Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) is a disease caused by multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA. It is characterized by peripheral neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, deafness, leukoencephalopathy, and gastrointestinal symptoms due to visceral neuropathy. Neurological manifestations can be the consequence of vitamin B1, nicotinamide, vitamin B12, vitamin D, or vitamin E deficiency and from nutritional deficiency states following gastric surgery.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is an intestinal inflammatory disease of unknown origin that is sometimes associated with cutaneous manifestations. These skin lesions are usually nonspecific (erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme and pyoderma gangrenosum) and should be differentiated from the cutaneous lesions corresponding to the typical histological pattern of CD; most of these extend directly from the involved bowel. Noncaseating granulomatous infiltration in skin anatomically distant from areas of gastrointestinal CD and separated by normal skin is extremely rare. This entity, known as metastatic Crohn's disease, can be the first symptom of CD or even more unusually can appear during the course of the disease.We report the case of a 9-year-old boy, previously diagnosed with ileocolic and perianal CD, who had been receiving treatment with mesalazine, prednisone and 6-mercaptopurine for 3 years. He presented with swelling of the penis and scrotum of 2 weeks' evolution, without any other symptoms. Testicular ultrasound showed thickening of the scrotal wall and increased flux at this site. Skin biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas. Results of special staining techniques were negative for the presence of microorganisms. The prednisone dose was increased and metronidazole was added, with noticeable improvement in the lesions. Due to reappearance of cutaneous lesions when the prednisone dose was reduced, the patient currently receives maintenance treatment.},

In contrast, nutrition plays no major role in the development of the disease or in provoking an acute attack. During an acute attack of Crohn's disease, the application of oral (drinks) or tube feeding (enteral nutrition) can result in a substantial clinical improvement. The remission rate of this side effect-free therapy is, however, lower than that seen with steroids. The data available for diet therapy in ulcerative colitis are less unequivocal, but the effects are probably slight at best. During the remission phase, the patient should eat a balanced, vitamin-rich and varied normal diet that excludes all poorly tolerated foods: lactose intolerance in particular appears to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease. Known vitamin or mineral deficiencies should be corrected by appropriate dietary measures or supplementation. There is no such thing as a "Crohn's diet" or "colitis diet". The patient can be allowed to eat anything that is tolerated.},

As new indications the PEG for decompression in chronic intestinal obstruction and the questionable relative contraindications ascites, peritoneal carcinosis and Morbus Crohn are discussed. The common thread-pull through-technique is recommended in a slightly modified variation, according to direct puncture techniques of small intestine: the cannulas inserted in the intestine are fixed by an endoscopic alligator forceps, thus facilitating precise puncture and raising safety for the patient due to avoidance of dislocation. As complications local infections, implantation metastases and the buried bumper syndrome have to be mentioned and avoided. Alternative methods for PEG and different exchange systems for more comfort for the patients are discussed finally.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We did a randomised controlled trial to assess the benefit of maintenance infliximab therapy in patients with active Crohn's disease who respond to a single infusion of infliximab. METHODS: 573 patients with a score of at least 220 on the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) received a 5 mg/kg intravenous infusion of infliximab at week 0. After assessment of response at week 2, patients were randomly assigned repeat infusions of placebo at weeks 2 and 6 and then every 8 weeks thereafter until week 46 (group I), repeat infusions of 5 mg/kg infliximab at the same timepoints (group II), or 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 2 and 6 followed by 10 mg/kg (group III). The prespecified co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who responded at week 2 and were in remission (CDAI <150) at week 30 and the time to loss of response up to week 54 in patients who responded. Analyses of the co-primary endpoints were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: 335 (58%) patients responded to a single infusion of infliximab within 2 weeks. At week 30, 23 of 110 (21%) group I patients were in remission, compared with 44 of 113 (39%) group II (p=0.003) and 50 of 112 (45%) group III (p=0.0002) patients. Thus, patients in groups II and III combined were more likely to sustain clinical remission than patients in group I (odds ratio 2.7, 95% CI 1.6-4.6). Throughout the 54-week trial, the median time to loss of response was 38 weeks (IQR 15 to >54) and more than 54 weeks (21 to >54) for groups II and III, respectively, compared with 19 weeks (10-45) for group I (p=0.002 and p=0.0002, respectively). Infliximab safety was consistent with that seen in other trials of infliximab in Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. In particular, the incidence of serious infections was similar across treatment groups. INTERPRETATION: Patients with Crohn's disease who respond to an initial dose of infliximab are more likely to be in remission at weeks 30 and 54, to discontinue corticosteroids, and to maintain their response for a longer period of time, if infliximab treatment is maintained every 8 weeks.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous reports suggest an association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in adults. To date, only five children with both diseases have been described. The aim of the study was to describe the characteristics of children with IBD and ITP. METHODS: Cases were obtained from the pediatric gastroenterology community by means of the pediatric gastroenterology internet bulletin board in June 1999. Eight cases were submitted from seven medical centers. Medical records were reviewed by two pediatric gastroenterologists and a pediatric hematologist. RESULTS: The age range of the patients was 2.1 to 16.5 years, with a mean age of 9.6 +/- 5.2 years. Four children had ulcerative colitis, three had Crohn disease, and one had indeterminate colitis. All had colonic involvement of IBD. Of eight patients, three had IBD first, three had ITP first, and two had both simultaneously. At ITP diagnosis, platelet count was less than 10,000/mL in five children, 17,000/mL in one child, and 50,000 to 60,000/mL in two children. Of the three children diagnosed with ITP first, two initially had rectal bleeding at the time of ITP diagnosis. Bone marrow evaluations, performed in six of eight children, were consistent with ITP. Six of the eight children had chronic ITP, including three children who were 5 years of age or younger. Therapy for ITP included steroids (n = 6), intravenous immunoglobulin (n = 6), Rh o (D) intravenous immunoglobulin (n = 2), and splenectomy (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe the largest pediatric case series of children with IBD and ITP. More than 50% of the children had the chronic form of ITP. Most patients responded to conventional therapy for ITP and IBD.},

   abstract = {The primary function of the gastrointestinal system is to assist the intake and further processing of food and liquids. Besides that, it forms an anatomical barrier between the external environment and internal milieu. It is also highly important for its paracrine and endocrine function. Inflammatory bowel diseases, which frequently cause a gastrointestinal failure, form a specific group. Most frequently it is the ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Impaired integrity of the gastrointestinal mucosa and failure of protective mechanisms lead to the increased permeability of the intestinal wall for antigens derived from food, saprophytic bacteria and pathogenic microorganisms. When the gastrointestinal failure is threatening, factors determining its residual function become more important. As decisive reveals the severity and location of the primary disease. Previous surgeries and adaptation of the residual part of the gastrointestinal system are important, as well as the possibility of peroral or enteral nutrient intake. Depending on the presence of risk factors and the degree of residual gut function, some complications can be expected: dehydration, mineral disorders, symptoms of protein and energy depletion, infection, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. It is highly important to decide whether the gastrointestinal system will be included into or excluded from the process of realimentation. Critically ill patients with inflammatory bowel diseases should be treated at an intensive care unit.},

In Crohn disease, the provision of adequate protein and calories may not only improve symptoms but may be associated with acceleration of growth. In celiac disease, the dietary restriction of gluten is curative of the intestinal inflammation. In chronic nonspecific diarrhea and functional constipation, the provision of appropriate amounts of fiber and fluids may ameliorate symptoms. A thorough understanding of the role of diet is essential to the management of these disorders.},

   abstract = {AIM: To report the results of a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study in 13 patients affected by Crohn's disease with resistance to steroids. METHODS: The patients were treated long-term with oral tacrolimus, aiming to both resolve acute attacks and maintain remission. Tacrolimus was administered at the dose of 0.1--0.2 mg.day/kg and adjusted in order to achieve levels of 5--10 ng/mL; only mesalazine was continued concomitantly. Steroids and total parenteral nutrition were tapered when appropriate. RESULTS: Median treatment was 27.3 months. Only one patient dropped out due to adverse events. Crohn's disease activity index score significantly decreased after 6 months in 11 patients; for 1 year in nine of them, and 7 years in two of them. The inflammatory bowel disease life-quality questionnaire score significantly increased over the same periods. A marked drop in hospitalizations was recorded. In three out of six patients complete closure of fistulas occurred. Tacrolimus allowed total parenteral nutrition to be withdrawn in three out of five patients. Supplementation with low-dose steroids was required in five patients. Two patients underwent surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus therapy appears to be associated with both short- and long-term benefits, and may represent a therapeutic option in Crohn's disease when conventional therapies fail. This study encourages its use in controlled trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) is intestinotrophic, antisecretory, and transit-modulating in rodents, and it is mainly secreted from the intestinal mucosa of the terminal ileum and colon after food ingestion. We assessed the effect of GLP-2 on the gastrointestinal function in patients without a terminal ileum and colon who have functional short-bowel syndrome with severe malabsorption of wet weight (>1.5 kg/day) and energy (>2.3 MJ/day) and no postprandial secretion of GLP-2. METHODS: Balance studies were performed before and after treatment with GLP-2, 400 microg subcutaneously twice a day for 35 days, in 8 patients (4-17 years from last bowel resection; 6 with Crohn's disease). Four patients received home parenteral nutrition (mean residual jejunum, 83 cm), and 4 did not (mean ileum resection, 106 cm). Biopsy specimens were taken from jejunal/ileal stomas, transit was measured by scintigraphy, and body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Treatment with GLP-2 improved the intestinal absorption of energy 3.5% +/- 4.0% (mean +/- SD) from 49.9% to 53.4% (P = 0.04), wet weight 11% +/- 12% from 25% to 36% (P = 0.04), and nitrogen 4.7% +/- 5.4% from 47.4% to 52.1% (P = 0.04). Body weight increased 1.2 +/- 1.0 kg (P = 0.01), lean body mass increased 2.9 +/- 1.9 kg (P = 0.004), fat mass decreased 1.8 +/- 1.3 kg (P = 0.007), and 24-hour urine creatinine excretion increased (P = 0.02). The time to 50% gastric emptying of solids increased 30 +/- 16 minutes from 89 to 119 minutes (P < 0.05). Small bowel transit time was not changed. Crypt depth and villus height were increased in 5 and 6 patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with GLP-2 improves intestinal absorption and nutritional status in short-bowel patients with impaired postprandial GLP-2 secretion in whom the terminal ileum and the colon have been resected.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased incidence of thromboembolic events. This risk may be caused by an increased frequency of thrombophilic mutations such as factor V Leiden G1691A (FVL), prothrombin G20210A (PT), or methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase C667T (MTHFR). Prevalence rates of heterozygous mutations in FVL, PT, and MTHFR are reported for whites (1.8%, 1.3%, 26.6%, respectively), blacks (0.8%, 0.3%, and 12.4%, respectively), and Hispanics (1.2%, 2.4%, and 41.5%, respectively). We sought to determine the prevalence of these thrombophilic mutations in a large cohort of children with IBD. METHODS: Children aged 21 years or younger with IBD were genotyped for FVL, PT, and MTHFR mutations by polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction enzyme digestion. Prevalence rates were compared with established rates in the respective populations. RESULTS: Of 92 patients enrolled, 89 (62 with Crohn disease, 24 with ulcerative colitis, and 3 with indeterminate colitis) had genotype results available. The mean age was 13.3 +/- 4.2 years (range, 2-21 years). Statistical analysis was performed on 89 FVL, PT, and MTHFR allele pairs. Polymerase chain reaction genotyping identified 5 patients with heterozygous FVL mutations, 3 patients heterozygous for the PT mutation, and 36 patients heterozygous and 4 patients homozygous for the MTHFR mutation. The thrombophilic allele mutation frequencies in our sample were not significantly different from predicted weighted average values: FVL, 2.8% versus 1.5%; PT, 1.7% versus 1.1%; and MTHFR, 24.7% versus 24.4%. In 24 patients with a family history of thrombosis, 1 was heterozygous for FVL and for MTHFR, 1 was heterozygous for FVL and homozygous for MTHFR, 2 were heterozygous for PT, and 9 were heterozygous MTHFR. There was no significant correlation between family history of thrombosis and presence of a thrombophilic mutation. The four patients with homozygous mutations for MTHFR, two of whom also were heterozygous for FVL, did not have either a personal history of thrombosis or a family history of thrombotic events. Two patients had thrombotic events without mutations in these genotypes: one had protein S deficiency and the other had no identifiable cause. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of genetic mutations that predispose to hypercoagulable states does not appear to correlate with the prevalence of IBD or to thromboembolic events in patients with IBD. There was no statistical difference between the proportions of the mutated allele frequency in our study patients and the general population.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Serology is reported to be helpful in evaluating children for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and distinguishing chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) from Crohn's disease (CD). The markers include perinuclear staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) for CUC and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) for CD. In the clinical setting, hemoglobin (Hgb) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are commonly performed for screening symptomatic children for IBD. We examined whether there was an additional benefit of serology in addition to specific symptoms and routine laboratory tests in screening for IBD. METHOD: Medical record data was reviewed on children investigated for IBD from February 1999 to April 2001. Children were included if they had blood analyzed for pANCA and ASCA, Hgb, ESR, and colonoscopy as part of their assessment. RESULTS: Of 177 cases reviewed, 51 were diagnosed with CUC, 39 with CD, and 26 other inflammatory conditions. Visible rectal bleeding was the most discriminating symptom (occurred in 60/90 cases of IBD and 5/61 without IBD). There was a significant difference between the proportion with CUC positive for pANCA (42/51) and those with abnormal Hgb and ESR (30/51) (p < 0.05), but not between children with CD who were ASCA positive (18/39) and those with abnormal Hgb and ESR (26/39) (p = 0.27). The sensitivity and specificity of combined pANCA and ASCA was 68% and 92%, respectively. For the combination of Hgb, ESR, and the presence of rectal bleeding the respective values were 86% and 67%. Serology combined with Hgb and ESR and rectal bleeding as independent factors significantly (p < 0.05) improved sensitivity (89%) but reduced specificity (60%). Screening with the combination of rectal bleeding, Hgb, and ESR identified 86% (77/90) patients with IBD prior to an endoscopic procedure. A further 3 of 90 (3.3%) screened positive with the addition of serology. CONCLUSION: Serology tests have a high degree of specificity for IBD while routine laboratory test have a higher sensitivity. When serology is combined with rectal bleeding, Hgb, and ESR, the sensitivity of screening children for IBD is significantly improved. However the large majority of children with IBD can be identified with a clinical history and routine laboratory tests as needing an endoscopic procedure with little benefit of adding serology.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Non-traumatic perforation of the small intestine (NTPSI) is a rare entity. It is possible that nowadays, the etiology of NTPSI has changed and that mortality might be lower. The aim of this study was to compare a recent series with previous series published in the literature. METHODOLOGY: During 13 years (1984-1996), 13 patients were diagnosed by laparotomy and histology as cases of NTPSI. RESULTS: The various etiologies of the perforations were: Crohn's disease in 6 (46%) patients, an ingested foreign body in 3 (23%) patients, primary intestinal malignancies (B-cell high-grade lymphoma and leiomyosarcoma) in 2, an internal hernia and an unclear etiology ("idiopathic") in 1 patient each. The symptoms were non-specific and an abdominal X-ray showed free-air in only 1 of 11 patients. Only one patient died postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: NTPSI remains a rare entity with an incidence of 1 case/year/350,000 population. Compared to seven previous series from industrialized countries, it seems that Crohn's disease has recently become the major etiology for NTPSI, probably due to the increasing prevalence of this disease. It is possible that many of the frequent "idiopathic" cases diagnosed in the past were due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. While in developing countries, typhoid fever remains a major cause of NTPSI, opportunistic infections are recently reported in industrialized countries. The diagnosis of NTPSI is usually made at laparotomy. In most cases, resection and primary anastomosis is appropriate. Mortality rates might be lower than in the past.},

The aim of this study was to investigate IBD tissues for different bacterial population groups harbouring the mucosal surface and/or invading the mucosa. METHODS: Tissue sections from surgical resections from the terminal ileum and/or the colon from 24 IBD patients (12 active ulcerative colitis (UC), 12 active Crohn disease (CD)) and 14 non-IBD controls were studied by fluorescent in situ hybridization on a quantifiable basis. RESULTS: More bacteria were detected on the mucosal surface of IBD patients than on those of non-IBD controls (P < 0.05). Bacterial invasion of the mucosa was evident in 83.3% of colonic specimens from the UC patients, in 55.6% of the ileal and in 25% of the colonic specimens from the CD patients, but no bacteria were detected in the tissues of the controls. Colonic UC specimens were colonized by a variety of organisms, such as bacteria belonging to the gamma subdivision of Proteobacteria, the Enterobacteriaceae, the Bacteroides/Prevotella cluster, the Clostridium histolyticum/Clostridium lituseburense group, the Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectale group, high G + C Gram-positive bacteria, or sulphate-reducing bacteria, while CD samples harboured mainly bacteria belonging to the former three groups. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic events in CD and UC may be associated with different alterations in the mucosal flora of the ileum and colon.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To discover the prevalence and significance of lymphonodular hyperplasia (LNH) of the lower gastrointestinal tract, the authors did a retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of children using colonoscopy to evaluate persistent and severe gastrointestinal symptoms. The authors also sought to discover in more detail how often subjects with LNH of the terminal ileum (TI) or colon show an association with food allergy (FA). METHODS: The analysis included a consecutive series of 140 children evaluated at the Oulu University Hospital using colonoscopy, which extended to the TI in 74 of these children. A total of 102 patients underwent gastroduodenoscopy. The disease category was assessed using endoscopic, histopathologic, and clinical information. To diagnose FA, a masked or an open food challenge was administered to all patients who aroused any suspicion of food-related exacerbation of symptoms. RESULTS: Of 140 patients, LNH of the colon was diagnosed in 46 subjects, 9 of 38 patients had colitis, 1 of 8 patients had Crohn disease, and 36 of the remaining 94 subjects did not have colitis. Twelve patients of the 22 with LNH of the colon (55%) showed concomitant LNH on the bulb of the duodenum. Lymphonodular hyperplasia of the TI was diagnosed in 53 of the 74 subjects in whom TI could be visualized. It was seen in most patients without colitis (80%), in one half the subjects with colitis (48%), and in one quarter of those with Crohn disease (25%). Among the whole study group 37 (26%) could be defined as having FA. It was more prevalent in patients with (52%) than in those without (13%) LNH of the colon ( P < 0.001). The presence of LNH in the TI also showed some association with FA ( P < 0.05), but less than did LNH of the colon. CONCLUSION: We consider LNH on the mucosa of the colon or TI common but not an innocent bystander. Significantly related to a diagnosis of gastrointestinal FA in this study, it is an expression of mucosal immune response. If detected on the colon, FA should be considered, whereas if present in TI, it may be related to FA but also to a variety of other immunologically active disease states.},

Supportive role of nutrition is to correct malnutrition, to heal specific nutritional deficiencies and enable normal growth, development and sexual maturation of children. Enteral nutrition, however, could be a primary therapeutical aspect as a change for pharmacological treatment. In this role, as succesful as steroids, initiate remmission in patients with intermediate or severe forms of disease without steroid like side. In adults, three meta-analyses confirmed therapeutical effects of enteral nutrition with remission rate of 60%, although steroids were more successful. These reports were valid only in Crohns disease. In ulcerative colitis neither parenteral or enteral nutrition had therapeutical effects without other types of treatment.},

   abstract = {In Crohn's disease, severe skeletal demineralization, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and muscle weakness can occur. This may be caused by impaired vitamin D absorption, resulting from extensive intestinal disease and resection of duodenum and jejunum, where vitamin D is absorbed. We report a 57-year-old woman with a long history of Crohn's disease and short-bowel syndrome who had only 2 feet of small intestine remaining after 3 bowel resections. She was taking a daily multivitamin containing 400 IU of vitamin D(3) and was dependent on total parenteral nutrition that contained 200 IU of vitamin D and calcium (18 mEq in a 1-L bag infused over 8 hours daily) for a period of 36 months. Despite the above replacement, she complained of bone pain and muscle weakness, and she continued to be vitamin D-deficient with a 25(OH)D level <20 ng/mL. She was then exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation in a tanning bed wearing a 1-piece bathing suit for 10 minutes, 3 times a week for 6 months at the General Clinical Research Center, Boston University Medical Center. She tolerated the irradiation well without evidence of erythema. After 4 weeks, her serum 25(OH)D level increased by 357% from 7 to 32 ng/mL, parathyroid hormone level decreased by 52% from 92 to 44 pg/mL, and the serum calcium level increased from 7.8 to 8.5 mg/dL. After 6 months of UVB treatment, her serum 25(OH)D level was maintained in the normal range and was free of muscle weakness, and bone and muscle pain.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the effectiveness of controlled ileal release (CIR) budesonide in children can be extrapolated from adult studies, there are currently no data available concerning the effects of CIR budesonide therapy on linear growth. In the absence of controlled, prospective pediatric clinical trials, we reviewed the outcomes, particularly linear growth, of children and adolescents given CIR budesonide to treat active intestinal inflammation and to maintain remission. METHODS: Thirty-two children (20 males) aged 14.1 +/- 2.7 years with Crohn disease of the distal ileum with or without right colon involvement were treated for active Crohn disease (baseline Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index, 34 +/- 14) with 9 mg daily of CIR budesonide through the Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases program. RESULTS: At first follow-up visit 8.7 +/- 6.0 weeks later, 19 of 32 (59%) were judged by the physician to have responded. In the subset of 22 patients who had laboratory tests repeated at the first follow-up visit, their Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index fell from 33 +/- 14 to 22 +/- 16 (P = 0.001). The Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index score fell to less than 15 (cut-off score remission) in 29%. Six prepubertal responders continued to receive 6 mg CIR budesonide for 6 to 13 months. Five of the 6 experienced only mild or no gastrointestinal symptoms and gained weight. Nevertheless, their mean height velocity was only 2.3 +/- 1.0 cm/year, and none grew at a rate of more than 4cm/year whilst receiving CIR budesonide. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide grade III evidence of modest effectiveness of CIR budesonide in children with active Crohn disease confined to the ileum with or without right colon involvement. The subnormal growth observed with continued therapy is concerning and may reflect either inadequately controlled intestinal inflammation or direct suppression of linear growth, as is observed with conventional corticosteroids. Randomized controlled pediatric trials of CIR budesonide must include parameters of linear growth as an outcome variable.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The aim of our study was to review retrospectively the frequency of pancreatitis in 124 pediatric patients (54.8% boys, 45.2% girls; 97 with Crohn disease, 16 with ulcerative colitis and 11 with undetermined colitis). Diagnostic criterion of pancreatitis was an increase of amylasemia > or = +2 SD of the normal with or without evocative clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Symptomatic or asymptomatic pancreatitis was found in 27% (respectively 14.5 and 12.5%). Pancreatitis was significantly more frequent in girls as compared to boys (P = 0.04). Symptomatic pancreatitis was moderate and non complicated, often recurrent. It occurred mainly during active and severe diseases (P = 0.006). The localizations of IBD were not discriminant. Strong relation with drug was found in 25% of pancreatitis mainly due to azathioprine or 5-aminosalicylic acid, and salazopyrin. Duodenal localisation of Crohn disease or hepatobiliary complications were found associated with pancreatitis in 18% and 15% respectively. CONCLUSION: These data suggest the high incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic pancreatitis in children with IBD, the importance of its regular monitoring but also its multifactorial causes. Precise diagnosis of pancreatitis in pediatric IBD has to be done in order to avoid inappropriate drug pancreatitis diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Children with Crohn disease are at increased risk for osteopenia and osteoporosis. Early development of osteopenia can increase the lifetime risk for fractures and may be amenable to early intervention. The gold standard for measuring bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk is dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), but this involves some radiation and specialized programs for measuring BMD in children. Bone density Z scores were evaluated with quantitative ultrasound (QUS) using a novel portable device and were compared with DXA in children with Crohn disease. METHODS: Thirty-five children with documented Crohn disease (mean age 14.3 +/- 2.3 years) had speed of sound measured at the left radius and left tibia. Normative values for QUS Z scores were calculated from a cohort of 1,110 healthy children. A subgroup of 26 children with Crohn disease underwent both QUS and DXA. Z scores were calculated and compared for both groups. RESULTS: The mean Z score using lumbar spine DXA was -1.04 +/- 1.51 SD, compared with -0.15 +/- 1.49 SD, using the lowest Z score for QUS ( < 0.05). Using height adjusted DXA, 50% of children with Crohn disease had osteopenia, whereas QUS detected only 19.2% of these children ( < 0.05). Significantly fewer cases of osteopenia were detected using QUS at Z scores up to -2 SD. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative ultrasound performed on the radius and tibia may not be sensitive enough to pick up osteopenia in children with Crohn disease.},

It has recently been introduced for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in Europe, Canada, and Israel. Benign intracranial hypertension has rarely been associated with corticosteroid therapy but has not been reported in association with budesonide therapy. Three adolescents with Crohn's disease and poor nutritional status developed benign intracranial hypertension while receiving oral budesonide. All three patients had previously received multiple courses of prednisone during the course of their disease, without developing intracranial hypertension. Benign intracranial hypertension resolved after medication withdrawal and did not recur with subsequent use of prednisone. Evaluation for benign intracranial hypertension should be considered in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who develop headache while receiving oral budesonide. This side effect may be associated with poor nutritional status.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unknown, although in recent years more data have become available. The contribution of genetic and environmental factors is evident, and the luminal bacterial flora plays a major role in the initiation and perpetuation of chronic IBD. Animal models of IBD have shown that colitis does not occur in a germ-free environment. In human IBD, inflammation is present in parts of the gut containing the highest bacterial concentrations. Moreover, the terminal ileum, caecum and rectum are areas of relative stasis, providing prolonged mucosal contact with luminal contents. Enhanced mucosal permeability may play a pivotal role in maintaining a chronic inflammatory state, due to a genetic predisposition or as a result of direct contact with bacteria or their products. A detective epithelial barrier may cause a loss of tolerance to the normal enteric flora. Furthermore, an increased mucosal absorption of viable bacteria and bacterial products is found in IBD. Serum and secreted antibodies are increased and mucosal T-lymphocytes that recognize luminal bacteria are present. However, there is evidence that the immune system reacts over aggressively towards the normal luminal flora rather than the flora being altered in IBD. Several approaches have been used in attempts to discover a specific microbial agent in the cause of IBD. These include demonstration of the presence of organisms or specific antigens in affected tissues, culture of microbes firm the affected tissues, demonstration of serological responses to several agents, and localization and detection of individual pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences in affected tissue by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. So far, no specific micro-organism has been directly associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. Analysis of the luminal enteric flora, however, has revealed differences in the composition of this flora compared to healthy controls. In Crohn disease, concentrations of Bacteroides, Eubacteria and Peptostreptococcus are increased, whereas Bifidobacteria numbers are significantly reduced. Furthermore, in ulcerative colitis, concentrations of facultative anaerobic bacteria are increased. The arrival of new molecular techniques qualifying and quantifying the complex intestinal flora has induced a revival of interest in this microflora. Therapeutic approaches geared towards changing the environment at the mucosal border have been attempted by the use of elemental diets, total parenteral nutrition, surgical diversion of the faecal stream and antibiotics. Over the past few years, the use of probiotics in IBD and other intestinal disorders has gained attention. Strengthened by promising experimental data and commercial interests, research in this field is rapidly expanding. Manipulation of the colonic bacteria with antibiotic drugs and probiotic agents may prove to be more effective and better tolerated than immunosuppressants in the future.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Luminal nitric oxide increases in ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. The authors have previously used a minimally invasive method to demonstrate increased luminal nitric oxide in ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease of the colon. The aim of the current study was to determine whether this method could be applied to identify inflammatory activity in ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease in children. METHODS: Thirty-six children (18 of whom had active disease) with inflammatory bowel disease localized to the colon were studied. The control group comprised 12 healthy children. To measure nitric oxide, a silicon catheter with an inflatable balloon was inserted into the rectum and inflated with 10 mL of nitric oxide-free air. After a 10-minute incubation time, the air was withdrawn and nitric oxide concentrations were immediately analyzed using a chemiluminescence technique. RESULTS: Children with active ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease of the colon had greatly increased luminal nitric oxide concentrations in the rectum (8,840 +/- 5,120 and 15,170 +/- 4,757 parts per billion [ppb], respectively) compared with controls (77 +/- 17 ppb) (P < 0.001). Children with nonactive ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease displayed low concentrations of rectal nitric oxide (356 +/- 110 and 188 +/- 55 ppb, respectively), which was not different from that of healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Rectal nitric oxide measurement is a feasible and useful method for monitoring disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease, especially in children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ultrafine and fine particles are potent adjuvants in antigen-mediated immune responses, and cause inflammation in susceptible individuals. Following recent findings that microparticles accumulate in the phagocytes of intestinal lymphoid aggregates, this study is the first investigation of whether their reduction in the diet improves the symptoms of Crohn's disease. METHODS: In a double blind study, 20 patients with active corticosteroid-treated ileal or ileo-colonic Crohn's disease randomly received either a low microparticle diet (trial group; n = 10) or a control diet (n = 10) for 4 months. Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and corticosteroid requirements were compared. RESULTS: One patient in each group was withdrawn. In the trial group there was a progressive decrease in CDAI from entry (392 +/- 25) to month 4 (145 +/- 47) (P = 0.002 vs control group) and seven patients were in remission (CDAI <150). In contrast, the control group had returned to baseline levels (302 +/- 28 on entry and 295 +/- 25 at month 4), with none in remission. Corticosteroid intake was reduced more in the trial group although this did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: A low microparticle diet may be effective in the management of ileal Crohn's disease and could explain the efficacy of elemental diets, which similarly are low in microparticles.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a modern Western disease characterised by transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. It is of unknown aetiology, but evidence suggests that it results from a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Bacterial-sized microparticles (0.1-1.0 microm) are potent adjuvants in model antigen-mediated immune responses and are increasingly associated with disease. Microparticles of TiO2 and aluminosilicate accumulate in macrophages of human gut-associated lymphoid tissue where the earliest signs of lesions in Crohn's disease are observed. Dietary microparticles are of endogenous or exogenous origin. Endogenous microparticles dominate and are calcium phosphate (most probably hydroxyapatite), which precipitates in the lumen of the mid-distal gastrointestinal tract due to secretion of Ca and phosphate in the succus entericus. Exogenous dietary microparticles are contaminants (soil and/or dust) and food additives. TiO2, for example, is a food colourant, and aluminosilicates are anti-caking agents, although some aluminosilicates occur as natural contaminants. Food additives alone account for ingestion of approximately 10(12) particles/person per d. Possible mechanisms for the role of exogenous and endogenous dietary microparticles in promoting toleragenic or immune responses of gastrointestinal mucosal phagocytosis are discussed. In a double-blind randomised pilot study we have shown that a diet low in Ca and exogenous microparticles appears to alleviate the symptoms of ileal Crohn's disease, with a significant (P= 0.002) improvement in the Crohn's disease activity index. A multi-centre trial and further mechanistic studies at the cellular level are underway.},

The aim of our study was to document the prevalence of this complication and possible associated factors. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of case notes of 107 patients on HPN was performed. Deranged LFT was defined as any biochemical parameter of LFT that is 1.5 times above the reference range. RESULTS: There were 39 males and the median age was 51 (range 20-73) years old. Median duration of HPN was 40 (range 6-252) months. Underlying diagnoses were Crohn's disease (40%), ischaemic bowel disease in 28.1% (arterial or venous), post-surgical intestinal adhesion and fistula (16.9%) and others (21.7%). The mean energy intake from HPN was 1003+/-544(SD) kcal/day with 845+/-474 kcal/day from glucose, 157+/-127 kcal/day from fat and mean nitrogen intake was 6.2+/-3.6 g/day. Raised alkaline phosphatase (mean 197+/-143(SD)U/L) was the most common abnormality (40 patients). Two patients had hyperbilirubinaemia; one patient had hereditary spherocytosis and in the other patient, the cause could be attributed to HPN with bilirubin of 54 micromol/l. Fifty-one patients (47.7%) had deranged LFT as judged from raised parameters on LFT. Abnormality in LFT was transient in nine patients. For the other 42 patients (39%), abnormalities in LFT remained stable for median duration of follow-up of 18.5 (range 3-180) months. No patients developed decompensated liver disease. On univariate analysis, length of small bowel of less than 100 cm, a higher total caloric intake from HPN (mean 1117+/-486 kcal against 907+/-576 kcal, P<0.05), and higher daily caloric intake from HPN in relation to calculated daily energy requirement (70+/-32% against 57+/-36%) were noted to be significantly associated with deranged LFT. However, on multivariate analysis, length of small bowel of less than 100 cm was the only significant variable for deranged LFT. CONCLUSION: Our finding showed the prevalence of deranged LFT to be 39% and raised alkaline phosphatase was the most common abnormality. Length of small bowel of less than 100 cm was found to be a significant independent variable for deranged LFT and the reason for this observation could be due to higher parenteral caloric intake. In our experience, LFT abnormalities are associated with a good prognosis as none of the patients developed decompensated liver disease.},

   abstract = {The aetiology and pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) remain to be elucidated. In addition to genetic influences and immune mediated cytokine gene activation, various specific and non-specific environmental factors are considered to be associated with the induction and/or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The incidence of CD is higher in urban areas than in the rural, environment. Patients with CD have a higher dietary intake of sucrose, refined carbohydrates and (omega-6 fatty acids, and reduced intake of fruit and vegetables. Elemental and exclusion diets are known to be effective in CD. However, patients relapse on returning to a normal diet, which suggests that there is something in an ordinary diet which, on penetrating the mucosal defence mechanism of the terminal ileum, generates a pathogenic immune process. It has been suggested that the urban diet contains large quantities of inert inorganic non-nutrient microparticles, such as natural contaminants (soil and dust), food additives and anti-caking agents which may combine with intestinal luminal components such as bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharides, to form antigenic particles. When these are taken up by mucosal mononuclear cells they can mediate immune reactions both locally in the mucosa and in the systemic circulation. In a study published in this issue of the journal, CD patients allocated to a low microparticle diet experienced a significant reduction in CD activity and the requirement for corticosteroids, when compared with the control group on a normal diet. The main advantage of the microparticle free diet, when compared with elemental and exclusion diets, is its enhanced tolerance by the patients and its relatively low cost. The preliminary results may give an explanation for the rising incidence of the disease in urban society. The results of an on-going multi-centre trial by the authors are awaited with interest.},

Parenteral iron therapy is rarely prescribed because of concern about potential side effects. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of total dose intravenous (TDI) iron therapy. METHODS: Charts of all the pediatric patients with IBD who received TDI iron therapy between February of 1994 and February of 2000 were reviewed. RESULTS: Seventy patients (20 with ulcerative colitis and 50 with Crohn disease) received a total of 119 TDI iron dextran infusions. Thirty-four patients qualified for the efficacy analysis. The average increase in hemoglobin concentration was 2.9 g/dL, (P < 0.0001). Eleven immediate hypersensitivity reactions developed in 10 patients (9% of the total number of infusions). None of the reactions was life threatening and none required hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Total dose intravenous infusion of iron dextran, when appropriately used, is a safe and potentially efficacious treatment for children with inflammatory bowel disease and iron deficiency anemia who are unresponsive to or noncompliant with oral iron therapy.},

Our aim was to evaluate early onset IBD in patients 5 yr of age and younger. METHODS: Medical records of patients diagnosed with early onset IBD at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between 1977 and 2000 were reviewed. Patients were divided into three categories: those with Crohn's disease (CD), those with ulcerative colitis (UC), and those with indeterminant colitis (IC). RESULTS: A total of 82 patients fulfilled the criteria. In 12 patients (15%), the IBD diagnosis was changed during the course of illness. At the end of the follow-up period, linear growth failure was present in 10 of 35 (29%) children with CD, one of 30 (3%) with UC, and three of 17 (18%) with IC. Failure to thrive was a frequent presenting symptom in children with CD (44%) and IC (39%), whereas in all four patients with UC and failure to thrive the diagnosis was subsequently changed to CD or IC. A high proportion of patients with CD had large bowel (89%), and perianal (34%) disease. None of the tested patients were positive for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA), and 10 tested positive for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (three of five patients with CD, five of seven with UC, and two of three with IC). CONCLUSIONS: Failure to thrive, at the time of presentation, is indicative of a final diagnosis of CD or IC, not UC. Linear growth failure is a common finding in patients with early onset CD. A high proportion of patients with CD have failure to thrive, colonic, and perianal disease. The IBD serology panel is of limited clinical relevance in providing definitive diagnostic information in this pediatric population.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify changes over the past decade in physicians' attitudes regarding the use of immunomodulatory agents for the treatment of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we surveyed the membership of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition and compared the responses to those from an identical survey performed in 1990. METHODS: Surveys were mailed to 718 physicians in January, 2000. All surveys returned by mid-February were analyzed, and results compared to those obtained in the 1990 survey. RESULTS: Thirty-nine percent (278/718) of surveys were returned, compared to 27% (105/385) in 1990. Overall, 93% of the current survey's respondents agreed with the statement "immunomodulatory agents are effective in the treatment of children and adolescents with IBD." Compared to 1990, significant increases (p < 0.0001) were noted in the percentage of respondents who prescribe immunomodulatory agents to children with all forms of IBD. Indications for immunomodulation that showed significant increases (p < 0.001) since 1990 included treatment of perianal and non-perianal fistulae; growth failure; use as initial, primary therapy; and use as prophylaxis against postoperative recurrence. 6-Mercaptopurine and azathioprine continue to be the agents prescribed by the greatest percentage of respondents. More physicians are willing to use immunomodulatory agents in children younger than 5 yr, and duration of use is longer than in 1990. Currently, physicians seem to favor the use of immunomodulatory agents over colectomy for children with either intractable ulcerative or Crohn's colitis. Most respondents remain concerned about potential bone marrow and immune suppression, but concerns regarding malignancy, teratogenicity, and infertility have lessened. CONCLUSION: These survey findings document that pediatric gastroenterologists have widely accepted the use of immunomodulators in the treatment of children and adolescents with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanism of action of elemental diet in Crohn's disease treatment, is unknown. Alteration of bacterial flora, low antigenicity, low fat content and improvement of nutritional status are postulated to play a role in the anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet. AIM: To determine whether elemental diet or its modifications has a direct anti-inflammatory effect on colonic tissue biopsies in vitro. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Colonic or ileal biopsies from 39 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and control patients were incubated for 24 hours with enteral diets in which nitrogen sources were amino acids as in elemental diet, casein or whey. Tissues were incubated with elemental diet, casein or whey, at dilutions of 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20 in Waymouth's complete medium; a medium control was also included. Tissue viability was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and interleukin-10 concentrations in supernatants were measured by immunoassay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). RESULTS: Incubation of tissues from Crohn's disease with elemental diet resulted in an increase in the ratio of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta vs control statistically significant at 1:10 (89.6+/-17 vs 45.7+/-9. 1, p<0.05). Incubation of Crohn's tissue with casein resulted in a significant increase of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio at dilutions 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5 (101.8+/-22.0, p=0.05, 142.8+/-24.6, p<0.05; 109.7+/-25.0, p=0.05). In ulcerative colitis tissue and non-inflamed non-inflammatory bowel disease control tissue, no significant increase in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio was seen after incubation with elemental diet, casein and whey. CONCLUSION: Elemental diet incubation increases anti-inflammatory:proinflammatory cytokine ratio in Crohn's disease and this anti-inflammatory effect is not specifically due to amino acid composition, as diets containing casein have similar anti-inflammatory effects.},

   abstract = {Intestinal failure requiring total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Intestinal transplantation can be a lifesaving option for patients with intestinal failure who develop serious TPN-related complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate survival, surgical technique, and patient care in patients treated with intestinal transplantation. We reviewed data collected from 95 consecutive intestinal transplants performed between December 1994 and November 2000 at the University of Miami. Fifty-four of the patients undergoing intestinal transplantation were children and 41 were adults. The series includes 49 male and 46 female patients. The causes of intestinal failure included mesenteric venous thrombosis (n = 12), necrotizing enterocolitis (n = 11), gastroschisis (n = 11), midgut volvulus (n = 9), desmoid tumor (n = 8), intestinal atresia (n = 6), trauma (n = 5), Hirschsprung's disease (n = 5), Crohn's disease (n = 5), intestinal pseudoobstruction (n = 4), and others (n = 19). The procedures performed included 27 isolated intestine transplants, 28 combined liver and intestine transplants, and 40 multivisceral transplants. Since 1998, we have been using daclizumab (Zenepax) for induction of immunosuppression and zoom videoendoscopy for graft surveillance. We began to use intense cytomegalovirus prophylaxis and systemic drainage of the portal vein. The 1-year patient survival rates for isolated intestinal, liver and intestinal, and multivisceral transplantations were 75%, 40%, and 48%, respectively. Since 1998, the 1-year patient and graft survival rates for isolated intestinal transplants have been 84% and 72%, respectively. The causes of death were as follows: sepsis after rejection (n = 14), respiratory failure (n = 8), sepsis (n = 6), multiple organ failure (n = 4), arterial graft infection (n = 3), aspergillosis (n = 2), post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease (n = 2), intracranial hemorrhage (n = 2), and fungemia, chronic rejection, graft vs. host disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, pancreatitis, pulmonary embolism, and viral encephalitis (n = 1 case of each). Intestinal transplantation can be a lifesaving alternative for patients with intestinal failure. The prognosis after intestinal transplantation is better when it is performed before the onset of liver failure. Rejection monitoring with zoom videoendoscopy and new immunosuppressive therapy with sirolimus, daclizumab, and campath-1H have contributed to the improvement in patient survival.},

Careful nutritional monitoring and appropriate nutritional intervention throughout all stages of disease should be an integral part of the multidisciplinary management approach to IBD. In terms of primary therapy, polymeric and elemental enteral diets are an effective therapy for patients with acute Crohn's disease, offering an unrivaled safety profile and significant nutritional benefits. Enteral diets should be considered as primary therapy in children with Crohn's disease, especially in those with poor nutritional status or growth impairment, and in patients with severe drug-induced side effects. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) does not have a primary therapeutic role in patients with IBD.},

This study sought to assess the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the instrument. METHODS: The readability statistics and number of unanswered questions were assessed among 147 patients (97 CD, 50 UC) with mean age 14.4 +/- 2.2 years (range 9.2-18.0 years) using the self-administered questionnaire. Internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach's alpha and test-retest reliability using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Construct validity was based on a priori hypotheses. Mean total scores were compared by ANOVA among patients grouped according to disease activity and disease severity within the past year. RESULTS: The readability statistic showed a Flesch-Kincaid Grade level of 4.5. Only 0.68% of questions were left blank. Reliability was excellent with Cronbach's alpha = 0.96, and an ICC of 0.90 in patients with stable disease over a two-week period (n = 32). The mean total IMPACT score for patients with quiescent disease (180 +/- 32) was significantly higher (better QOL) than for those with active disease (146 +/- 31 for mild, 133 +/- 34 for moderate/severe) (P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The IMPACT questionnaire is a valid and reliable reflection of health-related quality of life of older children and adolescents with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Lactase deficiency is commonly found in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our aim was to determine its prevalence in children with IBD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective and descriptive analysis of patients with symptomatic IBD whose mucosal lactase activity was measured on duodenal biopsies obtained during gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluations. Age- and gender-matched controls were chosen randomly from a group with chronic abdominal pain. RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients with IBD were identified from January 1994 to December 2000. Seventy-nine (71%) had Crohn disease, and 33 (29%) had ulcerative colitis. Forty-five (40%) of all IBD patients (29 with Crohn disease and 16 with ulcerative colitis) had low lactase activity levels (< 15 microM/min/gm). The prevalence of lactase deficiency in patients with IBD was 37% (38 of 103) in white patients and 78% (7 of 9) in blacks. Thirty-four of 112 controls (30%) had lactase deficiency. IBD patients were more likely to be lactase deficient than the controls, but the difference was not statistically significant ( = 0.162). Normal duodenal histology was found in 67% of lactase-deficient IBD patients compared with 82% in lactase-sufficient IBD patients. The frequency of duodenal inflammation did not differ significantly between lactase-deficient and -sufficient patients with IBD ( = 0.068). CONCLUSIONS: More than one third of pediatric patients with IBD have lactase deficiency, which is not significantly different from non-IBD patients with chronic abdominal pain. The majority of lactase-deficient patients with IBD have normal duodenal biopsy results. Lactase activity from small bowel biopsy specimens can be measured at the time of initial endoscopy. Reevaluation, either by small bowel biopsy or the breath hydrogen test, may then be considered during follow-up of symptomatic patients.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Crohn's disease is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa, which can be successfully treated with enteral nutrition. In this study, the activities of the antioxidant metalloenzymes copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and selenium-glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPx) were determined in erythrocyte lysates from children with Crohn's disease. Both enzymes exhibited significantly lower activities relative to healthy control subjects: 1.55 +/- 0.33 vs 2.13 +/- 0.75 SOD U mg(-1) protein (p < 0.025) for Cu/Zn-SOD, and 61.9 +/- 17.7 vs 93.6 +/- 28.7 mU mg(-1) protein (p < 0.01) for Se-GPx. Treatment of patients with a specific polymeric diet, CT3211, for a period of 8 wk did not significantly alter the activities of the enzymes. In contrast, clinically, enteral nutritional therapy induced a remission in 13/14 children, and a significant fall in both median serum C-reactive protein and mean serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha levels. CONCLUSION: The results imply that the anti-inflammatory action of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is caused by a mechanism other than restitution of these antioxidant enzymes.},

   abstract = {Redistribution of white adipose tissue is a long-term symptom of several chronic diseases. Although the roles of adipocytes in acute illness have been thoroughly studied, how or why short-term responses of adipose tissue to disease sometimes produce long-term redistribution, and the causal relationship between the anatomical changes and the associated metabolic syndromes are poorly understood. The present paper reviews explanations for the redistribution of adipose tissue after infection with HIV, and in Crohn's disease; both conditions that share the peculiarity of selective expansion of certain adipose depots while others are depleted. HIV adipose tissue redistribution syndrome (HARS) develops gradually after several months of infection with the HIV both in untreated patients and in those taking protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Some current theories about the causes of HARS are critically assessed, and reasons presented for implicating local interactions between the immune system and perinodal adipocytes. Some evolutionary aspects of conspicuous long-term changes in the distribution of human adipose tissue are discussed. Adipose tissue acts as a social signal, indicating dietary history and previous exposure to pathogens. A distinctive symptom of Crohn's disease is selective enlargement of the mesenteric adipose tissue near the diseased lymph nodes and intestine. Perinodal adipocytes have site-specific properties not found in adipocytes from nodeless depots, such as perirenal and epididymal, that may equip them to interact locally with lymph-node lymphoid cells, making polyunsaturated fatty acids selectively and rapidly available to activated immune cells. Studies of the time course of activation of perinodal adipocytes via the lymph nodes they enclose indicate that prolonged or frequent stimulation recruits more adipocytes to control by immune cells, which may lead to selective enlargement of node-containing depots. These concepts suggest hypotheses about HARS and the anomalous development of mesenteric adipose tissue in Crohn's disease that could form the basis for further investigations.},

Although radiographic contrast studies are superior to endoscopy for diagnosing fistulas, endoscopic procedures have a definite role in the evaluation and management of fistulizing Crohn's disease. Endoscopy allows for tissue sampling, and provides information regarding the extent and severity of gastrointestinal inflammation, and the presence of such complications as strictures and cancer. Preoperative colonoscopy has particular value in assessing an enterocolonic fistula, and has important implications regarding the type of surgery performed. Endoscopic therapy for Crohn's fistula is less certain, but may allow for dilation of associated strictures, and may someday serve as a better delivery system for targeted anticytokine and immunologically based therapy.},

There have been few previous studies on the quality of life for children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: A cross-cultural comparison was performed to determine whether the concerns of children with IBD in the United Kingdom are ranked similarly to those of children with IBD in Canada. An item reduction questionnaire, developed from interviews with Canadian children with IBD, was scored by 53 British children with IBD for importance and frequency, as a questionnaire had been scored previously by 117 Canadian children. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between the mean scores (r = 0.831, P < 0.001) and ranks (r = 0.801, P < 0.001) for the 96 questions, and 43 of the 50 highest-ranking concerns corresponded for both populations. Confidence interval analysis showed a significant difference between the mean values for 21 of the 96 items; 20 of these 21 were ranked higher in the United Kingdom than they had been in Canada, suggesting that the frequency and/or degree of concern was greater for the British children with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related concerns of British children with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis correlate closely with those of Canadian children with those diseases. Further studies are needed to determine the sensitivity of individual questions, the most appropriate wording of these questions, and the optimal length for a proposed instrument to assess quality of life in children with IBD.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis remain medically incurable conditions with potentially significant morbidity. The treatment of children with these conditions therefore should seek to reduce or eliminate symptoms, optimize nutritional status, promote normal growth and development, prevent complications, and minimize the potential psychologic effects of chronic illness. Treatment strategies must seek to both induce and maintain clinical remission. For all but the most mildly affected children with Crohn's disease, a combination of nutritional and pharmacologic approaches is optimal. For those with ulcerative colitis, anti-inflammatory medication is necessary. Moderate to severe Crohn's disease acutely responds best to potent immunomodulatory therapy, eg, corticosteroids and infliximab. Either agent must be coupled with 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine to maintain long-term remission and to minimize toxicity. Particular attention must be paid to limit the growth suppression and other toxic effects of corticosteroids. Elemental or semielemental enteral nutrition also can induce remission effectively, but relapse is common after primary nutritional therapy is discontinued, mandating concomitant pharmacologic therapy with either 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine. The availability of 6-mercaptopurine/azathioprine metabolite testing allows optimization of immunomodulatory therapy, detection of noncompliance, and avoidance of potentially dangerous toxicity. Mild ulcerative colitis acutely responds to treatment with a 5-aminosalicylate medication. Long-term remission frequently can be maintained with the same medication. Moderate to severe disease activity requires potent immunomodulatory therapy if colectomy is to be avoided. Surgery is a potential cure for patients with ulcerative colitis, although the development of pouchitis after ileal pouch anal anastomosis is common and frequently requires long-term medical management. Surgery provides only palliative relief of complications in those with Crohn's disease. Emerging therapies, especially evolving biologic and probiotic agents, offer hope for better treatments in the years ahead.},

   abstract = {GOALS: Surgery accounts for one half, and hospitalizations for one third, of overall costs for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Infliximab induces remission and heals fistulas in CD but is more costly than traditional therapies. Its impact upon resource use in CD is unknown. STUDY: The medical records were reviewed for all CD patients managed at our institution for at least 1 full year both before and after initial infliximab infusion. The incidences of hospitalizations, hospitalized days, surgeries, endoscopies, radiologic examinations, outpatient and emergency room (ER) visits were studied (weighted according to time period). RESULTS: There were 79 patients (59% female, mean age 38.6 years). A decrease was seen in the annual incidence of all surgeries (38%, p < 0.01), gastrointestinal (GI) surgeries (18%, p < 0.05), endoscopies (43%, p < 0.01), ER visits (66%, p < 0.05), all outpatient visits (16%, p < 0.05), outpatient GI visits (20%, p < 0.01), all radiologic examinations (12%, p < 0.01), and non-plain films (13%, p < 0.01). Fistula patients (n = 37) had decreases in hospitalizations (59%, p < 0.05); GI surgeries (59%, p < 0.01); all surgeries (66%, p < 0.01); all, GI, and surgical outpatient visits (27%, 26%, and 70%, respectively, p < 0.05 for all); ER visits (64%, p < 0.05); all radiologic examinations (40%, p < 0.05); and non-plain films (61%, p < 0.05). Patients with luminal disease(n = 42) had decreases in endoscopies (52%, p < 0.05), and ER visits (69%, p < 0.05). Patients of both genders and all ages experienced decreases in resource use. CONCLUSION: Patients with CD decreased their use of some services, with a decreased number of hospitalizations and a decrease in the use of surgical services seen primarily in the patients infused for fistulas. This decrease in use of healthcare resources raises the potential of overall cost savings in CD patients receiving this drug.},

REE, CO2 production and O2 utilization were investigated in 9 patients on complete enteral nutrition by indirect calorimetry in four modifications: I--nutrition with 40% kJ fat in a ration 1.2x the energy output at rest at the onset of the trial; II--40% kJ and high energy intake (2.4x energy output at rest; III--60% kJ fat in ration of 1.2x energy output at rest; IV--60% kJ fat and energy intake 2.4x energy output at rest. At 40% (I) and 60% (III) fat content in a caloriocally adequate diet the energy output at rest, the CO2 production and O2 utilization did not differ (mean +/- SD: 1438 +/- 264.1 kcal/24 h, 179 +/- 31.6 nl/min, 209 +/- 38.1 ml/min vs. 1431 +/- 342.7, 190 +/- 54.2, 207 +/- 46.5). Comparison of modifications II and IV revealed a significant (p < 0.05) increase of CO2 production on a diet rich in carbohydrates (218 +/- 52.0 vs. 202 +/- 42.3). The energy output at rest (1674 +/- 389.6 vs. 1661 +/- 378.7), nor O2 production (240 +/- 54.5 vs. 242 +/- 55.4) changed. Overfeeding with 40% fat (II) as compared with (I) led to a rise of the energy output at rest (p < 0.05), O2 utilization (p < 0.05) and CO2 production (p < 0.01). Overfeeding with lipids (IV) led as compared with III to a rise of the energy output at rest and O2 utilization; CO2 production did not change. CONCLUSION: The composition of enteral nutrition according to the described modification does not influences the energy output at rest, O2 utilization and CO2 production under conditions of an adequate energy intake. In case of an excessive nutrient intake nutrition with 60% fat does not lead to an increase of CO2 production.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal dietary fat content to induce clinical remission in active Crohn's disease has been the subject of controversy. We therefore performed a prospective, randomized, controlled study to compare the effects of nutrient formulas differing in the amount of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). METHODS: Thirty-six patients with active Crohn's disease whose Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) was > or =150 were included in the study. A formula with 3.4 g of fat per 2000-kcal dose was used as the nutrient formula with a low-fat content (ED group), and a formula with 55.6 g of fat per 2000-kcal dose was used as the nutrient formula with a high amount of MCT (TL group). RESULTS: The rate of short-term remission induction at 6 weeks was 67% in the ED group and 72% in the TL group (p = NS). Therapy markedly reduced the high CDAI and van Hees activity index in both groups, with no significant difference in the pattern of the time-course changes. C-reactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and low serum albumin and plasma prealbumin levels normalized over the course of therapy, with no significant difference between the 2 groups. The assessment of fatty acid fractions revealed that the triene/tetraene ratio began to increase at 2 weeks in the ED group. The serum levels of linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, almost always varied within the normal range during the treatment period in the TL group, but in the ED group, levels began to decrease significantly at 2 weeks. The levels of linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid, decreased in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both nutrient formulas induced clinical remission in about two-thirds of patients. The results of the present study suggest that it is not necessary to restrict the amount of MCT when given in liquid form to patients with active Crohn's disease.},

STUDY DESIGN: Self-assessment of SMS in 100 children (34 girls) ages 8 to 18 years with CD from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was compared with an independent assessment by one well trained pediatrician, using drawings and written descriptions of Tanner stages of breast, genital, and pubic hair development. RESULTS: Overall, subjects with CD (age, 14.3 +/- 2.8 years) had delayed growth status based on height-for-age (HAZ) and weight-for-age Z scores (WAZ). Boys were more growth delayed (HAZ, -0.90 +/- 1.1; WAZ, -0.75 +/- 1.3) than girls (HAZ, -0.45 +/- 1.3; WAZ, -0.20 +/- 1.1). Kappa coefficients (kappa) showed excellent agreement between child and physician assessment of SMS, ranging from kappa = 0.74 to 0.85, depending on sex and SMS component, corresponding to a 79% to 88% agreement. When not in agreement, children tended to overestimate their SMS. Boys who overestimated (n = 8) had significantly higher weight and BMI status than boys who assessed accurately. CONCLUSIONS: Self-assessment of SMS was a reliable and valid method in children with CD and is useful in screening for maturational delay in children with chronic disease.},

   abstract = {Most patients with inflammatory bowel disease can be managed with conventional immunosuppressive therapy. The choice of agents to prevent relapses of inflammatory bowel disease must be based on efficacy, toxicity and cost. Studies in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease indicate that chronic intestinal inflammation results from enhanced immune responses to bacteria that are present normally in the lumen. Loss of tolerance, an abnormal function or defective healing of the mucosal barrier may all give raise to chronic intestinal inflammation. This hypothesis is the basis of new therapies aimed at either decreasing the levels of luminal bacterial antigens and/or selectively blocking detrimental mucosal immune responses. Anti-TNF is an example of this novel approach that is very effective in Crohn's disease. The use of biological therapy is costly, however, and the long-term complications are not yet known. The recent increase of tuberculosis in patients treated with anti-TNF indicates that careful monitoring is necessary. It is clear that the new forms of treatment may play an important role in tailoring the appropriate drug to a specific group of patients. However, for the time being, fine-tuning in the use of conventional immunosuppression is necessary. New knowledge in the pharmacogenetics of these compounds allows improvements to be made in their use. It is to be hoped that a critical approach in the use of current and future drugs, taking into account the advances in the aetiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, will contribute to the quality of life of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and vitamin D deficiency are associated with decreased bone mineralization. OBJECTIVE: We examined the prevalence of and risk factors for hypovitaminosis D in children, adolescents, and young adults with CD. DESIGN: Growth, clinical characteristics, vitamin D intake ( micro g/d), and bone mineral density (g/cm(2)) were measured in a cross-sectional study of 112 subjects (44 females) who had CD and were 5-22 y of age. Hypovitaminosis D was defined as a serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 38 nmol/L. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) serum concentration of 25(OH)D was 59.7 +/- 26.9 nmol/L, and 16% (95% CI: 9.3%, 23%) of the subjects had hypovitaminosis D. Hypovitaminosis D was most prevalent during the winter (31%; P = 0.02), among the African Americans (56%; P = 0.01), in the subjects with CD confined to the upper gastrointestinal tract (44%; P = 0.05), and in the subjects with a greater lifetime exposure to glucocorticoid therapy (23.7 +/- 13.5 compared with 17.5 +/- 12.2 mg/d; P = 0.05). There was no association between hypovitaminosis D and either bone mineral density (P = 0.10) or average dietary intake of vitamin D (4.6 +/- 3.6 micro g/d; P = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of pediatric patients with CD, hypovitaminosis D was common and was associated with the winter season, African American ethnicity, CD confined to the upper gastrointestinal tract, and magnitude of lifetime exposure to glucocorticoid therapy. The occurrence of these factors should prompt assessment of 25(OH)D status and clinical care optimized by supplementing subjects who have low serum concentrations. The physiologic relevance of ethnicity on 25(OH)D status in children with CD remains to be determined.},

   abstract = {Probiotic therapy is attracting the renewed interest of clinicians and basic investigators from a variety of traditional research disciplines. While the theoretical rationale for modifying the commensal flora of the gastrointestinal tract in specific circumstances appears sound and requires scientific pursuit, the field of probiotics has been clouded by exaggerated claims from some quarters. In general, many of the claims for therapeutic efficacy have not been well substantiated, but the field is now poised for evaluation within the realm of evidence-based medicine. Alterations in commensal bacterial flora within the gastrointestinal tract are associated with susceptibility to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile and there is persuasive evidence that the normal flora may participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic diseases in genetically susceptible individuals. This has prompted various strategies to fortify or otherwise modify the enteric flora by dietary supplements containing probiotic formulations. Detailed comparisons of probiotic performance amongst different bacterial strains have not been performed in vivo in man or under clinical trial conditions, and the level of scientific characterisation of individual organisms has been variable. In addition, it cannot be assumed that the same probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Moreover, the heterogeneity of clinical disorders such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis implies that strain-specific properties may be required for subset-specific categories of patients. While cocktails of probiotics offer convenience, therapeutic progress may require clarification of the mechanism of probiotic action and may be delayed until individual bacterial components have been rigorously studied. More importantly, the full potential of therapeutic manipulation of the enteric flora with probiotics or other strategies may not be optimally realised until the composition and metabolic activities of the normal flora are better understood.},

   abstract = {Delayed onset of puberty and a reduced pubertal growth spurt are often reported in patients suffering from chronic diseases. The basis of abnormal puberty in these patients is multifactorial. Nutritional deficiency may contribute to growth disorders and delayed puberty. Insufficient food supply and/or eating disorders and/or malabsorption of nutrients can be observed in these patients. Moreover, increased energy supplies are often needed in patients with chronic lung disease, infection or inflammation. More specific factors due to the disease itself may be involved in growth and puberty disorders. Abnormalities of the growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor (IGF)1 axis and gonadotrophin secretion have been described in patients with chronic renal failure, cystic fibrosis and Crohn's disease. More recently, it has been shown that cytokines produced during chronic diseases such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis may affect the GH-IGF1 axis. Finally, concomitant medication, namely corticosteroids, which are often given to these patients, may contribute to delayed puberty and poor pubertal growth.},

Some of the effects of omega-3 PUFA are brought about by modulation of the amount and types of eicosanoids made, and other effects are elicited by eicosanoid-independent mechanisms, including actions upon intracellular signaling pathways, transcription factor activity and gene expression. Animal experiments and clinical intervention studies indicate that omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and, therefore, might be useful in the management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Coronary heart disease, major depression, aging and cancer are characterized by an increased level of interleukin 1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine. Similarly, arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and lupus erythematosis are autoimmune diseases characterized by a high level of IL-1 and the proinflammatory leukotriene LTB(4) produced by omega-6 fatty acids. There have been a number of clinical trials assessing the benefits of dietary supplementation with fish oils in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in humans, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and migraine headaches. Many of the placebo-controlled trials of fish oil in chronic inflammatory diseases reveal significant benefit, including decreased disease activity and a lowered use of anti-inflammatory drugs.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative complications and anastomotic leak rate. RESULTS: None of the patients were on immunosuppressive treatment and about half in each group had had several weeks of preoperative enteral nutrition. No anastomotic-related complications and few other postoperative complications were noted, irrespective of the anastomotic technique used. CONCLUSION: A strategy to operate on Crohn patients without steroids and, if indicated, treated preoperatively with enteral nutrition and percutaneous drainage of abscesses resulted in no anastomotic leaks and few postoperative complications. These results were independent of the anastomotic technique used.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In the 1970s several reports highlighted the long delay in diagnosis often experienced by children with Crohn's disease. In recent years this disorder has attracted much publicity, and many believe that the incidence has increased substantially. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether heightened awareness had shortened the interval to diagnosis, improved clinical management and reduced morbidity. A retrospective study was therefore carried out on 112 children with inflammatory bowel disease (64 Crohn's disease, 41 ulcerative colitis, 7 indeterminate colitis) referred to a paediatric gastroenterology department in the UK between 1994 and 1998. In Crohn's disease the median interval to diagnosis was 47 wk (maximum 7 y). In those without diarrhoea this was longer (66 vs 28 wk; p = 0.005). In ulcerative colitis the median interval was 20 wk (maximum 3 y). Even in severe colitis the median interval was 5.5 wk (range 3-9 wk) and 4 required urgent colectomy soon after referral. Many with unrecognized Crohn's disease had undergone inappropriate treatments, such as growth hormone or psychiatric therapy. Nineteen (17%) had undergone endoscopic investigations in adult units prior to referral. Malnutrition was equally common in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (11%). Short stature was present in 19% with Crohn's disease, and 5% with ulcerative colitis, and was severe in 8% with Crohn's disease. There was a significant correlation between symptom duration and the degree of growth impairment present (r(s) = -0.4; p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that late diagnosis and inappropriate investigation and management are still significant problems.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elevated serum levels of several potent angiogenesis factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor have been described in children with active inflammatory bowel disease. Angiogenesis-promoting cytokines may promote inflammation by increasing vascular permeability but also mediate tissue repair by activating fibroblasts. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is another angiogenesis-promoting cytokine that is increased in colon cancer tissues. We therefore evaluated serum HGF levels in individuals with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 60 patients with Crohn disease, 31 with ulcerative colitis, and 38 controls with functional abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal illnesses. Disease activity for Crohn disease patients was determined using the pediatric Crohn disease activity index, and for ulcerative colitis patients using the Kozarek score. The HGF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Serum HGF levels were significantly ( P < 0.001) higher for Crohn disease patients (1439 +/- 84 pg/mL) and ulcerative colitis patients (1384 +/- 107 pg/mL) than for control patients (807 +/- 50 pg/mL). Serum HGF levels also rose with increasing disease activity in individuals with both Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSION: Serum HGF is elevated in children and young adults who have Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. Levels of serum HGF correlate directly with disease activity. The raised serum HGF suggests that HGF may mediate angiogenesis and vascular permeability in the mucosa of children with inflammatory bowel disease. Alternatively, the raised serum HGF may be an epiphenomenon of inflammation.},

   abstract = {Once considered rare in pediatric practice, chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is now being recognized with increasing frequency in children of all ages. In IBD, growth failure may be the only clinical presentation; it is imperative to perform a detailed history and physical examination to search for other systemic and gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease. IBD can have a significant impact on linear growth, weight gain, and bone mineralization, and can cause delays in the onset of puberty. Delays in growth and sexual development can be early indicators of disease activity, and assessment of growth and development should be performed frequently. Nutritional therapy is important not only to correct undernutrition, but also as therapy for IBD. Delayed puberty can have a significant impact on the self-esteem of the adolescent patient and diminish final adult height. Loss of bone mineral density is especially significant during a period in which the majority of bone accretion is expected to occur. These issues present unique problems to the gastroenterologist caring for a child or adolescent with IBD and require specific types of monitoring and interventions.},

The focus is on presenting clinically useful information for the practising gastroenterologist. Selected important clinical learning points include the following: (1) numerous peptides are being identified which stimulate the proliferation and functional response of the small intestine to disease or resection, and may in time find a clinical use; (2) under usual in vivo conditions, absorption of nutrients has little effect on the paracellular movement of water; (3) the permeability of the intestine is modified by the function of the tight junctions, and measuring intestinal permeability may be useful to reflect the presence of disease; (4) the release of serotonin is influenced by cholinergic, adrenergic, and nonadrenergic, noncholinergic mechanisms, and serotonin agonists and antagonists may play an important future role in the treatment of motility disorders; (5) the use of endothelin receptor antagonists may be useful for the treatment of intestinal anaphylaxis; (6) the alterations in intestinal pH and motility in patients with Crohn's disease may influence the action of pH- or time-dependent release medications; and (7) patients with irritable bowel syndrome may also have abnormalities in gastric and small intestinal motility.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic biopsies often show histologic abnormalities in Crohn disease. Consequently, it has been proposed that routine endoscopy could help to distinguish Crohn disease from ulcerative colitis. Surprisingly, however, recent case reports and an uncontrolled study suggested that similar abnormalities may occur in ulcerative colitis. Therefore, a blinded, controlled study was performed. METHODS: Esophageal, gastric antral, and duodenal biopsies from children with Crohn disease (n = 28) and ulcerative colitis (n = 14) were compared with those from controls undergoing endoscopy for suspected reflux esophagitis (n = 22). Two pathologists, unaware of patient identity and diagnosis, agreed on a consensus report. Severity of inflammation was scored semiquantitatively. Helicobacter pylori colonization was an exclusion criterion. RESULTS: Inflammation was reported as follows: esophagitis: controls 91%; Crohn disease: 72%; ulcerative colitis: 50%; gastritis: controls: 27%; Crohn disease: 92% (P < 0.001); ulcerative colitis: 69%; duodenitis: controls: 9%; Crohn disease: 33%; ulcerative colitis: 23%. In Crohn disease, granulomas were noted in 40% of patients (P = 0.001). Duodenal cryptitis was noted in 26% of patients with Crohn disease but not ulcerative colitis. In one patient with ulcerative colitis, neutrophilic infiltration of gastric glands was seen. Abnormalities seen in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis included gastroduodenal ulceration (Crohn disease, 7%; ulcerative colitis, 8%), villus atrophy (Crohn disease, 11%; ulcerative colitis, 15%), and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (Crohn disease, 15%; ulcerative colitis, 31% [P < 0.05]). None of these abnormalities was noted in the controls. CONCLUSION: Although the presence of granulomas can support a diagnosis of Crohn disease, severe inflammation and other abnormalities occur in the proximal gastrointestinal tract in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although enteral nutrition (EN) therapy for Crohn's disease has been confirmed to be as effective as steroid therapy, the precise mechanism responsible for the effects of EN remains unclear, although some of the therapeutic effects of EN are believed to be due to a low dietary fat content. In order to elucidate the influence of fat in EN, it is important to investigate not only the quantity of fat, but also the source of the fat. METHODS: We compared two enteral nutritional formulae: Elental (Ajinomoto) (elemental diet; ED), which contains only 1.5% fat, provided as long-chain triglycerides (LCT), versus Twinline (Snow Brand Milk Products) (TL), which contains a high percentage of fat (20.4%), provided mainly as medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). These formulae were tested on rat enteritis and rat colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). RESULTS: Both ED and TL reduced the manifestations of enteritis. TL had a stronger anti-inflammatory effect than ED for colitis. TL also had nutritional advantages as compared with ED, as shown by the total serum protein in the TL group being significantly higher than that in the ED group. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that intraluminal MCT is suitable as a fat energy source during intestinal inflammation in rats. We suggest that Twinline may be more useful to improve nutritional status and to reduce the mucosal inflammation in rat colitis, but that Twinline is equal in effect to Elental for rat enteritis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are often characterized by impairment of nutritional status. Crohn's disease (CD) patients, especially in the active phase of disease, show a reduced body weight, due to the reduction of lipid stores, in spite of lean mass depletion. Fat mass reduction has been correlated to an increased utilization of lipids as fuel substrate. The alterations of nutritional status are able, in turn, to influence, as independent factors, the disease course and patient prognosis. A disease's treatment based only on pharmacologic therapy, especially on corticosteroid use in the active phases, often does not take into account the relevant need for preserving a normal nutritional status. In this connection, enteral nutrition has been shown to be able to improve nutritional status and induce and maintain remission. We present some of the possible mechanisms of efficacy of enteral feeding and some rules to attempt to treat patients with IBD, especially those with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We propose that Crohn disease (CD) decreases bone formation via circulating inflammatory mediators. We therefore examined the effects of serum from newly diagnosed, untreated children with CD on osteoblasts in culture and the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine present in excess in active CD that also has direct effects on bone. METHODS: Bone mineral density was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry. Primary cultures of rat osteoblasts were treated with serum from patients with CD and healthy controls. We measured expression of osteoblast proliferation, viability, differentiation markers, and mineralized nodule formation. Neutralizing antibodies were used to inhibit the effects of IL-6 present in serum. RESULTS: We studied 24 children with CD (14 male) and 31 controls (15 male). Spine bone mineral density was lower in patients with CD (Z score, -0.8 +/- 0.9 vs. 0.0 +/- 1.0 for controls; P < 0.05). Nodule formation was markedly decreased in osteoblasts treated with CD serum. However, CD serum did not affect osteoblast proliferation or viability. Expression of proteins characteristic of mature osteoblasts-osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase-was reduced. Unlike our results in a model of intact bone, neutralization of IL-6 did not inhibit the effects of CD serum. Addition of IL-6 to control serum to match serum concentrations in CD had no effect either. CONCLUSIONS: CD serum affects osteoblast function and probably differentiation in vitro, suggesting a mechanism by which CD may affect bone formation. IL-6 by itself is not sufficient to cause these effects and probably needs a cofactor present in intact bone.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy plays an important role in the management of Crohn disease, particularly during the acute phase. Nutritional supplementation may also prevent relapses during the quiescent phase of Crohn disease, though this aspect has not been widely explored. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with Crohn disease in remission were studied. All had steroid-dependent disease. Patients were randomized to receive either elemental diet (n = 19, EO28 Extra) or polymeric diet (Forticips, n = 14). The supplement was given orally in addition to normal food in an amount to provide 35%-50% of pre-trial total calorie intake. Prednisolone was withdrawn gradually. Patients were followed up for 12 months. Failure was defined as increase in CDAI by 100 points from baseline to >200, inability to withdraw chronic steroid therapy completely, need for surgery or steroid therapy. RESULTS: The nutritional supplement was successful in 14 (43%) patients who remained in remission for 12 months with complete withdrawal of steroids. The response to elemental diet (42%) was similar to that of polymeric diet (43%). Nutrition supplement failed in 13 (39%). Six (18%) patients were intolerant to enteral feeding because of smell and taste problems. Per-protocol analysis of data indicated that the success rate of nutrition supplement in steroid-dependent patients was 52% (14 out of 27 patients). No disease or patient-related factors helped predict the response to nutrition supplement. CONCLUSION: Nutritional supplementation with either an elemental or polymeric diet may provide a safe and effective alternative to chronic steroid therapy in patients with steroid-dependent Crohn disease.},

OBJECTIVE: We compared lipid peroxidation, a measure of reactive-oxygen-species production, and plasma antioxidant vitamin concentrations between CD patients and healthy control subjects. DESIGN: Thirty-seven nonsmoking CD patients (22 women and 15 men) were compared with an equal number of healthy control subjects who were matched by age, sex, and body mass index. In patients the mean CD activity index (CDAI) was 141.2 +/- 18.7 (range: 9.0-514), and 11 of 37 patients (30%) had a CDAI > or =150. Seventy-eight percent of patients were taking > or = 1 medication. Medication use by subjects included the following: 5-aminosalicylic acid (40% of subjects), antibiotics (22%), oral corticosteroids (30%), and immunosuppressants (19%). RESULTS: Lipid peroxidation as measured by breath pentane output (CD patients, 7.47 +/- 0.98 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1); control subjects, 4.97 +/- 0.48 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1); P < or = 0.025), breath ethane output (CD patients, 11.24 +/- 1.17 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1); control subjects, 5.46 +/- 0.71 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1); P < or = 0.0005) and F2-isoprostane (CD patients, 78.6 +/- 8.0 ng/L; control subjects, 60.6 +/- 3.7 ng/L; P < or = 0.047) were significantly higher in CD patients than in control subjects. Plasma antioxidant vitamins (ascorbic acid, alpha- and beta-carotene, lycopene, and beta-cryptoxanthin) were all significantly lower in CD patients than in control subjects. There were no significant differences in macro- and micronutrient intakes between groups. CONCLUSION: Patients with CD are oxidatively stressed, which was observed even though 70% of patients had a CDAI < or =150 and 78% of them were taking medications to treat CD.},

This study reviews the long-term outcome of surgical treatment for diffuse jejunoileal Crohn's disease. METHODS: The cases of 46 patients who required surgery for diffuse jejunoileal Crohn's disease between 1980 and 1997 were reviewed. RESULTS: Strictureplasty was used for short strictures without perforating disease (perforation, abscess, fistula). Long strictures (<20 cm) or perforating disease was treated with resection. During an initial operation, strictureplasty was used on 63 strictures in 18 patients (39%). After a median follow-up of 15 years, there were 3 deaths: 1 from postoperative sepsis, 1 from small-bowel carcinoma, and 1 from bronchogenic carcinoma. Thirty-nine patients required 113 reoperations for jejunoileal recurrence. During 75 of the 113 reoperations (66%), strictureplasty was used on 315 strictures. Only 2 patients experienced the development of short-bowel syndrome and required home parenteral nutrition. At present, 4 patients are symptomatic and require medical treatment. All other patients are asymptomatic and require neither medical treatment nor nutritional support. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with diffuse jejunoileal Crohn's disease can be restored to good health with minimal symptoms by surgical treatment that includes strictureplasty.},

METHODS: 32 patients with Crohn's disease receiving perioperative parenteral nutrition in our department between 1984 and 1994 were enrolled in this survey. 16 patients with loss of body weight in the range of 15%-30% were assigned to the malnutrition group, the other 16 patients with normal weight or loss of body weight less than 15% to the control group. Serum IgM, IgG and IgA levels were measured before and after PN by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Liver function, body weight changes and postoperative complications were also analyzed. RESULTS: IgM levels were elevated before PN in both groups [control group: (133 +/- 16) mg/dl, malnutrition group: (139 +/- 41) mg/dl; normal value: (110 +/- 35) mg/dl; P = 0.04], decreased to normal value [(105 +/- 29) mg/dl, P = 0.02] in the malnutrition group while having no obvious changes in the control group [(129 +/- 13) mg/dl, P = 0.34]. No significant changes in concentrations of IgG and IgA were found (P in the range of 0.20-0.57). The average weight gain was 1.862 kg in malnutrition group [before PN: (45.8 +/- 8.9) kg, after PN: (48.0 +/- 8.8) kg; P = 0.005] and no significant changes in the control group [before PN: (55.6 +/- 6.1) kg, after PN: (56.3 +/- 6.0) kg; P = 0.46]. There was an increase in infectious complications in the control group (control group: 4 cases, 25%, malnourished group: 2 cases, 12.5%; P = 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative parenteral nutrition ameliorated the humoral immunity, increased the body weight in patients with obvious malnutrition, whereas it had little value for those without or with mild malnutrition.},

   abstract = {It is important for patients with benign intestinal failure under HPN, such as those with inflammatory bowel syndrome and short bowel syndrome, to maintain his/her indwelling catheter patent for a long time. The results of catheter care affects their quality of life. We describe the results of 18 patients who were under HPN. Their average age was 35.2 (range 21-49) years. The underlying diseases were Crohn's disease (n = 13), short bowel syndrome (n = 3), Behcet disease (n = 1), and nutrition support for pre-operative state of lung transplantation (n = 1). A totally implantable subcutaneous infusion port (SIP) was used for 16 patients and Broviac's catheter for two patients. Fundamentally, the self-infusion method was selected and nocturnal cyclic TPN was performed. The period of HPN was a mean of 601 (range 73-1, 159) days. Seven catheters (4 patients) were exchanged due to occlusion or infection, and one due to infection of the subcutaneous pocket. The average life of the catheters was 415 +/- 320 days. Catheter related complications occurred 0.74/1,000 days of catheter in place. We conclude that HPN is managed safely and that it is useful to maintain the QOL of patients with benign intestinal failure. All patients were satisfied with HPN.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is controversial. Increasing research on the mechanisms by which nutritional therapy improves the clinical well being of patients with Crohn's disease has led to novel formula design and trials comparing two different forms of enteral nutrition. This systematic review aims to provide an update on the existing efficacy data for both corticosteroids versus enteral nutrition and for one form of enteral nutrition versus another for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of exclusive enteral nutrition as primary therapy to induce remission in Crohn's disease and to examine the importance of formula composition on efficacy. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were selected using a computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic databases MEDLINE (1966-2000) and EMBASE (1984-2000), as well as the Science Citation Index on Web of Science. Additional citations were sought by manual search of references of articles retrieved from the computerized search, abstracts submitted to major gastroenterologic meetings and published in the journals: Gut, Gastroenterology, Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, and from the reviewers' personal files or contact with leaders in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials involving patients with active Crohn's disease defined by a clinical disease activity index were considered for review. Studies evaluating the administration of one type of enteral nutrition to one group of patients and another type of enteral nutrition or conventional corticosteroids to the other group were selected for review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and any discrepancies were resolved by rereading and discussion. For the dichotomous variable, achievement of remission, individual and pooled trial statistics were calculated as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); both fixed and random effect models were used. The results for each analysis were tested for heterogeneity using the chi square statistic. The studies were separated into two groups: A. one form of enteral nutrition compared with another form of enteral nutrition and B. one form of enteral nutrition compared with corticosteroids. Subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of clinical or disease criteria and formula composition. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the basis of the inclusion of abstracts of studies not yet fully published, methodologic quality and by random or fixed effects models. MAIN RESULTS: In part A, of the 11 trials (one abstract) comparing different formulations of enteral nutrition ten compared one [or more (Middleton (a)1995)] elemental formulas to a non-elemental diet. The eleventh study (Akobeng 2000) compared two non-elemental diets differing only by glutamine enrichment in one group. This study was therefore not included in the primary analysis but was part of the subgroup analyses. Meta-analysis of nine studies which included 170 patients treated with an elemental diet and 128 patients treated with a non-elemental diet for active Crohn's disease demonstrated no significant difference among diet formulations [OR 1.15 (95% CI: 0.64, 2.08)]. Significant heterogeneity was not present [chi-square 9.77 (df=8)]. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses had no significant effect on the results. In part B, six trials (two abstracts) comparing enteral nutrition to steroid therapy met the inclusion criteria for review. Meta-analysis of four trials that included 130 patients treated with enteral nutrition and 123 treated with steroids yielded a pooled OR of 0.30 favouring steroid therapy (95% CI: 0.17, 0.52). Heterogeneity was not demonstrated [chi-square 0.43 (df=3)]. The risk difference calculated from this meta-analysis was 0.26, and the NNT (number of patients needed to treat with steroids rather than enteral nutrition to achieve one remission) was four. The same result was found in a sensitivity analysis that included abstracts. The inclusion of abstracts resulted in an increase in the number of participants to 150 in the enteral nutrition group and 142 in the steroid group but the meta-analysis yielded a similar result [OR 0.34 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.56)]. There were inadequate data from full publications to perform further subgroup analyses by age, disease duration and disease location. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid therapy is more effective than enteral nutrition for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease as was found in past meta-analyses. There is no significant difference in the efficacy of elemental and non-elemental diets for induction of remission of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To enhance our understanding of Crohn's disease and improve its early diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with active Crohn's disease were studied. All their diagnostic and therapeutic results were analyzed. RESULTS: Most patients were young adults, with a 1.14:1 female predominance in prevalence. The disease affects any segment or a combination of segments of the alimentary tract from the mouth to the anus. However, the colon and the small bowel were the major sites involved. Recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and watery diarrhea were the most common symptoms. In addition, low grade fever, emaciation, anemia, and symptoms with skin, joints or perianal complications could be discovered if attention was paid. An endoscopy combined with histologic examination in biopsy specimens provided characteristic features with a diagnostic accuracy of 62.9%. Granulomas were identifiable in 30.8% of all biopsy specimens. Transabdominal bowel sonography (TABS) accurately detected intestinal complications. Factors causing misdiagnosis were: insufficient attention of the disease, diverse clinical presentations, or over emphasis of the diagnostic value of granulomas. Oral prednisone therapy for mild to moderate disease was more rapid to receive clinical remission when compared to oral aminosalicylates (SASP or 5-ASA). Nutrition support therapy was given in 20 cases with active disease and received beneficial effects on host nutritional status. Immunosuppressives were used on an individual basis, and showed variable effects with limited experience. Sixteen patients had operations due to intestinal obstruction or failure to respond to drug therapies. Rapid improvement after operations was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's diseases not uncommon in China. Abdominal pain and watery diarrhea are two hallmark symptoms. Endoscopy (with biopsy), and TABS were both valuable procedures for diagnosis. Prednisone and SASP/5-ASA were effective as inductive therapies. Surgery, as an alternative and effective treatment, provided another choice in well selected patients.},
