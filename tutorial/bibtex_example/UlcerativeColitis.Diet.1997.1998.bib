   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively the relationship between self-reported regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen and the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study using a mailed baseline questionnaire in 1986, and follow-up every 2 years through 1992. SETTING: Male health professionals residing in 50 US states. PATIENTS: A total of 35 615 male health professionals (dentists, optometrists, veterinarians, physicians, pharmacists, osteopathic physicians, podiatrists) 40 to 75 years of age at baseline and free of diagnosed diverticular disease, colon or rectal polyp, ulcerative colitis, and cancer prior to 1988. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Follow-up questionnaires in 1988, 1990, and 1992 about use of NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and other variables including the diagnosis of symptomatic diverticular disease. RESULTS: During 4 years of follow-up, we documented 310 newly diagnosed cases of symptomatic diverticular disease. After adjustment for age, physical activity, and energy-adjusted dietary fiber and total fat intake, regular and consistent use of NSAIDs and acetaminophen was positively associated with the overall risk of symptomatic diverticular disease (for users vs nonusers, relative risk [RR] for NSAIDs = 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-3.91; RR for acetaminophen = 1.81, 95% CI, 0.79-4.11). Most of this positive association was attributable to cases associated with bleeding, particularly for acetaminophen (for users vs nonusers, RR for NSAIDs = 4.64, 95% CI, 0.99-21.74; RR for acetaminophen = 13.63, 95% CI, 3.53-52.60). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that regular and consistent use of NSAIDs in general and acetaminophen is associated with symptoms of severe diverticular disease, particularly bleeding. Further research is needed to investigate the potentially deleterious effect of NSAIDs and other medications on the lower gastrointestinal tract.},

The insoluble component of fiber was inversely associated with risk of diverticular disease relative risk (RR) = 0. 63, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.44-0.91, P for trend = 0.02, and this association was particularly strong for cellulose (RR = 0.52, 95% CI, 0.36-0.75, P for trend = 0.002). The association between diverticular disease and total dietary fiber intake calculated from the AOACstandards method was not appreciably different from results using the Southgate or Englyst method [for AOAC method, RR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.41-0.87; for Southgate method, RR = 0.61, 95% CI, 0.42-0. 88; for Englyst method, RR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.42-0.87, for the highest quintiles]. Our findings provide evidence for the hypothesis that a diet high in dietary fiber decreases the risk of diverticular disease, and this result was not sensitive to the use of different analytic techniques to define dietary fiber. Our findings suggest that the insoluble component of fiber was significantly associated with a decreased risk of diverticular disease, and this inverse association was particularly strong for cellulose.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is well established that glutamine supplemented elemental diets result in less severe intestinal damage in experimental colitis. However, few studies have examined the mode of action of glutamine in reducing intestinal damage. AIMS: To examine the effects of glutamine supplemented elemental diets on the potent inflammatory cytokines interleukin 8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) induced colitis which presents with both acute and chronic features of ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised into three dietary groups and fed 20% casein (controls), or 20% casein supplemented with either 2% glutamine (2% Gln) or 4% glutamine (4% Gln). After two weeks they received intracolonic TNBS to induce colitis. RESULTS: Both Gln groups of rats gained more weight than the control group (p < 0.05) which had progressive weight loss. Colon weight, macroscopic, and microscopic damage scores for the Gln groups were lower than in the control group (p < 0.05). IL-8 and TNF-alpha concentrations in inflamed colonic tissues were lower in the Gln groups than in the control group (p < 0.05), and correlated well with disease severity. Bacterial translocation was lower both in incidence (p < 0.05) and in the number of colony forming units (p < 0.05) for the Gln groups, than in the control group. With respect to all indices studied, the 4% Gln group performed better than did the 2% Gln group. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic glutamine supplementation modulates the inflammatory activities of IL-8 and TNF-alpha in TNBS induced colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although suggested, it has never been convincingly documented that food sensitivity is of pathogenetic importance in chronic inflammatory bowel disease. However, many patients may relate their gastrointestinal symptoms to specific food items ingested and may restrict their diet accordingly. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease who attended the outpatient clinic, Medical Dept., Roskilde County Hospital in Koge, Denmark, in the year 1993. The patients were asked whether they had problems with any particular food item and, if so, to describe the symptoms experienced from it. A control group of 70 healthy persons were included. RESULTS: Among 189 patients, 132 (70%) responded. One hundred and thirty had completed the questionnaire, 52 males and 78 females aged 13-89 years (median, 43 years). Fifty-three (41%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 69 (53%) ulcerative colitis (UC), and 8 (6%) unclassified colitis. Forty-one patients (31 CD, 10 UC) were-operated on; 51 (19 CD, 32 UC) had disease activity. Sixty-five per cent of the patients and 14% of the controls reported being intolerant to one or more food items (P < 0.0001). The intolerance covered a wide range of food products. The commonest symptoms among patients were diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and meteorism and among controls, regurgitation. Food intolerance was equally common in CD (66%) and UC (64%) and was not related to previous operation, disease activity or disease location. CONCLUSION: Most patients with chronic inflammatory bowel intolerance disease feel intolerant to different food items and may restrict their diet accordingly. The frequency and pattern of food intolerance did not differ between patients with CD and UC. The food intolerance was probably unspecific rather than of pathogenetic importance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: In the Western world, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease that is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly chronic ulcerative colitis and, to a lesser degree, Crohn's disease. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of PSC in Turkish patients with IBD and chronic amebic colitis, a disease that is endemic in Turkey. METHODOLOGY: During a 10-year period, between 1986 and 1996, a total of 81 IBD (64 ulcerative colitis and 17 Crohn's disease) patients and 127 patients with chronic amebic colitis were seen and evaluated with radiologic, serologic, immunologic and pathologic tests. Whenever a clinical or biochemical finding suggested the presence of co-existent hepatic and/or biliary disease, the patient was further evaluated by liver biopsy, auto-antibodies and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to determine whether they also had PSC or some other form of liver disease. As a disease control group, a total of 752 patients with clinical and/or laboratory evidence of pancreaticobiliary disease were also studied. In 86 of these 752 patients (10%), a primary disorder of the biliary tree was diagnosed by ultrasonography, computed tomography, peritoneoscopy, liver biopsy, ERCP and abdominal laparotomy. In addition, all 86 patients of the control group were evaluated endoscopically in order to determine whether they had any associated gastrointestinal condition of the upper or lower gastrointestinal tracts. After establishing final diagnoses of IBD, amebic colitis and PSC, these patients were evaluated with respect to their socio-economic status. A high protein diet (1.8 gram/kg/day) was administered to those patients with chronic amebic colitis and IBD during the active period of the disease. RESULTS: Of the 208 patients (81 with IBD and 127 with chronic amebic colitis), no cases of PSC were identified. Of the 86 patients in the control group with primary biliary tract disease, 45 had a biliary system malignancy, 14 had primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), 16 had PSC, 3 had Caroli's disease, 6 had a common bile duct cyst, and 2 had gallbladder adenomatosis. All but 1 of the 16 patients with PSC were female. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in contrast to findings in Western Europe and the USA, in Turkey: 1) PSC is not regularly associated with idiopathic IBD; 2) most patients with PSC are female; 3) PSC accounts for only 18% of patients with a primary disorder of the biliary tree; 4) the incidence of small-duct primary sclerosing cholangitis is greater than that reported in the literature; and, 5) the incidence of IBD and PSC in Turkey is relatively lower than in other countries.},

   abstract = {The objective of the present investigation was to study the evolution of untreated inflammatory disease of the colon as compared to disease treated with an elemental diet plus glutamine, with 5-ASA and with a combination of the three. A total of 120 female Wistar-Tecpar rats aged 180 days and weighing on average 290 g were studied. Inflammatory disease of the colon was induced with 10% acetic acid and the animals were divided at random into four groups of 30 rats each. Group A, which received a standard diet and no type of treatment, was used as control. Group B received an elemental diet supplemented with glutamine. Group C received a standard diet and daily 5-ASA enemas, 15 mg/ml. Group D received an elemental diet supplemented with glutamine plus daily 5-ASA enemas. Ten animals were picked at random from each group and sacrificed on the 7th, 14th and 21st days of treatment after intravenous injection of Evans blue for visualization of the damaged areas. Changes in weight and the macroscopic aspects of the abdominal cavity and the colon were evaluated and the involved segment was resected for macroscopic and microscopic analysis. The highest weight loss occurred in group D animals on the 14th and 21st days. The number of complications was larger in group A animals, with intestinal perforation, peritonitis and death (P = 0.0053). Complications were of equal intensity in groups B and C and no complications were detected in group D. Macroscopic evaluation showed a lower frequency of ulcers on the 7th day in group B (P = 0.0113) and D (P = 0.0294). Group D animals showed a significantly reduced frequency of ulcers on the 14th day (P = 0.0140). Microscopic examination showed a better evolution in groups B (P = 0.0113) and D (P = 0.0294) on the 7th day and in group D on 14th day (P = 0.0105) compared to A. We conclude that the combination of an elemental diet containing glutamine and treatment with 5-ASA leads to more rapid healing of the colon lesions induced by 10% acetic acid in rats.},

   abstract = {In persons at higher risk for colon cancer (e.g., those with sporadic adenoma or ulcerative colitis), compared to those at lower risk, colonic epithelial cell proliferation kinetics are altered. We have shown previously that calcium supplementation appears to normalize the distribution of proliferating cells without affecting the proliferation rate in the colorectal mucosa of sporadic adenoma patients. In a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial conducted concurrently with our previously published sporadic adenoma trial, we tested whether calcium supplementation can also modulate cell proliferation kinetics in patients with ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis patients (n = 31) were randomized to placebo or 2.0 g of supplemental calcium daily. Colorectal epithelial cell proliferation was determined by immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling of cells in "nonprep" rectal biopsies taken at randomization and after 2 months treatment. All biopsies were scored by one reviewer. Differences in mean follow-up minus baseline labeling index (LI; the proportion of colon crypt epithelial cells that were labeled) and in the phi(h) (proportion of labeled cells that were in the upper 40% of the crypts) were compared with analysis of covariance. Pill-taking adherence was 97%. Biopsy-scoring reliability was high (r = 0.89). The pooled baseline LI and phi(h) were 6.3% and 5.6%, respectively. The LI in the calcium group decreased by 0.5% (proportionately, 3%) more than in the placebo group (P = 0.91). Similarly, the phi(h) in the calcium group decreased by 0.3% (proportionately, 10%) more than in the placebo group (P = 0.85). This pilot study does not suggest that 2.0 g of calcium as calcium carbonate daily can substantially normalize either the rate or distribution of proliferating cells over a 2-month period in the colon crypts of patients with ulcerative colitis; a more definitive answer to the question of whether calcium may be effective would require a study with a larger sample size and/or other study design modifications.},

Patient involvement and education are necessary components of effective management. Mild disease requires only symptomatic relief and dietary manipulation. Mild to moderate disease can be managed with 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds, including olsalazine and mesalamine. Mesalamine enemas and suppositories are useful in treating proctosigmoiditis. Antibiotics such as metronidazole may be required in patients with Crohn's disease. Corticosteroids are beneficial in patients with more severe symptoms, but side effects limit their use, particularly for chronic therapy. Immunosuppressant therapy may be considered in patients with refractory disease that is not amenable to surgery. Inflammatory bowel disease in pregnant women can be managed with 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds and corticosteroids. Since longstanding inflammatory bowel disease (especially ulcerative colitis) is associated with an increased risk of colon cancer, periodic colonoscopy is warranted.},

   abstract = {The role of diet in the aetiology and pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) remains uncertain. Impaired utilization by colonocytes of butyrate, a product of bacterial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates escaping digestion, may be important. Sulphur-fermenting bacteria may be involved in this impaired utilization. Oxidative stress probably mediates tissue injury but is probably not of causative importance. Patients with UC are prone to malnutrition and its detrimental effects. However, there is no role for total parenteral nutrition and bowel rest as primary therapy for UC. The maintenance of adequate nutrition is very important, particularly in the peri-operative patient. In the absence of massive bleeding, perforation, toxic megacolon or obstruction, enteral rather than parenteral nutrition should be the mode of choice. Nutrients may be beneficial as adjuvant therapy. Butyrate enemas have improved patients with otherwise recalcitrant distal colitis in small studies. Non-cellulose fibre supplements are of benefit in rats with experimental colitis. Eicosapentaenoic acid in fish oil has a steroid-sparing effect which, although modest, is important, particularly in terms of reducing the risk of osteoporosis, but it seems to have no role in the patient with inactive disease. gamma-Linolenic acid and anti-oxidants also are showing promise. Nutrients may also modify the increased risk of colorectal carcinoma. Oxidative stress can damage tissue DNA but there are no data published at present on possible protection from oral anti-oxidants. Butyrate protects against experimental carcinogenesis in rats with experimental colitis. Folate supplementation is weakly associated with decreased incidence of cancer in UC patients when assessed retrospectively. Vigilance should be maintained for increased micronutrient requirements and supplements given as appropriate. Calcium and low-dose vitamin D should be given to patients on long-term steroids and folate to those on sulphasalazine.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of an enteral nutritional formula containing supplemental oligosaccharides, gum arabic and fish oil on serum metabolite profiles, haematology, plasma and red blood cell membrane phospholipid fatty acid profiles, urinary constituent, and safety in healthy human adult males. 30 subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatments, a control formula (n = 10) and an ulcerative colitis nutritional formula (UCNF; n = 20). Formulas contained comparable levels of protein, fat and non-structural carbohydrates. Daily intake of the formulas provided nutrients to meet or exceed the recommended daily allowance. Intake was recorded daily while blood and urine samples were collected weekly on days 0, 7 and 14. Certain subjects consuming large quantities of the UCNF experienced some abdominal distention, gas and loose stools. Sole source intake of the UCNF was safe over 14 days as assessed by routine measurements of serum metabolite profiles, haematology and urinalysis compared with subjects fed the control formula. Substantial decreases in plasma and red blood cell phospholipid 18:2n-6 and increases in 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 within 1 wk of feeding the UCNF were noted.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of an ulcerative colitis nutritional formula (UCNF) containing oligosaccharides, fish oil, gum arabic and antioxidants on plasma and colonic phospholipid fatty acid and prostaglandin profiles in pigs. Twenty-four growing barrows in two replications were equally randomized among four killing times (d 0, 7, 14 and 21), and one of two diets, a control and the UCNF. Diets contained comparable levels of protein, fat, and nonstructural carbohydrate and met 100% of the energy requirements of the pig. Intake and body weight were recorded daily while blood, urine and tissue samples were collected at time of kill. Within 1 wk of ingestion of the UCNF, the composition of plasma phospholipid fatty acids showed an increase in 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) (P < 0.0001) and a decrease in 20:4(n-6) and 18:2(n-6) (P < 0.0001). Similar effects were observed for the phospholipids in the colonic and cecal mucosa. Plasma prostaglandin E was unaffected by treatment, whereas thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha levels were significantly decreased after 7 d of UCNF ingestion. Ingestion of the UCNF resulted in a suppression in the synthesis of proinflammatory prostaglandins by cecal and colonic mucosal cells. Levels of colonic and cecal prostaglandin E, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 were significantly decreased after 7 d of UCNF ingestion. These changes may have been mediated by rapid increases of (n-3) fatty acids into cellular phospholipids. Dietary supplementation with the UCNF may prove beneficial for patients with ulcerative colitis by modulating colonic prostaglandin synthesis.},

DESIGN: A retrospective study of cases of CHUC seen at Sydney University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (SUVTH) over a 20-year period (1975-1994). PROCEDURE: Case records of all dogs in which colitis was suspected were reviewed. Dogs were diagnosed with CHUC based on colonorectal biopsy and histopathological examination. RESULTS: CHUC was diagnosed in 8 of 57 dogs presented for colitis. All affected dogs were Boxers and six were female. Dogs with milder clinical signs showed moderately good response to therapy. Four dogs were still alive 1 to 7 years after diagnosis. Three dogs were euthanased, one for reasons other than CHUC, and one was lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Young boxer dogs with relatively mild signs of CHUC may respond moderately well to medical and dietary therapy with fair prognosis. Euthanasia early in the course of the disease may be unwarranted. Prevalence may be increasing within the SUVTH referral population.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients (8 women and 7 men) with mean average age of 33 years who underwent mucosal proctectomy, colectomy, ileal-pouch-anal anastomosis and temporary loop ileostomy. Quality of life was studied when the patients had an ileostomy and follow-up evaluation, one year after restitution of anal defecation. The surgeons' evaluation was done using a health scale. RESULTS: Among the patients with temporary ileostomy, 40% reported bad tolerance, 53% leakage of stoma bag and 26% skin problems. The mean stool frequency among ileoanal anastomosis was four per day, 87% reported total continence, 13% had major complications and they needed pouch removal. 67% patients with ileostomy reported dietary restrictions against 13% patients functioning with pelvic pouch (p = 0.004). 13% patients with ileostomy had restricted sport activities. Social activities were restricted for 40% and 26% had limitations in their ability to work. Sex life was affected in 20% of patients with ileostomy and 13% of patients with ileal pouch anastomosis. 73% of patients presented an excellent level of satisfaction with pouch. CONCLUSION: Quality of life after ileoanal pouch anastomosis is higher than ileostomy.},

   abstract = {Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been the subject of much research over the past few decades. They play a vital role in maintenance of colonic integrity and metabolism. They are produced when dietary fibre is fermented by colonic bacteria. SCFAs are avidly absorbed in the colon, at the same time as sodium and water absorption and bicarbonate secretion. Once absorbed, SCFAs are used preferentially as fuel for colonic epithelial cells and have trophic effects on the epithelium. Clinically, SCFAs have been studied as possible therapeutic agents in diversion colitis, ulcerative colitis, radiation proctitis, pouchitis and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Although some promising effects have been observed in uncontrolled studies, a specific therapeutic role for SCFAs remains to be defined. SCFAs may be the effector of the beneficial role of fibre in prevention of colon cancer.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: A prospective phase II trial was carried out to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a combined interstitial with external beam radiotherapy approach for localized prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 1992 and December 1994, 82 evaluable patients were treated. T2 and T3 tumours, according to the AJCC classification system of 1992, were found in 21 and 61 cases, respectively. The median follow-up was 24 months; three patients were lost during follow-up. All of the patients were pathologically proven to be node-negative by laparoscopic node dissection of the fossa obturatoria region. A dose of 9 Gy a week was prescribed during the first and second weeks of treatment (10 Gy each week from October 1992 to December 1993) interstitially with high-dose rate Iridium-192 brachytherapy to the prostate and tumour extension beyond the capsule. External beam four-field box irradiation was then given to the prostate to a dose of 45 Gy/25 fractions (40 Gy/20 fractions from October 1992 to December 1993). RESULTS: Before starting treatment, a PSA value of > or =10 ng/ml was found in 64.6% (53/82) of patients with a median PSA of 14.0 ng/ml. The median PSA 3, 12 and 24 months after completion of therapy was 1.20, 0.78 and 0.70 ng/ml, respectively. The PSA value was < 1.0 ng/ ml in 52.9% of patients at 2 years. Negative punch biopsies 12 and 24 months after therapy were observed in 69.8% (44/63) and 73. 1% (38/ 52) of patients, respectively. A positive biopsy combined with a PSA value of > 1.0 ng/ml was considered as local failure. The local tumour control rate was 79.5% at 2 years. Acute side-effects were not increased relative to external beam irradiation alone. Severe side-effects were observed in three patients (two of the three patients had additional risk factors (colitis ulcerosa and diabetes mellitus)); they developed rectourethral fistulae requiring colostomy after biopsies from the anterior rectal wall. CONCLUSION: The described method is feasible and well tolerable. The three complications observed were not caused by irradiation alone. Biopsies from the anterior rectal wall after definitive high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer have to be seen as obsolete. The rate of negative prostate biopsies of 73.1% after 24 months represents an encouraging result.},

DESIGN: Double-blind cross-over study. SETTING: Metabolic kitchen with policlinic visits, Sahlgrenska Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden. SUBJECTS: Patients with conventional ileostomy because of ulcerative colitis. INTERVENTIONS: 7 g of inulin, 17 g of oligofructose and 7 g of sucrose were added to a controlled diet during three experimental periods of three days each. Ileostomy effluents were collected and analysed. Differences between experimental and control diet were investigated with the Wilcoxon's sign and values test. RESULTS: Inulin and oligofructose were recovered in the ileostomy effluent to 88% (95% CI, 76-100%) and 89% (64-114%) respectively. Dry solid excretion increased by 14.4 g (11.3-17.5) on inulin, and by 14.7 g (13.0-16.4 g) on oligofructose and energy excretion increased 245 kJ (190-307 kJ) on inulin and 230 kJ (214-315 kJ) on oligofructose compared to control diet (P < 0.05). Cholesterol absorption, excretion of cholesterol, bile acids, nitrogen, fat, calcium, magnesium, zinc and iron were not affected by inulin and oligofructose. CONCLUSIONS: Inulin and oligofructose are not digested in the small intestine. They do not affect mineral excretion and hence hardly mineral absorption. They do not increase fat or nitrogen excretion from the small intestine. Any physiological effect of inulin and oligofructose is probably mediated through other mechanisms than altered excretion from the small intestine.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire mailed to 153 pediatric patients was returned by 125 patients (76 Crohn's disease [CD] and 49 ulcerative colitis [UC] patients)--an 82% response rate. RESULTS: The median age of respondents was 13 years, and 62% were male. Ninety per cent and 71% of CD and UC patients, respectively, had changed their diets since diagnosis. Caloric supplements (eg, BOOST [Mead Johnson Nutritionals]), sole source nutrition, low fibre and lactose-free diets were used by more than 15% of CD patients, whereas lactose-free, nonspicy, low acid, additive-free, caloric supplement and low fibre diets were used by more than 15% of UC patients. A diet supplement was more commonly used in CD patients (P < 0.05) and an additive-free diet in UC patients. Corn and corn products, nuts, milk and bran were avoided by more than 20% of CD and UC patients; however, more CD than UC patients avoided corn and corn products. In addition, UC patients (more than 20%) also avoided tomato, other dairy (nonfluid milk-based products and foods containing milk products), chocolate, cheese, wheat, tomato sauces and fruit juice. A benefit was reported for 103 of 141 reported diets, with the most commonly alleviated symptoms being abdominal pain, diarrhea and flatulence. CONCLUSION: Many children with inflammatory bowel disease have altered their diets to manage their disease and have attributed symptomatic relief to these diets.},

No specific dietary toxin or antigen has been identified to have an etiologic role in either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. A possible modulating effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on intestinal inflammation is being investigated. Most prevalent among the nutritional consequences of inflammatory bowel disease is weight loss, for which inadequate caloric intake is primarily responsible. Impairment of linear growth and associated delay in pubertal development commonly complicate childhood Crohn's disease. The two major etiologic factors are chronic undernutrition and direct effects of inflammatory mediators secreted from the inflamed gut. Recent studies have incriminated interleukin-6. Treatment of intestinal inflammation and provision of adequate nutrition are of paramount importance in preventing or remedying growth impairment. Exclusive enteral nutrition using formulated food is efficacious primary therapy of active Crohn's disease, although the mode of action is poorly understood.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest only minor changes in bile acid metabolism after panproctocolectomy with ileal pouch construction. AIMS/METHODS: To investigate these changes further, we studied cholesterol absorption and serum, biliary and fecal non-cholesterol sterols and lipids in 12 ileal pouch patients and 10 controls. RESULTS: In patients, cholesterol absorption was markedly reduced and was associated with low serum total and LDL cholesterol and LDL triglyceride levels, but surprisingly, cholesterol synthesis, as indicated by sterol-balance data or serum cholesterol precursor levels, was within low normal limits. The high proportions of serum plant sterol to cholesterol, particularly that of campesterol, were not related to cholesterol absorption, but were attributable to a markedly reduced biliary cholesterol secretion. Interestingly, in these patients the fractional absorption of campesterol was normal, whereas that of sitosterol, like cholesterol, was reduced and was positively related to the intestinal influx of cholesterol. The patients' serum cholestanol proportion was normal, but the proportion of the cholestanol formed during intestinal passage was significantly reduced (17.9% vs 65.2% in controls). CONCLUSIONS: Thus ileal pouch patients are characterized by sterol malabsorption, lowered serum total and LDL-cholesterol levels, but unexpectedly without any increase in cholesterol synthesis. The lack of high serum cholestanol, shown earlier frequently in unoperated patients with ulcerative colitis, may indicate reversible cholestasis, a finding deserving further exploration.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: No data exist on cholesterol absorption in patients with an ileoanal anastomosis (IAA). AIMS: To study cholesterol absorption and its effects on cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in patients with an IAA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cholesterol absorption, and serum, biliary, and faecal lipids were studied in 24 patients with an IAA and 20 controls. RESULTS: Fractional cholesterol absorption was significantly lower in the patients (36% versus 47% in controls). Surprisingly, the calculated intestinal influx of endogenous cholesterol was reduced so that the absolute absorption of cholesterol was decreased; elimination of cholesterol as faecal neutral steroids remained normal. Thus, the slightly increased cholesterol synthesis was mainly due to increased faecal bile acid excretion, which, in turn, was associated with reduced absorption and biliary secretion of bile acids. Serum total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and LDL triglycerides were lower in the patients. Molar percentage and saturation index of biliary cholesterol were slightly higher in patients with an IAA. Proportions of secondary bile acids in bile and faeces were diminished, and faecal unidentified bile acids were higher in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cholesterol absorption is significantly impaired in patients with an IAA, and is closely related to changes in serum and biliary lipids observed in these patients.},

   abstract = {During the past few decades, intensive collaborative research in the fields of chronic and acute inflammatory disorders has resulted in a better understanding of the pathophysiology and diagnosis of these diseases. Modern therapeutic approaches are still not satisfactory and shock, sepsis and multiple organ failure remain the great challenge in intensive care medicine. However, the treatment of inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis or psoriasis also represents an unresolved problem. Many factors contribute to the complex course of inflammatory reactions. Microbiological, immunological and toxic agents can initiate the inflammatory response by activating a variety of humoral and cellular mediators. In the early phase of inflammation, excessive amounts of interleukins and lipid-mediators are released and play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction. Arachidonic acid (AA), the mother substance of the pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, is released from membrane phospholipids in the course of inflammatory activation and is metabolised to prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Various strategies have been evaluated to control the excessive production of lipid mediators on different levels of biochemical pathways, such as inhibition of phospholipase A2, the trigger enzyme for release of AA, blockade of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways and the development of receptor antagonists against platelet activating factor and leukotrienes. Some of these agents exert protective effects in different inflammatory disorders such as septic organ failure, rheumatoid arthritis or asthma, whereas others fail to do so. Encouraging results have been obtained by dietary supplementation with long chain omega-3 fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). In states of inflammation, EPA is released to compete with AA for enzymatic metabolism inducing the production of less inflammatory and chemotactic derivatives.},

   abstract = {During the past 20 years there has been growing interest in the importance of nutritional factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. There are so far no definite links between ulcerative colitis and diet, but links with Crohn's disease have been studied by both epidemiologists and clinicians. Epidemiological studies, although retrospective, have suggested that patients with Crohn's disease eat more sugar and sweets that control individuals; however, when dietary sugar is restricted, there is little clinical benefit. The clinical approach to nutrition in Crohn's disease has been by the use of elemental diets, which will produce symptomatic and objective remission in up to 90% of compliant patients. Those who return to normal eating soon relapse but, in some studies, have enjoyed prolonged remission on exclusion diets. The foods excluded have been not sugar, but predominantly cereals, dairy products and yeast. Attention has now switched to the possible harmful role of fat in Crohn's disease. The efficacy of elemental feeds appears to depend not on the presentation of nitrogen but on the amount of long chain triglyceride present. Increases in recent years in the frequency of Crohn's disease in Japan have been correlated with increased dietary fat intake, and a recent study suggested that W-3 fatty acids, which are metabolized by immunomodulatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, may have a beneficial role to play. The links between nutrition and Crohn's disease have now become strong and the role of fat may be the most exciting of all.},

This article reviews much of the research that has evaluated the role of diet in the causation, primary treatment, and adjunctive therapy of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Benefits have been demonstrated in the use of elemental diets or polymeric diets in CD in both acute flare up or maintenance of IBD. A careful team approach can overcome problems in implementing nutritional therapy. Nutrition also has a critical benefit in postoperative CD and perioperative UC. Numerous easily corrected, nutritional abnormalities are often overlooked in patients with IBD, which may have significant consequences. Nutritional therapy may have a central place in the hierarchy of treatment in IBD and further research is critical in this area to better define the benefits of nutrition in IBD.},

   abstract = {The surgical procedure for forming an ileoanal anastomosis with a J pouch (IAA) usually involves a temporary ileostomy; patients undergoing IAA surgery thus need to recover quickly because they return for ileostomy closure 3 mo later. We evaluated the effects of perioperative biosynthetic growth hormone (GH) treatment on short- and long-term changes in body composition and on nutritional intake. Patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing IAA surgery were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with placebo (n=12) or 6 IU GH twice daily (n=12) from 2 d before to 7 d after the operation. Examinations were from 2 d before to 9 d after the operation and on days 30 and 90. Body composition was assessed with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner. The 2 groups had similar nutritional intakes. On postoperative day 7, placebo-treated patients had lost 4.2 kg (95% CI: 3.0, 5.4) total tissue mass, 3.6 kg (2.1, 5.1) lean tissue mass, and 0.5 kg (-0.1, 1.2) fat mass. These reductions persisted 3 mo later. Compared with placebo, GH improved nitrogen balance, changes in lean tissue mass [gain of 4.0 kg (1.9, 6.0), P=0.001], and changes in total tissue mass [gain of 3.2 kg (1.6, 4.9), P=0.001], but increased the loss of fat mass [loss of 0.7 kg (0.0, 1.5), P=0.049] on postoperative day 7. Three months later, the placebo-treated patients had lost 2.4 kg (0.7, 4.2) more lean tissue mass than GH-treated patients (P=0.009), whereas changes in total tissue and fat mass were not significantly different. Hence, GH treatment enhanced the long-term regain of lean tissue mass.},

AIMS: To determine whether MCTs and medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are absorbed in the colon like the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) or are lost in faeces similarly to long chain fatty acids (LCFAs). METHODS: Nine small bowel resected patients without and 10 with a colon in continuity excreted 2-6 MJ/day and were randomised and crossed over between two high fat diets (10 MJ/day, 50% as fat), based on either long chain triglycerides (LCT) alone or equal quantities of LCT and MCT. RESULTS: Patients with a colon absorbed C8-C10 fatty acids considerably better than patients without a colon at similar and extreme levels of LCFA malabsorption; the colonic impact on absorption of C14-18 fatty acids was negligible. MCT redoubled fat (MCT+LCT) absorption from 23% to 58% in patients with a colon, and increased overall bomb calorimetric energy absorption from 46% to 58%. The increase in fat absorption from 37% to 46% in patients without a colon did not improve overall energy absorption because malabsorption of carbohydrate and protein increased. CONCLUSION: In small bowel resected patients, the colon seems to serve as a digestive organ for medium chain fat, probably absorbed as MCFAs, perhaps because like the SCFAs, they are water soluble. Only patients with a colon gained from MCT treatment.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of feeding GBF or germinated gramineous seeds on experimental ulcerative colitis. Sprague-Dawley rats that received 3% dextran sulfate sodium in their diets were used as an experimental colitis model. The effects of sulfasalazine, a drug used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, were compared with those of GBF. After rats had consumed diets containing GBF or various aleurone and scutellum fractions, mucosal damage; the content of mucosal protein, RNA, and DNA in the colo-rectum; and serum interleukin-8 and alpha1-acid glycoprotein levels were assessed. GBF and germinated seeds more effectively prevented bloody diarrhea and mucosal damage in colitis compared with controls and rats receiving sulfasalazine, but non-germinated samples did not have a protective effect. GBF increased mucosal protein and RNA content in the colitis model. The consumption of GBF appears to prevent inflammation in a colitis model, and its effect seems to be related to the germination process. GBF and germinated seeds have the potential to serve as nutritional therapy for ulcerative colitis.},

PATIENTS: Preillness non dietary habits and factors were studied in 88 patients with recent onset of inflammatory bowel diseases (55 with ulcerative colitis and 33 with Crohn's disease) and in matched 76 population and 68 clinic controls. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in relation to education, housing, birth weight, breast feeding in infancy and current weight. The current body mass index was significantly lower in patients as compared to clinic controls (p < 0.05). More patients had low levels of physical activity during the preillness period as compared to controls (p < 0.001 vs clinic controls), while more controls engaged in moderate (p < 0.05) or high levels of physical activity in the corresponding periods. Patients spent fewer hours in strenuous physical activity as compared to controls (NS). Patients slept fewer hours per day (p < 0.05 vs clinic controls). More patients than controls experienced stressful life events during the year prior to onset of symptoms (p < 0.05 for patients with Crohn's disease against both controls and all patients vs population controls). CONCLUSIONS: Other environmental factors besides smoking and diet may affect the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: During total parenteral nutrition, gallbladder motility is impaired, resulting in sludge and stone formation. Little is known about gallbladder motility during prolonged enteral nutrition. METHODS: We studied gallbladder motility during continuous enteral nutrition (CEN) in nine hospitalized patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. The patients received a polymeric diet (2000 kcal/24 h) by CEN through a nasogastric tube for a prolonged period. Gallbladder volumes were obtained daily by ultrasonography, starting from day 0 (before CEN) and on 7 consecutive days during CEN. At days 0, 1, 4, and 7, the gallbladder response to i.v. cholecystokinin (CCK-33; 0.5 Ivy Dog unit/kg/h) was studied. Plasma CCK levels were determined at regular intervals by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed on day 0 between patients and a group of nine healthy control subjects in fasting gallbladder volumes (19.4 +/- 2.3 and 19.6 +/- 2.4 cm3, respectively) and gallbladder contraction during CCK infusion (56 +/- 14% and 69 +/- 7%, respectively). During CEN, from day 1 to day 7, mean gallbladder volume remained significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared with fasting gallbladder volume, and mean plasma CCK levels remained significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared with fasting levels. Although gallbladder volume was significantly reduced during CEN, the gallbladder contractile response to CCK was not affected; at days 1, 4, and 7, gallbladder contraction was 36-57%. CONCLUSIONS: During CEN, 1) gallbladder volume is significantly reduced and plasma CCK levels are significantly increased, 2) these effects are sustained over time (7 days), and 3) the gallbladder remains responsive to exogenous CCK. These results indicate that gallbladder contractility and gallbladder responsiveness to CCK are preserved during prolonged CEN in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Prompt diagnosis and exclusion of infection requires a minimum of rigid sigmoidoscopy, rectal mucosal biopsy and stool culture. Admission to hospital is mandatory for patients with features of severe disease, or who are in their first attack of ulcerative colitis and have bloody diarrhoea, even if the criteria for severe disease are not met. Once admitted, the patient should be monitored by plain abdominal X-ray, full blood count, serum albumin and C reactive protein on alternate days; temperature and pulse rate should be recorded four times per day. Treatment should be instituted as soon as the diagnosis is made with an intravenous corticosteroid (hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously, four times daily, or equivalent). Antibiotics may be included if infection cannot be confidently excluded. Free diet can be allowed but attention should be given to nutritional, fluid and electrolyte status with intravenous replacement if necessary. Any evidence of colonic dilatation occurring despite maximal therapy should be regarded as an absolute indication for colectomy. The patient should be kept fully informed from an early stage about the likely natural history of the condition and about the possible therapeutic options including surgery. Cyclosporin therapy should be reserved for patients who have a poor response to the first 3-4 days of corticosteroid therapy, particularly those with serum C reactive protein > 45 mg/l and who do not yet have absolute indications for colectomy. Most patients who have not convincingly responded within 10 days of starting full medical therapy should undergo colectomy, although partial responders who are afebrile may reasonably continue for up to 14 days before a final decision. Approximately 30-40% of patients with severe colitis will need colectomy within the first 6 months. With optimal management, mortality should be zero, but better medical therapies are urgently needed to reduce the colectomy rate.},

   abstract = {This study evaluated whether twice daily isotonic perfusion of the bypassed ileum for six weeks would enhance its motor activity and its absorption of fluids, electrolytes, and vitamin B12. The study also determined if patients undergoing perfusion had improved bowel function and decreased hospital stay after ileostomy closure. Following proctocolectomy, ileal pouch-anal canal anastomosis, and diverting loop ileostomy, six patients self-infused an isotonic solution (sucrose and sodium chloride) into the bypassed ileum twice daily, while seven patients did not (controls). Two months following proctocolectomy, and just prior to ileostomy closure, a manometric catheter assembly was placed into the unused distal ileum via the stoma and the distal ileum perfused with an isotonic sodium chloride solution for 3 hr during fasting and 3 hr after a meal. Absorption was measured, single and clustered pressure waves were identified, and a motility index was calculated. Water absorption, motility index, and cluster parameters did not improve in perfused patients compared to controls during fasting or after a meal, nor did perfused patients have improved vitamin B12 absorption. The perfused patients also did no better clinically following ileostomy takedown; the onset of bowel movements, their frequency, time to tolerate a diet, and hospital stay were similar to controls. We conclude that six weeks of twice daily isotonic perfusion did not improve motor activity or water, electrolyte, and vitamin B12 absorption in the bypassed distal ileum after proctocolectomy, ileal pouch-anal canal anastomosis, and loop ileostomy. The perfusion also did not improve bowel function after ileostomy takedown.},

   abstract = {The ability of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to tolerate dairy products and the guidance they receive from physicians and nutritionists on this subject are important considerations in the management of their IBD. Although most affected persons are able to consume a glass of milk daily without discomfort, additional consideration must be given to specific factors that can be relevant to certain individuals. The declaration by patients that they are "dairy sensitive" may be related to lactose intolerance or malabsorption, the long-chain triacylglycerol content of milk, allergy to milk proteins, as well as psychologic factors and the misconception that dairy products can be detrimental to their health. The prevalence of lactose malabsorption is significantly greater in patients with Crohn disease involving the small bowel than it is in patients with Crohn disease involving the colon or ulcerative colitis. In the latter colonic conditions the prevalence of lactose malabsorption is mainly determined by ethnic risk, which is based on genetic factors. In addition, lactose malabsorption in Crohn disease of the small bowel may be determined by factors other than lactase enzyme activity, such as bacterial overgrowth and/or small bowel transit time. Physicians differ widely in the advice they give their patients: some dogmatically advise avoidance of dairy products when the diagnosis is made whereas others discount the possible role of dairy in the management of IBD. IBD patients avoid dairy products more than they would need to based on the prevalence of lactose malabsorption and/or milk intolerance, probably partly because of incorrect patient perceptions and arbitrary advice from physicians and authors of popular diet books. Adequate scientific and clinical information is now available to permit recommendations about the intake of dairy products for each IBD patient.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) has been shown to attenuate intestinal injury in animal models, largely by increasing luminal short-chain fatty acid production. AIM: To investigate the safety and efficacy of GBF in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Ten patients with active UC received 30 g of GBF daily for 4 weeks in an open-label treatment protocol while the baseline anti-inflammatory therapy was continued. The response to treatment was evaluated clinically and endoscopically. Pre- and post-treatment stool concentrations of short-chain fatty acids were measured by gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Patients showed improvement in their clinical activity index scores, with a significant decrease in the score from 6.9+/-1.4 to 2.8+/-1.5 (mean+/-S.E.M., P < 0.05). The endoscopic index score fell from 6.1+/-2.3 to 3.8+/-2.3 (P < 0.0001). Patients showed an increase in stool butyrate concentrations after GBF treatment (P < 0.05). No side-effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Oral GBF therapy may have a place in management of ulcerative colitis, but controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its efficacy in the treatment of this disorder.},

This study evaluated the influence of different dietary fatty acids, i.e., monounsaturated, n-3, and n-3 + n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, on the recovery of the colonic mucosa histological pattern, the cellular antioxidant defense system of colon, and PGE2 and LTB4 colonic mucosa contents in a model of ulcerative colitis induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Administration of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids led to a minimum stenosis score, a higher histological recovery, lower colon alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activities, and lower mucosal levels of PGE2 and LTB4 compared with the other two experimental groups. However, glutathione transferase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activities were lower in the group treated with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids than in the groups fed with either the monounsaturated or the n-6 + n-3 polyunsaturated enriched diet. We conclude that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can be administered to prevent inflammation in ulcerative colitis, but they cause a decrease in the colonic antioxidant defense system, promoting oxidative injury at the site of inflammation.},

The effect of oral consumption of a bovine whey-derived growth factor extract (WGFE) on lipid peroxidation was assessed using the ethane breath test in the dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) model of ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats. METHODS: Groups of rats consumed water (control), 2% DSS in drinking water, 2% DSS with a WGFE-supplemented diet, or 2% DSS plus prednisolone (1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) for 6 weeks, changing to sulphasalazine (100 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) for the subsequent 4 weeks. Ethane breath tests were conducted on all animals on days 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 (acute phase) and weeks 3, 6, and 9 (chronic phase) after commencement of DSS consumption. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in ethane production between any groups during the acute phase. Ethane was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in rats consuming DSS alone in week 6 compared with control but had decreased to control levels by week 9. WGFE and conventional therapy were effective in suppressing ethane production in week 3. CONCLUSIONS: WGFE is as effective as conventional therapies at limiting ethane production and thus ostensibly colonic lipid peroxidation in the early phases of experimental chronic UC.},

AIM: To investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in comparison with matched population and clinic controls. METHODS: Quantified dietary histories were obtained from 87 patients with recent IBD (54 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 33 Crohn's disease (CD)) and 144 controls. Odds ratios (OR) for IBD were derived for intake levels of various foods. RESULTS: A high sucrose consumption was associated with an increased risk for IBD (OR 2.85 (p = 0.03) against population controls and 5.3 (p = 0.00) against clinic controls). Lactose consumption showed no effect while fructose intake was negatively associated with risk for IBD (NS). Similar trends were noted in UC and CD. A high fat intake was associated with an increased risk for UC; this was particularly marked for animal fat (OR 4.09, p = 0.02) and cholesterol (OR 4.57, p = 0.02). A high intake of fluids (p = 0.04), magnesium (p = 0.04), vitamin C, and fruits (NS) was negatively associated with the risk for IBD, while a positive association was found for retinol (p = 0.01). Most of the findings were similar in UC and CD except for potassium and vegetable consumption which showed a negative association only with risk for CD. CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between pre-illness diet and subsequent development of UC and CD. The effect of dietary components may be primary or modulatory.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) since the Second World War coincides with profound changes of the dietary pattern. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible pathogenic role of some characteristic 'modern life' dietary factors in IBD. DESIGN: Case-control, studying risk factors in recently diagnosed cases, 290 with Crohn's disease and 398 with ulcerative colitis, compared with 616 population controls. Smoking, age, gender and education were taken into account by using logistic regression analysis. SETTING: Hospital cases and population controls. INTERVENTIONS: Questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression-derived odds ratios. RESULTS: A positive association with cola drinks [OR: 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-3.1)], chewing gum [OR: 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1-2.1)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95% CI: 1.8-3.5)] and a negative association with citrus fruit consumption [OR: 0.5 (95% CI 0.3-0.7)] and the development of Crohn's disease were found. Consumption of cola drinks [OR: 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.3)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95% CI 1.8-3.5)] were positively associated with developing ulcerative colitis. There was a negative association between the intake of citrus fruits [OR: 0.5 (95% CI 0.4-0.8)] and 'having a stuffed pet' for a period longer than 5 years [OR: 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.9)] and developing the disorder. No association with the frequency of tooth brushing and developing IBD was found. CONCLUSION: All the nutritional items mentioned may be true risk factors or they just might be the expression of a modern life-style also involving other risk factors for the development of IBD which at the present are still unknown.},

   abstract = {The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by intestinal inflammation of unknown etiology. Two distinct disorders, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, have been identified. Three theories of IBD etiology are currently under consideration: 1) reaction to a persistent intestinal infection, 2) existence of a defective mucosal barrier to luminal antigens, and 3) a dysregulated host immune response to ubiquitous antigens. In each of these theories, either pathogenic or resident luminal bacteria constantly stimulate the mucosal and systemic immune systems to perpetuate the inflammatory cascade. Chronicity of inflammation results from an interaction of the persistent stimulus of microbial antigens with genetically determined host susceptibility factors that determine the individual's immune response or mucosal barrier function. The pathogenesis of IBD involves a series of steps, beginning with the breach of the intestinal mucosal barrier by infectious agents or toxins. The defective barrier exposes lamina propria immune cells to the continual presence of resident luminal bacteria, bacterial products, or dietary antigens, which perpetuates the inflammatory cascade. Many immunoregulatory abnormalities are noted in IBD, including the ratio of proinflammatory to immunosuppressive cytokines, selective activation of T(H) lymphocyte subsets, and abnormalities in epithelial antigen presentation. When activated during the initial inflammatory process, macrophages and T lymphocytes secrete a host of cytokines, which recruit other inflammatory cell types, thereby continuing the process. Tissue injury is the net result of the soluble products of the activated inflammatory cells. Knowledge of the pathogenesis in IBD suggests that the ultimate goals of therapy should be to block the proinflammatory mediators toward the proximal, rather than the distal, end of the cascade, to decrease the constant antigenic drive of luminal bacteria, and to correct the dysregulated immune response.},

Male 9-week-old rats were intracolonically administrated trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) and fed the experimental diets containing 0.05% catechin and 0.025% alpha-tocopherol for 1 week, then dissected. The extent of colitis-induced TNBS was assessed macroscopically. The supplementation of catechins and alpha-tocopherol significantly decreased colonic damage compared with the group fed the basal diet (the disease control). In particular, catechin feeding completely inhibited the development of colon adhesions. Colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, which is a marker of neutrophil infiltration into the colonic mucosa, was lower in the groups that had been given catechins and alpha-tocopherol. The levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in colon was highest in the disease control group; however, the differences among the groups were not significant. Plasma alkaline phosphatase activity was maintained at normal levels in the rats supplemented with catechins and alpha-tocopherol. These results suggest that catechins and alpha-tocopherol have anti-inflammatory effects on TNBS-induced rat colitis.},

   abstract = {Highly toxic sulfur-containing gases have been pathogenetically implicated in ulcerative colitis. Utilizing a rat model, we studied the production and elimination of sulfur-containing gases within the unperturbed colon. The major sulfur-containing gases were hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methanethiol, and dimethyl sulfide with cecal accumulation rates of 2.6, 0.096, and 0.046 microliter/min, respectively. The dependence of H2S production on dietary components was demonstrated via a sixfold reduction with fasting and a fivefold increase with carrageenan (a nonabsorbable, sulfur compound) feeding. Zinc acetate reduced cecal H2S by fivefold, indicating the importance of H2S binding by divalent cations. During passage from the cecum to the rectum, > 90% of the sulfur gases were absorbed or metabolized. An H2 35S turnover of 97%/min was observed in the isolated cecum. Thus mucosal exposure is > 10 times the measured accumulation rate. Cecal mucosal tissue very rapidly metabolized H2S and methanethiol via a nonmethylating reaction.},

   abstract = {A recurrent theme in the schema of pathogenetic mechanisms attributed to colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the interaction between genes and environment. Dietary and other environmental factors, and lower intestinal flora and their chemical interactions occur in the pathogenesis of both. Events at the mucosal surface may be influenced by factors in the luminal environment and by contributions of the host. In addition, both forms of IBD--Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)--have distinctive associated host events. Even within CD and UC, different clinical patterns and prognoses may have different specific host mechanisms. Some of the current putative pathogenetic processes in CRC and IBD are reviewed. Particular attention is given to hypotheses relating to the role of dietetic substances, mainly fibre and dairy products, and how they may affect disease formation. It is argued that within the context of hypotheses proposed for possible beneficial effects of these two dietetic factors, CRC and IBD may be considered together. Further support is lent to arguments that similar and additional hypothetical features ascribed to beneficial effects of fibre may be attributed to disaccharides, lactose and its derivatives, lactulose and lactitol.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the procedure of choice for most patients with ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis, most patients have problems with stool frequency and/or consistency. Although most clinicians recommend fiber supplementation for these patients, we could find no studies that prove the efficacy of this practice. The first purpose of this study was to document the effect of fiber supplementation on intestinal function in patients after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Because pectin, a soluble fiber supplement, has been reported to slow gastric and intestinal transit, we also hypothesized that pectin would be a superior fiber supplement in these patients. The second purpose, therefore, was to determine whether the effects of pectin on intestinal transit would result in decreased stool frequency in patients with an ileal pouch. METHODS: Thirteen patients who had undergone ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis were entered into a 9-wk crossover study. The protocol consisted of three 2-wk study periods, each of which was preceded by a 1-wk washout period. During the three study periods patients supplemented their diets, in random order, with Citrucel, 1 tablespoon twice daily; pectin, 1 tablespoon twice daily; or no supplement. Patients maintained detailed dietary and bowel function diaries. RESULTS: The effects (mean +/- SE) of Citrucel and pectin supplementation are summarized in Table 1. There was no significant effect of either supplement on stool frequency, pouch function, bloating, or stool consistency. In addition, there were no differences in continence. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence to support the common practice of fiber supplementation in patients with an ileal pouch. Furthermore, this study did not find that stool frequency decreased during supplementation with pectin. We conclude that there is little role for fiber supplementation in patients with an ileal pouch.},

   abstract = {Butyrate, a SCFA generated by microbial fermentation of dietary substrates, is produced in the colon of humans and may influence colonic disease. It is possible to manipulate the diet in order to enhance levels of butyrate in various regions of the large intestine. Butyrate is absorbed by colonocytes in the proximal colon via passive diffusion and by active transport mechanisms which are linked to various ion exchange transporters. In the distal colon, the main mechanism of absorption is passive diffusion of the lipid-soluble form. Butyrate and other SCFA are important for the absorption of electrolytes by the large intestine and may play a role in preventing certain types of diarrhea. The mechanism by which butyrate and other SCFA exerts control over fluid and electrolyte fluxes in the colon is not well delineated though it may occur through an energy generated fuel effect, the up-regulation of various electrolyte transport systems, as well as possible effects on neuroendocrine factors. Butyrate has been shown to have beneficial effects on some colonic pathologies. This SCFA may be protective against colorectal neoplasia. Butyrate regulates colonic motility, increases colonic blood flow and may enhance colonic anastomosis healing. Butyrate may reduce the symptoms from ulcerative colitis and diversion colitis and it may prevent the progression of colitis in general. Further investigations are needed to confirm these findings in controlled, randomized, double blinded clinical studies.},

   abstract = {It is currently held that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves a complex interaction of host responses, some immunologic and genetically determined, and external influences including microbial and dietary factors. Nutritional surveys and studies testing stepwise exclusion dietary compounds have suggested that dietary factors might be linked to the occurrence of IBD. Food allergy was suggested early as a possible trigger for the inflammatory response; however, no firm evidence has been gathered over the years to substantiate this possibility. The possibility that patients with Crohn's disease may have an unusual premorbid pattern of dietary intake has also been examined since the early seventies. Several groups of investigators report a high intake of refined sugars (i.e. sucrose), recycled cooking oil, a more frequent consumption of fast foods in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis respectively. However, a critical comparison of incidence and prevalence studies published from 1976 until 1994 clearly showed no pre-existing nutritional abnormality that has been identified consistently in patients who develop inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the effects of olestra, a zero-calorie fat substitute that is neither digested nor absorbed, on the well-being and disease state of persons with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (n = 43) or Crohn's disease (n = 46) in remission, with a history of disease of 2 years or longer, were enrolled in this prospective study from nine private practices, three university-based medical centers, and one Veterans Administration medical center in the United States. Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive olestra and 45 to receive triglycerides in chips or cookies daily for 4 weeks. At Week 4, patients were classified as in remission, worsened, or relapsed according to an investigator's global assessment based on sigmoidoscopy (for ulcerative colitis) or the Crohn's disease activity index, laboratory findings, and clinical course. RESULTS: At Week 4, the olestra and triglyceride groups did not differ significantly with respect to the percentages of patients who relapsed (P = 0.494; difference = 2.4%; upper 95% CL = 8.8%) or with respect to the percentages of patients who experienced any worsening of their symptoms (P = 0.630; difference = 0.2%; upper 95% CL = 13.3%). Of evaluable patients, 90% (37 of 41) given olestra remained in remission with no worsening, compared with 90% (38 of 42) given triglycerides. Gastrointestinal symptoms were comparable between the treatment groups, and there were no treatment-related laboratory abnormalities. Six patients were excluded from analysis for reasons unrelated to treatment. CONCLUSION: Olestra did not affect the activity of quiescent mild to moderate IBD.},
