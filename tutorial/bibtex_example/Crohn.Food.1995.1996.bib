   abstract = {GI trophic factors that influence the coordinated pre- and postnatal growth and development of the GI tract have been identified. Studies in animals and humans demonstrate that GI trophic factors can initiate cellular growth and expression of differentiated function, and they are important in adaptation and repair following injury. Systemically as well as enterally administered growth factors can stimulate GI growth and maturation, suggesting that trophic factors in the serum of neonates may modulate GI growth via receptors on the serosal membranes of enterocytes. GI trophic factors may be synthesized endogenously or provided postnatally in milk. GI trophic factors in human milk play an important role in regulating the adaptive functional changes that accompany the transition to postnatal enteral feedings. Although human milk growth factors do not appear to be essential for infant survival, the elevated risk of gastrointestinal-related illnesses in formula-fed as compared with breast-fed infants (diarrhea, necrotizing enterocolitis, colitis, Crohn's disease) suggest that bioactive compounds in human milk contribute to the apparent protective effect of breast feeding. GI trophic factors have the potential to be used therapeutically to enhance GI maturation and repair following injury. These applications may be particularly useful in the premature or postsurgical infant. Several issues require further research, including (1) the mechanism of action, (2) the efficacy of oral versus systemic administration, (3) characterization of the complex interactions between the various growth factors, because some appear to act synergistically, (4) the effect of exogenously administered growth factors on endogenous production of that factor, its receptor, or other growth factors, (5) the effect of growth factors upon tissues not directly associated with the GI tract, and (6) the determination of safe and effective upper limits.},

   abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: Fish oil, rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, can alter leukotriene production and hence neutrophil function, factors which may be important in the inflammation of Crohn's disease (CD). Therefore we studied the effect of dietary PUFA on neutrophil mediated ileal inflammation and neutrophil function in the rat. METHODS: Animals were ad libitum-fed pellet diets containing 9.5% fish oil (menhaden oil, rich in n-3 PUFA) with 0.5% safflower oil, 10% safflower oil (rich in n-6 PUFA) or standard chow (6% fat) for 50 days prior to the study. Weight and circulating leukocyte and total neutrophil counts were identical in all three groups. Neutrophil mediated ileal inflammation induced by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) perfusion was evaluated by measuring macromolecular uptake of radiolabelled dextran (MW 70,000) and changes in mucosal neutrophil infiltration. RESULTS: The fish oil diet group showed no difference in fMLP-induced permeability changes relative to the Chow Control group. However, the Safflower Oil supplemented diet group had a reduced permeability response (p < 0.01). Mirroring the permeability changes, there was diminished mucosal neutrophil infiltration in the Safflower Oil group following ileal perfusion with fMLP (< .005). Chemotaxis and chemiluminescence, two important neutrophil functions, were also significantly suppressed in the Safflower Oil animals (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The failure of a n-3 PUFA enriched diet to diminish the ileal inflammatory response to a bacterial peptide and suppress neutrophil function in the rat suggests such therapy would not be expected to be highly successful in CD. However, it requires confirmation in man, especially under the more complicated inflammatory conditions found in CD. On the other hand, the decreased neutrophil mediated responses with a high linoleic acid (n-6 PUFA) diet warrant further investigation.},

   abstract = {The majority of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients not only possess HLA-B27, but during active phases of the disease have elevated levels of total serum IgA, suggesting that a microbe from the bowel flora is acting across the gut mucosa. Biochemical studies have revealed that Klebsiella bacteria, not only possess 2 molecules carrying sequences resembling HLA-B27 but increased quantities of such microbes are found in fecal samples obtained from AS patients and such patients have Crohn's like lesions in the ileo-caecal regions of the gut. Furthermore AS patients from 10 different countries have been found to have elevated levels of specific antibodies against Klebsiella bacteria. It has been suggested that these Klebsiella microbes, found in the bowel flora, might be the trigger factors in this disease and therefore reduction in the size of the bowel flora could be of benefit in the treatment of AS patients. Microbes from the bowel flora depend on dietary starch for their growth and therefore a reduction in starch intake might be beneficial in AS patients. A "low starch diet" involving a reduced intake of "bread, potatoes, cakes and pasta" has been devised and tested in healthy control subjects and AS patients. The "low starch diet" leads to a reduction of total serum IgA in both healthy controls as well as patients, and furthermore to a decrease in inflammation and symptoms in the AS patients. The role of a "low starch diet" in the management of AS requires further evaluation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to evaluate, using meta-analysis techniques, whether enteral nutrition is effective in inducing clinical remission in active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Randomized trials either comparing enteral nutrition with steroids or comparing elemental (amino acid-based) with nonelemental diets were selected using MEDLINE (1984 to 1994), reference lists from published articles, reviews, and abstracts from major gastrointestinal meetings. Sixteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria (four published as abstracts). Crude rates for induction of remission were collected on an intention-to-treat basis by three independent observers. Each study was given a quality score, based on predetermined criteria. RESULTS: The pooled odds ratio (OR) for all type of enteral diets compared with steroid therapy was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.53). This result was similar for the best studies (by quality score) combined, for trials using tube feeding combined, and when noncompliant patients were withdrawn. Further subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of the type of diet administered. Peptide-based diets were significantly inferior to steroids (pooled OR, 0.32; CI, 0.20 to 0.52). There was a trend to lower remission rate after elemental diets than after steroids (pooled OR, 0.44; CI 0.17 to 1.12). On the other hand, pooled OR for whole protein-based diets compared with elemental diets was 1.28 (CI, 0.40 to 4.02). CONCLUSIONS: Data available to date show that steroids are better than enteral nutrition to induce remission in active Crohn's disease. These results are more evident when peptide-based diets are administered, but they are not conclusive when either elemental or whole protein-based diets are used.},

   abstract = {We investigated the effect of nutritional therapy with an elemental diet (ED) for active Crohn's disease. One hundred and thirty-nine patients with Crohn's disease were enrolled in this study. Remission was judged to be present when the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease score was < or = 1 and the CRP and ESR values were within the respective normal ranges. An amount of 30kcal per 1kg of ideal body weight (IBW) per day was administered enterally, and the effect on the induction of remission in relation to various patient background factors, such as disease type, history of bowel resection, and the presence/absence of complications, was determined. An excellent remission rate was achieved in those patients to whom an adequate amount of ED could be administered. Remission rates were lower in the patient groups with any of the following complications: stenotic bowel lesions, abdominal masses, fistulas, and anal lesions. Even in those groups in which stenotic lesions or abdominal masses were present, when adequate amounts of ED could be administered, the remission rate did not differ from that in the groups without these complications. The remission rates in the groups with and without fistulas at any site, including fistulas in the anal region, were 40.0% and 82.5%, respectively, with remission being considerably easier to achieve in the patients without fistulas. Similarly, remission was difficult to achieve when anal lesions were present. These results suggest that, for active Crohn's disease, nutritional therapy with ED ( > or = 35kcal/kg IBW) should be enthusiastically administered, and in patients in whom the presence of complications necessitates therapy for 3 months or more, this point be considered to indicate a possible surgical approach.},

Oral application of 2500 mg 5-ASA sulfate/kg b.w./d for 28 days to rats resulted in significantly increased body weight gain and food and water consumption. Alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase values were elevated in high-dosed (2500 mg/kg b.w./d p.o.) males. Relative liver weights were significantly increased in high-dosed males and females and the macroscopical inspection revealed thickened liver margins. The no-effect level following 28 days of oral application to rats was determined as 500 mg 5-ASA sulfate/kg b.w./d. In acute local tolerance studies in rabbits, 5-ASA sulfate is rated as non-irritant to the skin and the eye. After a single oral administration of 1800 mg 5-ASA sulfate to 5 healthy human test subjects, 5-ASA sulfate was almost completely metabolized by all test subjects within 3 days; mean urinary and faecal excretion of unchanged 5-ASA sulfate amounted to only 6.7% of the administered dose. A high faecal excretion of the active metabolite 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) (21.2% of the administered dose) and a low urinary excretion (1.4% of the administered dose) were observed.},

During the period, two patients died; one of sepsis and the other from hepatic failure. Three of the remaining patients have since moved on to oral feeding, but four patients continued on HPN. The majority of these patients have attained a normal weight and height for age while receiving HPN. All patients were fed via an implanted silicone catheter. Catheters were removed and replaced due to complications including nine episodes of infection, four episodes of occlusion, three episodes of breakage and two episodes of dislodgement. Catheter-related sepsis was the most common cause of morbidity and hospital readmission in patients receiving HPN, but was acceptably rare. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently cultured organism from either the catheter tip or the blood. HPN is a relatively safe feeding method for patients who would otherwise remain hospitalized for prolonged periods on parenteral nutrition for permanent or prolonged intestinal failure.},

Malnutrition is a common occurrence in IBD, and this must be considered in the treatment of these diseases. Nutritional support in IBD has limited use as primary therapy (Table 2). Even though parenteral and enteral nutrition have been associated with remission, relapse frequently occurs when normal food intake is resumed. Likewise, fistulae may resolve with aggressive, nutritional therapy, but they frequently recur with reinstitution of food. In short bowel syndrome caused by extensive intestinal resection performed in CD, parenteral nutrition provides an important mode of therapy. In addition, perioperative use of nutritional support may decrease the incidence of postoperative complications in patients who are malnourished. Nutritional support in pediatric patients with CD who have growth failure has been effective in stimulating growth.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effect of nasogastric feeding with high- and low-fat, peptide-based diets on body composition and disease activity was studied in adolescents with active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Fourteen patients with active Crohn's disease (12 to 17 years) were fed exclusively through nasogastric feedings with two isocaloric, isonitrogenous, peptide-based diets, either with low- or high-fat content, for 3 weeks each in a randomized manner then were "crossed over" to the other diet for another 3 weeks of feeding. At the end of each 3-week period, urine and stools were collected for 72 hours for measuring energy absorption and nitrogen utilization (n = 6). Weight, height, triceps skin folds, fat free body mass, and disease activity were also monitored (n = 14). RESULTS: There was no difference in any parameter of energy absorption or nitrogen utilization between the two formulas irrespective of the order in which they were administered. The changes in nutritional parameters were also comparable with both formulas. There was a significant increase in weight, fat free body mass and triceps skinfold thickness during both the 3-week periods of feeding (p < .05). This was accompanied by a significant reduction in the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Peptide-based diets may be useful in restoring the fat free body mass and improving the disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease. A high fat (high medium-chain triglycerides) diet did not offer any nutritional advantage over a similar but low-fat diet. The improvement in disease activity during feeding with a low-fat diet was comparable to that with a high-fat diet. The improvement in disease activity seems to be associated with improvement in lean body mass irrespective of the type of diet used to achieve it.},

   abstract = {Short-bowel syndrome is a state of severe malabsorption secondary to extensive bowel resection. The most common reasons for extensive bowel resection are Crohn's disease and mesenteric infarction. The pathophysiological consequences depend on extent and site of resection, integrity and adaptation of the remaining bowel, and secondary effects on other organs. Most extensively bowel resected patients can be adequately nourished by mouth, especially since they develop compensatory hyperphagia. For patients with colon in function a high-carbohydrate low-fat diet is beneficial compared to a diet with a normal fat content, because it results in decreased diarrhoea, decreased faecal mineral losses, and increased energy assimilation. The relative amount of dietary fat does not influence stool mass or energy assimilation in jejunostomy patients. Patients with jejunostomy have a high faecal output of water, sodium, and divalent cations, and they often need permanent parenteral supply of saline as well as calcium and magnesium if their small intestinal remnant is < 200 cm and parenteral nutritional support if they retain < 100 cm small bowel. In contrast, 50 cm of the jejunum often suffices for adequate oral nutrition if most of the colon is preserved. The majority of patients needing long-term intravenous supply are trained to administer parenteral nutrition at home (HPN). Most patients on HPN obtain a good or fair quality of life with hospital readmissions corresponding to an average of 10% of the HPN duration and an overall HPN related mortality of about 4%.},

Mucosal biopsies were analyzed for protein carbonyl content (POPs), DNA oxidation products [8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)], reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), trace metals (copper, zinc, and iron) and superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD). In Crohn's disease biopsies, there was an increase in ROIs, POPs, 8-OHdG, and iron, while decreased copper and Cu-Zn SOD activity were found in inflamed tissues compared to controls. For ulcerative colitis, there was an increase in ROIs, POPs, and iron in inflamed tissue compared to controls, while decreased zinc and copper were observed. An imbalance in the formation of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant micronutrients may be important in the pathogenesis and/or perpetuation of the tissue injury in IBD and may provide a rationale for therapeutic modulation with antioxidants.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is no established therapy for maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease. Following different suggestions from the literature, two potential interventions for maintaining remission were tested against placebo, using either 5 g/day of a highly concentrated omega-3 fatty acid compound or a carbohydrate-reduced diet (84 g/day). METHODS: A total of 204 patients were recruited after they had had an acute relapse. After remission (CDAI < or = 150) was attained with steroid therapy, patients were randomized to receive either omega-3 fatty acids (n = 70), placebo (n = 65), or diet (n = 69). Low-dose prednisolone was given to all patients for the first 8 weeks of intervention. CDAI and an acute-phase protein (CRP) were used as criteria for a relapse. RESULTS: The proportion of patients without relapse within a year were similar in the placebo and active treatment group (intention-to-treat analysis: placebo, 30%; active treatment, 30%; protocol-adhering patients, 29% versus 28%). Patients did gain benefit (53%; p = 0.023) for as long as they maintained the diet. However, intention-to-treat analysis (diet group, 40%) did not show a noticeable difference when compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 fatty acids did not show an effect on extending the remission in Crohn's disease. For the diet patients the question remains whether the noncompliant patients dropped out early because they sensed a relapse approaching or whether their condition deteriorated because they failed to comply with the diet.},

In a previous study a whole protein containing diet proved less effective than one in which food antigens were excluded, suggesting that exclusion of food antigens from the gut was a possible mechanism. This study was designed to test whether an oligopeptide diet of hydrolysed proteins was as effective as an amino acid based diet. These diets were equally antigen free but with different nitrogen sources. Forty four patients with active Crohn's disease were randomised in a controlled trial of amino acid versus oligopeptide diet. The feeds were given by nasogastric tube in equicaloric quantities and were the sole form of nutrition. Treatment was continued for four weeks although failure to improve by day 10 resulted in withdrawal. Quantitative leucocyte scintigraphy was used to investigate the effect of diet treatment on gut inflammation. Clinical and nutritional responses to treatment were also measured. Sixteen patients entered remission (including withdrawal of corticosteroids), six patients could not tolerate the nasogastric tube, and 22 patients failed to respond. The two diets were equally effective. Patients who responded had a rapid drop in clinical index of disease activity and a major reduction in the bowel uptake of leucocytes on scintigraphy. The oligopeptide and amino acid based enteral feeds were equally effective at inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. With both diets clinical improvement was accompanied by a reduction in intestinal inflammation.},

Cyclic home elemental enteral alimentation (C-HEEA) was developed to prevent flare-up of CD and to minimize patient hospitalization. However, its therapeutic efficacy has not been studied in a large patient population. Therefore, questionnaires were sent to members of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Research Group of Japan to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA and to define the factors that may affect the efficacy of the treatment. Data for 410 patients (C-HEEA-treated n = 322; drug-treated n = 88) were collected from 29 institutions and analysis showed the following results. The cumulative remission and non-hospitalization rates of the C-HEEA treated group were significantly higher than the rates of the drug-treated group in all patients and in those with ileitis and ileo-colitis (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.01, respectively), but no significant difference was noted in patients with colitis. Cumulative remission and non-hospitalization rates were also influenced by the daily calorie content of the elemental diet (ED); more than 1200 kcal of the ED per day was found to be more effective than lower amounts to maintain remission and to prevent hospitalization. The therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA was shown to be superior to that of drug treatment in patients with CD with ileal involvement, and it is suggested that more than 1200kcal per day should be supplied by the ED to enhance its therapeutic efficacy.},

   abstract = {The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown. Several potential mechanisms are discussed. The etiological and therapeutic importance of nutrition is controversial. Though changes in dietary habits and incidence of inflammatory bowel disease during the last century were in parallel, no specific nutritional factor has been isolated. No dietary prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease is yet known; all dietary therapies in inflammatory bowel disease aim to improve nutritional support and to diminish inflammation by bowel rest. Children and adolescents gain in weight and height. Total parenteral nutrition will not substantially reduce disease activity and operation rates. Total parenteral nutrition can only be recommended in ulcerative colitis patients with severe disease in the initial phase and in Crohn's patients with severe malnutrition and intestinal complications. Enteral nutrition support is less effective in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. Reported remission rates on enteral nutrition are 25% for ulcerative colitis and up to 80% for Crohn. However, in active Crohn's disease enteral nutrition is less effective than standard therapy with methylprednisolone and sulfasalizine. It is generally believed that nutrition therapy in combination with drugs is the best treatment modality. There is no evidence to support the importance of any combination of the formula diets such as elemental, oligopeptide, or polymeric formulations. Administration of formula diets by nasogastric tubes all show similar remission rates. Whether newer diets supplemented with arginine, glutamine, omega-3-fatty acids or short chain fatty acids increase remission rates is not known. Further studies in this field are warranted.},

METHODS: Standard techniques for literature search were used to identify the pertinent trials. All studies included in our meta-analysis (n = 7) were aimed at comparing defined-formula diets versus steroids, using a randomized design. The patient-specific end-point of the meta-analysis was the occurrence of a treatment failure. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis indicated that steroids are more effective than defined-formula diets for inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. In fact, the relative risk of treatment failure (RTF) was significantly lower in the steroid group than in the diet group (risk values for patients given steroids compared with patients given diet: a) method of Mantel-Haenszel: RTF = 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.53; p < 0.001; b) method of Der Simonian & Laird: RTF = 0.43; 95% confidence interval, <0-0.94; p = 0.03). A separate analysis was carried out in which only the subgroup of patients who were not intolerant to diet were evaluated; this analysis also showed a superiority of steroids over diet. CONCLUSIONS: The data examined in this meta-analysis do not support the use of diets as primary treatment for acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease in adults.},

Disordered protein and carbohydrate metabolism have been reported in children with Crohn's disease, but little is known about their fat utilization. To assess fat oxidation, 13C-Hiolein was administered to 11 children with active Crohn's disease (age range, 10.5-16.9 years; mean, 12.6) before and after treatment with steroids. Expired breath samples were collected at hourly intervals for 12 h, and 13CO2 excretion was measured by mass spectrometry. The mean 95% confidence interval (CI) time to peak 13CO2 excretion was 9 h (range, 7.73-9.97) before treatment and 6.95 h (range, 5.75-8.15) after treatment (p < 0.02). Mean 95% CI cumulative 13CO2 excretion up to peak time (7 h) was 47.53% (range, 24-69%) before treatment and 68.7% (range, 35-80.5%) after treatment with steroids (p < 0.02). Our results demonstrated impaired lipid utilization during active disease and improvement following steroid treatment. The oral 13C-Hiolein test is simple and noninvasive, and its results are reproducible. It provides a new method for estimating fat utilization in paediatric patients, along with the possibility of discriminating between patients with and without impaired utilization during the acute phase of the disease.},

   abstract = {Nutrition and intestinal function are intimately interrelated. The chief purpose of the gut is to digest and absorb nutrients in order to maintain life. Consequently, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease commonly results in malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality. For example, studies have shown that 50-70% of adult patients with Crohn's disease were weight-depleted and 75% of adolescents growth-retarded. On the other hand, chronic malnutrition impairs digestive and absorptive function because food and nutrients are not only the major trophic factors to the gut but also provide the building blocks for digestive enzymes and absorptive cells. For example, recent studies of ours have shown that a weight loss of greater than 30% accompanying a variety of diseases was associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%, villus atrophy and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption. Finally, specific nutrients can induce disease, for example, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, whilst dietary factors such as fibre, resistant starch, short-chain fatty acids, glutamine and fish-oils may prevent gastrointestinal diseases such as diverticulitis, diversion colitis, ulcerative colitis, colonic adenomatosis and colonic carcinoma. The role of dietary antigens in the aetiology of Crohn's disease is controversial, but controlled studies have suggested that elemental diets may be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing a remission in patients with acute Crohn's disease. In conclusion, nutrition has both a supportive and therapeutic role in the management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. With the development of modern techniques of nutritional support, the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic GI disease can be reduced. On the other hand, dietary manipulation may be used to treat to prevent specific GI disorders such as coeliac disease, functional bowel disease, Crohn's disease and colonic neoplasia. The future development of nutria-pharmaceuticals is particularly attractive in view of their low cost and wide safety margins.},

Changes in linear growth were better after treatment with an elemental diet compared with steroids (p < 0.001). Serum albumin and haematocrit concentrations all improved significantly in the children treated with an elemental diet (p < 0.001) but not in those treated with steroids. Thus an elemental diet was better than prednisolone in proximal disease and confirmed improved growth and nutritional status.},

   abstract = {Macrophages at the base of human gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), become loaded early in life with dark granular pigment that is rich in aluminium, silicon, and titanium. The molecular characteristics, intracellular distribution, and source of this pigment is described. Laser scanning and electron microscopy showed that pigmented macrophages were often closely related to collagen fibres and plasma cells in GALT of both small and large intestine and contained numerous phagolysosomes, previously described as granules, that are rich in electron dense submicron sized particles. Morphological assessment, x ray microanalysis, and image electron energy loss spectroscopy showed three distinct types of microparticle: type I - spheres of titanium dioxide, 100-200 nm diameter, characterised as the synthetic food-additive polymorph anatase; type II - aluminosilicates, < 100-400 nm in length, generally of flaky appearance, often with adsorbed surface iron, and mostly characteristic of the natural clay mineral kaolinite; and type III - mixed environmental silicates without aluminium, 100-700 nm in length and of variable morphology. Thus, this cellular pigment that is partly derived from food additives and partly from the environment is composed of inert inorganic microparticles and loaded into phagolysosomes of macrophages within the GALT of all human subjects. These observations suggest that the pathogenicity of this pigment should be further investigated since, in susceptible individuals, the same intracellular distribution of these three types of submicron particle causes chronic latent granulomatous inflammation.},

   abstract = {In a 10-week randomised cross-sectional study we used an 88-item questionnaire to assess the quality of life in 16 children (ages 8-17 years) with Crohn's disease and their families. The questionnaire covered six domains of health-related quality of life, including disease and its treatment, social, emotional, family, education, and future aspects. Crohn's disease affected education, with absenteeism in 12 and distraction during school work in six. Three children had had a home tutor, and five stated their need for one. Engaging in sports was a problem for eight children, mainly because of a lack of energy in five and the presence of a stoma in three children. Three children had missed every PE lesson in 1 year. Five children cited the social problem of being unable to stay over at friends' houses. Bullying concerned parents more than the children. Holiday difficulties included long distance traveling or lack of toilet facilities during school trips. Elemental diet was the preferred treatment, although the majority complained about the taste. Surgery was the most effective method of symptom control, though the resulting stoma was upsetting and restricted sports activities. Children on steroids had more depressive symptoms. Using the Rutter A Questionnaire, five children were designated "neurotic." Parents' views of the severity of symptoms significantly correlated with their children's views regarding rectal bleeding, poor growth, lack of energy, and poor appetite (p < 0.01). The main parental concerns were the side effects of medications and issues concerning their children's future, including schooling, job prospects, and marriage. The parents of 11 children cited problems with children's behaviour. The parents of seven cited disruption of work, and those of six named taking holidays. Crohn's disease in children, in addition to being a symptomatically disabling condition, has a great impact on the health-related quality of life of both sufferers and their parents. The questionnaire was a useful instrument, and with some adjustment it can be used again in large group studies.},

   abstract = {The Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology characterized by a triad of recurrent orofacial swelling, relapsing facial paralysis, and fissured tongue. Exacerbations and recurrences are common. The orofacial swelling is characterized by fissured, reddish-brown, swollen, nonpruritic lips or firm edema of the face. The facial palsy is indistinguishable from Bell's palsy. The fissured tongue is seen in one third to one half of patients and, although the least common manifestation, its presence assists in diagnosis. The classic triad is not seen frequently in its complete form; therefore, diagnosis is difficult. This is particularly true because monosymptomatic and oligosymptomatic variants are seen more commonly. Cheilitis granulomatosa of Miescher is an example of a monosymptomatic variant of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The histologic findings of noncaseating, sarcoidal granulomas support the diagnosis. These granulomas are not invariably present, and their absence does not exclude the diagnosis of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. Thus, the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a disease with elements of orofacial granulomatosis. Orofacial granulomatosis is a clinicopathologic entity describing oral lesions with noncaseating granulomas. The spectrum of this entity includes patients with oral Crohn's disease, patients with oral lesions who will develop typical bowel symptoms of Crohn's disease in the ensuing months to years, patients with tooth-associated infections, patients with sarcoidosis, and patients with food or contact allergies. The value of the clinicopathologic construct of orofacial granulomatosis is to provoke the careful search for provocative causes for the reactive symptom complex of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome.},

In rats with TNBS-induced colitis, feeding with an elemental diet (ED) plus 2% n-3 PUEA-rich perilla oil significantly suppressed plasma leukotriene (LT) B4 and ulcer index compared to that in rats fed with ED plus 2% n-6 PUFA-rich safflower oil (34.2 +/- 12.3 s 63.8 +/- 13.2 pg/ml and 8.8 +/- 12.1 vs 66.4 +/- 33.1, P < 0.01, respectively). Moreover, the plasma LTB4 and the ulcer index were significantly correlated (P < 0.05). Feeding with ED plus 2% alpha-linolenic acid (A-LA)-rich vegetable oil significantly reduced plasma LTB4 and colonic weight compared to that in rats fed with ED plus 2% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/docosahexaenonic acid (DHA)-rich fish oil in this model (61.6 +/- 10.5 vs 85.0 +/- 20.9 pg/ml and 0.83 +/- 0.13 vs 0.96 +/- 0.08g, P < 0.05, respectively). This study suggested that dietary fat manipulation with perilla oil can reduce colonic damage and that this is correlated with the suppression of plasma LTB4. The therapeutic efficacy of A-LA in controlling intestinal inflammation in experimental CD may be superior to that of EPA and DHA.},

The incidence and daily intake of each dietary component were compared annually from 1966 to 1985. The univariate analysis showed that the increased incidence of Crohn disease was strongly (P < 0.001) correlated with increased dietary intake of total fat (r = 0.919). animal fat (r = 0.880), n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (r = 0.883), animal protein (r = 0.908), milk protein (r = 0.924), and the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acid intake (r = 0.792). It was less correlated with intake of total protein (r = 0.482, P < 0.05), was not correlated with intake of fish protein (r = 0.055, P > 0.1), and was inversely correlated with intake of vegetable protein (r = -0.941, P < 0.001). The multivariate analysis showed that increased intake of animal protein was the strongest independent factor with a weaker second factor, an increased ration of n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The present study in association with reported clinical studies suggests that increased dietary intake of animal protein and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids with less n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may contribute to the development of Crohn disease.},

To assess selected isotype contributions in greater detail, we examined the concentrations of IgA, IgG, IgE, and IgG4 antibodies to five selected antigens, two of bacterial and three of food origin. Thirty patients with IBD and thirty matched healthy controls were studied. Most antibodies were increased in IBD patients compared to controls. Statistically significant increases were more frequent in Crohn's disease (CD) than in ulcerative colitis (UC). An unexpected finding was that IBD patients treated with sulfasalazine had statistically higher levels of most IgA antibodies than healthy controls, while steroid treated patients had lower levels. These findings suggest differing effects on the immune systems of IBD patients by each of these commonly used drugs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition regimens achieve remission from active Crohn's disease at rates comparable to steroids and total parenteral nutrition. Despite their increasing use there has to date been no assessment of patient tolerance or practical difficulties involved. METHODS: We investigated 147 treatments with elemental diet in 89 patients and followed this with an anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS: Sip feeding was successfully introduced in 85% with nasogastric feeding being necessary in 22 (15%). Nausea and postural hypotension were common in the first week of treatment but vomiting was only seen in three patients who were sensitive to the formula used. Two patients each had caffeine withdrawal symptoms and hypoglycemia and a further four had food-related night terrors. Our experience suggests that caution is necessary if this treatment is used in elderly subjects. Although the diets are perceived as being unpalatable, only six patients found taste to be a problem after the first week of treatment. The main problem with long-term treatment was the large daily volume requirement, which was overcome by increasing the concentration of the feed. Eighty percent of patients responded to the questionnaire, and 65% stated that they would opt for treatment with elemental diet again in the case of a further relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Elemental diet seems to be an acceptable and well-tolerated form of treatment in Crohn's disease.},

METHODS: We assessed sequential changes in disease activity (clinical and laboratory indices and faecal excretion of indium-111-labelled leucocytes) and nutritional status (anthropometry, body composition variables), hepatic secretory proteins (albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin), and trace elements (iron, magnesium, copper, zinc) during treatment of acute Crohn's disease with an elemental diet. RESULTS: Disease activity indices improved significantly by 2 weeks and were maintained at 4 weeks of treatment. There was a significant increase in pre-albumin at 4 weeks and an increase in serum iron and a decrease in serum copper during the study period. The changes occurring in the measures of nutrition did not correlate significantly with the changes in disease activity. CONCLUSION: The fact that changes in disease activity appear to precede any detectable changes in nutritional state, it suggests that the beneficial action of elemental diet in patients with active Crohn's disease is not due to an improvement in nutritional status.},

DESIGN: We studied dietary habits immediately prior to the onset of disease in 104 patients enrolled in a prospective, epidemiological study of the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Italy. METHODS: Each patient was interviewed using a recall questionnaire to provide information on the daily intake of nutrients. The differences in diet between patients and healthy subjects matched for age, sex and city of residence were determined. RESULTS: Our data confirm that patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have a high intake of total carbohydrate, starch and refined sugar. This resulted in a significantly higher relative risk (P < 0.001) in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. Total protein intake was significantly higher in ulcerative colitis, but not in Crohn's disease patients, than in controls. Fibre consumption did not differ between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that carbohydrate consumption is significantly higher in IBD patients than in healthy controls. Ulcerative colitis patients also consumed more total protein than controls. The pathogenetic significance of these findings, however, remains unclear.},

   abstract = {The mechanism of anorexia in inflammatory bowel disease is poorly understood. To gain insight into possible pathophysiologic mechanisms, the feeding indices and food intake were studied in an animal model of Crohn's disease. The anorexia of indomethacin-induced ulcerative ileitis was compared with that of the well-known anorexia of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Forty-five female Lewis rats were randomized to four groups: Control, Indomethacin, Indomethacin + TPN, and TPN. Feeding indices and food intake were continuously measured using the Automated Computerized Rat Eater Meter. Interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) were assayed in plasma, mononuclear cell culture, or ileum to determine their role in mediating anorexia. In the TPN group, spontaneous food intake (SFI) decreased (52%; p < 0.05), primarily via reduction in meal number (MN, 54%; p < 0.05) and, to a lesser extent, meal size (MZ, 35%; p < 0.05). In comparison, in the Indomethacin group SFI decreased (74%; p < 0.05) primarily via reduction in MZ (67%, p < 0.05); MN also decreased but to a lesser extent (27%; p < 0.05). In the Indomethacin + TPN group, SFI decreased (55%; p > 0.05) primarily via reduction in MN (79%; p < 0.05), whereas MZ decreased slightly (19%; p < 0.05). Only in the Indomethacin group were IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha detected in the mononuclear cell culture and plasma, respectively. In the Indomethacin group, an inverse correlation existed between MZ and TNF-alpha (p < 0.05). In the Indomethacin group, IL-1 alpha, PGE2, and LTB4 concentrations did not correlate with feeding indices. SFI reduction in this model was mediated primarily via a decrease in MZ. TNF-alpha is proposed to mediate this effect and TPN was shown to overcome the effect on MZ.},

The study was undertaken in December. The nutritional status (height-weight index) was similar in both groups. The dietary vitamin D intake was as low in patient with CD (1.0 microgram/d; 0.5-1.3) as in the controls (1.1; 0.4-1.6) whereas the recommended daily intake is 5 micrograms/d. Vitamin D intake correlated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels in patients with low 25-OHD levels (tau = 0.45, p = 0.04). Bone mineral content (BMC)-measured by single photon absorptiometry on the radius- was decreased in 9 patients (31%) with CD. Patients with CD tended to have a lower sun exposure in summer (p = 0.10), which also correlated with BMC (p = 0.03). Hence, a specific diet with a high vitamin D content, or vitamin D supplementation is recommended in patients with CD to overcome the negative effects of low sun exposure on bone mineral density.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liquid diets given enterally combined with "bowel rest' are efficacious in the treatment of active Crohn's disease, but rapid recrudescence of gastrointestinal symptoms after resumption of a normal diet is common. AIMS: This study examined whether continuation of enteral nutrition as a nocturnal supplement to an ad libitum daytime intake of a normal diet increased the length of remission of Crohn's disease in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children and adolescents with active Crohn's disease treated successfully with exclusive enteral nutrition were classified retrospectively according to whether they continued supplementary enteral nutrition or not. Time to relapse and linear growth were compared between the two cohorts. RESULTS: Between January 1986 and December 1992, 65 patients aged 7-17 years (mean (SD) 13.6 (2.1) years) (36 males, 29 females) with Crohn's disease in exacerbation were treated for > or = four weeks by bowel rest and nasogastric tube feeding of an oligopeptide or amino acid based formula. At first follow up visit, remission (fall in Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index, PCDAI to < or = 20) was achieved in 47 of 65 (72%) patients. Subsequently, 20 of these 47 (43%) relapsed by six months and 28 of 47 (60%) by 12 months. Patients who continued nasogastric supplementary feeding (n = 28) after resumption of an otherwise normal diet remained well longer than those who discontinued nocturnal supplements completely (n = 19) (p < 0.02). Furthermore, continued use of nasogastric supplements before completion of puberty was associated with improved linear growth. CONCLUSION: After successful treatment of active Crohn's disease by exclusive enteral nutrition, supplementary enteral nutrition without restriction of normal diet is associated with prolongation of remission and improved linear growth in children and adolescents.},

   abstract = {The value of intense nutritional support in inflammatory bowel disease is still debated. Claims have been made that total enteral nutrition is as effective as total parental nutrition. In this review, the use of parenteral and enteral nutritional support as primary therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease has been critically evaluated. Most studies have been uncontrolled and nonrandomized with short-term follow-up. The literature does suggest, however, that intense nutritional support may have an adjunctive role to drug therapy in achieving remission in Crohn's disease, especially in corticosteroid-refractory patients. Nutritional support has a lesser role in chronic ulcerative colitis, except for assistance in pre- and postoperative management. The data do not support one variety of nutritional support over another, although enteral support should be used if possible, as it is less costly and potentially less complicated.},

   abstract = {Undernutrition is considered to have a central role in the pathogenesis of growth retardation in Crohn's disease. This may occur as a consequence of inadequate food intake, increased energy expenditure, or both. Ten growing adolescents with inactive Crohn's disease were assessed with respect to anthropometric parameters and resting energy expenditure, measured by indirect calorimetry during remission, repeated in relapse (N = 5), and compared to that predicted from the Harris-Benedict formula. Mean energy intake was assessed with seven-day diaries in five patients and compared to recommended intake for age, sex, weight, and physical activity. Ten healthy, growing, age- and sex-matched adolescents served as controls. Nine patients with inactive Crohn's disease, who had ceased growing, were matched for disease site and duration and acted as disease controls. Patients and disease controls had lower body mass index (19.2 +/- 0.6; 20.9 +/- 0.7) than healthy controls (23.7 +/- 0.6; P < 0.001). Percent body fat was lower in patients (13.2 +/- 1.9%) compared to healthy controls (20.5 +/- 2.4%; P < 0.05) but not to disease controls (17.0 +/- 2.6%). Patients had higher resting energy expenditure per kilogram of fat-free mass than disease or healthy controls (36.9 +/- 5.1; 32.9 +/- 2.6; 30.9 +/- 2.1 kcal; P < 0.02). Measured resting energy expenditure in patients, but not in disease or healthy controls, was higher than the predicted (measured: predicted 1.15, 1.03, 0.9, respectively; P < 0.03). Energy intake in patients was 97% of recommended intake but the measured ratio of energy intake/resting energy expenditure was lower than the predicted ratio (1.49 vs 1.71; P < 0.05). During subsequent relapse in five patients resting energy expenditure was unchanged. In growing adolescents with inactive Crohn's disease, there is increased energy expenditure that is not accompanied by an increase in energy intake. Relapse of disease does not appear to increase resting energy expenditure further but may "divert" energy from growth to disease activity. This suggests that nutritional therapy should be directed towards increasing caloric intake to maximize growth potential.},
