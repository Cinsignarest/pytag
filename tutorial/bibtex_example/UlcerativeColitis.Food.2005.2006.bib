   abstract = {Strains of Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli, also called enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), are important food-borne pathogens for humans. Most EHEC strains intimately adhere to the intestinal mucosa in a characteristic attaching and effacing (A/E) pattern, which is mediated by the bacterial adhesin intimin. Subsequent release of Stx1 and/or Stx2 leads to the frequent development of hemorrhagic colitis and, less commonly, to hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The aim of the present study was to develop an attenuated A/E E. coli strain for use as a vaccine against EHEC infection encoding a truncated intimin lacking adhesive capacity, but which would still express somatic antigens, other products of the locus of enterocyte effacement pathogenicity island, and an immunogenic remnant of the intimin molecule. A single-nucleotide deletion was generated in the eae gene in the prototype rabbit A/E E. coli strain RDEC-1 (O15:H-), which resulted in truncation of intimin by 81 C-terminal residues (860 to 939 amino acids) containing a disulfide loop. Inoculation of rabbits with large doses of the truncated intimin mutant (RDEC-1Deltaeae(860-939)) was well tolerated, as observed by the absence of clinical signs of disease or evidence of intestinal A/E lesions. The efficacy of RDEC-1Deltaeae(860-939) as a vaccine was evaluated by orogastric inoculation of rabbits with RDEC-1Deltaeae(860-939) followed by challenge with the virulent strain RDEC-H19A, an Stx1-producing derivative of wild-type RDEC-1 capable of inducing hemorrhagic colitis in rabbits. Following RDEC-H19A challenge, nonimmunized control rabbits exhibited characteristic weight loss with watery to bloody diarrhea and demonstrated intimate bacterial attachment, effacement of microvilli, submucosal edema, mucosal heterophile infiltrates, and Shiga toxin-induced vascular lesions. In contrast, the RDEC-1Deltaeae(860-939)-immunized rabbits showed no clinical signs of disease, maintained normal weight gain, had reduced fecal shedding of challenge organisms, and showed an absence of gross or microscopic lesions in the intestinal mucosa. Serum antibodies specific to intimin were detected among rabbits immunized with RDEC-1Deltaeae(860-939), indicating that truncation of the intimin functional domain not only attenuated bacterial virulence, but also retained at least some of the immunogenicity of native intimin. Although it is not possible to gauge the exact contribution of residual intimin immunity to protection, this attenuation strategy for A/E E. coli strains shows promise for the development of effective vaccines to prevent EHEC infection in humans and animals.},

In humans, ulcerative colitis (UC) can extend a variable distance into the terminal ileum in a phenomenon known as backwash ileitis (BWI). The aim of this study was therefore to examine the effect of TNBS-induced colitis on different aspects of the rat ileum and jejunum. We hypothesized that TNBS administration would lead to a systemic influence on the small intestine. Rats were induced colitis by administration of 0.25 ml of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and 72 h after colitis induction animals were sacrificed. Segments were taken of the colon, ileum and jejunum. In addition to mucin mRNA expression, morphological changes were observed in the jejunum and ileum. We examined the mRNA expression and biochemical activity of brush border enzyme, sucrase iso-maltase and aminopeptidase, in all three segments. The villous surface area of colitis-induced rats was smaller in jejunum and ileum compared to control. In the jejunum of TNBS-induced rats, goblet-cell volume increased and their density decreased. The relative amount of MUC2 mRNA decreased in the jejunum, ileum and colon of colitis rat. However, MUC3 mRNA expression increased in the ileum and colon of these rats. Sucrase isomaltase expression and activity decreased in the ileum of TNBS-induced rats, while aminopeptidase activity was lower in the jejunum. These observations suggest that intrarectal administration of TNBS to rats influences not only their colon and terminal ileum, but also the proximal ileum and jejunum. Involvement of the ileum and jejunum in TNBS-induced colitis may be related to the systemic reaction of the immune system and mucosa to colitis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease, are chronic intestinal disorders of unknown etiology in which in genetically susceptible individuals, the mucosal immune system shows an aberrant response towards commensal bacteria. The gastrointestinal tract has developed ingenious mechanisms to coexist with its autologous microflora, but rapidly responds to invading pathogens and then returns to homeostasis with its commensal bacteria after the pathogenic infection is cleared. In case of disruption of this tightly-regulated homeostasis, chronic intestinal inflammation may be induced. Previous studies showed that some commensal bacteria are detrimental while others have either no influence or have a protective action. In addition, each host has a genetically determined response to detrimental and protective bacterial species. These suggest that therapeutic manipulation of imbalance of microflora can influence health and disease. This review focuses on new insights into the role of commensal bacteria in gut health and disease, and presents recent findings in innate and adaptive immune interactions. Therapeutic approaches to modulate balance of intestinal microflora and their potential mechanisms of action are also discussed.},

Probiotic administration may recover the commensal microflora and normalise the host-microbial interaction. In this experiment, we cocultured colonic biopsies from active ulcerative colitis patients with bifidobacterium to investigate the modulation effect of probiotics on inflamed colonic tissues and its possible mechanism. Colonic biopsies from active ulcerative colitis were cocultured for 24 h with Bifidobacterium longum. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8 in supernatants were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, the biopsies were fixed using paraffin and the expression of NF-kappaB P65 of tissues was studied using immunohistochemical staining. The concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-8 in supernatants of tissues cocultured with probiotics were lower than those cultured alone. The number of lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) with nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) P65 positive in cocultured tissues was also decreased. When cocultured with inflamed tissues of active ulcerative colitis, probiotics could inhibit NF-kappaB activation in LPMC and down-regulate inflammatory cytokine secretion from inflamed tissues of active ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {The reason of bleeding from alimentary tract in small children - may sometimes be a big problem and we may need a long observation before making the diagnosis. One of the most frequent reasons of bleeding is food allergy, which resembles allergic colitis. However, bleeding can be the first symptom of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, but it is very rare in small children. We present three cases of small children with bleeding from alimentary tract, in which it was difficult to make the final diagnosis. In our cases, the endoscopic and histopathological examination showed changes, which suggested non-specific inflammatory bowel disease. The microabscesses in crypts and inflammatory infiltration in the mucosa indicated ulcerative colitis. Moreover, one child had also inflammatory infiltration in the oesophagus and duodenum, which is typical for Crohn's disease. We conclude that even when the clinical course suggests that the reason of presenting symptoms was food allergy, there is need for longer observation until one can make the final diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intestinal bacteria have been implicated in the initiation and perpetuation of IBD; in contrast, "probiotic bacteria" have properties possibly effective in treating and preventing relapse of IBD. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of VSL#3 and the components, and the composition of the biopsy-associated microbiota in patients with active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Thirty-four ambulatory patients with active UC received open label VSL#3, 3,600 billion bacteria daily in two divided doses for 6 wk. The presence of biopsy-associated bacteria was detected using a nucleic acid-based method and the presence of VSL#3 species confirmed by DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients completed 6 wk of VSL#3 treatment and 2 patients did not have the final endoscopic assessment. Intent to treat analysis demonstrated remission (UCDAI < or = 2) in 53% (n = 18); response (decrease in UCDAI > or = 3, but final score > or =3) in 24% (n = 8); no response in 9% (n = 3); worsening in 9% (n = 3); and failure to complete the final sigmoidoscopy assessment in 5% (n = 2). There were no biochemical or clinical adverse events related to VSL#3. Two of the components of VSL#3 were detected by PCR/DGGE in biopsies collected from 3 patients in remission. CONCLUSION: Treatment of patients with mild to moderate UC, not responding to conventional therapy, with VSL#3 resulted in a combined induction of remission/response rate of 77% with no adverse events. At least some of the bacterial species incorporated in the probiotic product reached the target site in amounts that could be detected.},

Most of the members of the microbiota have not yet been cultured, but nucleic-acid-based methods of detection and enumeration can provide information about the community. This investigation used these methods to obtain information about the bacteria associated with mucosal surfaces in the gut of 20 CD and 15 UC patients. Biopsies were collected from inflamed and non-inflamed sites in the intestines of newly diagnosed, untreated patients. Biopsies were also collected from several intestinal sites of 14 healthy subjects. The bacterial collections associated with the biopsies were analysed by generating PCR/denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles, the preparation of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, and qualitative PCR to detect specific groups of bacteria. The total numbers of bacteria associated with the biopsies were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. DGGE profiles generated from the terminal ileum and various colonic regions were characteristic of each individual but differed between subjects. DGGE profiles and 16S rRNA gene libraries showed that the bacteria associated with inflamed and non-inflamed tissues did not differ. UC patients had more bacteria associated with biopsies than did CD patients (P<0.01). Statistical analysis of the composition of 16S rRNA gene libraries showed that the bacterial collections in UC and CD patients differed (P<0.05). Unclassified members of the phylum Bacteroidetes were more prevalent in CD than in UC patients. Therefore, the types and numbers of bacteria associated with biopsy samples were distinctly different for UC and CD patients. The observations made in this study should permit targeting of specific bacteriological abnormalities in investigations of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases and provide targets for medical interventions.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to analyze the complications associated with treatment of inflammatory bowel disease with biologic agents. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been various biologic agents evaluated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease; that is, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Thus far only infliximab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as induction and maintenance treatment in patients with active Crohn's disease (moderate-to-severe and/or fistulizing) who are refractory to conventional therapy. Recent data from two large multicenter, multicountry, randomized controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that infliximab is efficacious also for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Other biologics considered potentially efficacious are still undergoing evaluation in various clinical trials. SUMMARY: The data concerning biologics' associated toxicity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are the most robust in the case of infliximab. These data are derived from both prospective, randomized clinical trials and from post-marketing experience. In the case of the remaining agents the data concerning safety in inflammatory bowel disease are limited, as these agents were not evaluated in as many trials as infliximab; indeed, some of them included only several patients.},

   abstract = {Various biologic agents have been evaluated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease ) and ulcerative colitis (UC). At present, only one, infliximab (humanized monoclonal anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody), is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for induction and maintenance treatment in patients with active moderate to severe and/or fistulizing CD who are refractory to conventional therapy. Two recent trials, Active Ulcerative Colitis Trial (ACT) 1 and ACT 2, observed high efficacy of infliximab in inducting and maintaining clinical remission, mucosal healing, and corticosteroid-sparing effects in patients with moderate to severe UC. A plethora of randomized, double-blind, controlled and open-label, uncontrolled studies on large and small numbers of patients has assessed efficacy and safety of various biologic agents of potential use in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. With respect to safety of biologic agents used for treatment, the most accurate data are available only in the case of infliximab. This is due to the fact that infliximab was evaluated in many more trials than any other biologic agent. Moreover, postmarketing experience also provides very valuable information about any side effects occurring during treatment with this agent.},

   abstract = {There is currently a growing appreciation for the role of the enteric flora in health and disease. In the past years overwhelming evidence has accumulated for the role of commensal gut bacteria in the inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Both entities are mainly located in areas with high bacterial concentrations. Reduction of the enteric bacterial concentration by antibiotics, lavage, or surgical bypass results in a mitigation of symptoms, while experimental colitis models depend on the presence of the bacterial flora and the NOD2/CARD15-mutation results in inefficient clearance of invasive bacteria. Those findings helped to bring the concept of probiotic therapy to the forefront, a therapy that had been known for millennia, but had been disregarded by the scientific world. Probiotics are meanwhile established in the maintenance therapy of ulcerative colitis and chronic recurrent or refractory pouchitis. Promising data exist for the primary prevention of pouchitis. Probiotic research at the intersection of gastroenterology, immunology and microbiology is highly dynamic in both the basic and the clinical field. Further understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms leading to the effectiveness of probiotics will also spur the development of more successful probiotic formulations.},

METHODS: All children referred for initial assessment of possible IBD were eligible. Patients with symptoms or signs (right-lower quadrant mass, perianal disease, or hematochezia) mandating a complete work-up for IBD were excluded. All enrolled patients underwent a clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic evaluation including biopsy examinations. The immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgA ASCA, IgG pANCA, FC, IP, and BWUS were tested in all patients at the initial assessment. RESULTS: A final diagnosis of IBD was made in 27 patients: 17 Crohn disease and 10 ulcerative colitis. Eighteen children had other gastrointestinal diagnoses (8 functional bowel disorders, 5 food allergy-mediated diseases, 4 infectious enterocolitis, 1 familial Mediterranean fever). In patients with simultaneous abnormal values of FC, BWUS, and ASCA/pANCA, the estimated probability of having IBD was 99.47%. Patients with negative results on all tests had a 0.69% of probability of IBD. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of noninvasive diagnostic tests into the initial diagnostic approach may avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and facilitate clinical decision-making when the diagnosis of IBD in children is initially uncertain.},

Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effects of pravastatin on colitis induced by acetic acid and the relevant mechanism. METHODS: 8% solution of acetic acid was infusion into the rectum of 50 male SD rats so as to establish models of ulcerative colitis induced by acetic acid and 10 rats were used as normal controls treated with regular feeding. Then the 50 models of ulcerative colitis were randomly assigned into 3 groups: model + placebo group (n = 20, infused intragastrically with normal saline 2 ml/d for 7 days), model + pravastatin group (n = 15, infused intragastrically with pravastatin 1 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)), and model + salicylazosulfapyridium (SASP) group (n = 15, infused intragastrically with SASP 0.25 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)). The general conditions, food intake, weight, stool consistencies, stool bleeding of rats were observed then the disease activity index (DAI) and the therapeutic effects were evaluated. All the rats were sacrificed at day 8 with their colons taken out. The colon length, colon mucosa damage index (CMDI), and histological score were evaluated and nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) of the tissue were measured as well. RESULTS: Compared with those of the model + placebo and model + SASP groups, the colon length, DAI, CMDI, and histological score of the model + pravastatin group were significantly improved (all P < 0.05), the levels of NO and MDA were significantly reduced, while the SOD level was increased remarkably (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pravastatin may ameliorate the colitis by antioxidant activity. Its therapeutic effect is more obvious than the conventional medicine SASP.},

Biofilms are implicated in cross-contamination of food products, biofouling and various human infections such as dental cavities, ulcerative colitis and chronic respiratory infections. The recalcitrance of biofilms to typical antibiotic and antimicrobial treatments is one focus of current investigations. Neither reaction-diffusion limitation nor heterogeneities in growth-rate explain the observed tolerance. Another hypothesis is that specialized 'persister' cells, which are extremely tolerant of antimicrobials, are the source of resistance. In this investigation, we describe the formation of 'persister' cells which neither grow nor die in the presence of antibiotics. We propose that these cells are of a different phenotype whose expression is regulated by the growth rate and the antibiotic concentration. Based on several experiments describing the dynamics of persister cells, we introduce a mathematical model that is used to describes the effect of a periodic dosing regiment. Results from our analysis indicate that the relative dose/withdrawal times are important in determining the effectiveness of such a treatment. A reduced model is also introduced and the similar behavior is demonstrated analytically.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Probiotics are live, nonpathogenic bacteria that confer health benefits beyond their nutritional value. In inflammatory bowel disease, where changes in bacterial flora have been demonstrated, there is an increasing interest in modulating the flora with probiotic strains. The beneficial effect of probiotics is demonstrated mainly in pouchitis and ulcerative colitis; however, their mechanisms of action are not well defined. The purpose of this review is to discuss the latest findings related to their mechanism of action. RECENT FINDINGS: A decrease in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-12, and interference with bacterial adherence to the epithelium has been demonstrated. At the molecular level, an anti-inflammatory effect associated with NF-kappaB inhibition, heat-shock protein induction and proteasome inhibition has been suggested, although NF-kappaB induction has also been demonstrated. Unexpectedly, the beneficial effects described were achieved not only by live bacteria but also by gamma-irradiated nonviable bacteria, bacterial DNA components and probiotic-cultured media. SUMMARY: Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effect of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease and experimental colitis may help understand the role of bacteria in disease pathogenesis. The findings that live probiotics may not be mandatory to be beneficial, and that therapeutic effects may be obtained by systemic, rather than oral administration could have a major impact on the practical use and manufacturing of probiotics.},

   abstract = {Several beneficial effects of probiotics have been described in studies using rodent disease models and in human patients; however, the underlying mechanisms remained mostly unclear. Only a few studies focused on the effects of probiotics on the intestinal mucosal immune system. Here, we studied the effect of the probiotic strain E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) administered orally to young pigs at two concentrations (10(9) and 10(11)CFU/d for 21 days) on the gut-associated lymphatic tissue. This probiotic strain was shown recently to reduce recurrence of inflammation in ulcerative colitis patients. We quantified the number and distribution of intestinal immune cells (granulocytes, mast cells, CD4+, CD8+, CD25+, IgA+ lymphocytes) and the mucosal mRNA expression of cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, IL-10) and antimicrobial peptides (PR-39, NK-lysin, prepro-defensin-beta 1, protegrins). The number and distribution of cells were highly different between small intestinal and colon segments in all groups, but were not influenced by EcN, except high dose EcN fed pigs (10(11) CFU/d) showing an increase in mucosal CD8+ cells in the ascending colon. The mRNA analysis revealed no changes associated with EcN feeding. In conclusion, according to our analyses EcN has only minor effects on the distribution of mucosal immune cells in the gut of healthy individuals. The well-established preventive effects of EcN might therefore be relate to other mechanisms than simple modulation of immune cell distribution.},

Disturbances in this remarkable symbiosis can result in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although the etiology of IBD is not entirely understood, it is known that the chronic inflammation of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and chronic pouchitis are a result of an overly aggressive immune response to the commensal intestinal flora in genetically susceptible hosts. Recent studies have enhanced our ability to understand the interaction between the host and its intestinal microflora and the role the microflora plays in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. As we begin to understand the benefits conferred to the intestine by the microflora, the notion of modifying the composition of the bacterial load to improve human health has arisen. A significant body of research now exists investigating the role of probiotics and prebiotics in ameliorating chronic intestinal inflammation. This article will begin with an overview of the role of the commensal microflora in maintaining mucosal immune homeostasis, and how a dysregulated immune response to the intestinal microflora results in IBD. This will be followed by a summary of the use of probiotics and prebiotics in experimental and human IBD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and irritable bowel syndrome are chronic, debilitating gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. There are no known causes of inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome. Both of these GI conditions significantly impair quality of life and the ability to complete activities of daily living. Unfortunately, there has been little education and research surrounding the evaluation of effective coping strategies with respect to GI disorders, particularly from the perspective of those diagnosed. As such, exploring the strategies of individuals with GI disorders would provide information concerning coping strategies from the perspective of those afflicted. PURPOSE: The overall objective of this research was to explore the lived experience of women who had been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome. This article specifically explores the relationship between food and irritable bowel syndrome and/or inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Eight females, diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome, were recruited via on-campus posters from a university in southern Ontario, Canada. Qualitative information was collected in the form of background questionnaires, e-mail interviews, and face-to-face interviews, which were subsequently analyzed for trends. RESULTS: Every woman reported that one of the most significant means by which to cope with their condition centered around food consumption or controlling their food consumption. Subjects identified the importance of determining their "trigger foods," selecting healthy food choices, the impact of stress, and problems associated with food and travel. CONCLUSIONS: This research, predicated on the narratives of women diagnosed with GI disorders, substantiates the profound effect that food has on conditions of the GI tract. All of the women identified their relationship with food as a dynamic learning process, one that they thought would be a lifelong struggle. The implications for community health nurses in assisting individuals with GI disorders are discussed.},

It is the recommendation that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of acute diarrhea in adults and children, the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, and the maintenance of remission and prevention of pouchitis. Although early results indicate that probiotics may also be useful in immunologic modulation to prevent atopy, treatment of radiation intestinal disease, vaginosis, ulcerative colitis, and the irritable bowel syndrome, the studies available are not sufficient to say they are definitely helpful. Even fewer data are available to recommend probiotics for the treatment of H pylori and Crohn disease and for the prevention of cardiovascular risk factors or other degenerative diseases. Clearly, larger and better-designed studies of probiotics are necessary, including comparative and dose-ranging trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an acute and chronic inflammatory disease of the large bowel with unknown aetiology. The immune response against normal commensal microorganisms is believed to drive inflammatory processes associated with UC. Therefore, modulation of bacterial communities on the gut mucosa, through the use of probiotics and prebiotics, may be used to modify the disease state. METHODS: A synbiotic was developed for use in UC patients combining a probiotic, Bifidobacterium longum, isolated from healthy rectal epithelium, and a prebiotic (Synergy 1), a preferential inulin-oligofructose growth substrate for the probiotic strain. Treatment was employed in a double blinded randomised controlled trial using 18 patients with active UC for a period of one month. Clinical status was scored and rectal biopsies were collected before and after treatment, and transcription levels of epithelium related immune markers were measured. RESULTS: Sigmoidoscopy scores (scale 0-6) were reduced in the test group (start 4.5 (1.4), end 3.1 (2.5)) compared with placebo (start 2.6 (2.1), end 3.2 (2.2)) (p=0.06). mRNA levels for human beta defensins 2, 3, and 4, which are strongly upregulated in active UC, were significantly reduced in the test group after treatment (p=0.016, 0.038, and 0.008, respectively). Tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1alpha, which are inflammatory cytokines that drive inflammation and induce defensin expression, were also significantly reduced after treatment (p=0.018 and 0.023, respectively). Biopsies in the test group had reduced inflammation and regeneration of epithelial tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Short term synbiotic treatment of active UC resulted in improvement of the full clinical appearance of chronic inflammation in patients receiving this therapy.},

   abstract = {The chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), namely Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, appear to be derived from an inappropriate reaction towards a luminal agent, most probably driven by the intestinal microflora, which upregulates the synthesis and release of different pro-inflammatory mediators, thus contributing to tissue damage that characterizes these intestinal conditions. Several studies have reported that IBD is associated with impairment in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate. They are produced in the large bowel by anaerobic bacterial fermentation of undigested dietary carbohydrates and fiber polysaccharides, with butyrate being considered as the major fuel source for colonocytes. These SCFAs have been proposed to play a key role in the maintenance of colonic homeostasis. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider therapeutic approaches that increase colonic SCFA production, as it can be achieved by administration of dietary fiber to IBD patients. Unfortunately, there is quite limited documentation of efficacy of dietary fiber in properly designed trials. This review discusses the rationale, available evidence for the use of dietary fiber and its mechanisms of action in the treatment and prevention of IBDs.},

   abstract = {Undigested carbohydrates reaching the colon can act as competitors for epithelial bacterial receptors, making it difficult for noncommensal bacteria to adhere to them. On the contrary, fermentation of these carbohydrates by anaerobic flora produces - among other substrates - butyrate that is involved in numerous important metabolic processes. These include the provision of energy to the colonocytes, the enhancement of sodium and water absorption and the synthesis of mucus and cell membranes. In addition, butyrate inhibits the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFkappaB, which exerts a potent anti-inflammatory activity. Clinical experience with probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is controversial. Whereas some probiotic preparations appear to be useful in ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis, most attempts to use probiotics for treating or preventing recurrence in Crohn's disease have failed. It should be pointed out that - unlike in the small bowel - the colon and ileal pouches are well-established microbiological ecosystems with increasing amounts of a wide variety of bacterial strains. These bacterial strains have a high degree of metabolic interaction with luminal nutrients and a greater probability of developing dysbiosis. With this in mind, the rationale for using pre- and probiotics appears to be stronger for colonic IBD (UC or Crohn's colitis) and pouchitis than for IBD mostly involving the small bowel.},

AIM: To compare bone biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease patients (Crohn's disease: n = 68, and ulcerative colitis: n = 32, separately) with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. SUBJECTS: Patients and controls were recruited from Cork University Hospital and Cork City area, respectively. RESULTS: Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's disease (n = 47) and ulcerative colitis (n = 26) patients (i.e. excluding supplement users) had significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) higher serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (by 27% and 63%, respectively) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (by 15% and 21%, respectively) and urinary Type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptides concentrations (by 87% and 112%, respectively). Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients had significantly (P < 0.01) lower serum total osteocalcin (by 20% and 42%, respectively) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (by 37% and 42%, respectively), while serum parathyroid hormone levels were similar. In the combined patient group (n = 100), undercarboxylated osteocalcin was positively associated with bone markers. CONCLUSIONS: Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients have altered bone turnover relative to that in healthy controls.},

Manipulation of the luminal content using antibiotics or probiotics represents a potentially effective therapeutic option. The available studies do not support the use of antibiotics in ulcerative colitis (UC). Antibiotics are effective in treating septic complications of Crohn's disease (CD) but their use as a primary therapy is more controversial, although this approach is frequently and successfully adopted in clinical practice. There is evidence that probiotic therapy may be effective in the prevention and treatment of mild to moderate UC. In contrast, a lack of successful study data at present precludes the widespread use of probiotics in the treatment of CD. Both antibiotics and probiotics appear to play a beneficial role in the treatment and prevention of pouchitis and further trials are warranted to fully quantify their clinical efficacy.},

The aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle strain 1917 in experimental colitis induced in TLR-2 and TLR-4 knockout mice. Colitis was induced in wild-type (wt), TLR-2 knockout, and TLR-4 knockout mice via administration of 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Mice were treated with either 0.9% NaCl or 10(7) E. coli Nissle 1917 twice daily, followed by the determination of disease activity, mucosal damage, and cytokine secretion. wt and TLR-2 knockout mice exposed to DSS developed acute colitis, whereas TLR-4 knockout mice developed significantly less inflammation. In wt mice, but not TLR-2 or TLR-4 knockout mice, E. coli Nissle 1917 ameliorated colitis and decreased proinflammatory cytokine secretion. In TLR-2 knockout mice a selective reduction of gamma interferon secretion was observed after E. coli Nissle 1917 treatment. In TLR-4 knockout mice, cytokine secretion was almost undetectable and not modulated by E. coli Nissle 1917, indicating that TLR-4 knockout mice do not develop colitis similar to the wt mice. Coculture of E. coli Nissle 1917 and human T cells increased TLR-2 and TLR-4 protein expression in T cells and increased NF-kappaB activity via TLR-2 and TLR-4. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that E. coli Nissle 1917 ameliorates experimental induced colitis in mice via TLR-2- and TLR-4-dependent pathways.},

   abstract = {A large and diverse variety of bacteria have evolved and adapted to live in the human intestinal habitat in a symbiotic arrangement that influences both physiology and pathology in the host. Symbiosis between host and flora can be optimised by prebiotics. Inulin-type fructans have been shown to improve the metabolic functions of the commensal flora. Clinical and experimental data suggest that they also improve the gut mucosal barrier. Furthermore, modulation of the trophic functions of the flora by these prebiotics could help in the prevention of inflammatory bowel diseases. The anti-inflammatory effects of inulin or oligofructose have been assessed in the rat model of distal colitis induced by dextran sodium sulphate, which histologically resembles human ulcerative colitis, and in the trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid model that resembles human Crohn's disease. Both inulin and oligofructose stimulate colonic production of SCFA and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation and decreased mucosal lesion scores. Inulin has also been tested in a placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with relapsing pouchitis. Treatment reduced endoscopic and histological parameters of inflammation of the pouch mucosa. Inulin and oligofructose may offer an opportunity to prevent chronic inflammatory intestinal disorders, and this potential should be tested in further clinical studies.},

   abstract = {Bromelain is a mixture of proteinases derived from pineapple stem that is marketed in health food stores as a "digestive aid". Orally administered bromelain was anecdotally reported to induce clinical and endoscopic remission of ulcerative colitis in two patients whose disease was refractory to multi-agent conventional medical therapy. However, the potential efficacy of bromelain in colitis has not yet been tested rigorously in either animals or humans. In this study, the clinical and histologic severity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was determined in IL-10-/- mice treated orally with bromelain in vivo. Daily treatment with oral bromelain beginning at age 5 weeks decreased the incidence and severity of spontaneous colitis in C57BL/6 IL-10-/- mice. Bromelain also significantly decreased the clinical and histologic severity of colonic inflammation when administered to piroxicam-exposed IL-10-/- mice with established colitis. Proteolytically active bromelain was required for anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. Adverse effects of dermatitis, hair loss, and weight loss due to mucositis were rare, dose related, and were not seen in wild-type mice treated orally with up to 1000 mg bromelain/kg/day for 18 weeks. Although the exact mechanisms by which exogenous proteinases affect bowel inflammation have not yet been determined, the results justify additional studies of this complementary biologically based approach to treatment of IBD.},

   abstract = {We tested the effect of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) on the murine model of ulcerative colitis induced by dextran sodium sulphate. The effect of LcS was tested either as a prophylactic 10 days before the onset of the disease, simultaneously with ulcerative colitis induction or continued 10 days after the disease was induced. LcS was not able to prevent the disease induction in any of the experiments. However, important clinical parameters including blood anemia indicators, body weight, and organ weight were improved in the animals receiving LcS as compared with the ulcerative colitis-induced controls. Increased colonic epithelial regeneration in the LcS treated animals was observed in the chronic stage. The results seemed better for the simultaneous short LcS treatment where some parameters remained similar to the PBS controls, including disease activity scores measured in the acute stage. We can conclude that although LcS alone cannot prevent the induction of ulcerative colitis by dextran sodium sulphate, it can improve the clinical condition of the mice. This could imply important biological consequences for the human situation. Further studies including LcS or other probiotic bacteria together with the available treatment are encouraged.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested an increasing use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of CAM in German patients with IBD. METHODS: A questionnaire was offered to IBD patients participating in patient workshops which were organized by a self-help association, the German Crohn's and Colitis Association. The self-administered questionnaire included demographic and disease-related data as well as items analysing the extent of CAM use and satisfaction with CAM treatment. Seven commonly used CAM methods were predetermined on the questionnaire. RESULTS: 413 questionnaires were completed and included in the analysis (n = 153 male, n = 260 female; n = 246 Crohn's disease, n = 164 ulcerative colitis). 52 % of the patients reported CAM use in the present or past. In detail, homeopathy (55%), probiotics (43%), classical naturopathy (38%), Boswellia serrata extracts (36%) and acupuncture/Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) (33%) were the most frequently used CAM methods. Patients using probiotics, acupuncture and Boswellia serrata extracts (incense) reported more positive therapeutic effects than others. Within the statistical analysis no significant predictors for CAM use were found. 77% of the patients felt insufficiently informed about CAM. CONCLUSION: The use of CAM in IBD patients is very common in Germany, although a large proportion of patients felt that information about CAM is not sufficient. However, to provide an evidence-based approach more research in this field is desperately needed. Therefore, physicians should increasingly inform IBD patients about benefits and limitations of CAM treatment.},

   abstract = {Because intestinal microflora play a pivotal role in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there is currently some interest in alternating the composition of the microflora toward a potentially more remedial community. This paper summarizes the clinical and experimental efficacy of the manipulation of microflora by the use of antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics in IBD. Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) is a prebiotic whose unique characteristics make it highly suitable for applications in IBD. It also helps prolong remission in remissive ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and also attenuates clinical activity in non-remissive UC patients. GBF has shown to be converted into a preferential nutrient, butyrate, for colonocytes through the action of Eubacterium and Bifidobacterium, and this bacterial butyrate can provide anti-inflammatory effects. The probiotic approaches for IBD include VSL#3, Nissle1917, Clostridium butyricum, and Bifidobacterium-fermented milk. In this paper, we summarize the distinctive role of another probiotic, Eubacterium limosum (E. limosum), which is a commensal microorganism that is promoted by GBF administration. The metabolites of E. limosum included butyrate, which can accelerate intestinal epithelial growth and inhibit IL-6 production. This new probiotic approach may be useful as an adjunctive IBD treatment in the future. Although these strategies hold great promise and appear to be useful in some settings, more experimental and clinical studies are needed to firmly establish their relevance.},

   abstract = {Arthralgias and spondyloarthropathies of the peripheral and axial joints are common in inflammatory bowel disease. Evidence for a strong association between these clinical manifestations and diseases of the joints has been provided by several clinical and epidemiological studies. Immunological studies have shown the presence of shared inflammatory cells both in the gut and the synovium in spondyloarthropathies. Genetic factors play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of spondyloarthropathies and inflammatory bowel disease. The role of the ubiquitous bacterial flora and pathogenic microorganisms present in the intestinal lumen may induce these joint diseases in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In this review we will focus on the pathogenesis of spondyloarthropathies and arthralgia in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease. Based on preliminary clinical observations in patients with arthralgia and IBD, we put forward the hypothesis that probiotics may be helpful in the management of common extraintestinal manifestations such as arthralgia in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Arthralgia is a common extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Alterations of the immunologic regulation in the gut may contribute to the pathogenesis of arthralgia. Probiotics (VSL#3) have proven effective in the treatment of pouchitis in patients with ileal pouch anal anastomosis after panproctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis both in maintaining remission and in preventing a flare-up without side effects. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of VSL#3 in patients with quiescent IBD who suffered from arthralgia for more than two weeks. An open-label trial was conducted using VSL#3. Pre- and post-treatment joint pain intensity were measured on the Ritchie Articular Index and visual analog scale. Disease activity of the bowel was assessed by the Truelove-Witts and the Harvey-Bradshaw scores. Sixteen of 29 patients completed the trial; in 10 of the 16 patients a statistically significant improvement was documented by the Ritchie Articular Index. No one of the patients had a relapse of intestinal disease while on probiotics. These preliminary results suggest that the probiotic mixture VSL#3 may be an alternative treatment for arthralgia in patients with IBD without inducing exacerbation of the disease. Because probiotics may be effective in the treatment of IBD as well, our results suggest that patients with active disease and arthralgia may also derive benefit from this treatment. Proper randomized controlled studies are indicated.},

Strain UCC118 can adhere to animal and human intestinal tissue, and to both healthy and inflamed ulcerative colitis mucosa, irrespective of location in the gut. In this study, an enzymatic technique has been combined with proteomic analysis to correlate bacterial growth phase with the presence of factors present in the cell wall of the bacterium. Using PAGE electrophoresis, it was determined that progression from lag to log to stationary growth phases in vitro correlated with increasing prominence of an 84kD protein associated with in vitro adherence ability. Isolated proteins from the 84kD band region were further separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, resolving this band into 20 individual protein spots at differing isoelectric points. The protein moieties were excised, trypsin digested and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry. The observed proteins are analogous to those reported to be associated with the Listeria monocytogenes cell-wall proteome, and include DnaK, Ef-Ts and pyruvate kinase. These data suggest that at least some of the beneficial attributes of probiotic lactobacilli, and in particular this strain, may be due to nonpathogenic mimicry of pathogens and potentially be mediated through a form of attenuated virulence.},

PBS pretreated mice had a significantly shorter colon than Ec O83-, Ec Nis- and Lc-pretreated mice (p < 0.05). Administration of Lc significantly decreased the severity of DSS induced histological marks of inflammation (p < 0.05). A significant difference (p < 0.05) was also found in specific IgA level against given probiotic in enteral fluid between colitic mice and healthy mice pretreated with Ec 083 and Ec Nis.},

The use of probiotics in the therapy of infectious bowel diseases as well as maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis is evidence-based. Also, in several studies proof could be supplied that specific probiotics relieve the symptoms and the course of irritable bowel syndrome. Some trials showed a significant improvement of irritable bowel syndrome-related constipation via Lactobacillus casei Shirota and E. coli Nissle 1917. Lactobacillus plantarum has been proven effective in reducing pain and abdominal bloating. However, in most of the studies rather small numbers of patients were examined. Furthermore, these studies do not always closely follow scientific standards (randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled). Therefore, confirmatory studies are necessary to examine the effect of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome.},

Uncontrolled reactions of T-cells and proinflammatoric cytokines are the common denominator of all factors contributing to pathogenesis. The detection of NOD2 gene mutation in about 25% of patients with Crohn's disease was an important step towards an understanding of the molecular background of the disease. The NOD2 proteins functions as an intracellular sensor of bacterial cell membrane constituents and is a crucial part of the innate immune system. In Crohn's disease, the secretion of defensins, naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides, is disturbed. There is evidence that several pathways involved in the reaction of the innate immune system may be disturbed in CED, ultimately leading to an uncontrolled activity of the adaptive immune system.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of pouchitis, a major complication after ileal pouch anal anastomosis in patients with ulcerative colitis. Recently, controlled trials have demonstrated that probiotics are effective in maintenance of remission in pouchitis patients. However, the mechanism by which therapy with probiotics works remains elusive. This study explores the role of the bacterial and fungal flora in a controlled trial for maintenance of remission in pouchitis patients with the probiotic VSL#3 compound. METHODS: The mucosa associated pouch microbiota was investigated before and after therapy with VSL#3 by analysis of endoscopic biopsies using ribosomal DNA/RNA based community fingerprint analysis, clone libraries, real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Patients were recruited from a placebo controlled remission maintenance trial with VSL#3. RESULTS: Patients who developed pouchitis while treated with placebo had low bacterial and high fungal diversity. Bacterial diversity was increased and fungal diversity was reduced in patients in remission maintained with VSL#3 (p = 0.001). Real time PCR experiments demonstrated that VSL#3 increased the total number of bacterial cells (p = 0.002) and modified the spectrum of bacteria towards anaerobic species. Taxa specific clone libraries for Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria showed that the richness and spectrum of these bacteria were altered under probiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic therapy with VSL#3 increases the total number of intestinal bacterial cells as well as the richness and diversity of the bacterial microbiota, especially the anaerobic flora. The diversity of the fungal flora is repressed. Restoration of the integrity of a "protective" intestinal mucosa related microbiota could therefore be a potential mechanism of probiotic bacteria in inflammatory barrier diseases of the lower gastrointestinal tract.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pouchitis is a common and troublesome condition in patients operated on with ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis (IPAA). A disturbed microecology in the pouch has been suggested as one possible explanation. In a previous double-blind, randomized, controlled study we demonstrated clinical improvement of symptoms in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) operated on with IPAA, during intervention with live probiotic microbes Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteriae. The aim of the present study was to confirm our previous results in a much larger material, including clinical symptoms, faecal flora and endoscopic evaluation, and to compare the results in UC/IPAA patients with those of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with IPAA and UC patients with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five hundred millilitres of a fermented milk product (Cultura) containing live lactobacilli (La-5) and bifidobacteriae (Bb-12) was given daily for 4 weeks to 51 UC patients and 10 patients with FAP, operated on with IPAA, and six UC patients operated on for IRA. Stool samples were cultured for examination of lactobacilli, bifidobacteriae, fungi and pH before, during and after intervention. Before, during and after intervention, endoscopic evaluation was performed. Categorized symptomatology was examined prospectively using diary cards in addition to an interview, before and on the last day of intervention. RESULTS: The number of lactobacilli and bifidobacteriae increased significantly during intervention in the UC patients operated on with IPAA and remained significantly increased one week after intervention. Involuntary defecation, leakage, abdominal cramps and the need for napkins (category I), faecal number and consistency (category II) and mucus and urge to evacuate stools (category III) were significantly decreased during intervention in the UC/IPAA group. In the FAP group there was a significant decrease in faecal leakage, abdominal cramps and use of napkins (category I) during intervention. The median endoscopic score of inflammation was significantly decreased during intervention in the UC/IPAA patients. Blood tests, faecal fungi and faecal pH did not change significantly during intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this extended study, showing an effect of probiotics on symptoms and endoscopic inflammation in UC patients operated on with IPAA confirm our previously reported effect of probiotics on clinical symptoms and endoscopic score in a smaller, double-blind, randomized, controlled study. The significantly higher response to probiotics in families with increased risk of IBD will have to be repeated in future studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Probiotic therapy has been shown to prevent the onset of pouchitis and to improve the quality of life in ulcerative colitis patients who required ileal pouch anal anastomosis. Pouchitis has been associated with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of archived endoscopic samples from responding patients enrolled in the above-mentioned trial, we were interested in studying mucosal gene expression of the pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6), TH1 cytokines (interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-12), regulatory cytokines (interleukin-10, transforming growth factor-beta), and the chemokine interleukin-8. In addition to assessment of cytokine gene expression, the presence of polymorphonuclear cells in the mucosal tissue was evaluated. RESULTS: Data show that patients who were treated with probiotics had significant lower mucosal mRNA expression levels of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-8, and interferon-gamma compared with placebo-treated patients. In addition, a lower number of polymorphonuclear cells was present in the tissue of patients within the probiotic group compared with the number of polymorphonuclear cells in the tissue of patients receiving placebo and patients having an episode of pouchitis. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that probiotic treatment regulates the mucosal immune response by reducing mucosal levels of neutrophil-chemoattractant IL-8 and tissue influx of polymorphonuclear cells, and may further act by inhibition of T-cell activation, by reinforcement of barrier function and by a tight control of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: The E. faecalis isolates were cultured from human faecal samples obtained from five ulcerative colitis patients in remission phase. The species identification was based on API120 strips and species-specific PCR primers. The isolates were further characterized using the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The presence of seven different known enterococcal virulence factors among the confirmed E. faecalis isolates were screened using PCR techniques and published primers. CONCLUSIONS: Among the 35 isolates representing nine different pulsotypes the most frequent virulence factors were cpd (33 isolates), agg (25 isolates), gelE (22 isolates) and esp (15 isolates). No complete sets of genes associated for the production of functional cytolysin were encountered indicating that intestinal enterococci may differ in this respect from clinical strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: According to the results, the commensal enterococcal strains appear to differ from clinical isolates in their complement of presumed virulence factors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a 10- to 100-fold increased risk of nephrolithiasis, with enteric hyperoxaluria being the major risk factor for these and other patients with fat malabsorptive states. Endogenous components of the intestinal microflora can potentially limit dietary oxalate absorption. METHODS: Ten patients were studied with chronic fat malabsorption, calcium oxalate stones, and hyperoxaluria thought to be caused by jejunoileal bypass (1) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for obesity (4), dumping syndrome secondary to gastrectomy (2), celiac sprue (1), chronic pancreatitis (1), and ulcerative colitis in remission (1). For 3 months, patients received increasing doses of a lactic acid bacteria mixture (Oxadrop), VSL Pharmaceuticals), followed by a washout month. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were performed at baseline and after each month. RESULTS: Mean urinary oxalate excretion fell by 19% after 1 month (1 dose per day, P < 0.05), and oxalate excretion remained reduced by 24% during the second month (2 doses per day, P < 0.05). During the third month on 3 doses per day oxalate excretion increased slightly, so that the mean was close to the baseline established off treatment. Urinary oxalate again fell 20% from baseline during the washout period. Calcium oxalate supersaturation was reduced while on Oxadrop, largely due to the decrease in oxalate excretion, although mean changes did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Manipulation of gastrointestinal (GI) flora can influence urinary oxalate excretion to reduce urinary supersaturation levels. These changes could have a salutary effect on stone formation rates. Further studies will be needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen.},

Injury is facilitated by barrier disruption and invasion of commensal bacteria. However, certain bacteria have shown anti-inflammatory properties in in vitro models. AIM: To investigate in vivo the anti-inflammatory effect of Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001. METHODS: Rats with a colonic segment excluded from faecal transit were surgically prepared. After washing the lumen with antibiotics, the excluded segment was recolonized (control group: standard flora of rat origin; test group: standard flora and L casei). Microbial colonisation was confirmed by culture of segment washing, and colitis was then induced by instillation of TNBS. One day after, intestinal lesions were blindly graded by macro- and microscopic scores, and myeloperoxidase activity measured in tissue homogenates. Translocation of bacteria to mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and liver was investigated. RESULTS: Test rats showed a smaller area of mucosal injury than control rats (p<0.05). Maximum depth lesion scores were similar in both groups but myeloperoxidase activity was lower in test than in control rats (p<0.05). Remarkably, bacterial translocation was quantitatively lower (p<0.01) and less frequent (p<0.05) in test than in control rats. CONCLUSION: In rats colonised with L casei, mucosal injury, inflammatory response, and barrier disruption after TNBS challenge were attenuated. Bacterial communities colonising the mucosa can modify inflammatory responses to luminal challenges.},

ONS and/or TF in addition to normal food is indicated in undernourished patients with CD or CU to improve nutritional status. In active CD EN is the first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant differences have been shown in the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and whole protein formulae for TF. In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid dependent patients in CD. In patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the adaptation phase and should be changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in addition to normal food.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to review the principal effects of probiotics on pouchitis and identify their mechanisms of action. METHODS: The study was based on a review of all relevant studies published in the literature on the effects of probiotics in pouchitis and their possible mechanisms of action. RESULTS: Pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal pouch anal anstomosis for ulcerative colitis. The cause is still unknown but is likely to be multifactorial. An imbalance in the usual fecal flora was recently suggested. Most patients with symptoms of pouchitis respond promptly to antibiotics. However, 5-10% of them develop rapidly relapsing symptoms that required protacted therapy. Porbiotics are living microorganisms that ingested in adequate amounts exert beneficial effects. Promising results have been obtained with probiotics mainly in maintenance of remission of chronic pouchitis and also as induction of remission. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that restoring the microbial imbalance may offer an effective therapeutic alternative to patients with pouchitis.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an acute and chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown aetiology, although bacterial species belonging to the normal colonic microbiota are known to be involved in its initiation and maintenance. Several organisms have been linked to the disease; however, mucosa-associated bacteria are more likely to be involved than their luminal counterparts, due to their close proximity to the host epithelium. Comparative bacteriological analyses were done on rectal biopsies to investigate differences in mucosal bacteria in patients with UC and healthy controls. Complex bacterial communities were found in both groups, with significant reductions in bifidobacterial numbers in UC, which suggested that they might have a protective role in the disease. Accordingly, a therapy for treating UC was designed, with the aim of modifying the mucosal microbiota to increase bifidobacterial colonisation and reduce inflammation. Ranges of mucosal and faecal bifidobacteria were tested for their substrate preferences and their abilities to survive under a variety of environmental conditions. A synbiotic comprising a probiotic (Bifidobacterium longum) isolated from healthy rectal mucosa combined with a prebiotic (oligofructose-enriched inulin - Synergy 1) was developed. The treatment was used in a randomised controlled trial involving eighteen patients with active UC, for a period of 1 month. Rectal biopsies were collected at the beginning and end of the study. Bacteriological analysis and transcription levels of epithelium-related immune markers were assessed. Results demonstrated that short-term synbiotic treatment resulted in increased bifidobacterial colonisation of the rectal mucosa and induced significant reductions in the expression of molecules that control inflammation in active UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates that alter the composition, or metabolism, of the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner. It is therefore expected that prebiotics will improve health in a way similar to probiotics, whilst at the same time being cheaper, and carrying less risk and being easier to incorporate into the diet than probiotics. AIM: To review published evidence for prebiotic effects on gut function and human health. METHODS: We searched the Science Citation Index with the terms prebiotic, microbiota, gut bacteria, large intestine, mucosa, bowel habit, constipation, diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, calcium and cancer, focussing principally on studies in humans and reports in the English language. Search of the Cochrane Library did not identify any clinical study or meta-analysis on this topic. RESULTS: Three prebiotics, oligofructose, galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose, clearly alter the balance of the large bowel microbiota by increasing bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus numbers. These carbohydrates are fermented and give rise to short-chain fatty acid and intestinal gas; however, effects on bowel habit are relatively small. Randomized-controlled trials of their effect in a clinical context are few, although animal studies show anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel disease, while calcium absorption is increased. CONCLUSIONS: It is still early days for prebiotics, but they offer the potential to modify the gut microbial balance in such a way as to bring direct health benefits cheaply and safely.},

Many experimental and clinical studies suggest that intestinal bacterial flora plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD, and manipulation of the luminal contents with antibiotics or probiotics represents a potentially effective therapeutic option. The beneficial effect of probiotics was demonstrated mainly in the prevention and treatment of pouchitis and in maintaining remission of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Probiotics seems to be less effective in patients with Crohn's disease. Randomized clinical trials are still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and therapeutic agents.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relapsing nature and varying geographical prevalence of ulcerative colitis (UC) implicates environmental factors such as diet in its aetiology. METHODS: In order to determine which foods might be related to disease activity in UC a new method of dietary analysis was developed and applied. Eighty-one UC patients were recruited at all stages of the disease process. Following completion of a 7 d diet diary, clinical assessment including a sigmoidoscopic examination (scale 0 (normal mucosa) to 6 (very active disease)) was conducted. Food weights for each person were adjusted (divided) by the person's calorific intake for the week. Each food consumed was given a food sigmoidoscopy score (FSS) calculated by summing the products of the (adjusted) weight of food consumed and sigmoidoscopy score for each patient and occurrence of food and dividing by the total (adjusted) weight of the food consumed by all 81 patients. Thus, foods eaten in large quantities by patients with very active disease have high FSSs and vice versa. Foods consumed by <10 people or weighing <1 kg for the whole group were excluded, leaving 75 foods. RESULTS: High FSS foods were characterized by high levels of the anti-thiamin additive sulfite (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.001), i.e. bitter, white wine, burgers, soft drinks from concentrates, sausages, lager and red wine. Caffeine also has anti-thiamin properties and decaffeinated coffee was associated with a better clinical state than the caffeine containing version. Beneficial foods (average intake per week) included pork (210 g), breakfast cereals (200 g), lettuce (110 g), apples and pears (390 g), milk (1250 ml), melon (350 g), bananas (350 g), bacon (120 g), beef and beef products (500 g), tomatoes (240 g), soup (700 g), citrus fruits (300 g), fish (290 g), yogurt (410 g), cheese (110 g), potatoes (710 g) and legumes (120 g). CONCLUSIONS: The dietary analysis method described provides a new tool for establishing relationships between diet and disease and indicates a potentially therapeutic diet for UC.},

   abstract = {IL-6/STAT-3 signals play key roles in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is known that Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) improves inflammatory disorders. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of LcS on murine chronic IBD and to clarify the mechanism. We focused the inhibitory effect of LcS on the production of IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated large intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LI-LPMC) isolated from mice with chronic colitis and in RAW264.7 cells in vitro. We also determined in vivo the effect of LcS on murine chronic IBD models induced with dextran sodium sulphate and SAMP1/Yit mice. Finally, we examined the cellular determinants of LcS for the down-regulation of IL-6 secretion by LI-LPMC, RAW264.7 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). LcS, but not other strains of Lactobacillus, inhibited the production of IL-6 in LPS-stimulated LI-LPMC and RAW264.7 cells, down-regulating the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. The LcS-diet-improved murine chronic colitis is associated with the reduction of IL-6 synthesis by LI-LPMC. LcS also improved chronic ileitis in SAMP1/Yit mice. The release of IL-6 in vitro in LPS-stimulated LI-LPMC, RAW 264.7 cells and UC-PBMC was inhibited by a polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (PSPG) derived from LcS. This probiotic-induced improvement in murine chronic inflammatory bowel disease is associated with the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IFN-gamma production in LPMC. Therefore, LcS may be a useful probiotic for the treatment of human inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review reports on the recent progress understanding mechanisms of action and clinical applications of probiotics. RECENT FINDINGS: New insights on regulating mechanisms of intestinal commensal bacteria to prevent and treat different gastrointestinal diseases have been reported. Some probiotics, though not all, exert beneficial effects by modulating the mucosal barrier function and immune activity. It seems that a combination of different probiotics is more effective than a single strain. It was demonstrated that not only viable bacteria administered to the intestinal tract but also isolated probiotic DNA is active, even if injected subcutaneously. There is reasonable evidence to recommend probiotics in infectious diarrhoea for prevention and treatment (mainly in children) and to prevent antibiotic-induced gastrointestinal side effects. Furthermore, probiotics are effective in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and preventing and treating pouchitis. Promising positive effects were published in major surgery patients (gastric resection, pancreatic resection, liver transplantation) and in severe necrotising acute pancreatitis. SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge on probiotics is exciting, but in the near future it must be defined which probiotics (single strains or a combination) are most effective in specific diseases. Well-designed, randomized clinical trials are still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and therapeutic agents.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the influence of fish oil enriched enteral diet on intestinal tissues taken from Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-inflamed non-IBD control patients in vitro. METHODS: Colonoscopic biopsies from patients with active CD (n = 4), active UC (n = 7), and non-inflamed non-IBD control patients (n = 4) were incubated (three dilutions of 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) with Waymouth's culture medium and enteral elemental diet (EO28, SHS, Liverpool, UK) modified in the fatty acid composition with fish oil (EF) in an organ culture system for 24 h. In each experimental set-up, incubation with Waymouth's medium alone as control was included. Tissue viability was assessed by adding bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to the culture fluid and immunohistochemically staining for BrdU uptake. Cytokine ratio of IL-1ra/IL-1beta (low ratio indicative of inflammation) and production of those cytokines as a percentage of medium control were assayed in the culture supernatant. RESULTS: Incubation of CD-affected tissue with EF (1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) modestly and non-significantly increased IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio as compared with medium control (CD 39.1+/-16.1; 26.5+/-7.8, 47.1+/-16.8 vs control 13.0+/-2.2), but incubation of UC-affected tissues increased IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio significantly in all three dilutions (UC 69.1+/-32.2, P<0.05; 76.1+/-36.4, P = 0.05; 84.5+/-37.3, P<0.02; vs control 10.2+/-3.7). Incubation of non-inflamed non-IBD control tissue did not increase the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in any dilution compared to medium control (69.3+/-47.0, 54.1+/-30.6, 79.4+/-34.0 vs control 76.1+/-37.3). Average percentage production of IL-1beta indexed against medium control was significantly less in UC after EF incubation as compared with CD (UC 24.0+/-4.8 vs CD 51.8+/-8.1; P<0.05). Average percentage production of IL-1ra was markedly higher in UC (135.9+/-3.4) than that in control patients (36.5+/-4.3) (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: IBD tissues, after incubation with elemental diet modified in its fatty acid composition with fish oil, show an increase in IL-1ra/IL-1beta cytokine ratio. This effect of omega-3 fatty acid modulation is significantly more marked in UC compared with CD and is accompanied by both a reduction of IL-1beta and increase of IL-1ra. The positive direct anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet with fish oil in tissue affected with UC suggests dietary treatment of UC may be possible.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain that is associated with disturbed defecation. Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD appears to result from dysregulated immune response with contributions from genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Among environmental factors the enteric microflora and the components of food (eg. antigens) may play important role in the pathogenesis of IBD. The aim of the authors' study was to detect IgE type antibodies against the most frequent food allergens in patients with IBD and IBS. METHODS: Antibodies against food allergens (IgE type) with ELISA method in patients with CD, UC and IBS were quantitatively measured. The figures were compared to the result of a healthy control group contains the same number of participants, and the frequency of food allergy in these patient groups were determined. RESULTS: On the basis of the study the presence of increased IgE type immune response against any food allergens was 34.5% (p = 0.01) in the group of IBS. In patients with CD or UC the immune response against food allergens was also more frequent than in the control group. The order of frequency of food allergens in IBS was the following: milk protein, soybean, tomato, peanut, egg white. CONCLUSION: As the occurrence of food allergens was significantly higher in IBS group than in the control group, the role of food allergy in the symptoms of IBS can be come up. The frequency of food allergy in patients with diagnosis of IBS, and the similarity of symptoms of this two diseases give an obvious opportunity for the patients with IBS to use a diet avoiding the most frequent food allergens, or take e.g. Na-cromoglycate which is useful therapy in food allergy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate estimates of endogenous ileal total nitrogen and amino acid flows are necessary to ascertain true dietary amino acid digestibility coefficients and for the factorial estimation of dietary amino acid requirements. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to ascertain endogenous amino acid losses from the small bowel in human subjects consuming a protein-free diet or a diet with enzyme-hydrolyzed casein (EHC; MW <5000) as the sole source of nitrogen. DESIGN: The subjects were 8 men and women with terminal ileum ileostomies after ulcerative colitis who consumed the protein-free and EHC-based diets in a crossover design. Each subject received each test diet in single meals followed by 2 consecutive 9-h total collections of digesta. Digesta samples for the EHC treatment were centrifuged and ultrafiltered (10 000 MW cutoff), with the precipitate-plus-retentate fraction (>10 000 MW) providing a measurement of endogenous ileal amino acids. RESULTS: The mean endogenous flows for most of the amino acids and nitrogen were significantly (P < 0.05) higher when determined with the EHC-based diet than with the protein-free diet. Mean (n = 8) endogenous ileal nitrogen flows were 2061 and 4233 mug/g dry matter intake for the protein-free and EHC-based diets, respectively. CONCLUSION: The traditional protein-free method underestimates endogenous ileal amino acid loss in adults.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Intestinal dendritic cells have emerged as key regulators of immunity to pathogens, oral tolerance and intestinal inflammation. Studies have begun to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms responsible for defining region- and compartment-specific phenotypes and functions of dendritic cells in mucosal tissues. RECENT FINDINGS: Specific subsets of dendritic cells appear to be associated with the various routes for antigen acquisition in the intestine. The constant sampling of intestinal antigenic content ensures establishment of tolerance to commensal bacteria and food antigens. Tolerance development to oral antigens is restricted to the mucosal immune system. Other advances have provided insight into the molecular basis of microbial recognition and innate immune responses by intestinal dendritic cells. Differences in the involvement of dendritic cells have begun to emerge in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and link gene regulation in dendritic cells to therapeutic responses. SUMMARY: A major focus of mucosal immunology will be to understand how diverse dendritic cell subsets cooperate in regulating homeostasis and host defense in the different intestinal immune compartments. This will be pivotal to understanding how the mucosal immune system makes the distinction between commensal microbiota, pathogens and self antigens.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggest that supplementation of total parenteral nutrition with glutamine (gln), a conditionally essential amino acid in catabolic conditions, increases gln plasma concentrations, reduces intestinal damage, improves nitrogen balance and may improve the course of the disease. However, human data supporting this assumption are missing. METHODS: A total of 24 consecutive patients with an acute exacerbation of IBD (19 Crohn's disease; five ulcerative colitis) and scheduled for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (>7 days) were randomised. Parallel to a standardised anti-inflammatory therapy, the patients received either a TPN with 1.5 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid or an isonitrogenic, isocaloric TPN with 1.2 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid and 0.3 g/kg L-alanine-L-glutamine. Primary end points were gln plasma concentrations and intestinal permeability assessed by urinary lactulose and D-xylose ratio. RESULTS: Gln plasma levels did not differ significantly in either group throughout the study. Intestinal permeability did not change within 7 days either with or without gln supplementation (Delta-lactulose/xylose ratio: 0.01+/-0.05 (gln+) vs 0.02+/-0.1 (gln-)). The observed changes in inflammatory and nutritional parameters, and also disease activity, length of TPN and hospital stay, were independent of glutamine substitution. Five (41%) patients in the gln+ group and three (25%) patients in the gln- group needed surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Although limited by the sample size, these results do not support the hypothesis that glutamine substitution has an obvious biochemical or clinical benefit in patients with active IBD scheduled for total parenteral nutrition.},

   abstract = {Salicylate intolerance is defined as a nonspecific antigen-induced pseudo-allergic hypersensitivity reaction which can occur upon contact of an organism with salicylic acid, its derivatives or other related organic or inorganic acids of similar chemical structure. Since the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) intolerance are by no means always severe or life-endangering but may just as well present as oligosymptomatic or local disorders (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhea, we decided to evaluate the characteristics of patients with salicylate intolerance on the basis of gastroenterological case material of Medical Department I of Erlangen University. On the basis of the findings from the Erlangen interdisciplinary data register of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, the signs and symptoms of NSAID intolerance were found to constitute a diagnosis of great practical import to clinical medicine (allergology, dermatology, immunology, other disorders etc.) including gastroenterology. For approx. 2-7% of all patients with inflammatory bowel syndrome and food allergies this poses a new diagnostic and therapeutic challenge which may concern physicians from any of the disciplines involved. When presented with patients with chronic active disease who are suffering from these symptoms one should, therefore, in future give greater thought to the possibility of salicylate intolerance, all the more as there are meaningful dietetic, diagnostic and therapeutic options available for these persons.},

The results of this review provided the content for the accompanying treatment guidelines, Clinical Guidelines for the Medical Management of Left-sided Ulcerative Colitis and Ulcerative Proctitis: Summary Statement. METHODS: All English language articles published between 1995 and September 2005 were identified through a comprehensive literature search using OVID and PubMed. The quality of the data supporting or rejecting the use of specific therapies was categorized by a data quality grading scale. An "A+" grade was assigned to treatment supported by multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials with consistent results, whereas a "D" grade was given to therapy supported only by expert opinion. The therapeutic efficacy of a treatment was defined by its success in treating UP and L-UC compared with placebo. A medication was ranked as "excellent" if it was specifically studied for UP and L-UC and had consistently positive results compared with placebo or another agent. Quality and efficacy scores were agreed on by author consensus. RESULTS: For the acute treatment of UP or L-UC, the rectally administered corticosteroids and mesalazine (5-ASA), either alone or in combination with oral 5-ASAs, are the most effective therapy: evidence quality, A+; efficacy, excellent. Only rectally administered 5-ASA received an A+/excellent rating for maintenance of remission. Infliximab received an A+ grade for induction and maintenance of remission but only a "good" rating because the studies were performed in all UC, not specifically UP or L-UC. CONCLUSIONS: This critical evaluation of treatment provides a "report card" on medications available for the management of patients with UP and L-UC. The guidelines should provide a useful reference and supplement for physicians treating UC patients.},

   abstract = {The demonstration that immune and epithelial cells can discriminate between different microbial species has extended our understanding of the actions of probiotics beyond simple antimicrobial concepts. Several probiotic mechanisms of action, relative to inflammatory bowel disease, have been elucidated: (1) competitive exclusion, whereby probiotics compete with microbial pathogens; (2) immunomodulation and/or stimulation of an immune response; (3) antimicrobial activity and suppression of pathogen growth; (4) enhancement of barrier activity; and (5) induction of T cell apoptosis. The unraveling of these mechanisms of action has led to new support for the use of probiotics in the management of clinical inflammatory bowel disease. While level 1 evidence now supports the therapeutic use of some probiotics in the maintenance treatment of pouchitis, only level 2 and 3 evidence are currently available in support of the use of probiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, one significant and consistent finding has emerged over the course of research in the past year: not all probiotic bacteria have similar therapeutic effects. Rigorously designed, controlled clinical trials, to investigate the unresolved issues related to efficacy, dose, duration of use, single or multistrain formulation, and the concomitant use of prebiotics, synbiotics or antibiotics, are vital.},

   abstract = {UC (ulcerative colitis) patients have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared with the normal population. The cause underlying this higher risk is not fully defined but includes nutritional and environmental factors concomitant with genetic alterations. We aimed to evaluate genetic stability in the colonic tissue of UC patients in clinical remission compared with the healthy population, and to establish a possible correlation between nutritional habits and these molecular assessments. UC patients (n 42) and healthy controls (n 37) participated in the study. All participants were histopathologically and medically diagnosed. Participants completed five separate 7 d dietary records, food-frequency questionnaires and validated 24 h recalls for nutritional assessment. The extent of chromosome 17 loss and the calculated chromosome index was determined in colon tissue biopsies by fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Correlations between the molecular and nutritional assessments were performed using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Significant differences in the nutritional intake of total fat (65 (SD 15) v. 89 (SD 25) g), cholesterol (330 (SD 168) v. 464 (SD 177) mg), dietary fibre (32 (SD 4.7) v. 9 (SD 4) g), vitamin A (1009 (SD 209) v. 506 (SD 204) microg), vitamin C (308 (SD 108) v. 72 (SD 53) mg) and folic acid (412 (SD 89 microg) v. 187 (SD 107)) were recorded for UC patients compared with controls. Significant correlations were found for the consumption of different food groups and the chromosome index for chromosome 17. The results of our study suggest that the nutritional habits adopted by UC patients during clinical remission may affect key cellular components of the colonic tissue, inducing a high degree of aneuploidy and genetic instability, and probably affecting the development of colon cancer.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD) are chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases that can present as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malnutrition. Collectively, these disorders are referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). All patients with IBD share a common pathophysiology. However, there are a number of developmental, psychosocial, and physiologic issues that are unique to the approximate, equals 20% of patients that present during childhood or adolescence. These include the possibility of disease-induced delays in linear growth or physical development, differences in drug dosing, and the changes in social and cognitive development that occur as children move from school-age years into adolescence and early adulthood. Gastroenterologists caring for these children must therefore develop an optimal regimen of pharmacologic therapies, nutritional management, psychologic support, and properly timed surgery (when necessary) that will maintain disease remission, minimize disease and drug-induced adverse effects, and optimize growth and development. This article reviews current approaches to the management of patients with UC and CD and highlights issues specific to the treatment of children with IBD. The principal medical therapies used to induce disease remission in patients with UC are aminosalicylates (for mild disease), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), and cyclosporine (ciclosporin) (for severe disease). If a patient responds to the induction regimen, maintenance therapies that are used to prevent disease relapse include aminosalicylates, mercaptopurine, and azathioprine. Colectomy with creation of an ileal pouch anal anastomosis (J pouch) has become the standard of care for patients with severe or refractory colitis and results in an improved quality of life in most patients. Therefore, the risks associated with using increasingly potent immunosuppressant agents must be balanced in each case against a patient's desire to retain their colon and avoid a temporary or potentially permanent ileostomy. Decisions about drug therapy in the management of patients with CD are more complex and depend on both the location (e.g. gastroduodenal vs small intestinal vs colonic), as well as the behavior of the disease (inflammatory/mucosal vs stricturing vs perforating) in a given patient. Induction therapies for CD typically include aminosalicylates and antibiotics (for mild mucosal disease), nutritional therapy (including elemental or polymeric formulas), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), and infliximab (for corticosteroid-resistant or fistulizing disease). Aminosalicylates, mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and infliximab can be used as maintenance therapies. Because surgical treatment of CD is not curative, it is typically reserved for those patients either with persistent symptoms and disease limited to a small section of the intestine (e.g. the terminal ileum and cecum) or for the management of complications of the disease including stricture or abdominal abscess. When surgery is necessary, maintenance medications administered postoperatively will postpone recurrence. Patients with UC and CD are at risk for the development of micronutrient deficiencies (including folate, iron, and vitamin D deficiencies) and require close nutritional monitoring. In addition, patients with UC and CD involving the colon are at increased risk of developing colon cancer, and should be enrolled into a colonoscopy surveillance program after 8-10 years of disease duration.},

   abstract = {To evaluate the role of dietary factors in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we conducted a multicenter hospital-based case-control study in a Japanese population. Cases were IBD patients aged 15 to 34 years [ulcerative colitis (UC) 111 patients; Crohn's disease (CD) 128 patients] within 3 years after diagnosis in 13 hospitals. One control subject was recruited for each case who was matched for sex, age, and hospital. A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to estimate preillness intakes of food groups and nutrients. All the available control subjects (n = 219) were pooled, and unconditional logistic models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs). In the food groups, a higher consumption of sweets was positively associated with UC risk [OR for the highest versus lowest quartile, 2.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24 to 6.57], whereas the consumption of sugars and sweeteners (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.17), sweets (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.38 to 5.83), fats and oils (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.29 to 5.39), and fish and shellfish (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.18-4.89) were positively associated with CD risk. In respect to nutrients, the intake of vitamin C (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.99) was negatively related to UC risk, while the intake of total fat (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.39 to 5.90), monounsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.23 to 5.03) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.79), vitamin E (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.45 to 7.17), and n-3 (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.52 to 6.88) and n-6 fatty acids (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.24 to 5.32) was positively associated with CD risk. Although this study suffers from the shortcoming of recall bias, which is inherent in most retrospective studies (prospective studies are warranted to confirm the associations between diet and IBD risk), the present findings suggest the importance of dietary factors for IBD prevention.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The author presents evidence published during the past year regarding treatment of clinical and experimental intestinal inflammation and infections by probiotic agents. RECENT FINDINGS: Normal commensal bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated intestinal inflammation, particularly Crohn disease and pouchitis, whereas viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infections are increasingly important with widespread use of immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Combinations of Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and Streptococcus salivarius prevent relapse of recurrent pouchitis and perhaps decrease the initial onset of pouch inflammation, whereas Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 maintains remission in ulcerative colitis. Several agents offer promise as primary therapy of ulcerative colitis. Use of probiotics in Crohn disease remains unsubstantiated. Animal models demonstrate marked differences in responses among various probiotic bacterial species and that nonviable organisms can have therapeutic efficacy. Probiotics have multiple mechanisms of action, including prevention of pathogenic bacterial growth, binding to or penetration of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, stimulation of mucosal barrier function, or altering immunoregulation (decreasing proinflammatory and promoting protective molecules). Although multiple probiotic species block epithelial adhesion and invasion by microbial pathogens in vitro, their proven utility in clinical infections is limited to accelerating recovery from acute infectious diarrhea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. SUMMARY: Probiotics offer promise for physiologic, nontoxic treatment of pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and acute infectious diarrhea, but larger, controlled clinical studies must be performed to clarify optimal agents; doses; combinations of various probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics; and therapeutic conditions.},

These diseases mainly affect young adults, with a peak occurrence between 15 and 25 years of age. The causes of these diseases are largely unknown, with current treatments targeted against the heightened inflammatory response witnessed in the intestinal mucosa of both conditions. With the peak age ranges for pregnancy and inflammatory bowel disease overlapping, it is important to weigh the benefits of treating a mother during pregnancy against the potential risks to the fetus and the course of the pregnancy. This review examines the current safety data on medications used in women with inflammatory bowel disease during pregnancy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and peptide YY (PYY) are produced in endocrine L-cells of the intestine and secreted in response to food intake. GLP-2 has a trophic effect on the intestinal epithelium, whereas PYY has pro-absorptive effects. It can be speculated that, in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the production and secretion of GLP-2 and PYY could be affected as a part of a regulatory mechanism. Therefore, tissue levels and meal-stimulated secretion of GLP-2 and PYY were studied in IBD patients and compared to controls. METHODS: Outpatients with IBD and control patients were included. Mucosal biopsies were taken from the ileum and colon and the content of GLP-2 and PYY was measured. After colonoscopy the patients took a mixed meal and plasma was collected for 90 min for plasma measurements of GLP-2 and PYY. RESULTS: Tissue levels of GLP-2 in control patients were highest in the terminal ileum (407+/-82 pmol/g tissue, n=10), whereas PYY was highest in the rectum (919+/-249 pmol/g tissue, n=10). In IBD patients with acute inflammation, the content of GLP-2 was similar to controls, whereas PYY was decreased to 72.1+/-17.7% (P=0.03, n=13) of control values. Neither the fasting plasma levels nor the meal responses of GLP-2 and PYY differed between controls and IBD patients. CONCLUSION: The similar responses of GLP-2 and PYY in patients and controls do not support the suggestion that L-cell secretion is altered in IBD. The decreased tissue PYY concentrations may contribute to the diarrhoea of some of these patients.},

   abstract = {Probiotic microorganisms are defined as viable nutritional agents conferring benefit to the health of the human host. Especially, Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) was shown to be equally effective as mesalazine in the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (UC). Presumably, the therapeutic effect of EcN is linked to the presence of the strain in the region of interest; however, it remains difficult to follow the orally administered strain on its passage through the complex microbial environment of the intestine in vivo, inhabited dominantly by various E. coli strains, using traditional culturing methods. In this study we transformed EcN and a wild-type E. coli from a laboratory rat (EcR) with a plasmid carrying a gfp gene (pUC-gfp) to obtain EcN- and EcR-GFP to allow in vivo detection without alteration of strain-specific characteristics. Analysis of different strain-specific characteristics included the measurement of stimulation of IL-8 secretion and adhesion in vitro using the epithelial cell line HT-29. The kinetics of intestinal distribution in mice and colonization properties in rats following oral administration was studied in vivo. Detectability of the strain in histologic specimens was analysed using fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry. The identity of fluorescent E. coli strains isolated from stool samples, Peyer's patches (PP) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) was determined by REP-PCR. We were able to demonstrate that EcN and EcN-GFP do not differ in stimulation of IL-8 secretion or adhesion to HT-29 cells. In vivo, EcN-GFP colonies were readily detectable by fluorescence microscopy in luminal samples and also by immunohistochemistry in histological sections allowing analysis of the kinetics of the intestinal passage following oral administration. Translocation of fluorescent and non-fluorescent bacteria into PP and MLN was noted at 6 h post oral administration. EcN-GFP was detectable initially for 14 days in faecal samples of rats, while EcR-GFP was detectable throughout the whole experiment (45 days). Challenge with ampicillin at day 45 demonstrated continuing presence of EcN-GFP in small numbers by reappearing fluorescent colonies. The plasmid was not stable in vivo since non-fluorescent EcN colonies were detected also in faecal samples by REP-PCR. In summary, transformation of EcN to obtain EcN-GFP in our study had no detectable influence on the probiotic microorganism regarding adhesion on and induction of IL-8 secretion of HT-29 cells and allows the detection in mixed microbial environments in vivo but the stability of EcN-GFP in vivo is limited.},

We assessed the efficacy of a nutritionally balanced oral supplement enriched with fish oil, fructooligosaccharides, gum arabic, vitamin E, vitamin C, and selenium on disease activity and medication use in adults with mild to moderate UC. METHODS: A total of 121 patients with UC and a disease activity index (DAI) from 3-9 on a 12-point scale were block randomized for extent of disease and smoking status. In addition to their usual diet, patients consumed 18 oz of the oral supplement or a carbohydrate-based placebo formula each day for 6 months. Clinical and histologic responses were assessed at 3 and 6 months or at the final visit. A change in average prednisone use between groups was tested by using a linear mixed-effects model. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients completed the study. Baseline characteristics were not different between groups except for a higher total DAI score in the oral supplement group (7.3 +/- 1.3; n = 36) compared with the placebo group (6.2 +/- 2.0; n = 50) ( P < .05). Both groups showed significant and similar degree of improvement at 6 months in DAI (-2.5 for oral supplement and -2.8 for placebo) and histologic index (-1.9 for oral supplement vs. -2.0 for placebo). Both intent-to-treat and completed patients given oral supplement had a significantly greater rate of decrease in the dose of prednisone required to control clinical symptoms over 6 months as compared with the placebo group ( P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in clinical response combined with a decreased requirement for corticosteroids suggest that this enriched oral supplement can be a useful adjuvant therapy in patients with UC.},

Because of iron and nutrition deficiency, UC patients are encouraged to consume a high-protein and high-iron diet. The crucial clinical question is the effect of a high-iron diet on inflammation activity and inflammation-driven carcinogenesis. Is a high-iron diet a foe or a feat in UC and UC-associated carcinogenesis? This review updates the progress and information on (1) iron nutrition and iron-deficiency anemia in patients with UC, (2) experimental evidence of the exacerbating effect of a high-iron diet on UC and its associated carcinogenesis and the difference between a high-iron diet and parental iron supplementation, (3) the clinical efficacy of, and concerns about, oral and intravenous iron supplements in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and iron deficiency anemia, and (4) the clinical implications of long-term iron supplements and management of UC. These experimental findings from animal models provide evidence to warrant further consideration and clinical studies of iron nutrition, inflammation activity, and cancer development.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) patients frequently require iron supplementation to remedy anemia. The impact of systemic iron supplementation (intraperitoneal injection) on UC-associated carcinogenesis was assessed in mice subjected to cyclic dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment and compared with dietary iron enrichment. Systemic iron supplementation, but not a twofold iron diet, remedied iron deficiency as indicated by the histochemical detection of splenic iron stores. A twofold iron diet, but not systemic iron, increased iron accumulation in colonic luminal contents, at the colonic mucosal surface, and in superficial epithelial cells. Colitis-associated colorectal tumor incidence after 15 DSS cycles was not affected by systemic iron (2/28; 7.1%) compared to nonsupplemented controls (4/28; 14.1%) but was significantly increased by the twofold iron diet (24/33; 72.7%) (P < 0.001). Mechanistic study revealed that systemic iron had no effect on DSS-induced inflammation, or colonic iNOS and COX-2 protein levels, compared to controls. Systemic iron supplementation for 16 weeks replenished splenic iron in a spontaneous colitis model (interleukin-2-deficient mice) and significantly reduced colonic inflammation compared to interleukin-2 (-/-) controls without increasing hyperplastic lesions. These results suggest that iron supplemented systemically could be used to remedy anemia in UC patients without exacerbating inflammation or enhancing colon cancer risk. These findings need to be verified in clinical studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: In the treatment of ulcerative colitis, 5-aminosalicylic acid is the standard therapy for both acute exacerbations of the disease and the maintenance of remission. Clinical studies have shown that olsalazine (Dipentum)--a prodrug converted to two molecules of 5-ASA by colonic bacteria-induces and maintains remission. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of olsalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis who were being treated in daily practice by private physicians specializing in gastroenterology. METHODOLOGY: A total of 260 patients with ulcerative colitis (aged 17-77 years, 116 men) were studied. The doses of olsalazine and the clinical data (including acute disease symptoms and the occurrence of adverse events) were recorded over a 6-month period. RESULTS: Twenty per cent of patients had pancolitis, 48% had left-sided disease and 32% had proctitis or proctosigmoiditis. At study entry, 86% of patients had active disease; the percentages of these patients in remission after 6 weeks and 6 months were 42% and 91%, respectively. Patients with active disease received a mean dose of olsalazine - 2324mg per day initially and 1325mg per day at 6 months. The corresponding figures for patients in remission at study entry were 1386mg and 1162mg per day, respectively. Seventy-three per cent of patients took olsalazine with food, as recommended. The overall rate of adverse events was low; no serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Olsalazine therapy resulted in a rapid regression in the acute symptoms of ulcerative colitis. Olsalazine was also effective in maintaining remission. The drug was well tolerated.},

The aim of this study was to identify foods causing intolerance and to determine the nature and severity of reported symptoms. Patients from the Dutch Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Association were mailed a survey on food intolerance; 105 (31% men) of 137 patients took part. They all reported intolerance to one or more foods. Common symptoms (scored from 0=absent to 10=severe), included diarrhea (mean score=5.8), fatigue (mean score=5.5), and thirst (mean score=4.6). Spicy foods, cabbage, and citrus fruits (or juice) were most likely to decrease stool consistency, increase stool frequency, or cause perianal irritation. Onions, cabbage, or leeks were reported by 28% of the patients to cause flatulence. The urge to defecate was stronger after a cooked meal (45% within (1/2) hour) than after sandwiches (15% within (1/2) hour). Foods reported to increase stool consistency were potato products, bread, and bananas. This study demonstrates that food intolerance is a common, albeit mild, problem after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Food and nutrition professionals should encourage patients to base their food choices on individual tolerance as long as no (patho-) physiological-based evidence to the contrary is available.},

This review discusses advances in knowledge of the changes in gut microbiota and host response in inflammatory bowel disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Approximately 15% of Crohn's disease cases in western populations result from mutations in NOD2/CARD15. This disease leads to defective intestinal defensin production and defective monocyte interleukin-8 response to bacterial peptidoglycan. A similar defective interleukin-8 response and consequent delayed neutrophil recruitment have also been shown in patients with Crohn's disease who do not have the NOD2 mutation. A consequence seems to be the accumulation in tissue of macrophages containing various bacteria, perhaps particularly Escherichia coli. In keeping with this patients with Crohn's disease have circulating antibodies against bacterial flagellar proteins of enterobacteria and clostridia. In ulcerative colitis, there is less evidence for invasion by or immune response to bacteria but changes in gut microbiota include a relative deficiency of bifidobacteria. There is considerable interest in probiotic or prebiotic therapies although so far little evidence for their efficacy. SUMMARY: Molecular techniques are giving us better insight into the gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease that should translate into improved therapies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Experimental studies have shown that luminal antigens are involved in chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders. Bifidogenic growth stimulator (BGS) is a prebiotic preparation produced by Propionibacterium freudenreichii isolated from Swiss cheese. Previously BGS was shown to act in the colon as a growth stimulator of Bifidobacteria. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of BGS in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Twelve patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis received orally 4.5 g of BGS daily for 4 wk in an open-label treatment protocol while the baseline anti-inflammatory therapy was continued. The response to treatment was evaluated clinically and endoscopically. Concentrations of short-chain fatty acids and the composition of commensal bacteria, including Bifidobacteria, Enterobacteria and Bacteroides species, were studied in stool samples. RESULTS: Patients showed improvement in their clinical activity index scores, with a significant decrease in the score from 7.4 +/- 2.8 to 4.7 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- standard error of the mean, P < 0.01). The endoscopic index score decreased from 4.4 +/- 1.7 to 2.8 +/- 1.8 (P < 0.05) with treatment. Patients showed an increase in stool butyrate concentrations after BGS treatment (P < 0.05). There were no significant changes in stool levels of bacteria as a result of BGS treatment. No side effects related to BGS were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Oral BGS therapy may represent a non-toxic way to treat ulcerative colitis. However, controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its efficacy in the treatment of this disorder.},

We investigated the effect of pretreatment with Lyprinol (LYP) on experimentally induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice (aged 6 weeks) were gavaged daily for 13 days with (150 microl) olive oil (OO; n = 7), fish oil (FO; n = 8), or LYP (n = 8). Mice consumed 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 6 days, starting on day 7. Body weight and disease activity index (DAI) scores were recorded daily. Colonic damage was determined by histopathology. Colonic inflammation was quantified by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. RESULTS: LYP treatment significantly (P < 0.05) reduced body weight loss, DAI scores, crypt area losses, and cecum and colon weights, compared with FO treatment. MPO activity was not significantly affected by any treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary evidence that Lyprinol may be potentially useful in ameliorating symptoms of IBD. The benefit, however, is unlikely to be due to the omega-3 fatty acid content. Dose-response evaluation of Lyprinol in experimental IBD is warranted.},

   abstract = {Initial events and effector mechanisms of most inflammatory and autoimmune diseases remain largely unknown. Dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems associated with mucosae (the major interface between the organism and its environment, e.g., microbiota, food) can conceivably cause impairment of mucosal barrier function and development of localized or systemic inflammatory and autoimmune processes. Animal models help in elucidating the etiology and pathogenetic mechanisms of human diseases, such as the inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, severe chronic diseases affecting the gut. To study the role of innate immunity and gut microbiota in intestinal inflammation, colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Conventionally reared (microflora-colonized) SCID mice displayed severe inflammation like that seen in immunocompetent Balb/c mice, whereas only minor changes appeared in the intestinal mucosa of DSS-fed gnotobiotic germ-free SCID mice. The presence of microflora facilitates the inflammation in DSS-induced colitis that develops in immunodeficient SCID mice, that is, in the absence of T and B lymphocytes. Celiac disease, a chronic autoimmune small bowel disorder, afflicts genetically susceptible individuals with wheat gluten intolerance. We showed that, in contrast with any other food proteins, wheat gliadin and its peptic fragments activate mouse macrophages and human monocytes to produce proinflammatory cytokines through the nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway. Activation of innate immunity cells by food proteins or components from gut microbiota thus could participate in the impairment of intestinal mucosa and the development of intestinal and/or systemic inflammation.},

Advances in biotherapy include new data on monoclonal antibodies (infliximab in ulcerative colitis, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, fontolizumab, selective anti-adhesion molecules, and others), antisense oligonucleotides, the development of small molecules, and cell-gene therapy (including helminth ova, leukocytapheresis, stem cell transplantation, and probiotic intestinal mucosal delivery systems). However, management of inflammatory bowel disease is about more than drug therapy, dose, and timing. The goals remain induction of remission, limitation of side effects, modification of the pattern of disease, and avoidance of complications. With the cost and complexity of biotherapy, inflammatory bowel disease is emerging as a specific subspecialty.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease, a transmural inflammation of the gut, has been linked to good childhood hygiene, frequent use of antibiotics before diagnosis, adherent or invasive mucosal bacteria and a break in the tolerance of luminal bacteria. A decrease or lack of mucosal peptide antibiotics may play a central role in the etiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease. The dysregulated adaptive immune system may reflect only the primary break of the mucosal defence since the immune response is mostly directed against luminal bacteria. Crohn's disease patients with ileal involvement, as compared to controls and Crohn's disease patients without ileal disease, are characterized by a diminished expression of the ileal Paneth cell defensins. This decrease is even more pronounced in Crohn's disease patients with a mutation in the NOD2 gene, which is associated with Crohn's disease and ileal involvement. NOD2 is an intracellular peptidoglycan receptor and is expressed in Paneth cells. In contrast to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease of the colon is characterized by an impaired induction of human beta defensins 2 and 3. The hypothesis of an impaired mucosal antibacterial activity is also consistent with the benefit from antibiotic or probiotic treatment in certain disease states.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC) is to be understood. The basic pathological feature of UC is intestinal chronic inflammation. Superantigen, such as Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB), is reported to compromise intestinal barrier function by increasing epithelial permeability and initiate inflammation in the intestinal mucosa. Inasmuch as anatomic position of the sinus, chronic sinusitis-derived SEB may follow the secretion and to be swallowed down to the gastrointestinal tract and induce lesions to the intestinal mucosa. METHODS: Sinus wash fluid (SWF, containing SEB) was collected from a group of patients with both chronic sinusitis (CS) and UC. A group of mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) in the presence of SWF. The sensitized mice were challenged with the specific antigen OVA. The inflammatory status of the colonic tissue was determined with histology, serology and electron microscopy. Using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a tracer, another group of mice was stimulated with SWF for 2 hours. The HRP activity was detected in the colonic tissue with enzymatic approaches and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Epithelial hyperpermeability in colonic epithelium was induced by stimulating with SWF. The HRP activity in the colonic mucosa was almost 11 times more in the SWF treated group (3.2 +/- 0.6 microg/g tissue) than the control group (0.3 +/- 0.1 microg/g tissue). Mice were sensitized using a mixture of SWF and OVA (serum OVA-specific IgE was detected with a highest titer as 1:64). Challenge with OVA induced extensive inflammation in the colonic mucosa by showing (1) marked degranulation in mast cells (MC, 46.3 +/- 4.5%) and eosinophils (Eo, 55.7 +/- 4.2%); (2) inflammatory cell infiltration (MC = 145.2 +/- 11.4; Eo = 215.8 +/- 12.5; mononuclear cell = 258.4 +/- 15.3/mm2 tissue); (3) increased MPO activity (12.9 +/- 3.2 U/g tissue) and inflammatory scores (1.8 +/- 0.3); (4) mucosal surface ulcers; (5) edema in the lamina propria; (6) bacterial translocation and abscess formation in the subepithelial region. CONCLUSION: Introducing Sinusitis-derived SEB-containing SWF to the gastrointestinal tract compromised colonic mucosal barrier function increasing epithelial permeability to luminal macromolecular protein in mice. The SWF facilitated colonic mucosal sensitization to luminal antigen. Multiple challenging the sensitized colonic mucosa with specific antigen OVA induced inflammation, induced a condition similar to human ulcerative colitis.},

The rationale for using probiotics is based on the evidence implicating intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of this disorder. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG alone or in combination with mesalazine vs. mesalazine as maintenance treatment in ulcerative colitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 187 ulcerative colitis patients with quiescent disease were randomized to receive Lactobacillus GG 18 x 10(9) viable bacteria/day (65 patients), mesalazine 2400 mg/day (60 patients) or Lactobacillus GG + mesalazine (62 patients). Disease activity index, endoscopic and histological scores were determined at 0, 6 and 12 months and in case of relapse. The primary end point was to evaluate sustained remission. RESULTS: Overall analysis showed no difference in relapse rate at 6 (P = 0.44) and 12 months (P = 0.77) among the three treatment groups. However, the treatment with Lactobacillus GG seems to be more effective than standard treatment with mesalazine in prolonging the relapse-free time (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus GG seems to be effective and safe for maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it could represent a good therapeutic option for preventing relapse in this group of patients.},

Our studies included: 1) clinical investigation of 293 patients with dyspeptic and ulcer complaints and 72 patients with lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract: 60 patients with UC, 12 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - the control group. Significant fungal colonization (SFC), over 10(5) CFU/ml was evaluated. Mycological investigation was performed, including qualitative and quantitative examination, according to Muller method, 2) experimental studies in rats included estimation of the influence of inoculation of Candida isolated from human GI tract on the healing process of GU, induced by acetic acid with or without probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (10(6) CFU/ml) introduced intragastrically (i.g.). At 0, 4, 15 and 25 day after ulcer induction. Weight, damage area, gastric blood flow (GBF) (H2 clearance), expression of mRNA for cytokines IL-beta, TNF-alpha (ELISA) were evaluated. Mycology: qualitative and quantitative examination was performed. MPO serum activity was measured. Results of clinical studies: 1) SFC was more frequent in patients with GU: 54.2% of cases and patients with over 5 years history of UC: 33.3% cases. 2) SFC delayed GU healing and influenced the maintenance of clinical symptoms in both diseases. Results of animal studies: 3) In Candida inoculated rats, the GBF was significantly lower than in the vehicle controls (saline administered group). Upregulation of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta was recorded. The GUs were still present till 25 day in all rats inoculated with Candida, in contrast to vehicle group (reduction of ulcer in 92% at day 25). CONCLUSIONS: 1) Fungal colonization delays process of ulcer and inflammation healing of GI tract mucosa. That effect was attenuated by probiotic therapy. 2) Probiotic therapy seems to be effective in treatment of fungal colonization of GI tract. 3) Lactobacillus acidophilus therapy shortens the duration of fungal colonization of mucosa (enhanced Candida clearance is associated with IL-4, INF-gamma response).},
