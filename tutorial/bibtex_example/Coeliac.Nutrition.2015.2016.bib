   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated gluten dependent enteropathy induced by ingestion of gluten, characterized by intestinal malabsorption and subtotals or total atrophy of intestinal villi. The predominant consequence of CD in untreated patients, is malnutrition as a result of malabsorption. Moreover, several and increasing extra-intestinal clinical manifestations have been described in the CD patients. Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) improves nutritional status, inducing an increase in fat and bone compartments, but does not completely normalize body composition and nutritional deficiencies. An early and accurate evaluation of nutritional status can be of the pivotal step in the clinical management of the adult CD patients. The aim of this review is to present the most important and recent data on nutritional and metabolic features in the CD adult patients, the related implications and the effects of the GFD on these conditions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Guidelines for diagnosing celiac disease (CD) recommend initial testing with a highly sensitive serologic test for anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A antibodies (tTG IgA). When the probability of CD is high, IgA deficiency should be considered. The two approaches to address this include measuring "both tTG IgA and tTG IgG" or measuring "total IgA". We aim to assess the utility of an isolated positive tTG IgG result in diagnosing CD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients undergoing serologic testing for CD from January 1997 to June 2014. Patients with positive tTG IgG and negative tTG IgA were included. Moreover, all patients who had any other positive CD-specific serologic findings were excluded. Demographic, clinical presentation, tests and biopsy results were recorded. RESULTS: The indication for checking celiac serology was gastrointestinal symptoms in 172 of 233 patients, iron deficiency anemia in 12, and high-risk screening in 48. Small bowel biopsy was obtained in 178 patients (77%); 160 had normal results and 18 had histologic changes suggestive of enteropathy. 9 patients had increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, and 9 had partial villous atrophy. However, only 6 cases of CD were confirmed. The utility of isolated tTG IgG in diagnosis of CD was low at 3% (6/178). CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients, the utility of isolated tTG IgG in diagnosing CD was low at 3%.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Response to gluten challenge (GC) is a key feature in diagnostic algorithms and research trials in celiac disease (CD). Currently, autoantibody titers, late responders to GC, and invasive duodenal biopsies are used to evaluate gluten responsiveness. This study investigated the accuracy of serum intestinal-fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), a marker for intestinal epithelial damage, to predict intestinal damage during GC in patients with CD. METHODS: Twenty adult CD patients in remission underwent a two-week GC with 3 or 7.5 g of gluten daily. Study visits occurred at day -14, 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Serum I-FABP, antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA), deamidated gliadin peptides (IgA-DGP), and anti-actin (AAA-IgA) were assessed at each visit. Villous-height to crypt-depth ratio (Vh:Cd) and intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) count were evaluated at day -14, 3, and 14. Forty-three CD-serology negative individuals were included to compare serum I-FABP levels in CD patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) with those in healthy subjects. RESULTS: Serum I-FABP levels increased significantly during a two-week GC. In contrast, the most pronounced autoantibody increase was found at day 28, when patients had already returned to a GFD for two weeks. IgA-AAA titers were only significantly elevated at day 28. I-FABP levels and IEL count correlated at baseline (r=0.458, P=0.042) and at day 14 (r=0.654, P=0.002) of GC. Neither gluten dose nor time on a GFD influenced I-FABP change during GC. CONCLUSIONS: Serum I-FABP levels increased significantly during a two-week GC in adult CD patients and correlated with IEL count. The data suggest that serum I-FABP is an early marker of gluten-induced enteropathy in celiac patients and may be of use in both clinical and research settings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is an important step in the diagnostic algorithm for celiac disease (CD) and is also used for screening purposes. Collection of blood is invasive and accompanied with emotional impact especially in children. Genetic technological progress now enables HLA typing from buccal cell samples. This study evaluated the reliability and feasibility of HLA typing for CD-associated HLA polymorphisms using buccal swabs as routine test in high-risk individuals. METHODS: Blood and buccal swabs of 77 children and adolescents with high risk for CD were prospectively collected in this cohort study. Buccal swab collection was performed either by the investigator at the outpatient clinic or by the patient or its parents at home. To evaluate the possibility of self-administration, three families performed the test at home. DNA was extracted using an adapted QIAamp method. Quantity, quality, and purity of DNA were recorded. HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 typing was examined on buccal cell-derived and blood-derived DNA at low and, if necessary, high resolution level, using sequence-specific oligonucleotide and sequence-based typing, respectively. RESULTS: DNA isolation using buccal swabs yielded a good quality and sufficient quantity of DNA to perform HLA-DQ typing in all individuals. HLA typing results on buccal cell-derived DNA were identical to typing on blood-derived DNA, also for the self-administered samples. CONCLUSION: Introduction of the buccal swab test for HLA typing of CD risk in routine diagnostics can omit the current venipuncture and enables self-administration at home. Therefore, the buccal swab test is beneficial for individuals with a clinical suspicion for CD, as well as for screening purposes in high-risk populations.},

Usually, venous blood DNA extraction and expensive and time consuming amplification are used, that hinder population-wide studies. We assayed a friendly HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 genotyping procedure using a combination of DNA from dried blood spot (DBS) and duplex allele-specific qPCR amplification using SYBR Green. DNA was extracted using home-made buffers and compared to an extraction commercial kit. Duplex reactions by qPCR were designed using each Tm allele amplicon for reference samples (positive HLA-DQ2 or DQ8) with allele-specific primers. DBS samples from 558 children (7.99 +/- 2.47 y) were collected. The DNA final yield obtained by the home-made extractive procedure was higher than from the commercial kit (1.11 +/- 0.56 vs 0.23 +/- 0.14 mug), while the quality was similar for both DNA samples. There was concordance in the amplification profiles for DNA samples obtained with both methods. All of four alleles from DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes were accurately identified in duplex reactions. By using DBS samples and DNA extraction home-made procedure, the costs were reduced by 60%. The whole procedure is cost-effective for HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 genotyping.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) are 2 distinct disease entities affecting the gastrointestinal tract of pediatric patients. Recently it has been suggested that EoE is more prevalent in patients with celiac disease than in the general population. We studied the association between these 2 disease entities in our pediatric patients. METHODS: We reviewed our hospital files for suspected or confirmed cases of CD. Only cases with both duodenal and esophageal biopsies in pediatric patients were included. A total of 120 patients who met these criteria were included as the disease group. We also selected 100 patients with no clinical suspicion of CD and included them as a control group. Slides were reviewed using established criteria for diagnosis of both conditions. Duodenal biopsies were categorized as positive, negative, and suspicious for CD, whereas esophageal biopsies were classified as either positive or negative for esophageal eosinophilia (EE). Serologic and clinical data were additionally collected. RESULTS: Sixty-two (62) cases were considered positive for CD in the disease group; among those 4 (6.5%) showed EE. In the control group, 91 cases were negative for CD, histologically, and 7 of those had EE (7.7%). Although 6 patients in the control group were histologically suspicious for CD, none of them had evidence of EE. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that, in our patient population, patients with CD are not more likely to have EE than patients undergoing upper endoscopy for other reasons. Therefore, we suggest that the association between CD and EE is likely incidental and not causal.},

The aim of this study is to evaluate effect of these alleles on the clinical, serological and histological features of Turkish children with celiac disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: we divided 36 celiac patients to 4 groups according to their HLA-DQ2 genotype based on the presence or absence of DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201 alleles. Group 1: 4 patients had no HLA-DQ2A1*0501 and DQ2B1*0201 alleles, Group 2: 12 patients had at least one of these alleles with heterozygous status, Group 3: 12 patients had both alleles with heterozygous status, Group 4: 8 patients had both alleles with homozygous status. We compared groups according to the clinical, serological, histological, and biochemical features. RESULTS: there was no statistical significance among the groups for age, body mass index (BMI), weight for height, and onset of symptoms. However, both in groups 3 and 4 compared with groups 1 and 2, minor differences were observed for BMI and anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) without statistical significance. According to the anti-endomysial antibody (EMA), Marsh scores, clinical presentations, hematological and biochemical values, there was no statistical significance among groups without constipation that observed higher rate in the 4th group without statistically significance. Hypothyroidism was detected in one patient (25%) in the lowest genetic load group (Group 1) with statistically significance (p < 0.046). CONCLUSION: in this study, small differences found among groups were not elucidated the impact of HLADQ2 A1*0501 and DQ2B1*0201 alleles on the clinical, serological and laboratory manifestations of celiac patients. Further studies are needed to assess the effect of reported HLA alleles and other genetic polymorphisms on CD outcomes in children.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to translate, adapt and validate the Celiac Disease Questionnaire (CDQ), which was developed in Germany, for use in Turkey. METHODS: The questionnaire was translated by a forward-backward translation method. Total CDQ score and four subscores (emotional state, gastrointestinal symptoms, worries, social problems) were calculated and their reliability assessed by internal consistency. Reliability of scales was evaluated by internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was assessed by means of a retest after 15 days. Face validity was assessed by patient volunteers and physicians and construct validity was assessed by means of confirmatory factor analysis. Convergent validity was determined by comparing responses to the CDQ with similar subscale scores of the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey. Discriminative concurrent criterion validity was determined by comparing the CDQ scores of patients with celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD) with CD patients not on a GFD. RESULTS: The Turkish version of the CDQ was completed by 205 patients with celiac disease (Female 146, mean age 31.1 year, +/- 10.61). The Cronbach-alpha coefficent of the subscores ranged between 0.73 and 0.93. Test-retest reliability was 0.99 for all subscores. 42 patients with CD and five gastroenterologists assessed the items of the CDQ to be comprehensible and relevant to the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of CD patients. The confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated acceptable fit indices for the original four subscales of the CDQ. The correlations between the scales of the CDQ and the instrument for validation covering similar dimensions of the HRQOL ranged between 0.61 and 0.93. In all subscores and in the total score, patients not on a GFD showed a significantly reduced HRQOL (all p < 0.05) compared to patients on a GFD. CONCLUSION: The Turkish version of the CDQ proved to be a reliable and valid instrument for measuring HRQOL in Turkish patients with celiac disease.},

This prospective study was conducted among 980 adults. Out of that, 482 subjects (staff and students of Riyadh Health Science College) were designated as control cohorts for undetected coeliac disease. Furthermore, another contingent of 498 subjects diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) at Prince Salman Hospital and Al-Iman General Hospital also constituted a segment of the overall initial 1020 subjects. Both cases and control were tested for serological markers of coeliac disease (tissues transglutaminase (tTGAs) and endomysial autoantibody (EMAs) and were confirmed by histopathology test. All the positive for cases of coeliac disease were screened for iron deficiency anaemia, Vitamin D deficiency, and osteoporosis and weight assessment. The percentage of coeliac disease in control subjects and patients diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were found to be 1.9% and 9.6% respectively, about 38% of the total coeliac disease patients are among females of middle age (20-39-years) and 16% of the males in the same age range. Whereas, 20% and 25% of all coeliac disease cases with ages of 40-59 were remarked as females and males respectively. The identical nature and overlap of symptoms of the two conditions could possibly result in misdiagnosis of coeliac diseases or over-diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome. The findings of the study might also give considerable implications of the disease in the nutritional level which is noticeable.},

   abstract = {Enzymatic digestion, or hydrolysis, has been proposed for treating gluten-containing foods and beverages to make them safe for persons with celiac disease (CD). There are no validated testing methods that allow the quantitation of all the hydrolyzed or fermented gluten peptides in foods and beverages that might be harmful to CD patients, making it difficult to assess the safety of hydrolyzed products. This study examines an ELISA-based method to determine whether serum antibody binding of residual peptides in a fermented barley-based product is greater among active-CD patients than a normal control group, using commercial beers as a test case. Sera from 31 active-CD patients and 29 nonceliac control subjects were used to assess the binding of proteins from barley, rice, traditional beer, gluten-free beer, and enzymatically treated (gluten-removed) traditional beer. In the ELISA, none of the subjects' sera bound to proteins in the gluten-free beer. Eleven active-CD patient serum samples demonstrated immunoglobulin A (IgA) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding to a barley extract, compared to only one nonceliac control subject. Of the seven active-CD patients who had an IgA binding response to barley, four also responded to traditional beer, and two of these responded to the gluten-removed beer. None of the nonceliac control subjects' sera bound to all three beer samples. Binding of protein fragments in hydrolyzed or fermented foods and beverages by serum from active-CD patients, but not nonceliac control subjects, may indicate the presence of residual peptides that are celiac-specific.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although gastritis and esophagitis are well studied in children, there is very limited literature on duodenitis in children. We aimed to assess the prevalence, etiology, clinical, endoscopic, and pathological features in a large cohort of unselected children with duodenitis. METHODS: We reviewed the pathology reports of all the upper endoscopies performed at our institution during 5 years to identify children with duodenitis. Biopsy sections were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of duodenitis. Demographic, clinical, endoscopic data, and the presence of associated gastritis and esophagitis were noted in all of the children with duodenitis. The etiology of duodenitis was correlated with the patients' clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Out of 2772 children who had endoscopy, 352 had duodenitis with the prevalence rate of 12.7%. Gastritis was seen in 64% of children with duodenitis compared with 46% of children without duodenitis (P < 0.001). Common indications for endoscopy in children with duodenitis were abdominal pain, positive celiac serology, and diarrhea. The most common etiology was celiac disease (32%), followed by Crohn disease (13%), ulcerative colitis (3%), and Helicobacter pylori infection (6%). In 63% of cases, the endoscopic appearance of duodenum was normal. Cryptitis, villous changes, and cellular infiltration were noted on histology. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of duodenitis is 12.7% in children undergoing endoscopy. Celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease are common causes of duodenitis. Associated gastritis is common in children with duodenitis, and the correlation of endoscopic appearance with histology is poor.},

   abstract = {Weaning (or introduction of complementary feeding) is a special and important moment in the growth of a child, both for the family and the infant itself, and it can play a major role in the child's future health. Throughout the years, various weaning modes have come in succession, the latest being baby-led weaning; the timing for introducing foods and the requirements of which sort of nutrient for weaning have also changed over time. Furthermore, the role played by nutrition, especially in the early stages of life, for the onset of later non-communicable disorders, such as diabetes, obesity or coeliac disease has also been increasingly highlighted.Members of Italian Society of Gastroenterology, Hepathology and Pediatric Nutrition (SIGENP) and the Italian Society of Allergology and Pediatric Immunology (SIAIP) Emilia Romagna here propose a practical approach for pediatricians to deal with daily practice. The four main areas for discussion were weaning in relation with the onset of allergic diseases, coeliac disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, the nutrition requirements to take into account for assessing the diet of infants under one year of age and about the practice of baby-led weaning focusing on limits and benefits, respectively.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Little is known regarding nutritional adequacy of the gluten free diet (GFD) in children and adolescents with celiac disease (CD). The study aim was to examine macro- and micronutrient intake in children with CD. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in children and adolescents (4-18 years of age) with CD (n = 32) and healthy controls (n = 32). Macro- and micronutrient intake, and glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) intake was assessed using validated measures. Diet quality was assessed using the Canadian Healthy Eating Index (HEI-C) and the Alberta Nutrition Guidelines. Values are shown as mean +/- SE. RESULTS: Age (10.4 +/- 0.7 years vs 8.7 +/- 0.7 years; P = 0.06), weight-for-age z score (P = 0.27), and height-for-age z score (P = 0.23) were not different between groups. CD children consumed more fibre (15.9 +/- 1.2 g per day(CD) vs 10.8 +/- 0.8 g per day (controls); P < 0.001), had higher GI (CD: 54 +/- 2 vs 48 +/- 1; P < 0.01) and GL (CD: 118 +/- 8 vs 93 +/- 7; P = 0.02), and lower folate (146.7 +/- 15.3 (CD) vs 245.4 +/- 21.8 microg per day (controls); P < 0.001) than controls. No differences in HEI-C scores (</= and > 80) were observed between groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Children with CD had high intakes of fibre, GI, and GL and lower intakes of folate. This has implications for dietary counselling in this population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Early nutrition may affect the risk of celiac disease. We investigated whether amount of gluten in diet until 2 years of age increases risk for celiac disease. METHODS: We performed a 1-to-3 nested case-control study of 146 cases, resulting in 436 case-control pairs matched for sex, birth year, and HLA genotype generated from Swedish children at genetic risk for celiac disease. Newborns were annually screened for tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA). If tested tTGA positive, time point of seroconversion was determined from frozen serum samples taken every 3 months. Celiac disease was confirmed by intestinal biopsies. Gluten intake was calculated from 3-day food records collected at ages 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated through conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Breastfeeding duration (median, 32 wk) and age at first introduction to gluten (median, 22 wk) did not differ between cases and tTGA-negative controls. At the visit before tTGA seroconversion, cases reported a larger intake of gluten than controls (OR, 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.46; P = .0002). More cases than controls were found in the upper third tertile (ie, >5.0 g/d) before they tested positive for tTGA seroconversion than controls (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.70-4.13; P < .0001). This finding was similar in children homozygous for DR3-DQ2 (OR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.61-6.30; P = .001), heterozygous for DR3-DQ2 (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.08-4.62; P = .030), and for children not carrying DR3-DQ2 (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 0.90-6.54; P = .079). CONCLUSIONS: The amount of gluten consumed until 2 years of age increases the risk of celiac disease at least 2-fold in genetically susceptible children. These findings may be taken into account for future infant feeding recommendations.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is a systemic autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten consumption in genetically susceptible individuals. It exhibits several clinical features, such as blood auto-antibodies (anti-endomysial antibodies EMA, anti-transglutaminase antibodies tTG, anti-deamidated gliadin peptides PGD), plus variable degrees of damage in the small intestinal mucosa. In Chile, tTG is positive in 0.76% in individuals >15 years, with the prevalence of CD being estimated at 0.6%. Approximately17% of first-degree relatives of coeliac patients have been reported tTG positive. To date, the gluten free diet (GFD) is the only known treatment for CD. To be effective, this must be lifelong, permanent, and strict. Gluten content in the GFD is not zero, but is limited to a cut-off of 3ppm (ormg/kg of product) in Chile. Mortality higher than that of the general population has been reported among coeliac patients, and poor adherence to GFD is associated with complications (mainly autoimmune processes and cancer). GFD is difficult to maintain strictly and poor adherence is by far the main cause of lack of response to treatment. Follow-up of adherence is also difficult because there are no objective measurements to assess it. In clinical practice determination of serum EMA, tTG and PGD is routinely used for these purposes, although more recently, the interview by an expert dietitian, validated questionnaires and measurement of faecal 33-mer peptide are being assessed as alternatives or complements to measure adherence to GFD. A review is presented with the current concepts on the available tools to follow up patients on GFD, emphasising those available in Chilel.},

   abstract = {HLA-linked genes are relevant to celiac disease (CD); the potential genetic differences present worldwide are not fully understood. Previous results suggest that the distribution of HLA-DQ2/DQ7/DQ8 in Chile may differ from that in Europe and North America. In celiac patients and their first-degree relatives (FDRS), we assessed their clinical, serological and histological characteristics, determined HLA-DQ2, HLA-DQ7 and HLA-DQ8 alleles and genotypes, and evaluated the relations between them. A total of 222 individuals were assessed (56 cases, 166 FDRs). 16.9% of FDRs were tTG positive; 53.6% of them showed overweight/obesity and 3% undernourishment; they spontaneously declared being asymptomatic, but detailed questioning revealed that 60.7% experienced symptoms, which had not been investigated. DQ2 was present in 53.9% and 43.9.0% of cases and FDRs (p < 0.05). The most frequent genotype distribution was DQ2/DQ7 (fr 0.392 (cases) and 0.248 (FDRs), respectively, p < 0.02). The next most common genotypes were HLA-DQ2/DQ8 (fr 0.236 in FDRs and 0.176 in cases, p < 0.05). 3.92% cases were not HLA-DQ2/DQ8 carriers. Among tTG positive FDRs, 57.4%, 22.3% and 20.2% carried DQ2, DQ7 and DQ8, respectively. In cases, 72.7% of the biopsies classified Marsh >/= 3 carried at least one DQ2; 91.7% of DQ2/DQ2 and 88.3% of DQ2/DQ7 were Marsh >/= 3. Thus, DQ2 frequency is lower than reported; the higher frequency found for DQ8 and DQ7 concur with recent publications from Argentine and Brazil. These results suggest that although CD may manifest clinically in ways similar to those described in other populations, some genetic peculiarities in this region deserve further study.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to determine whether age at introduction to gluten was associated with risk for celiac disease (CD) in genetically predisposed children. METHODS: TEDDY (The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young) is a prospective birth cohort study. Newborn infants (N = 6436) screened for high-risk HLA-genotypes for CD were followed up in Finland, Germany, Sweden, and the United States. Information about infant feeding was collected at clinical visits every third month. The first outcome was persistent positive for tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA), the marker for CD. The second outcome was CD, defined as either a diagnosis based on intestinal biopsy results or on persistently high levels of tTGA. RESULTS: Swedish children were introduced to gluten earlier (median: 21.7 weeks) compared with children from Finland (median: 26.1 weeks), Germany, and the United States (both median: 30.4 weeks) (P < .0001). During a median follow-up of 5.0 years (range: 1.7-8.8 years), 773 (12%) children developed tTGA and 307 (5%) developed CD. Swedish children were at increased risk for tTGA (hazard ratio: 1.74 [95% CI: 1.47-2.06]) and CD (hazard ratio: 1.76 [95% CI: 1.34-2.24]) compared with US children, respectively (P < .0001).Gluten introduction before 17 weeks or later than 26 weeks was not associated with increased risk for tTGA or CD, adjusted for country, HLA, gender, and family history of CD, neither in the overall analysis nor on a country-level comparison. CONCLUSIONS: In TEDDY, the time to first introduction to gluten introduction was not an independent risk factor for developing CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) have an increased risk of celiac disease (CD). Since CD can be seronegative, more sensible tests for detection are needed. In seronegative patients, CD diagnosis may be difficult because of a lack of specificity. Flow cytometry analysis of lymphocyte populations can be useful in this situation. We aimed to study the prevalence of CD in adult DM1 using human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatibility-based screening. A secondary goal was to study the role of flow cytometry as a complementary tool in these patients. METHODS: We selected 200 patients with DM1, of whom 190 (95%) had HLA DQ2, DQ8 or both. Of these, 136 agreed to participate and provided epidemiological data. All patients underwent blood tests and gastroscopy. RESULTS: Sixteen patients had a histology consistent with CD. After ruling out other diagnoses, 6 patients were diagnosed with CD, 2 of whom had negative antibodies. All were DQ2.5 homozygous, with a CD prevalence of 9.8% in this group. In the flow cytometry analysis of duodenal biopsy samples, when we compared all non-CD with CD patients, we found that the gamma/delta intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) percentage was significantly higher and the CD3 negative IEL percentage significantly lower in the CD group. We found similar results when we compared only those with histological lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Screening of CD in patients with DM1 by HLA detects only 1% of seronegative patients with CD. DQ2.5 homozygous patients are at most risk of developing CD. The study of lymphocyte populations in the duodenal biopsy by flow cytometry discriminates patients with CD from those without CD with high sensitivity and specificity.},

DESIGN: A population based study. PATIENTS: Prior to enlistment, at the age of 17 years, most of the Israeli Jewish population undergoes a general health examination. Subjects' medical diagnoses are entered into a structured database. INTERVENTIONS: The enlistment database was thoroughly searched for CD cases between the years 1988 and 2015. Medical records of 2 001 353 subjects were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anthropometric measures at the age of 17 years. RESULTS: Overall, 10 566 CD cases (0.53%) were identified and analysed. Median age at data ascertainment was 17.1 years (IQR, 16.9-17.4). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that boys with CD were leaner (Body Mass Index 21.2+/-3.7 vs 21.7+/-3.8, p=0.02) while girls with CD were shorter (161.5+/-6 cm vs 162.1+/-6 cm, p=0.017) than the general population. The prevalence of diagnosed CD increased from 0.5% to 1.1% in the last 20 years with a female predominance (0.64% vs 0.46%). CD prevalence was significantly lower in subjects of lower socioeconomic status and those of African, Asian and former Soviet Union origin. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent boys with CD were leaner and girls with CD were shorter compared with the general population. However, the clinical relevance of the small differences suggests that when CD is diagnosed during childhood, final weight and height are not severely impaired. Our cohort reinforces the observed increase in diagnosed CD.},

Thus, we aimed to investigate the association of CD with CVD risk factors at late adolescence in a cross-sectional population based study. METHODS: A total of 2,001,353 Jewish Israeli adolescents who underwent a general health examination at median age of 17.1y from 1988 to 2015 were included. Covariate data included demographic measures, blood pressure (BP), resting heart rate and risk factors associated with CVD. RESULTS: Overall, 10,566 cases of CD were identified (0.53%). Multivariate analysis showed that mean diastolic BP was significantly lower in subjects with CD (males: 72.0+/-8.7 vs. 70.4 +/- 8.5, p < 0.0001; females: 70.0 +/- 8.3 vs. 69.0 +/- 8.2, p < 0.0001) whereas systolic BP did not differ between groups. Resting heart rate was higher in CD cases (An absolute difference of 0.4 beats per minute, p < 0.0001). The proportions of overweight and obese subjects were significantly lower in CD cases. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (RR, 4.1, 95% CI 2.8-5.7), hypercoagulability (RR, 2.6, 95% CI 1.5-4.5) and hyperlipidemia (RR, 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3) were significantly more common in subjects with CD. CONCLUSION: At the age of 17 years, the prevalence of risk factors for CVD is higher in subjects with CD compared to the general population. However, there is neither increase in blood pressure nor increase in overweight and obesity rates.},

Given the requirements and intricacies inherent to each condition, we describe the rationale and design a dietary curriculum specifically addressing the educational requirements for children and adults with CD and diabetes as part of the CD-DIET Study. METHODS AND DESIGN: The CD-DIET Study (Celiac Disease and Diabetes - Dietary Intervention and Evaluation Trial) is a multicenter randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of a GFD in patients with asymptomatic celiac disease and T1D on key diabetes and patient-centered outcomes. DISCUSSION: Key dietary components of the trial include a description and evaluation of food consumption patterns including glycemic index and glycemic load, novel assessments of gluten quantification, and objective and subjective measures of GFD adherence. This dietary curriculum will establish rigorous guidelines to assess adherence and facilitate evaluation of a GFD on metabolic control, bone health and patient quality of life in patients with CD and diabetes.

   abstract = {Celiac disease has been associated with several neurologic disorders which may result from micronutrient deficiencies, coexisting autoimmune conditions, or gluten sensitivity. Copper deficiency can produce multiple neurologic manifestations. Myeloneuropathy is the most common neurologic syndrome and it is often irreversible, despite copper replacement. We report the case of a 55-year-old man who presented with progressive proximal limb weakness and weight loss in the setting of untreated celiac disease without gastrointestinal symptoms. He had anemia, neutropenia, and severe hypocupremia. The pattern of weakness raised the suspicion that there was an underlying myopathy, although this was not confirmed by electrodiagnostic studies. Weakness and hematologic abnormalities resolved completely within 1 month of total parenteral nutrition with copper supplementation and a gluten-free diet. Myopathy can rarely occur in patients with celiac disease, but the mechanism is unclear. Pure proximal limb weakness has not been previously reported in copper deficiency. We propose that this may represent a novel manifestation of hypocupremia and recommend considering copper deficiency and gluten sensitivity in patients presenting with proximal limb weakness.},

   abstract = {Mankind has existed for 2.5 million years but only in the last 10,000 years have we been exposed to wheat. Wheat was first cultivated in the Fertile Crescent (South Western Asia) with a farming expansion that lasted from about 9000BC to 4000BC. Thus it could be considered that wheat (and gluten) is a novel introduction to man's diet! Prior to 1939 the rationing system had already been devised. This led to an imperative to try to increase agricultural production. Thus it was agreed in 1941 that there was a need to establish a Nutrition Society. The very roots of the society were geared towards necessarily increasing the production of wheat. This goal was achieved and by the end of the 20th century, global wheat output had expanded 5-fold. Perhaps as a result the epidemiology of coeliac disease (CD) or gluten sensitive enteropathy has changed. CD is a state of heightened immunological responsiveness to ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. CD now affects 1 % or more of all adults, for which the treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. However, there is a growing body of evidence to show that a far greater proportion of individuals without coeliac disease are taking a gluten-free diet of their own volition. This clinical entity has been termed non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), although the condition is fraught with complexities due to overlap with other gluten-based constituents that can also trigger similar clinical symptoms. This review will explore the relationship between gluten, the rising prevalence of modern coeliac disease, and the new entity of NCGS along with its associated uncertainties.},

Gluten-free diet (GFD) might affect AGE levels in patients who adhere to a GFD because of coeliac disease (CD). The aim of our study was to compare skin AGE levels and soluble receptor AGE levels (sRAGE) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) with (T1DM + CD) and without CD (T1DM - CD) and healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: We recruited 25 T1DM + CD and 25 T1DM - CD patients, matched for age, gender, diabetes duration, and glycaemic control alongside 25 healthy controls. We collected demographic, clinical and biochemical characteristics, including skin autofluorescence (AF), sRAGE and hs-CRP levels. The duration of T1DM in patients was 30 +/- 14 (+CD) and 29 +/- 14 years (-CD), whereas CD duration in T1DM + CD patients was 14 +/- 10 years. Skin AF levels in T1DM patients were higher compared to healthy controls (2.5 +/- 0.6 versus 1.9 +/- 0.4, p < 0.01) and skin AF was independently associated with age (r = 0.72, p < 0.01). sRAGE levels were higher in T1DM - CD patients compared to healthy controls (1554 +/- 449 versus 1309 +/- 400, p = 0.049) and independently associated with creatinine levels (r = 0.32, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that skin AGE and sRAGE levels are elevated in T1DM patients compared with healthy controls. No difference in skin AF or sRAGE levels between T1DM patients with or without CD were observed. The present study suggests that differences in microvascular complications between T1DM and T1DM + CD patients are not due to differences in skin AF or sRAGE levels.},

   abstract = {Theterm gluten intolerance may refer to three types of human disorders: autoimmune celiac disease (CD), allergy to wheat and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Gluten is a mixture of prolamin proteins present mostly in wheat, but also in barley, rye and oat. Gluten can be subdivided into three major groups: S-rich, S-poor and high molecular weight proteins. Prolamins within the groups possess similar structures and properties. All gluten proteins are evolutionarily connected and share the same ancestral origin. Gluten proteins are highly resistant to hydrolysis mediated by proteases of the human gastrointestinal tract. It results in emergence of pathogenic peptides, which cause CD and allergy in genetically predisposed people. There is a hierarchy of peptide toxicity and peptide recognition by T cells. Nowadays, there are several ways to detoxify gluten peptides: the most common is gluten-free diet (GFD), which has proved its effectiveness; prevention programs, enzymatic therapy, correction of gluten pathogenicity pathways and genetically modified grains with reduced immunotoxicity. A deep understanding of gluten intolerance underlying mechanisms and detailed knowledge of gluten properties may lead to the emergence of novel effective approaches for treatment of gluten-related disorders.},

   abstract = {This study was planned to investigate the amount and content of foods consumed by child patients with celiac disease on a long-term gluten-free diet. Children aged 3-18 years who were diagnosed with celiac disease according to ESPGHAN criteria and were compliant to the gluten-free diet for at least one year were included. Age and gender matched healthy children were included as the control group. Food consumption records including the amount and content of the foods consumed for a total of three days were obtained. Once the records had been completed on the food consumption form, quantity analysis was again performed by the same dietician. Energy and other nutritional elements taken in through foodstuffs consumed by the patient and control groups were calculated using the Nutrition Data System for Research Package; these results were shown as mean +/- standard deviation (x +/-SD) and the values compared. The study consisted of 28 patients with a mean age of 10.3 +/- 4.6 and 25 healthy controls with a mean age of 9.5 +/- 3.4. Average age at diagnosis in the patient group was 6.7 +/- 4.3 and mean duration of gluten-free diet was 4.0 +/- 3.3 years. Children with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet had significantly lower daily energy intake levels compared to the healthy controls (p<0.05). The proportional fat consumption was significantly higher in the patient group compared to the controls (p<0.05). Moreover, proportional carbohydrate and protein, vitamin E and vitamin B1, and microelements such as magnesium, phosphorus and zinc consumptions were significantly lower in celiac group with respect to v-control group. Solely determining compliance to the gluten free diet might be inadequate in the follow-up of children with celiac disease, adequacy of the nutritional content in terms of macro and micronutrients of celiac disease patients is also important.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a complex chronic immune-mediated disorder of the small intestine. Today, the pathobiology of the disease is unclear, perplexing differential diagnosis, patient stratification, and decision-making in the clinic. METHODS: Herein, we adopted a next-generation sequencing approach in a celiac disease trio of Greek descent to identify all genomic variants with the potential of celiac disease predisposition. RESULTS: Analysis revealed six genomic variants of prime interest: SLC9A4 c.1919G>A, KIAA1109 c.2933T>C and c.4268_4269delCCinsTA, HoxB6 c.668C>A, HoxD12 c.418G>A, and NCK2 c.745_746delAAinsG, from which NCK2 c.745_746delAAinsG is novel. Data validation in pediatric celiac disease patients of Greek (n = 109) and Serbian (n = 73) descent and their healthy counterparts (n = 111 and n = 32, respectively) indicated that HoxD12 c.418G>A is more prevalent in celiac disease patients in the Serbian population (P < 0.01), while NCK2 c.745_746delAAinsG is less prevalent in celiac disease patients rather than healthy individuals of Greek descent (P = 0.03). SLC9A4 c.1919G>A and KIAA1109 c.2933T>C and c.4268_4269delCCinsTA were more abundant in patients; nevertheless, they failed to show statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The next-generation sequencing-based family genomics approach described herein may serve as a paradigm towards the identification of novel functional variants with the aim of understanding complex disease pathobiology.},

   abstract = {With up to 200 m(2) the human intestine is the organ with the largest absorptive surface of the body. It is lined by a single layer of epithelial cells that separates the host from the environment. The intestinal epithelium provides both, selective absorption of nutrients, ions, and water but also a highly effective barrier function which includes the first line of defense against environmental antigens. The paracellular part of this barrier function is provided by tight junction (TJ) proteins, especially the large family of claudins. Changes in abundance or molecular structure of claudins can generally result in three typical effects, (i) decreased absorptive passage, (ii) increased secretory passage of small solutes and water causing leak flux diarrhea and (iii) increased absorptive passage of macromolecules which may induce inflammatory processes. Several intestinal diseases are associated with such changes that can result in intestinal inflammation and symptoms like weight loss, abdominal pain or diarrhea. This review summarizes our current knowledge on barrier dysfunction and claudin dysregulation in several intestinal diseases gastroenterologists are often faced with, like inflammatory bowel disease, microscopic colitis, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, gallstones and infectious diseases like HIV enteropathy, Campylobacter jejuni and Clostridium perfringens infection.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: There are conflicting data on the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on the nutritional status of celiac patients. In the present study, we evaluated, in adult celiac patients, the influence of a long-term, strictly GFD on their nutritional status and compared it with matched healthy volunteers. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Our study included 39 celiac patients and 39 healthy volunteers. The body mass index (BMI) of patients and controls was evaluated at enrollment, while the patients' BMI before the GFD was retrieved from clinical records. In addition, at enrollment, in both groups, we compared BMI, fat mass (FM), bone mineral density (BMD), as well as their dietary intake, recorded on a 7-day diary. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis, the majority of celiac patients (82.0%) had a normal BMI or were overweight, while 10.3% were malnourished. After the GFD, patients with a normal BMI showed a significant weight increase (P=0.002), but none of them switched in the overweight or obese category. Two (50%) of the four malnourished patients achieved a normal BMI. Controls and patients on a GFD had a similar BMI, FM, BMD and total calorie intake, but the amount of lipids and fiber intake was significantly different in the two groups (P=0.003 and P<0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that a GFD is able to improve the nutritional status of celiac patients without inducing overweight or obesity. Our findings are related to a celiac population adopting a GFD based on a Mediterranean-type diet.},

CASES DESCRIPTION: The two patients were simultaneously referred from the Municipal Hospital, where they were admitted to the Pediatric Gastroenterology clinic of a university hospital for diagnostic investigation of the cause of severe malnutrition and screening tests for Celiac Disease, Cystic Fibrosis and Environmental enteropathy among others. The exams were all normal, and after detailed research on the interactions of this family, we reached the conclusion that the malnutrition was due to abuse by starvation. The children spent approximately two months in the hospital, receiving a high-protein and high-calorie diet, with significant nutritional recovery. COMMENTS: Abuse by starvation, although rare, should always be considered of as one of the causes of child malnutrition and pediatrician should be aware of the child's development, as well as the family interactions, to prevent more severe nutritional and emotional consequences in the future.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The only effective and safe treatment of celiac disease (CD) continues being strict exclusion of gluten for life, the so-called gluten-free diet (GFD). Although this treatment is highly successful, following strict GFD poses difficulties to patients in family, social and working contexts, deteriorating his/her quality of life. We aimed to review main characteristics of GFD with special emphasis on factors that may interfere with adherence to it. METHODS: We conducted a search of various databases, such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scielo, with focus on key words such as "gluten-free diet", "celiac disease", "gluten" and "gluten-free diet adherence". Available literature has not reached definitive conclusions on the exact amount of gluten that is harmless to celiac patients, although international agreements establish cutoff points for gluten-free products and advise the use of clinical assessment to tailor the diet according to individual needs. Following GFD must include eliminating gluten as ingredient as well as hidden component and potential cross contamination in foods. There are numerous grains to substitute wheat but composition of most gluten-free products tends to include only a small number of them, especially rice. The diet must be not only free of gluten but also healthy to avoid nutrient, vitamins and minerals deficiencies or excess. Overweight/obesity frequency has increased among celiac patients so weight gain deserves attention during follow up. Nutritional education by a trained nutritionist is of great relevance to achieve long-term satisfactory health status and good compliance. CONCLUSIONS: A balanced GFD should be based on a combination of naturally gluten-free foods and certified processed gluten-free products. How to measure and improve adherence to GFD is still controversial and deserves further study.},

This work aimed to incorporate a commercial CGTase enzyme and the CGTase produced by Bacillus firmus strain 37 in the production of these breads to overcome these drawbacks. The flours employed were corn and pinion flours, which had the best CD production by CGTase, and exhibited good antioxidant activity, respectively. Rice flour was used as a control. The addition of the CGTase enzyme increased the specific volume and improved the texture of the breads. In the sensory analyses, the best score given by non-celiacs was for bread with pinion and rice flours and CGTase from B. firmus strain 37, while celiacs awarded the best score to the bread with rice flour only and same enzyme. The results demonstrate an improvement in the sensory and technological characteristics of gluten-free breads using the CGTase enzyme.},

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Institute for Maternal and Child Health IRCCS Burlo Garofolo (Trieste, Italy). PATIENTS: Children diagnosed with CD without a duodenal biopsy (group 1), following the last ESPGHAN and BSPGHAN guidelines, and children diagnosed with a duodenal biopsy, matched for sex, age and year of diagnosis (group 2), were prospectively enrolled over a 3-year period. All patients were put on a gluten-free diet (GFD) and were followed up for clinical conditions and laboratory testing at 6 months every year since diagnosis (median follow up: 1.9 years). OUTCOME MEASURES: Resolution of symptoms, body mass index, laboratory testing (haemoglobin, anti-transglutaminase IgA), adherence to a GFD, quality of life, and supplementary post-diagnosis medical consultations. RESULTS: 51 out of 468 (11%) patients were diagnosed without a duodenal biopsy (group 1; median age 2.1 years) and matched to 92 patients diagnosed with a biopsy (group 2; median age 2.4 years). At the end of follow-up the two groups were statistically comparable in terms of clinical and nutritional status, anti-transglutaminase IgA antibody titres, quality of life, adherence to a GFD, and number of supplementary medical consultations. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this prospective study, diagnosis of CD can be reliably performed without a duodenal biopsy in approximately 11% of cases. At least during a medium-term follow-up, this approach has no negative consequences relating to clinical remission, adherence to diet, and quality of life of children with CD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The beneficial effects of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) mixture (cis9, trans11, c9; trans10, cis12, t10) against gliadin-induced toxicity in HLA-DQ8-transgenic mice (DQ8) have been associated with improved duodenal cytoprotective mechanisms [nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2, Nrf2; acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH)/proteasome]. The present study was aimed at investigating the ability of individual CLA isomers to improve the efficacy of these defensive mechanisms and to protect against duodenal injury caused by the combined administration of gliadin and indomethacin (GI). METHODS: Gluten-mediated enteropathy was induced in DQ8 mice by three intra-gastric administration of gliadin (20 mg kg(-1)/bw) and indomethacin (15 mg L(-1)) in drinking water for 10 days (GI). C9 or t10 CLA (520 mg kg(-1)/bw/day) were orally administered for 2 weeks. Pro-oxidant and toxic effects associated with GI treatment, anti-oxidant/detoxifying ability of c9 or t10-CLA and the protective effect induced by c9 pre-treatment (c9 + GI) were evaluated in DQ8 mice duodenum by combining enzymatic, immunoblotting, histological evaluation and quantitative real-time PCR assays. RESULTS: GI treatment produces the time-dependent decline of the considered detoxifying mechanisms thus leading to pro-apoptotic and pro-oxidant effects. APEH/proteasome pathway was not markedly affected by individual CLA isomers, but duodenal redox status and activity/mRNA levels of Nrf2-activated enzymes were significantly improved by c9 administration. c9 pre-treatment protects against GI-mediated accumulation of oxidative stress markers, and histological examination reveals the increase of goblet cells number in mouse duodenum but induces only a partial recovery of APEH/proteasome activity. CONCLUSIONS: The activation of and adaptive response by low doses of c9 supplementation prevents distinct signs of gliadin-induced enteropathy in DQ8 mice.},

Thus, GFB and control bread (CB) were fermented with faecal microbiota in pH-controlled batch cultures. The effects on the major groups of microbiota were monitored over 48 h incubations by fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Furthermore, the death kinetics of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella Typhimurium in a saline solution supplemented with GFB or CB were also assessed. The experiments in saline solution pinpointed that GFB prolonged the survival of L. acidophilus and exerted an antibacterial effect towards S. aureus and S. Typhimurium. Moreover, GFB modulated the intestinal microbiota in vitro, promoting changes in lactobacilli and bifidobacteria members in coeliac subjects. A final multivariate approach combining both viable counts and metabolites suggested that GFB could beneficially modulate the coeliac gut microbiome; however, human studies are needed to prove its efficacy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Due to a high linkage disequilibrium of diabetes and coeliac-specific human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes, the prevalence of coeliac disease (CD) in children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1D) is much higher than in the general population. Recently, the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) revised new screening guidelines in which genotyping for coeliac-specific HLA alleles is recommended for high-risk patients as patients with T1D. The aim of our study was to investigate the frequency and distribution of coeliac-specific HLA genotypes in paediatric patients with T1D. STUDY DESIGN: HLA genotyping was performed on paediatric patients with T1D, recruited at the Medical University Hospital of Innsbruck and Graz. The test was done by PCR. Statistical analysis was performed with IBM-SPSS V.20. RESULTS: In 121 paediatric patients with T1D (52% male), mean age 13.3 (SD 3.9) years, mean age at diabetes diagnosis 7.4 (SD 3.8) and mean diabetes duration of 5.9 (SD 3.3) years, HLA genotyping was conducted. Ninety-two per cent showed positive HLA DQ2 and/or HLA DQ8 genotypes. Thirty-four per cent carried HLA DQ2, 33% were HLA DQ2+DQ8 positive and 25% of the patients showed positive results for HLA DQ8 alone. Only 8% had no coeliac-specific HLA markers. Four (3%) patients were diagnosed with CD. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of paediatric patients with T1D has positive coeliac-specific HLA genotypes DQ2 and/or DQ8. Therefore, genotyping for coeliac-specific HLA alleles as a first-line test in patients with T1D as recommended in the ESPGHAN guidelines does not seem reasonable. Screening for coeliac-specific antibodies needs to be performed on a regular basis for patients with T1D.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Law 123/2005 recognizes celiac disease as a social disease and so Ministry of Public Health annually allocates specific resources to Regions for managing gluten-free meals in school canteens. Therefore in 2009 Piedmont Region approved a specific project, in collaboration with Food Hygiene and Nutrition Department (SIAN) of several ASL (Local Health Authority), including ASL TO3 as regional leader, and the "Italian Celiac Association - Piedmont and Valle d'Aosta". This project was intended to facilitate the natural integration of celiac people in social life. A retrospective analysis of data has been carried out to assess the management of gluten- free meal of school food services in Piedmont Region in 2010. Furthermore the intervention efficacy has been evaluated comparing the critical points observed in 2010 and 2012. METHODS: The object of the study includes primary and secondary schools that have provided gluten-free food service in Piedmont Region. These school were examined by SIAN staff. (the examination included the check of hygienic aspects and qualitative assessment of the meal). The data were collected using the same checklist throughout the region. All data were included in the unified regional system ("Reteunitaria"). RESULTS: The results show that 29% of the sampled schools (277) are acceptable in all eight sections (supply, storage, process analysis, equipment check, packaging and transport, distribution of meals, self-control plan and qualitative assessment), whereas 71% are inadequate for at least one of the profiles (60% does not perform the qualitative valuation of service) and in 18% of schools three to seven insufficiencies are observed. Correlations between the number of total insufficiencies and the most critical sections of the check list were performed (with lower scores in "good") such as process analysis, distribution of meals, self-control plan and qualitative assessment. The analysis process has achieved a high score in the field of deficiency for at least 3 parameters. Schools with a good self-control plan have a significant correlation with schools suitable for the analysis process, instead schools appeared insufficient in the process analysis have an increased chance of being insufficient also in the distribution of meals. The schools that provide a transported meal (municipalities highly populated, generally) have many differences in distribution of meals respect schools that prepare food in the school kitchen. In fact, 88% of school that provide a transported meal achieved an appropriate score in distribution of meals section and collected fewer failures in overall assessment than the others. 120 structures are included in the indirect comparison between the checklist's sections with criticisms, during years 2010 and 2012: in 2010 32% of schools were recorded acceptable in all of the eight sections of the checklist and in 2012 this percentage rose to 54%. An improvement can be observed in all areas, but a statistical significant result do not turn out. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Data show that carry on the control activities of production of gluten free meal in school canteens would be appropriate. Actions focused on improving the methods of preparing meal without gluten were recommended, especially in under populated municipalities with school kitchen on site. The constant presence of ASL staff in school has promoted important changes: cultural change and about the management of allergy and food intolerance. An improvement can be observed: a transition from a suspicion about "special diet" management to an appropriate and responsible management of meals for children and young people suffering from this specific condition.},

FC was measured in 232 children; 55 children (n = 11 treatment naive) with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), 63 with coeliac disease (CD); 17 with new diagnosis before and after treatment on gluten-free diet and 114 controls. None of the treatment-naive children with JIA had raised FC. Four JIA patients on treatment had a raised FC but in all cases a repeat test was normal. In newly diagnosed patients with CD, the median (interquartile range) FC was higher 36.4 (26-61) than that in controls 25.0 (23-41) mg/kg (P = 0.045) but this significantly decreased 25 (25-25) mg/kg (P = 0.012) after 6 months on gluten-free diet. Random measurements of FC are not raised in children with JIA or CD. A significant elevation of FC in these groups is not explained by their diagnosis and therefore needs further investigation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is associated with tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGAs) in individuals carrying the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) risk haplotypes DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01 (DQ2) and/or DQA1*03:01-DQB1*03:02 (DQ8). The aim of the study was to identify CD in an HLA-genotyped birth cohort prospectively screened for CD. METHODS: In the initial screening, 13,860 HLA-DQ-genotyped children were invited, of whom 3435/13,860 (25%) accepted participation. Of the 3435, 1620 (47%) carried DQ2 and/or DQ8, of whom 73 (4.5%) were tTGA positive assessed in radioligand-binding assays and 56 (3.5%) developed CD. At age 9 years, 13,024 children from the original cohort were re-invited to follow-up screening using the same study protocol and tTGA assays as in the first screening. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by intestinal biopsy in children with persistent tTGA. RESULTS: In the follow-up screening, 1910/4077 (46.8%) carried DQ2 and/or DQ8, of whom 79/1910 (4.1%) were persistently tTGA positive and 72/1907 (3.8%) developed CD. Only 1/2167 (0.05%) child without HLA risk was IgG-tTGA positive, but did not have CD. Of the 980/1910 (51%) children carrying DQ2 and/or DQ8 who were already screened at 3 years of age, 30/979 (3.1%) were diagnosed as new patients at 9 years of age, compared with 42/928 (4.5%) children who did not participate in the initial screening (P = 0.094). CONCLUSIONS: Screening for CD can be restricted to children carrying HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8. Repeated screening using tTGA is necessary to identify new patients by 9 years of age. These findings may be relevant when considering implementing screening of the general population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dermatological manifestations associated with intestinal diseases are becoming more frequent, especially now when new clinical entities, such as Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS), are identified. The existence of this new entity is still debated. However, many patients with diagnosed NCGS that present intestinal manifestations have skin lesions that need appropriate characterization. METHODS: We involved 17 patients affected by NCGS with non-specific cutaneous manifestations who got much better after a gluten free diet. For a histopathological and immunopathological evaluation, two skin samples from each patient and their clinical data were collected. RESULTS: The median age of the 17 enrolled patients affected by NCGS was 36 years and 76% of them were females. On the extensor surfaces of upper and lower limbs in particular, they all presented very itchy dermatological manifestations morphologically similar to eczema, psoriasis or dermatitis herpetiformis. This similarity was also confirmed histologically, but the immunopathological analysis showed the prevalence of deposits of C3 along the dermo-epidermal junction with a microgranular/granular pattern (82%). CONCLUSIONS: The exact characterization of new clinical entities such as Cutaneous Gluten Sensitivity and NCGS is an important objective both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, since these are patients who actually benefit from a GFD (Gluten Free Diet) and who do not adopt it only for fashion.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the most commonly adopted special diet worldwide. It is an effective treatment for coeliac disease and is also often followed by individuals to alleviate gastrointestinal complaints. It is known there is an important link between diet and the gut microbiome, but it is largely unknown how a switch to a GFD affects the human gut microbiome. METHODS: We studied changes in the gut microbiomes of 21 healthy volunteers who followed a GFD for four weeks. We collected nine stool samples from each participant: one at baseline, four during the GFD period, and four when they returned to their habitual diet (HD), making a total of 189 samples. We determined microbiome profiles using 16S rRNA sequencing and then processed the samples for taxonomic and imputed functional composition. Additionally, in all 189 samples, six gut health-related biomarkers were measured. RESULTS: Inter-individual variation in the gut microbiota remained stable during this short-term GFD intervention. A number of taxon-specific differences were seen during the GFD: the most striking shift was seen for the family Veillonellaceae (class Clostridia), which was significantly reduced during the intervention (p = 2.81 x 10(-05)). Seven other taxa also showed significant changes; the majority of them are known to play a role in starch metabolism. We saw stronger differences in pathway activities: 21 predicted pathway activity scores showed significant association to the change in diet. We observed strong relations between the predicted activity of pathways and biomarker measurements. CONCLUSIONS: A GFD changes the gut microbiome composition and alters the activity of microbial pathways.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has gained attention as an emerging clinical entity. Data regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management of NCGS are scattered in view of the diagnostic uncertainty surrounding the disorder. We aim to provide a current perspective of NCGS and its associated controversies. RECENT FINDINGS: NCGS consists of a spectrum of intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, yet in the absence of coeliac disease or wheat allergy. To date, no specific biomarker exists for NCGS, thereby leaving the diagnosis to be confirmed by dietary elimination followed by double-blind placebo-controlled gluten-based rechallenges. Unfortunately, this technique is cumbersome, not readily-available in routine clinical practise, and can still leave the diagnosis of NCGS open to debate as to whether the effects demonstrated can be specifically attributed to the gluten-protein per se or rather coexisting nongluten components, such as fermentable carbohydrates and amylase-trypsin inhibitors. SUMMARY: Physicians are increasingly being posed with the dilemma of patients presenting with self-reported NCGS. However, this appears to be the tip of the iceberg and future studies are in need of delineating which gluten-based component is responsible for each individual patient's complaint.},

   abstract = {Perhaps because gastroenterology, immunology, toxicology, and the nutrition and agricultural sciences are outside of their competence and responsibility, psychologists and psychiatrists typically fail to appreciate the impact that food can have on their patients' condition. Here we attempt to help correct this situation by reviewing, in non-technical, plain English, how cereal grains-the world's most abundant food source-can affect human behavior and mental health. We present the implications for the psychological sciences of the findings that, in all of us, bread (1) makes the gut more permeable and can thus encourage the migration of food particles to sites where they are not expected, prompting the immune system to attack both these particles and brain-relevant substances that resemble them, and (2) releases opioid-like compounds, capable of causing mental derangement if they make it to the brain. A grain-free diet, although difficult to maintain (especially for those that need it the most), could improve the mental health of many and be a complete cure for others.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease, and both adaptive and innate immunity are involved in its development. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine whether the markers of intestinal mucosal inflammation in CD can be detected in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs), and whether the immune properties of PBMs change as the clinical signs and symptoms of CD improve after the introduction of a gluten-free diet (GFD). The focus was on changes in mRNA expression of selected toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4, TLR7), stress cytokine prolactin (PRL), and proand anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-12, IL-10) in PBMs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 20 CD patients diagnosed according to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition criteria and Marsh criteria: 10 recently-diagnosed cases (rCD) and 10 on a GFD for a minimum of one year. The control group comprised 10 ageand sex-matched healthy volunteers. PBMs from peripheral blood specimens were separated using immunomagnetic CD14+ beads. Total RNA was isolated using a standard commercial kit. Cytokine and TLR mRNA levels were quantified by relative qPCR with PGK1 as a reference gene. RESULTS: Significantly higher expression of TLR4 and TLR7 mRNA was observed in PBMs from rCD patients compared to the healthy controls (1.63 times higher; p < 0.05). TLR7 mRNA levels in rCDs were also significantly elevated in comparison to the CD-GFD patients (2.11 times higher; p < 0.01). TNF-alpha mRNA expression tended to be higher in both groups of patients; by contrast, in IL-6 mRNA, a trend to a fourfold decrease was detected in PBMs from the CD-GFD subjects. IL-10, IL-12 and PRL levels did not differ among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the inflammatory process in rCD intestinal mucosa and submucosa reflecting enterocyte damage can be detected in PBMs in peripheral blood. Further, the cytokine and TLR expression profile in PBMs alters after one year of GFD treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Celiac disease is a hypersensitivity enteropathy that can have various presentations in adults. Rarely, patients can present with severe lab abnormalities, dehydration and weight loss caused by celiac disease - a celiac crisis. CASE REPORT A 46-year-old male with a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus, type 2 (DM2) and recently treated Bell's Palsy presented to the emergency room complaining of weakness, diarrhea and lightheadedness. On presentation, the patient had a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 60 mm Hg and a lactic acidosis with pH of 7.28. Infectious etiologies of diarrhea were ruled out. The patient had an EGD which showed erythema of the duodenal bulb. Serum anti-gliadin and anti-TTG IgA were both elevated suggesting Celiac disease. Biopsies showed histopathology consistent with celiac disease. The patient's diarrhea resolved after initiation of a gluten free diet. He gained 25 kilograms after discharge and did not require further hospitalizations for diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS Celiac crisis is a very rare presentation of celiac disease in adults but nonetheless should be considered in patients with marked metabolic derangements in the setting of osmotic diarrhea. Treatment consists of a gluten free diet and may require management with steroids and total parenteral nutrition (TPN).},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an intestinal disease which shows different symptoms and clinical manifestations among pediatric and adult patients. These variations could be imputable to age-related changes in gut architecture and intestinal immune system, which could be characterized by gene expression differences possibly regulated by miRNAs. We analyzed a panel of miRNAs and their target genes in duodenal biopsies of Marsh 3AB and 3C pediatric celiac patients, compared to controls. Moreover, to assess variation of expression in plasma samples, we evaluated circulating miRNA levels in controls and patients at diagnosis or on gluten-free diet. We detected a decreased miR-192-5p expression in celiac patients, but no variations in NOD2 and CXCL2, targets previously identified in adults. Conversely, we detected a significant increase in mRNA and protein levels of another target, MAD2L1, protein related to cell cycle control. miR-31-5p and miR-338-3p were down-regulated and their respective targets, FOXP3 and RUNX1, involved in Treg function, resulted up-regulated in celiac patients. Finally, we detected, in celiac patients, an increased expression of miR-21-5p, possibly caused by a regulatory loop with its putative target STAT3, which showed an increased activation in Marsh 3C patients. The analysis of plasma revealed a trend similar to that observed in biopsies, but in presence of gluten-free diet we could not detect circulating miRNAs values comparable to controls. miRNAs and their gene targets showed an altered expression in duodenal mucosa and plasma of celiac disease pediatric patients, and these alterations could be different from adult ones.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gluten-free diet is the keystone of coeliac disease treatment. Despite adherence, some patients continue to suffer from symptoms that negatively influence health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Therefore we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of gluten-free diet on HRQoL in coeliac disease. We specifically sought for determinants that negatively influenced HRQoL. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library for studies assessing HRQoL in untreated or treated adults using validated HRQoL-questionnaires from 1960 to September 2015, comparing HRQoL: (1) before and after gluten-free diet initiation or (2) in patients and non-coeliac controls. RESULTS: We included eighteen studies and sixteen were suitable for meta-analysis. Gluten-free diet significantly improves HRQoL, for psychological general well-being (PGWB)-Total (mean difference (MD) 7.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.96; 12.72]; p = 0.008), SF-36 Mental Component Score (MCS) (MD 7.37, 95% CI [1.84; 12.90]; p = 0.009) and SF-36 Physical Component Score (PCS) (MD 5.72, 95% CI [1.50; 9.95]; p = 0.008). Treated patients had similar HRQoL compared with controls for PGWB-Total (MD -0.72, 95% CI [-2.71; 1.27]; p = 0.48), but significantly lower levels for SF-36 MCS (MD -4.09, 95% CI [-6.17; -2.01]; p = 0.0001) and PCS (MD -4.57, 95% CI [-6.97; -2.17]; p = 0.0002). Symptom-detected gluten-free diet adhering patients have lower HRQoL compared with screening-detected patients (MD -3.73, 95% CI [-6.77;-0.69]; p = 0.02) Strict adhering patients have better HRQoL compared with non-strict adhering patients for SF-36 MCS (MD 7.70, 95% CI [4.61; 10.79]; p < 0.00001) and for SF-36 PCS (MD 3.23, 95% CI [1.33; 5.14]; p = 0.0009). CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-free diet significantly improves but does not normalize HRQoL in adults with coeliac disease. Dietary adherence improves HRQoL. Better (self-reported) dietary adherence results in higher HRQoL.},

   abstract = {Background. Celiac disease seems to be rare in Colombians, but there are currently no data about the prevalence rates of symptomatic adverse reactions to gluten or adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) in this population. Aim. to evaluate the self-reported prevalence rates of adverse reactions to gluten, adherence to GFD, and gluten-related disorders at population level in Colombia. Methods. A self-administered questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted in a population from Northwest Colombia. Results. The estimated prevalence rates were (95% CI) 7.9% (6.5-9.6) and 5.3% (4.1-6.7) for adverse and recurrent adverse reactions to wheat/gluten, respectively, adherence to GFD 5.9% (4.7-7.4), wheat allergy 0.74% (0.3-1.4), and nonceliac gluten sensitivity 4.5% (3.5-5.8). There were no self-reported cases of celiac disease. Prevalence of self-reported physician-diagnosis of gluten-related disorders was 0.41% (0.17-0.96). Most respondents reported adherence to GFD without a physician-diagnosis of gluten-related disorders (97.2%). The proportion of gluten avoiders was 17.2% (15.2-19.5). Most of them did not report recurrent adverse reactions to wheat/gluten (87.0%). Conclusions. Nonceliac gluten sensitivity is rarely formally diagnosed in Colombia, but this population has the highest prevalence rate of adherence to GFD reported to date. Consequently, most respondents were avoiding wheat- and/or gluten-based products for reasons other than health-related symptoms.},

   abstract = {This review focuses key advances in different pediatric fields that were published in Italian Journal of Pediatrics and in international journals in 2015. Weaning studies continue to show promise for preventing food allergy. New diagnostic tools are available for identifying the allergic origin of allergic-like symptoms. Advances have been reported in obesity, short stature and autoimmune endocrine disorders. New molecules are offered to reduce weight gain and insulin-resistance in obese children. Regional investigations may provide suggestions for preventing short stature. Epidemiological studies have evidenced the high incidence of Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in patients with Down syndrome. Documentation of novel risk factors for celiac disease are of use to develop strategies for prevention in the population at-risk. Diagnostic criteria for non-celiac gluten sensitivity have been reported. Negative effect on nervous system development of the supernumerary X chromosome in Klinefelter syndrome has emerged. Improvements have been made in understanding rare diseases such as Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Eltrombopag is an effective therapy for immune trombocytopenia. Children with sickle-cell anemia are at risk for nocturnal enuresis. Invasive diseases caused by Streptococcus pyogenes are still common despite of vaccination. No difference in frequency of antibiotic prescriptions for acute otitis media between before the publication of the national guideline and after has been found. The importance of timing of iron administration in low birth weight infants, the effect of probiotics for preventing necrotising enterocolitis and perspectives for managing jaundice and cholestasis in neonates have been highlighted. New strategies have been developed to reduce the risk for relapse in nephrotic syndrome including prednisolone during upper respiratory infection. Insights into the pathophysiology of cerebral palsy, arterial ischemic stroke and acute encephalitis may drive advances in treatment. Recommendations on breastfeeding and complementary feeding have been updated. Novel treatments for rhabdomyosarcoma should be considered for paediatric patients. Control of risk factors for bronchiolitis and administration of pavilizumab for preventing respiratory syncytial virus infection may reduce hospitalization. Identification of risk factors for hospitalization in children with wheezing can improve the management of this disease. Deletions or mutations in genes encoding proteins for surfactant function may cause diffuse lung disease.},

The association of these two disorders has not been evaluated properly. We analyzed the prevalence and outcome of CD in children with CC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included children with CC (n = 313) and healthy children (n = 990). Serum IgA and IgA antitissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA-tTG) were studied in all subjects. Intestinal biopsy and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 typing was performed in subjects with elevated IgA-tTG. RESULTS: Serology was positive in 8 children (2.5%) with CC and 6 children (0.6%) from the control group (P < 0.05). Histopathological examination revealed total villous atrophy in two subjects in the control group. Other subjects had Marsh 0-1 lesions. All patients with CC and 4 children from the control group were classified as having potential CD. Two children in the control group had silent CD. Spontaneous loss of serum tTG-IgA occured in 75% of the subjects with potential CD at the end of the 1st year. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that serological evaluation CD may be omitted in children with CC at initial examination. It may be perform in selected patients such as those associated with prolonged symptoms or malnutrition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical complications in multivisceral transplantation (MVT) are frequent and always severe. Those related to technical issues are relevant as they have implications not only on the graft but also on patient survival. The aim of this study was to review our case-based data and experience with 5 MVT performed since December 2004. CASE REPORT: A 38 year-old woman presented with ultra-short bowel syndrome due to massive ischemia also affecting the celiac trunk. She also had moderate to severe hepatitis/steatosis with some degree of fibrosis on liver biopsy, due to long-term home parenteral nutrition (HPN). An MVT was carried out in September 2010 including the liver, stomach, pancreatoduodenal complex with the spleen, and small bowel. The postoperative course was complicated by a leak from the pyloromiotomy, requiring reoperation on postoperative day 13. She also had central line catheter infection and renal impairment, requiring renal replacement therapy, and was discharged on postoperative day 150. Fifteen days later she was hospitalized because of severe abdominal pain associated with an abdominal mass. Computed tomography showed an aortic donor graft pseudoaneurysm, so we decided to operate on the patient. A complete resection of the pseudoaneurysm using an interposed polytetrafluoroethylene graft was performed. Six months after the MVT, the patient died due to sepsis, despite a functional graft and complete digestive autonomy. CONCLUSIONS: Although this complication is rare, surgical complications in MVT are severe and may seriously impair graft and patient survival.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy resulting from exposure to gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Gluten proteins are partially digested by human proteases generating immunogenic peptides that cause inflammation in patients carrying HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 genes. Although intestinal dysbiosis has been associated with patients with CD, bacterial metabolism of gluten has not been studied in depth thus far. The aim of this study was to analyse the metabolic activity of intestinal bacteria associated with gluten intake in healthy individuals, CD patients and first-degree relatives of CD patients. Faecal samples belonging to twenty-two untreated CD patients, twenty treated CD patients, sixteen healthy volunteers on normal diet, eleven healthy volunteers on gluten-free diet (GFD), seventy-one relatives of CD patients on normal diet and sixty-nine relatives on GFD were tested for several proteolytic activities, cultivable bacteria involved in gluten metabolism, SCFA and the amount of gluten in faeces. We detected faecal peptidasic activity against the gluten-derived peptide 33-mer. CD patients showed differences in faecal glutenasic activity (FGA), faecal tryptic activity (FTA), SCFA and faecal gluten content with respect to healthy volunteers. Alterations in specific bacterial groups metabolising gluten such as Clostridium or Lactobacillus were reported in CD patients. Relatives showed similar parameters to CD patients (SCFA) and healthy volunteers (FTA and FGA). Our data support the fact that commensal microbial activity is an important factor in the metabolism of gluten proteins and that this activity is altered in CD patients.},

   abstract = {The aim of the paper is to show the various neurological and psychiatric symptoms in coeliac disease (CD). CD is a T cell-mediated, tissue-specific autoimmune disease which affects genetically susceptible individuals after dietary exposure to proline- and glutamine-rich proteins contained in certain cereal grains. Genetics, environmental factors and different immune systems, together with the presence of auto-antigens, are taken into account when identifying the pathogenesis of CD. CD pathogenesis is related to immune dysregulation, which involves the gastrointestinal system, and the extra-intestinal systems such as the nervous system, whose neurological symptoms are evidenced in CD patients. A gluten-free diet (GFD) could avoid cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, neuropathies, migraine and mild cognitive impairment. Furthermore, untreated CD patients have more symptoms and psychiatric co-morbidities than those treated with a GFD. Common psychiatric symptoms in untreated CD adult patients include depression, apathy, anxiety, and irritability and schizophrenia is also common in untreated CD. Several studies show improvement in psychiatric symptoms after the start of a GFD. The present review discusses the state of the art regarding neurological and psychiatric complications in CD and highlights the evidence supporting a role for GFD in reducing neurological and psychiatric complications.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic disorder induced by a trigger factor in genetically susceptible individuals. There is emerging evidence about the impact of the month of birth on the development of several autoimmune diseases. Our aim was to investigate whether, in Italian CD children, the season of birth is associated with development of CD later in life. We report a survey conducted at two Italian referral centers for CD in Rome and Bari. The CD database was created to enable retrospective examination of the data of all the consecutive patients, born between 2003 and 2010, who had received a diagnosis of CD. This CD patient group comprising 596 children was compared with a reference group that included all subjects born in the same period and in the same cities (439,990 controls). Overall, there was a summer birth preponderance in CD patients compared to controls (28.2 % of CD patients vs 23.0 % of the control population; OR 1.315; 95 % CI 1.100 to 1.572). Stratifying the caseload by gender and age, the summer birth preponderance was maintained for females (28.6 % CD females vs 22.6 % control females; OR 1.368; 95 % CI 1.069 to 1.750). CONCLUSIONS: our survey confirms that in Italy, children born in summer are at higher risk to develop CD than subjects born in other seasons. The identification of a responsible seasonal factor or factors, such as timing of the first introduction of gluten and/or acute viral gastrointestinal infections, would be very important for disease prevention strategies. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Environmental factors could be involved in the pathogenesis of CD. * Data about the impact of season of birth on CD development is so far derived from North American, Northern European and Israeli surveys. WHAT IS NEW: * This is the first study in Southern Europe to find a relationship between season of birth (summer) and development of CD. * Summer-born infants are introduced to complementary feeding (gluten) in winter, when the rotavirus infection is at its highest peak; this may be the link between season of birth and development of CD.},

   abstract = {We describe the nutritional status of a cohort of celiac disease (CD) children at presentation and during follow-up on gluten-free diet (GFD). Two Italian centers (Rome and Bari) prospectively enrolled 445 biopsy-confirmed CD children, diagnosed between 2009 and 2013. Body Mass Index was used as a measure of nutritional status according to Italian growth charts of Cacciari. The overweight/obese subject was 7.8% at onset and did not significantly increase during follow-up (9.8% at final assessment). The prevalence of overweight/obesity was significantly higher among males than females. Furthermore, overweight/obesity children as compared with those with normal weight were significantly older and had significantly lower levels of tTG antibodies. This study shows that some CD children are obese/overweight at diagnosis; therefore, overweight/obesity can be considered a rare but a possible mode of CD presentation. Thus, CD diagnosis must be considered even in overweight/obese children where this diagnosis can be easily missed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the recent incidence of T1D in a US Midwestern county to determine whether this increase has been sustained and compare it with the incidence of celiac disease (CD) and also investigate the prevalence of CD, an associated autoimmune disease, within the cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A broad search strategy was used to identify all incident cases of T1D in Olmsted County, Minnesota, between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 2010, using the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Diagnosis and residency status were confirmed through the medical record. Incidence rates were directly standardized to the 2010 US population. Poisson regression was used to test for a change in incidence rate. Clinical charts were reviewed to confirm case status. RESULTS: There were 233 incident cases of T1D. Directly adjusting for age and sex with respect to the 2010 US white population, the overall annual incidence of T1D was 9.2 (95% CI, 8.0-10.4) per 100,000 people per year among all ages and 19.9 (95% CI, 16.6-23.2) per 100,000 people per year for those younger than 20 years. There was no significant increase in the incidence of T1D over time (P=.45). Despite the overall stability in annual incidence, there was an initial increasing trend followed by a plateau. Of the 109 patients with T1D (47%) tested for CD, 12% (13) had biopsy-proven CD. CONCLUSION: The incidence of T1D has stopped increasing in Olmsted County, Minnesota, in the most recent decade. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding and explore reasons for this plateau.},

   abstract = {The association between gluten related disorders and psychiatric diseases has been firmly demonstrated. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome diagnosed in patients responsive to gluten-free diet after ruling out celiac disease and wheat allergy. The pathogenesis of neuro-psychiatric disorders in NCGS is unclear. An association between gluten and schizophrenia was described for the first time in 1950 by Bender et al. In the 1950's, Dicke noted that gluten-free diet improved mood in celiac patients. In 1970, Goldberg et al., in a study of 80 celiac patients, found that 34% of them showed minor affective disorders. Bipolar disorder patients show an increase of blood anti gliadin deamidated antibodies (IgG). The effect of diet and nutrition on autistic spectrum disorders has been investigated in the last two decades, particularly focusing on the symptoms of hyperactivity and attention. Toxoplasma gondii and other neurotropic pathogens as Influenzavirus and Coronavirus may be associated with mood disorders, probably secondary to an increased intestinal permeability. Abnormalities of host-microbiota interactions or of gut-microbiota composition have been associated with central nervous system disorders, such as autism, anxiety, depression and the integrity of intestinal microbiota may be considered a potential therapeutic goal to treat these conditions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Guidelines recommend routine screening of liver function tests (LFTs) in patients diagnosed with celiac disease (CD). However, little is known about the prevalence of liver disorders in CD outside of Europe. Our aims were to estimate the prevalence of LFT abnormalities in CD and to evaluate the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on LFTs. METHODS: Adult patients with biopsy-proven CD were identified from a prospectively maintained database and matched with healthy controls. LFT levels for women and men were defined as abnormal based on the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) criteria. Data on demographics, coexisting liver diseases, and laboratory work-ups including aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) values at the time of diagnosis and on a GFD were recorded. Subsequently, data from this cohort were compared with data from 7,789 individuals participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009-2010. Univariate logistic regression, Wilcoxon signed-ranks, Student's t-test, chi(2), and Fischer's exact test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In 463 CD patients with ALT or AST levels at the time of CD diagnosis, 40.6% had elevated LFTs compared with 24.2% of treated CD patients (P<0.001) and 16.6% of matched controls (P<0.001). Similarly, 36.7% of CD patients on the NHANES database had abnormal ALT values compared with 19.3% of non-celiac patients (P=0.03). Approximately, 78.6% of CD patients with elevated LFTs at diagnosis normalized LFTs on a GFD after a mean duration of 1.5+/-1.5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Forty percent of individuals will have elevated LFTs at CD diagnosis; however, the majority will normalize with standard CD therapy. LFTs should be checked in all patients with CD and coexisting liver disorder should be considered in patients whose LFTs have not improved within a year on a GFD.},

   abstract = {Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in subjects who are not affected by either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). The prevalence of NCGS is not clearly defined yet. Indirect evidence suggests that NCGS is slightly more common than CD, the latter affecting around 1% of the general population. NCGS has been mostly described in adults, particularly in females in the age group of 30-50 years; however, pediatric case series have also been reported. Since NCGS may be transient, gluten tolerance needs to be reassessed over time in patients with NCGS. NCGS is characterized by symptoms that usually occur soon after gluten ingestion, disappear with gluten withdrawal, and relapse following gluten challenge within hours/days. The 'classical' presentation of NCGS is a combination of irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, bowel habit abnormalities (either diarrhea or constipation), and systemic manifestations such as 'foggy mind', headache, fatigue, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, dermatitis (eczema or skin rash), depression, and anemia. In recent years, several studies explored the relationship between the ingestion of gluten-containing food and the appearance of neurological and psychiatric disorders/symptoms like ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, schizophrenia, autism, depression, anxiety, and hallucinations (so-called gluten psychosis). The diagnosis of NCGS should be considered in patients with persistent intestinal and/or extraintestinal complaints showing a normal result of the CD and WA serological markers on a gluten-containing diet, usually reporting worsening of symptoms after eating gluten-rich food. NCGS should not be an exclusion diagnosis only. Unfortunately, no biomarker is sensitive and specific enough for diagnostic purposes; therefore, the diagnosis of NCGS is currently based on establishing a clear-cut cause-effect relationship between the ingestion of gluten and the appearance of symptoms by a standardized double-blind, placebo-controlled gluten challenge.},

Given the lack of a NCGS biomarker, there is the need for standardizing the procedure leading to the diagnosis confirmation. In this paper we report experts' recommendations on how the diagnostic protocol should be performed for the confirmation of NCGS. A full diagnostic procedure should assess the clinical response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) and measure the effect of a gluten challenge after a period of treatment with the GFD. The clinical evaluation is performed using a self-administered instrument incorporating a modified version of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. The patient identifies one to three main symptoms that are quantitatively assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale with a score ranging from 1 to 10. The double-blind placebo-controlled gluten challenge (8 g/day) includes a one-week challenge followed by a one-week washout of strict GFD and by the crossover to the second one-week challenge. The vehicle should contain cooked, homogeneously distributed gluten. At least a variation of 30% of one to three main symptoms between the gluten and the placebo challenge should be detected to discriminate a positive from a negative result. The guidelines provided in this paper will help the clinician to reach a firm and positive diagnosis of NCGS and facilitate the comparisons of different studies, if adopted internationally.},

Doctors are going to play a major role as they are being called on to adapt their practices to confront it. In particular, nutrition seems to be at the core of obesity in children. The ascending trend of this phenomenon in pediatric age, with inherent healthcare implications, was already reported in epidemiological studies of the mid '90s. Public health programs of primary prevention should be stimulated and recommended, with the aim of promoting diet and lifestyle changes in the general population. In addition, accurate anthropometric measurements should be performed for use by pediatricians, who should focus efforts on preventing obesity during infancy and childhood. Nutrition plays such a pivotal role that it may be considered a valuable treatment strategy for multiple pediatric conditions, including celiac disease, Crohn's disease, short bowel syndrome, galactosemia, congenital deficiency of urea cycle enzymes. In view of all this, it would be advisable that food science be given higher relevance in medical education.},

Non-IgE-GI-FA have a favorable prognosis, with majority resolving by age 3-5 years. Diagnosis relies on the recognition of symptoms pattern in FPIAP and FPIES and biopsy in FPE. Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the pathomechanism, which will lead eventually to the development of diagnostic tests and treatments. Limited evidence supports the role of food allergens in subsets of constipation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic. The immunologic pathomechanism is not fully understood and empiric prolonged avoidance of food allergens should be limited to minimize nutrient deficiency and feeding disorders/food aversions in infants.},

   abstract = {Gut microbiota shapes the development of the mucosal immune system and may provide protection against immune-mediated diseases. Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition triggered by dietary gluten proteins, recently associated with gut microbiota alterations in cross-sectional studies comparing patients and controls. Whether or not these differences are causally related to the disease has yet to be elucidated, but evaluation of specific bacteria isolated from CD patients in experimental models suggests that they can promote an adverse response to dietary gluten, whereas other commensal bacteria can be protective. Genetic and environmental factors associated with increased CD risk have also been linked to shifts in the gut microbiota composition in infants early in life. Epigenetic mechanisms also seem to play an important role in modulating gut microbiota composition and function and, theoretically, could also influence CD risk. Here, we review the current knowledge on how host genetics, environmental factors, and epigenetic modifications could modulate gut microbiota functionality and how this may influence CD risk. Greater understanding of the role of this triad in CD onset and pathogenesis will be valuable in designing proof-of concept interventions in the gut ecosystem, with a view to improving CD management.},

   abstract = {It is widely recognized that the intestinal microbiota plays a role in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in numerous chronic conditions. Most studies report intestinal dysbiosis in celiac disease (CD) patients, untreated and treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD), compared to healthy controls. CD patients with gastrointestinal symptoms are also known to have a different microbiota compared to patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and controls, suggesting that the microbiota is involved in disease manifestation. Furthermore, a dysbiotic microbiota seems to be associated with persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in treated CD patients, suggesting its pathogenic implication in these particular cases. GFD per se influences gut microbiota composition, and thus constitutes an inevitable confounding factor in studies conducted in CD patients. To improve our understanding of whether intestinal dysbiosis is the cause or consequence of disease, prospective studies in healthy infants at family risk of CD are underway. These studies have revealed that the CD host genotype selects for the early colonizers of the infant's gut, which together with environmental factors (e.g., breast-feeding, antibiotics, etc.) could influence the development of oral tolerance to gluten. Indeed, some CD genes and/or their altered expression play a role in bacterial colonization and sensing. In turn, intestinal dysbiosis could promote an abnormal response to gluten or other environmental CD-promoting factors (e.g., infections) in predisposed individuals. Here, we review the current knowledge of host-microbe interactions and how host genetics/epigenetics and environmental factors shape gut microbiota and may influence disease risk. We also summarize the current knowledge about the potential mechanisms of action of the intestinal microbiota and specific components that affect CD pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {There are more than 50000 known edible plants in the world, yet two-thirds of global plant-derived food is provided by only three major cereals - maize (Zea mays), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa). The dominance of this triad, now considered truly global food commodities, has led to a decline in the number of crop species contributing to global food supplies. Our dependence on only a few crop species limits our capability to deal with challenges posed by the adverse effects of climate change and the consequences of dietary imbalance. Emerging evidence suggests that climate change will cause shifts in crop production and yield loss due to more unpredictable and hostile weather patterns. One solution to this problem is through the wider use of underutilised (also called orphan or minor) crops to diversify agricultural systems and food sources. In addition to being highly nutritious, underutilised crops are resilient in natural and agricultural conditions, making them a suitable surrogate to the major crops. One such crop is teff [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter], a warm-season annual cereal with the tiniest grain in the world. Native to Ethiopia and often the sustenance for local small farmers, teff thrives in both moisture-stressed and waterlogged soil conditions, making it a dependable staple within and beyond its current centre of origin. Today, teff is deemed a healthy wheat alternative in the West and is sought-after by health aficionados and those with coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity. The blooming market for healthy food is breathing new life into this underutilised crop, which has received relatively limited attention from mainstream research perhaps due to its 'orphan crop' status. This review presents the past, present and future of an ancient grain with a potential beyond its size.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disorder caused by ingestion of gluten. When diagnosed, it should be treated with a lifelong, strict gluten-free diet. Early infant feeding practices have been suggested as a means of preventing CD. In the last few decades, observational data have suggested that breastfeeding, especially at the time of introducing gluten into the infant's diet, as well as the time and mode of gluten first being given to a child could prevent or delay the occurrence of CD. As a result, recommendations advised that it is prudent to avoid both early (<4 months) and late (>7 months) introduction of gluten, and to introduce gluten gradually while the infant is still being breastfed, as this may reduce the risk of celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and wheat allergy. Recently, the results of two large randomized trials have shown that breastfeeding in general, breastfeeding during gluten introduction, and early or delayed gluten introduction do not influence the total risk of CD in genetically predisposed individuals. Introducing gluten at 4 versus 6 months in very small amounts, or at 6 versus 12 months, resulted in similar rates of CD in these children. Thus, early feeding practices seem to have no impact on the risk of developing CD during childhood. In children without the genetic predisposition, the age and mode of gluten introduction do not influence the risk anyway.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Racial disparities in the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) and the number of people without CD avoiding gluten (PWAG) in the United States are unknown. We aimed to describe racial differences in the prevalence of CD and PWAG, and evaluate the trends of CD in the noninstitutionalized civilian adult population of the US between 1988 and 2012. METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 1988 to 1994, 1999 to 2004, and 2009 to 2012. Serum samples from the NHANES participants were tested for CD serology, which included IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG IgA) and, if findings were abnormal, for IgA endomysial antibodies. Information about adherence to a gluten-free diet was obtained by means of an interviewer-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: In NHANES 2009-2012, the adjusted prevalence of CD was significantly higher (P<0.0001) among non-Hispanic whites (1.0%) than among non-Hispanic blacks (0.2%) and Hispanics (0.3%), whereas the adjusted prevalence of PWAG was significantly higher (P=0.01) in blacks (1.2%) as compared with Hispanics (0.5%) and whites (0.7%). The seroprevalence of CD in adults aged 50 years and older increased from 0.17% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.33) in 1988-1994 to 0.44% (95% CI 0.24-0.81) in 2009-2012 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of CD increased between 1988 and 2012 and is significantly more common in whites. In addition, a higher proportion of individuals maintaining a gluten-free diet in the absence of a diagnosis of CD are blacks.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the trends in the prevalence of diagnosed celiac disease (CD), undiagnosed CD, and people without celiac disease avoiding gluten (PWAG) in the civilian noninstitutionalized US population from 2009 to 2014. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the occurrence of CD and PWAG in the 2009 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The serum of all participants aged 6 years or older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 2009 to 2014 was tested for CD serology at Mayo Clinic. Participants were interviewed for a diagnosis of CD and the use of a gluten-free diet (GFD). The design effects of the survey and sample weights were incorporated in all statistical analyses. RESULTS: In the US general population, the prevalence of CD did not change significantly from 0.7% (95% CI, 0.6%-0.8%) in 2009 to 2010 to 0.8% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.2%) in 2011 to 2012 to 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.0%) in 2013 to 2014. However, the prevalence of undiagnosed CD decreased from 0.6% in 2009 to 2010 to 0.3% in 2013 to 2014. In contrast, the prevalence of PWAG increased significantly from 0.5% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.9%) in 2009 to 2010 to 1.0% (95% CI, 0.6%-1.4%) in 2011 to 2012 to 1.7% (95% CI, 1.1%-2.4%) in 2013 to 2014 (P=.005 for trend). CONCLUSION: Although the overall prevalence of CD remained stable from 2009 to 2014, the proportion of individuals with CD that is hidden considerably decreased. Moreover, the proportion of individuals without CD but following a GFD increased markedly from 2009 to 2014. Long-term health consequences of a GFD warrant further investigation.},

Height, weight and body composition were measured. An analysis of energy consumption and of the macronutrient distribution of their diet was carried out. Their fulfillment of micronutrient intake recommendations was verified. Participants showed a Body Mass Index of 21.6 +/- 2.4 kg/m2. Energy Intake was slightly lower than the Dietary Reference Intakes. Excessive protein apart from over-consumption of fat was observed. More than three quarters of participants consumed meat in excess. Carbohydrate consumption along with that of fiber was below recommended levels. Vitamin D, iron, and iodine had a low percentage of recommendation compliance. In general, participants followed the recommendations of dairy products and fruit intake whereas vegetable consumption was not enough for the vast majority. We conclude that although the diet of celiac women does not differ much from the diet of general population, some considerations, such as reducing fat and protein consumption and increasing fiber intake, must be taken into account.},

OBJECTIVES: We aim to review the literature on the GFD, the gluten content in naturally gluten-free (GF) and commercially available GF food, standards and legislation concerning the gluten content of foods, and the vitamins and mineral content of a GFD. METHODS: We carried out a PubMed search for the following terms: Gluten, GFD and food, education, vitamins, minerals, calcium, Codex wheat starch and oats. Relevant papers were reviewed and for each topic a consensus among the authors was obtained. CONCLUSION: Patients with CD should avoid gluten and maintain a balanced diet to ensure an adequate intake of nutrients, vitamins, fibre and calcium. A GFD improves symptoms in most patients with CD. The practicalities of this however, are difficult, as (i) many processed foods are contaminated with gluten, (ii) staple GF foods are not widely available, and (iii) the GF substitutes are often expensive. Furthermore, (iv) the restrictions of the diet may adversely affect social interactions and quality of life. The inclusion of oats and wheat starch in the diet remains controversial.},

Based on the regenerative and immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), we investigated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of serial infusions of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs in a 51-year-old woman with type II RCD. Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated, expanded, and characterized following standard protocols. Monitoring of the patient's malabsorption indexes, mucosal architecture, and percentage of aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes was scheduled for the time of enrollment, at each infusion, and after 6 months. Determination of mucosal expression of interleukin (IL)-15 and its receptor was also performed. Expansion of MSCs was feasible, and the patient underwent 4 systemic infusions of 2 x 10(6) MSCs/kg body weight 4 months apart, without adverse effects. During the treatment period, she experienced gradual and durable amelioration of her general condition, with normalization of stool frequency, body mass index, laboratory test results, and mucosal architecture. Remarkably, the expression of IL-15 and its receptor almost completely disappeared. Thus, treatment of RCD with serial MSC infusions seems promising, leading to recovery from the life-threatening condition while blocking the IL-15 pathogenic pathway.},

   abstract = {An old saying states that ''children are not little adults" and this certainly holds true for celiac disease, as there are many peculiar aspects regarding its epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical presentations, associated diseases, and response to treatment in pediatric compared to adult populations, to such an extent that it merits a description of its own. In fact, contrary to the past when it was thought that celiac disease was a disorder predominantly affecting childhood and characterized by a malabsorption syndrome, nowadays it is well recognized that it affects also adult and elderly people with an impressive variability of clinical presentation. In general, the clinical guidelines for diagnosis recommend starting with specific serologic testing in all suspected subjects, including those suffering from extraintestinal related conditions, and performing upper endoscopy with appropriate biopsy sampling of duodenal mucosa in case of positivity. The latter may be omitted in young patients showing high titers of anti-transglutaminase antibodies. The subsequent management of a celiac patient differs substantially depending on the age at diagnosis and should be based on the important consideration that this is a lifelong condition.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence and clinical presentation of celiac disease (CD) in a cohort of children with HLA-DQ2 positive and evaluate the risk factors in the development of CD. METHODS: Between July 2004 and July 2005, parents of all healthy full-term newborns in our hospital were invited to participate. HLA-DQ2 was tested in blood sample of the umbilical cord. A point of contact serological test was performed on children between 2 and 3 years of age. Positive results were confirmed by serum anti-transglutaminase 2 and endomysial antibodies. Children with high autoantibody titers underwent an intestinal biopsy. Children of the cohort diagnosed with CD before the screening study were included. Sex, mode of delivery, breast-feeding duration, and age of gluten introduction were studied. RESULTS: Of 1291 children, 362 were HLA-DQ2 positive and 262 participated in the study. CD was diagnosed in 4.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-6.3). In the whole cohort, 60% had gastrointestinal symptoms, 7% poor weight gain, and 33% were asymptomatic. Five children with potential CD and 6 with CD autoimmunity became negative (42.3%) and are still negative after 5 to 7 years. Female sex was at-risk factor odds ratio 5.7 (95% CI 1.5-20.9), whereas breast-feeding during gluten introduction had a protective effect odds ratio 0.1 (95% CI 0.01-0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of CD in this cohort was 4%, half of whom had digestive symptoms. Because a high proportion of children showed a spontaneous disappearance of antibodies, prevalence studies of CD in young children should be based on intestinal damage so as not to overestimate results.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Symptoms attributed to gluten consumption are frequently reported evoking the need for differentiating nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) from other gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease and wheat allergy. This review discusses diagnostic criteria and research to date on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of NCGS. RECENT FINDINGS: There is recent evidence to support NCGS as a distinct clinical entity. The symptoms attributed to NCGS are nonspecific, overlapping with those reported in patients with celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome. In contrast to celiac disease and wheat allergy, the diagnosis of NCGS is more challenging because there are no specific clinical biomarkers and because the pathogenesis of NCGS is largely not well understood. The pathogenesis of NCGS may reflect alterations in innate immunity to gluten or other components of wheat, may be linked with autoimmunity, or is a result of a reaction to gluten as a fermentable carbohydrate. SUMMARY: NCGS is a newly characterized and evolving clinical entity that requires ruling out other causes of wheat-related or gluten-related gastrointestinal symptoms, including celiac disease and wheat allergy, coupled with double-blind placebo-controlled crossover challenge with gluten.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic immune disorder. We assessed serum levels of adhesion molecules as a marker of endothelial dysfunction in patients with CD at first diagnosis and in those on a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with CD (mean age 6.74 +/- 4.6 years) and 51 age- and sex-matched control patients participated in the present case-controlled, prospective clinical study. Serum levels of vascular adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, endothelial selectin, vascular endothelial cadherin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and homocysteine levels were measured. RESULTS: Average soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (CD vs control group: 1320 +/- 308 vs 1120 +/- 406 ng/mL, P = 0.006), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (336 +/- 99 vs 263 +/- 67 ng/mL, P = 0.025), and soluble endothelial selectin (113.9 +/- 70 vs 76.9 +/- 32 ng/mL, P = 0.007) levels were significantly higher in cases of newly diagnosed CD than in the control group. Soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (1050 +/- 190 ng/mL) and soluble endothelial selectin (68.7 +/- 45 ng/mL) levels in patients with CD, who were fully compliant with a gluten-free diet, were significantly lower than that in those newly diagnosed as having CD (P = 0.003 and P = 0.0012, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that serum adhesion molecule levels are higher in patients with CD. Some of the risks associated with endothelial dysfunction may be related to CD and these risks can be reduced with an appropriate and fully controlled diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oats provide important nutritional and pharmacological properties, although their safety in coeliac patients remains controversial. Previous studies have confirmed that the reactivity of the anti-33-mer monoclonal antibody with different oat varieties is proportional to the immune responses in terms of T-cell proliferation. Although the impact of these varieties on the adaptive response has been studied, the role of the dendritic cells (DC) is still poorly understood. The aim of this study is to characterize different oat fractions and to study their effect on DC from coeliac patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Protein fractions were isolated from oat grains and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Several proteins were characterized in the prolamin fraction using immunological and proteomic tools, and by Nano-LC-MS/MS. These proteins, analogous to alpha- and gamma-gliadin-like, showed reactive sequences to anti-33-mer antibody suggesting their immunogenic potential. That was further confirmed as some of the newly identified oat peptides had a differential stimulatory capacity on circulating DC from coeliac patients compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time, to our knowledge, where newly identified oat peptides have been shown to elicit a differential stimulatory capacity on circulating DC obtained from coeliac patients, potentially identifying immunogenic properties of these oat peptides.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Patients should be followed-up with dietary interviews and serology as CD markers to ensure adherence to the diet. However, none of these methods offer an accurate measure of dietary compliance. Our aim was to evaluate the measurement of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in stools as a marker of GFD adherence in CD patients and compare it with traditional methods of GFD monitoring. METHODS: We performed a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter study including 188 CD patients on GFD and 84 healthy controls. Subjects were given a dietary questionnaire and fecal GIP quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serological anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) IgA and anti-deamidated gliadin peptide (anti-DGP) IgA antibodies were measured simultaneously. RESULTS: Of the 188 celiac patients, 56 (29.8%) had detectable GIP levels in stools. There was significant association between age and GIP in stools that revealed increasing dietary transgressions with advancing age (39.2% in subjects >/=13 years old) and with gender in certain age groups (60% in men >/=13 years old). No association was found between fecal GIP and dietary questionnaire or anti-tTG antibodies. However, association was detected between GIP and anti-DGP antibodies, although 46 of the 53 GIP stool-positive patients were negative for anti-DGP. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of gluten peptides in stools reveals limitations of traditional methods for monitoring GFD in celiac patients. The GIP ELISA enables direct and quantitative assessment of gluten exposure early after ingestion and could aid in the diagnosis and clinical management of nonresponsive CD and refractory CD.

   abstract = {A gluten-free diet is currently the only effective means of treating individuals with celiac disease. Such a diet enables celiac patients to control their symptoms and avoid various complications associated with this condition. However, while the quality of gluten-free foods has significantly improved during recent decades, maintenance of a gluten-free diet does not necessarily ensure adequate nutritional intake. Because oats are an important source of proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals, and fibre, their inclusion in a gluten-free diet might improve the nutritional status of a celiac patient. Although oats are included in the list of gluten-free ingredients specified in European regulations, their safety when consumed by celiac patients remains debatable. Some studies claim that pure oats are safe for most celiac people, and contamination with other cereal sources is the main problem facing people with this disease. However, it is necessary to consider that oats include many varieties, containing various amino acid sequences and showing different immunoreactivities associated with toxic prolamins. As a result, several studies have shown that the immunogenicity of oats varies depending on the cultivar consumed. Thus, it is essential to thoroughly study the variety of oats used in a food ingredient before including it in a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The protein Hwp1, expressed on the pathogenic phase of Candida albicans, presents sequence analogy with the gluten protein gliadin and is also a substrate for transglutaminase. This had led to the suggestion that C. albicans infection (CI) may be a triggering factor for Celiac disease (CeD) onset. We investigated cross-immune reactivity between CeD and CI. METHODS: Serum IgG levels against recombinant Hwp1 and serological markers of CeD were measured in 87 CeD patients, 41 CI patients, and 98 healthy controls (HC). IgA and IgG were also measured in 20 individuals from each of these groups using microchips sensitized with 38 peptides designed from the N-terminal of Hwp1. RESULTS: CI and CeD patients had higher levels of anti-Hwp1 (p=0.0005 and p=0.004) and anti-gliadin (p=0.002 and p=0.0009) antibodies than HC but there was no significant difference between CeD and CI patients. CeD and CI patients had higher levels of anti-transglutaminase IgA than HC (p=0.0001 and p=0.0039). During CI, the increase in anti-Hwp1 paralleled the increase in anti-gliadin antibodies. Microchip analysis showed that CeD patients were more reactive against some Hwp1 peptides than CI patients, and that some deamidated peptides were more reactive than their native analogs. Binding of IgG from CeD patients to Hwp1 peptides was inhibited by gammaIII gliadin peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Humoral cross-reactivity between Hwp1 and gliadin was observed during CeD and CI. Increased reactivity to Hwp1 deamidated peptide suggests that transglutaminase is involved in this interplay. These results support the hypothesis that CI may trigger CeD onset in genetically-susceptible individuals.},

The understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of coeliac disease in HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genetically susceptible individuals has greatly improved during the last decades but so far did not allow to develop curative therapeutics, leaving a long-life gluten free diet as the only treatment option for the patients. In order to bring new therapeutic targets to light and to test the safety and efficacy of putative drugs, animal models recapitulating features of the disease are needed. Here, we will review the existing animal models and the clinical features of coeliac disease they reflect and discuss their relevance for modelling immune pathways that may lead to potential therapeutic approaches.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: precise information on gluten consumption is crucial for specifically studying the impact of gluten introduction and gluten intake in celiac disease development. Our aim was to develop and validate tools (food frequency questionnaires, FFQs) for the assessment of gluten consumption in Spanish children aged 7-36 months. METHODS: a total of 342 children, who attended primary healthcare centers for routine health surveys or La Fe Hospital for minor health problems as well as healthy children (recruited in nurseries and primary schools) participated in this survey. We have developed two different FFQs (one for 7-12 months and other for 13-36 months). For validation, results from two FFQs were compared with results of 2-day food records and also with the gold standard 7-day records. The mean gluten intake obtained by the 2DR vs. FFQ and the 7DR vs. FFQ, were compared using the Bland Altman plot method and also Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. RESULTS: we found a good agreement between our FFQs and the 2DR and 7DR according to the results of both the Bland-Altman plots and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. CONCLUSIONS: our two new FFQs are therefore the only validated questionnaires available to determine gluten consumption in Spanish children. They are user-friendly and offer excellent instruments to assess gluten intake in children up to 36 months of age.},

   abstract = {Different dietary approaches have been attempted for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism, but only three of them have been subjected to clinical trials: education in healthy nutritional habits, supplementation and elimination diets. On the other hand, for multiple reasons, the number of people who adopt vegetarian and gluten-free diets (GFD) increases daily. More recently, a new entity, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), with a still evolving definition and clinical spectrum, has been described. Although, the benefits of GFD are clearly supported in this condition as well as in celiac disease, in the last two decades, GFD has expanded to a wider population. In this review, we will attempt to clarify, according to the existing evidence, which are the myths and facts of these diets.},

   abstract = {Until recently gluten intolerance has been believed to be typical of celiac disease (CD) and wheat allergy (WA). In the last few years, however, several study results have been published that have proved that gluten intolerance can also affect people who do not suffer from any of the above mentioned diseases. The new syndrome has been named non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or gluten sensitivity (GS). It has been included in the new list of gluten-related disorders published in 2012. Researchers believe that NCGS is the most common syndrome of gluten intolerance. This review discusses many aspects of NCGS epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical spectrum, and treatment and current tools to identify patients suffering from CD, WA, and NCGS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the seroprevalence of celiac disease in adolescents from public schools in the city of Salvador, Bahia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with probabilistic sample of 1,213 adolescents, aged 11 to 17 years old, of both genders. The body mass index was used to determine the participants' nutritional status based on the percentiles for age and gender recommended by the World Health Organization. Measurement of the anti-human transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (anti-tTG-IgA) antibody was established as the specific screening test for celiac disease, which involved an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Descriptive analysis was performed using proportions and means (standard deviation). RESULTS: The female gender prevailed in the sample, and most of the participants had normal weights. The anti-tTG-IgA antibody was positive in 6/1,213 (0.49%) adolescents. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of celiac disease was 0.49% in the investigated adolescents. Further studies are necessary to establish the prevalence of celiac disease in this age range.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Describe the overweight frequency (overweight and obesity) and identify the factors associated with this in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) treated at a University Children's Hospital in Rio de Janeiro. METHODS: This is an analytical cross-sectional study, which included patients diagnosed with T1DM who had complete anthropometric data (weight and height) and excluded those using drugs with effect on weight gain, genetic syndromes, celiac disease, hypothyroidism, renal failure and other chronic diseases, and pregnant women. The data collection was referring to the last consultation, and with respect to laboratory tests, the most recent data was collected. The dependent variable was the overweight, defined as Z score >/=1. The independent variables were gender, age, insulin dose, duration of disease, lipid profile, glycated hemoglobin, type of prescribed food planning, and place of residence. A logistic regression model was built for each outcome studied, considering significant associations those with p < 0.05. RESULTS: The study included 195 patients with a mean age of 10.6 (+/-3.8) years, and 49.7 % (n = 97) aged less than 10 years. The overweight frequency was 40 % (n = 78). The age >/=10 years (OR 0.41; 95 % CI 0.20-0.86; p = 0.019) and the dose of insulin/kg ideal weight (OR 3.38; 95 % CI 1:55-7:39; p = 0.002) were considered the variables associated with overweight. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of overweight, which explains strategies for promoting healthy eating habits and changing lifestyle with a focus on children and adolescents with diabetes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severity of villous atrophy in celiac disease (CeD) is the cumulative effect of enterocyte loss and cell regeneration. Gluten-free diet has been shown to benefit even in patients having a positive anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody titre and mild enteropathy. AIM: We explored the balance between mucosal apoptotic enterocyte loss and cell regeneration in mild and advanced enteropathies. METHODS: Duodenal biopsies from patients with mild enteropathy (Marsh grade 0 and 1) (n=26), advanced enteropathy (Marsh grade >/=2) (n=41) and control biopsies (n=12) were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for end-apoptotic markers (M30, H2AX); markers of cell death (perforin, annexin V); and cell proliferation (Ki67). Composite H-scores based on the intensity and distribution of markers were compared. RESULTS: End-apoptotic markers and marker of cell death (perforin) were significantly up-regulated in both mild and advanced enteropathies, in comparison to controls; without any difference between mild and advanced enteropathies. Ki67 labelling index was significantly higher in crypts of mild enteropathy, in comparison to controls, suggesting maintained regenerative activity in the former. CONCLUSIONS: Even in patients with mild enteropathy, the rate of apoptosis is similar to those with advanced enteropathy. These findings suggest the necessity of reviewing the existing practice of not treating patients with mild enteropathy.},

   abstract = {Tissue transglutaminase 2 enzyme plays a diverse role in intracellular and extracellular functioning. Aberrant expression of anti-TG2 antibody has recently been proposed for extraintestinal identification of celiac disease (CeD), but its utility is questionable. To examine whether anti-TG2 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining can be of diagnostic value in identifying extraintestinal involvement in CeD, tissue blocks of patients with IgA nephropathies (IgAN), minimal change disease, membranous glomerulonephritis, membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis, normal kidney, intestinal biopsies from CeD, tropical sprue, nonspecific duodenitis, and inflammatory bowel disease; liver biopsies from patients with chronic hepatitis B and C, acute liver failure (ALF), and CeD-associated liver diseases were retrieved and subjected to IHC staining for anti-tissue transglutaminase 2 enzyme. H-score was calculated by multiplying the area of positivity and stain intensity. Anti-TG2 stain H-scores were almost similar in IgAN and non-IgANs (H-score 6.31+/-3 vs. 7.03+/-2.7); however, H-scores in both of these groups were significantly higher than in normal renal parenchyma (1.6+/-1.5). Only 6.2% patients with IgAN with anti-TG2 immunostain positivity showed a positive anti-tTG antibody serology and villous abnormalities, suggestive of CeD. Intestinal biopsies from patients with CeD, tropical sprue, nonspecific duodenitis, and inflammatory bowel disease also showed high anti-TG2 H-scores, with no statistically significant differences. Liver biopsies from patients with both ALF, as well as chronic liver diseases showed high anti-TG2 H-scores; with highest stain expression in ALF. In conclusion, IHC expression of anti-TG2 stain correlates with both acute and chronic tissue injuries, irrespective of etiology and organ involvement. It is not a reliable marker for diagnosis of CeD.},

   abstract = {The clinical presentation of celiac disease has evolved from chronic diarrhea and malnutrition to mild nutrient insufficiencies. Recently diagnosed adults with celiac disease should be assessed for micronutrient deficiencies because early institution of a gluten-free diet (GFD) prevents morbidity and reduces the incidence of gastrointestinal malignant neoplasms and osteoporosis. In this report, we present the case of a 49-year-old woman of Southeast Asian-Indian descent living in the United States who had folate insufficiency, as manifested by low serum and red blood cell (RBC) folate levels. Further investigation, including serologic testing and intestinal biopsy, confirmed a diagnosis of celiac disease and other nutrient deficiencies. Managing the condition of this patient with folate supplements and implementation of a recommended GFD reversed the folate insufficiency. In conclusion, when serum and/or RBC levels are low in a person of Southeast Asian-Indian descent living in a country with folate fortification of the grain supply, such as the United States, the medical team needs to look for an organic cause, as in our patient, to diagnose and manage celiac disease early and, hopefully, forestall complications.},

In Maternity Hospitals and in Neonatal Units, appropriate organizative interventions should be applied in order to facilitate the beginning of breastfeeding and the use of mother's/human milk.The Italian Pediatric Societies indicate the desiderable goal of around 6 months exclusive breastfeeding if the infant grows properly according to WHO Growth Charts. In principle, complementary feeding should not be anticipated before 6 months as a nutritional strategy pretending to prevent allergy and/or celiac disease. Eventually, long term breastfeeding should be supported meeting mother's desire.},

   abstract = {AIM: Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic immune-mediated enteropathy sustained by gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible subjects. The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) has recently revised the diagnostic criteria, emphasizing the crucial role of serological testing in the diagnosis of this condition. This study was hence aimed to evaluate a new chemiluminescence assay for measuring anti-transglutaminase (tTG) and anti-endomysium (EMA) antibodies in a general population of unselected outpatients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IgA and IgG anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies (Quanta Flash(R) IgA and Quanta Flash(R) IgG tTG, Inova Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA) were measured with the fully-automated BIO-FLASH(R) analyzer (Inova Diagnostics) in serum samples of 727 consecutive patients without a diagnosis of CD. Data were compared with those of anti-endomysium antibody (EmA) obtained in the same population. RESULTS: A total of 96.4% samples display a negative concordance (anti-tTG negative and EMA negative), O% were positive for EMA and negative for anti-tTG IgA and IgG, 3.6% were both positive for tTG IgA and EMA, whereas 0.6% displayed discordant results (positive for anti-tTG and negative for EMA). The concordance (99%) and inter-rater agreement (Kappa Statistics, 0.943; p<0.001) between anti-tTG IgA and EmA antibodies were excellent, with sensitivity and specificity of 99% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that Quanta Flash(R) IgA assay alone may be regarded as a reliable approach for screening of CD, with no need to perform EMA detection.},

   abstract = {The question about recommending pure, noncontaminated oats as part of the gluten-free diet of patients with celiac disease remains controversial. This might be due to gluten cross contamination and to the possible immunogenicity of some oat cultivars. In view of this controversy, a review of the scientific literature was conducted to highlight the latest findings published between 2008 and 2014 to examine the current knowledge on oats safety and celiac disease in Europe and North America. Results showed that regular oats consumed in Canada are largely contaminated. Overall, the consumption of pure oats has been generally considered to be safe for adults and children. However, it appears that some oat cultivars may trigger an immune response in sensitive individuals. Therefore, further long-term studies on the impact of consumption of oats identifying the cultivar(s) constitute an important step forward for drawing final recommendations. Furthermore, a closer and more accurate monitoring of the dietary intake of noncontaminated oats would be paramount to better determine what its actual contribution in the gluten-free diet of adults and children with celiac disease are in order to draw sound recommendations on the safety of pure oats as part of the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {The association between celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune condition involving intestinal inflammation related to gluten ingestion, and type 1 diabetes has long been recognized. CD prevalence rates 4 to 6 times greater in adults with type 1 diabetes than in the general population. Much of the existing literature focuses on important implications related to the impact of a gluten-free diet on short-term outcomes in metabolic control and quality of life. Canadian Diabetes Association guidelines recommend targeted CD screening in patients with type 1 diabetes who have classic symptoms, such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, unexplained weight loss or labile metabolic control; however, a significant proportion (40% to 60%) of patients may have mild or absent symptoms. Recent evidence suggests that adult patients with both conditions are at higher risk for diabetes microvascular comorbidities, increased mortality and impaired bone health if the CD is untreated. The purpose of this review is to describe the association between CD and type 1 diabetes and to summarize recent literature that evaluates risks in patients with both conditions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and stroke, but the mechanisms are unclear. Continuous measurement of thrombin generation in plasma is a feasible way to detect hypercoagulable changes. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate thrombin generation in pediatric patients with CD compared with pediatric controls. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 19 pediatric patients with CD and 20 healthy controls. In each patient diagnosed as having CD, thrombin generation was determined twice by means of calibrated automated thrombography. The first measurement was undertaken when CD was diagnosed; the second measurement was undertaken after normalization of their IgA antitissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG-Ab) titers following a gluten-free diet. In the controls, measurement for TTG-Ab and thrombin generation was undertaken once during recruitment. RESULTS: Patients with CD at diagnosis showed a significantly shorter lag time compared with controls (P < 0.001) and a shorter time-to-peak compared with controls (P < 0.02). These differences were no longer detectable after normalization of TTG-Ab values. The overall amount of generated thrombin, represented by the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), showed no significant difference between the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that alterations in coagulation can be found in untreated CD that may help to explain the described increased risk of stroke or VTE. A shorter lag time in patients with untreated CD indicates a more rapid onset of thrombin generation as a sign of hypercoagulability. ETP, the best predictive parameter for thromboembolic disease, however, was not altered.},

   abstract = {There is no diet that is recommended for all individuals. Some special diets (eg, gluten-free for celiac disease) are necessary for health and quality of life. Other diets may be recommended for a short period of time to aid in symptom relief but may not be recommended for the long- term (eg, LFD). Popular diets continue to come and go with varying levels of success. When considering adolescents, continued growth and development are most important, and restrictive diets can lead to nutrient inadequacies and poor growth. Before making any recommendation, it is important to consider the goal of the diet and the cost versus benefits associated with following the diet. Adherence is always a challenge, regardless of the type of diet implemented. If a special diet is not warranted for the health, safety, and desired quality of life of the individual, it should not be implemented.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is associated with several autoimmune diseases (ADs) and, in particular, thyroid autoimmunity (TA) and Type 1 diabetes (T1D). TA and T1D are defined as 'associated conditions' to CD (conditions at increased prevalence in CD but not directly related to gluten ingestion). The diagnosis of CD may precede or follow that of TA/T1D. To date, the available evidence suggests that the common genetic background is the main factor determining the high prevalence of the association. Conversely, no conclusive findings clarify whether extrinsic gluten-related factors (age at the first introduction, concomitant breastfeeding, length of gluten exposure and gluten-free diet) may link CD to the ADs. The aim of this review is to evaluate whether genetic background alone could explain the association between CD and ADs or if gluten-related factors ought to be considered. The pathophysiological links clarifying how the gluten-related factors could predispose to ADs will also be discussed.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a complex immune-related disease with a very strong genetic component. Multiple genetic findings over the last decade have added to the already known MHC influence numerous genetic variants associated to CD susceptibility. Currently, it is well-established that 6 MHC and 39 non-MHC loci, including a higher number of independent genetic variants, are associated to disease risk. Moreover, additional regions have been recently implicated in the disease, which would increase the number of involved loci. Together, the firmly described genetic variants account for roughly 31% of CD heritability, being 25% explained by the MHC influence. These new variants represent markers of disease risk and turn the identification of the causal genes and the causal variants inside the associated loci, as well as their precise biological role on the disease, into a major challenge in CD research. Numerous studies have been developed with this aim showing the high impact of risk variants on gene expression. These studies also indicate a central role of CD4(+) T cells in CD pathogenesis and point to B cells as important players, which is in accordance with the key steps highlighted by the immunological models of pathogenesis. We comprehensively summarize the current knowledge about the genetic architecture of CD, characterized by multiple low-risk variants located within diverse loci which are most likely affecting genes with immune-related functions. These findings are leading to a better understanding of CD pathogenesis and helping in the design of new treatments. The repertoire of potential drug targets for CD has largely broadened last years, bringing us closer to get alternative or complementary treatments to the life-long gluten-free diet, the only effective treatment so far. Epigenetics and microbiota are emerging as potent factors modulating disease risk and putatively affecting disease manifestation, which are also being explored as therapeutic targets.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A large retrospective multicentre study was conducted in Spain to evaluate the efficiency of the new European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria for the diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD). METHODS: The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe (Valencia, Spain). The present study included 2177 children (ages 0.6-15.9 years) with small bowel biopsy (SBB) performed for diagnostic purposes (from 2000 to 2009) and with a minimum 2-year follow-up after biopsy. RESULTS: CD was diagnosed in 2126 patients (97.5%) and excluded in 51 (2.5%). Tissue transglutaminase antibodies (TG2A), anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) were reported in 751 patients, 640 symptomatic and 111 asymptomatic. TG2A levels >10 times the upper limit of normal, plus positive EMA and HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 haplotypes, were found in 336 symptomatic patients, all of them with final diagnosis of CD. In 65 of 69 asymptomatic patients, 65 had confirmed CD and 4 did not have CD. According to the 2012 ESPGHAN guidelines, SBB may have been omitted in 52% of the symptomatic patients with CD with serologic and HLA available data. Gluten challenge was performed in 158 children, 75 of them <2 years at first biopsy. Only 1 patient in whom according to the new proposed diagnostic criteria gluten challenge would not have been mandatory did not relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the new ESPGHAN 2012 guidelines for diagnosis of CD can be safely used without the risk of overdiagnosis. A prospective multicentre study is needed to confirm our results.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease affects approximately 1% of Northern American and European populations. It is caused by an inappropriate immune response to dietary gluten. Gluten comprises of two major protein fractions: gliadins and glutenins. Glutenins have recently been found to be toxic to coeliac individuals. Proliferation assays suggest in some but not all paediatric coeliac individuals there may be immunological stimulation with high molecular weight (HMW) glutenins. Less evidence pertains to low molecular weight (LMW) glutenins. The aim is to assess adaptive, T-cell driven, and innate immune response in adult coeliac individuals towards HMW glutenin peptide, glut04, and LMW glutenin peptide, glt156. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Coeliac patients were recruited attending endoscopy for routine monitoring. Adaptive immune response towards glut04 and glt156 was measured by proliferation assays and measurement of interferon-gamma secretion in 28 T-cell lines. The innate immune response was assessed by measurement of enterocyte cell height (ECH) in coeliac small intestinal biopsies following overnight incubation in organ culture chambers in a further nine individuals. RESULTS: There were 3/28 and 2/28 positive proliferation results using gluten-sensitive T-cells with glut04 and glt156, respectively. All coeliac biopsies tested in organ culture chambers demonstrated clear reduction in ECH with peptic-tryptic digest of whole industrial gluten, glut04 and glt156 when compared to negative control ovalbumin (p < 0.005). Three individuals had both T-cell and organ culture study data. Their proliferation assays showed no stimulation of the T-cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates glutenin epitopes glut04 and glt156, while minor T-cell epitopes, are important in their ability to trigger the innate immune response.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a chronic autoimmune disease that requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. However, strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is difficult, with findings from a recent review suggesting that up to 42% of individuals with coeliac disease do not eat a strict gluten-free diet. METHODS: The present study aimed to examine psychosocial predictors of adherence (purposeful and accidental) to a gluten-free diet among adults with coeliac disease over a 1-month period. In this longitudinal study, 212 North American adults with coeliac disease completed online questionnaires at two time points, baseline and 1 month later. RESULTS: The results revealed that intentions partially mediated the effects of symptom severity, self-regulatory efficacy, planning and knowledge on purposeful gluten consumption. Intentions did not mediate the effects of severity, response cost, self-regulatory efficacy, planning and knowledge for accidental gluten consumption but, interestingly, self-regulatory efficacy directly predicted fewer accidental incidents of gluten-consumption. CONCLUSIONS: These findings delineate the differential psychological processes in understanding accidental and purposeful gluten consumption among adults with coeliac disease and emphasise the importance of bolstering self-regulatory efficacy beliefs to prevent accidental and purposeful consumption of gluten.},

   abstract = {AIM: To assess the prevalence of nutritional disorders in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The data from a national cohort of children newly diagnosed with IBD between 2003 and 2012 were analyzed. The diagnosis of IBD and the differentiation between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were confirmed by gastroenterologists according to the standard criteria. The body mass index (BMI) of each child [weight (kg)/height(2) (m)] was calculated at the time of diagnosis. The World Health Organization standards and references were used and the BMI for age > +1 and < -2 standard deviation score were used to define overweight and thinness, respectively. Age stratification analysis was performed to investigate any age-related variation in the prevalence of nutritional status between children < 10 years of age and older. RESULTS: There were 374 children from 0.33 to 17 years of age, including 119 (32%) children with UC and 255 (68%) with CD. All of the children were Saudi nationals, and 68 (57%) of the UC and 150 (59%) of the CD children were males. A positive history of anorexia at the time of diagnosis was found in 30 (25%) patients with UC and 99 (39%) patients with CD. The prevalence of thinness was 31%, 35% and 24% in children with IBD, CD and UC, respectively, with a significantly higher prevalence of thinness in children with CD than in children with UC (P = 0.037) only in the age group of 10-17 years (P = 0.030). The prevalence of overweight was 16 %, 15% and 20 % in the children with IBD, CD and UC, respectively, indicating a higher prevalence in UC that was statistically significant only in the age group of 10-17 years (P = 0.020). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of children with IBD presented with overweight instead of the classical underweight. Awareness of this finding is important for patient care.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac serology is crucial for the diagnosis of celiac disease in children. The American guideline for celiac disease in children suggested that positive serology should be followed by confirmatory intestinal histology. The relationship between high tissue transglutaminase titers and celiac disease in children has not been well investigated in children from North America. AIMS: In the present study, we investigated whether different tissue transglutaminase titers in symptomatic children could predict celiac disease without the confirmation of intestinal histology. METHODS: Data from biopsy confirmed celiac children were collected from four different clinics in North America. Clinical, serological, histological, and follow-up data were collected. The accuracy rates of various tissue transglutaminase titers to predict celiac disease in children were calculated. RESULTS: The data from 240 children were calculated. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy rate of tissue transglutaminase titers at >/=10x upper limit of normal were 75.4, 48.8, 87.7, 29.0, and 70.8 %, respectively. Similar data were noted in the other tissue transglutaminase titers (>/=3x upper limit of normal, >100 U/ml, or >100 U/ml and >10x upper limit of normal). CONCLUSIONS: The positive predictive value of tissue transglutaminase titers at >/=3x upper limit of normal or higher was too low to predict celiac disease in children. Our data suggested that in routine clinical practice, high titers of tissue transglutaminase are not sufficient to diagnose celiac disease in North American children without intestinal biopsies.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Small bowel villous atrophy can represent a diagnostic challenge for gastroenterologists and pathologists. In Western countries small bowel atrophy and mild non-atrophic alterations are frequently caused by celiac disease. However, other pathology can mimic celiac disease microscopically, widening the differential diagnosis. The several novelties on this topic and the introduction of the device-assisted enteroscopy in the diagnostic flowchart make an update of the literature necessary. Areas covered: In this review, a description of the different clinical scenarios when facing with small bowel mucosal damage, particularly small bowel atrophy, is described. The published literature on this subject has been summarized and reviewed. Expert commentary: When an intestinal mucosal alteration is histologically demonstrated, the pathology report forms part of a more complex workup including serological data, clinical presentation and clinical history. A multidisciplinary team, including pathologists and enteroscopy-devoted endoscopists, is frequently required to manage patients with small bowel alterations, especially in cases of severe malabsorption syndrome.},

   abstract = {In 2013, four Italian Gastroenterological Societies (the Italian Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, the Italian Society of Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists, the Italian Society of Endoscopy, and the Italian Society of Gastroenterology) formed a joint panel of experts with the aim of preparing an official statement on transition medicine in Gastroenterology. The transition of adolescents from paediatric to adult care is a crucial moment in managing chronic diseases such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease and liver transplantation. Improved medical treatment and availability of new drugs and surgical techniques have improved the prognosis of many paediatric disorders, prolonging survival, thus making the transition to adulthood possible and necessary. An inappropriate transition or the incomplete transmission of data from the paediatrician to the adult Gastroenterologist can dramatically decrease compliance to treatment and prognosis of a young patient, particularly in the case of severe disorders. For these reasons, the Italian gastroenterological societies decided to develop an official shared transition protocol. The resulting document discusses the factors influencing the transition process and highlights the main points to accomplish to optimize compliance and prognosis of gastroenterological patients during the difficult transition from childhood to adolescence and adulthood.},

   abstract = {Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterized by the onset of symptoms after eating gluten-containing food. We aimed to single out NCGS subjects among subjects with functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients were enrolled in a multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled trial with crossover. Symptoms and quality of life were evaluated by means of 10-cm VAS and SF36. Iron parameters, transaminases and C reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated. After a three-week-long gluten-free diet (GFD), responsive patients were randomly assigned to gluten intake (5.6 g/day) or placebo for seven days, followed by crossover. The primary endpoint was the worsening of symptoms (VAS increase >/=3 cm) during gluten ingestion compared to placebo. One hundred and forty patients were enrolled and 134 (17 males, mean age 39.1 +/- 11.7 years, BMI 22.4 +/- 3.8) completed the first period. A total of 101 subjects (10 males, mean age 39.3 +/- 11.0 years, BMI 22.3 +/- 4.0) reported a symptomatic improvement (VAS score 2.3 +/- 1.2 vs. 6.5 +/- 2.2 before and after GFD, p = 0.001). 98 patients underwent the gluten challenge and 28 (all females, mean age 38.9 +/- 12.7 years, BMI 22.0 +/- 2.9) reported a symptomatic relapse and deterioration of quality of life. No parameters were found to be statistically associated with positivity to the challenge. However, 14 patients responded to the placebo ingestion. Taking into account this finding, about 14% of patients responding to gluten withdrawal showed a symptomatic relapse during the gluten challenge. This group is suspected to have NCGS.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by intermittent abdominal pain/discomfort, altered bowel habits and abdominal bloating/distension. This review aimed at presenting the recent developments concerning the role of diet in the pathophysiology and management of IBS. There is no convincing evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy/intolerance, and there is no evidence that gluten causes the debated new diagnosis of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The component in wheat that triggers symptoms in NCGS appears to be the carbohydrates. Patients with NCGS appear to be IBS patients who are self-diagnosed and self-treated with a gluten-free diet. IBS symptoms are triggered by the consumption of the poorly absorbed fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) and insoluble fibre. On reaching the distal small intestine and colon, FODMAPS and insoluble fibre increase the osmotic pressure in the large-intestine lumen and provide a substrate for bacterial fermentation, with consequent gas production, abdominal distension and abdominal pain or discomfort. Poor FODMAPS and insoluble fibres diet reduces the symptom and improve the quality of life in IBS patients. Moreover, it changes favourably the intestinal microbiota and restores the abnormalities in the gastrointestinal endocrine cells. Five gastrointestinal endocrine cell types that produce hormones regulating appetite and food intake are abnormal in IBS patients. Based on these hormonal abnormalities, one would expect that IBS patients to have increased food intake and body weight gain. However, the link between obesity and IBS is not fully studied. Individual dietary guidance for intake of poor FODMAPs and insoluble fibres diet in combination with probiotics intake and regular exercise is to be recommended for IBS patients.},

   abstract = {Wheat products make a substantial contribution to the dietary intake of many people worldwide. Despite the many beneficial aspects of consuming wheat products, it is also responsible for several diseases such as celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy, and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). CD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients have similar gastrointestinal symptoms, which can result in CD patients being misdiagnosed as having IBS. Therefore, CD should be excluded in IBS patients. A considerable proportion of CD patients suffer from IBS symptoms despite adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The inflammation caused by gluten intake may not completely subside in some CD patients. It is not clear that gluten triggers the symptoms in NCGS, but there is compelling evidence that carbohydrates (fructans and galactans) in wheat does. It is likely that NCGS patients are a group of self-diagnosed IBS patients who self-treat by adhering to a GFD.},

BACKGROUND: Ischemic gastritis is rare, given the rich blood supply of the stomach. It has been reported in isolated case reports and small case series. Most cases are vascular in origin and associated with a high mortality. STUDY: Pathology databases from 3 hospitals affiliated with the University of Minnesota Medical School were searched for cases of ischemic gastritis in the last 10 years. Patients' demographics, clinical course, and 1-month and 1-year mortalities were collected from electronic medical records. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients were identified (age range, 32.1 to 83.2), the largest series reported to date. The presenting symptom was gastrointestinal bleeding (8), abdominal pain (2), nausea (1), and symptomatic anemia (1). The etiology included postinterventional radiology embolization (2), hemodynamic changes in the setting of celiac axis stenosis (2), vasculitis (1), systemic hypotension (1), and unknown (6). Treatment included steroid therapy, revascularization by interventional radiology, surgery, or supportive treatment. Thirty-day and 1-year mortalities were 33% and 41%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic gastritis is rare, but associated with a high mortality. Evaluation for treatable etiologies should be sought and corrected if present.},

   abstract = {The enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) plays a crucial role in the initiation of celiac disease by catalyzing the deamidation of gluten peptides. In susceptible individuals, the deamidated peptides initiate an immune response leading to celiac disease. Several studies have addressed lactic fermentation plus addition of enzymes as a means to degrade gluten in order to prevent adverse response in celiacs. Processing for complete gluten degradation is often harsh and is not likely to yield products that are of comparable characteristics as their gluten-containing counterparts. We are concerned that incomplete degradation of gluten may have adverse effects because it leads to more available TG2-binding sites on gluten peptides. Therefore, we have investigated how lactic acid fermentation affects the potential binding of TG2 to gluten protein in wheat flour by means of estimating TG2-mediated transamidation in addition to measuring the available TG2-binding motif QLP, in alpha2-gliadin. We show that lactic fermentation of wheat flour, as slurry or as part of sourdough bread, did not decrease the TG2-mediated transamidation, in the presence of a primary amine, to an efficient level (73%-102% of unfermented flour). Nor did the lactic fermentation decrease the available TG2 binding motif QLP in alpha2-gliadin to a sufficient extent in sourdough bread (73%-122% of unfermented control) to be useful for celiac safe food.},

   abstract = {Fourteen Saharawi celiac children following an African-style gluten-free diet for at least two years were subjected to a change of diet to an Italian-style gluten-free diet for 60 days. Significant differences were identified in the salivary microbiota and metabolome when Saharawi celiac children switched from African- to Italian-style dietary habits. An Italian-style gluten-free diet caused increases in the abundance of Granulicatella, Porphyromonas and Neisseria and decreases in Clostridium, Prevotella and Veillonella, altering the 'salivary type' of the individuals. Furthermore, operational taxonomic unit co-occurrence/exclusion patterns indicated that the initial equilibrium of co-occurring microbial species was perturbed by a change in diet: the microbial diversity was reduced, with a few species out-competing the previously established microbiota and becoming dominant. Analysis of predicted metagenomes revealed a remarkable change in the metabolic potential of the microbiota following the diet change, with increased potential for amino acid, vitamin and co-factor metabolism. High concentrations of acetone and 2-butanone during treatment with the Italian-style gluten-free diet suggested metabolic dysfunction in the Saharawi celiac children. The findings of this study support the need for a translational medicine pipeline to examine interactions between food and microbiota when evaluating human development, nutritional needs and the impact and consequences of westernisation.},

For the quantification of gluten, an ELISA was used. The threshold of 20 ppm gluten was considered as the safe upper limit for gluten-free food, as proposed in the Codex Alimentarius. RESULTS: The results revealed a total of 21.5 % of contamination among the bakery products sampled. Sixty-four per cent of the bakeries sold at least one contaminated product in our sample. CONCLUSIONS: These findings represent a risk for coeliac patients since the ingestion of gluten traces may be sufficient to adversely impact on their health.},

   abstract = {While gluten and wheat must be absolutely avoided in coeliac disease and allergy, respectively, nutritional recommendations are largely more confused about non-coeliac wheat/gluten sensitivity (NCWGS). Today, some even recommend avoiding all cereal-based foods. In this paper, the increased NCWGS prevalence is hypothesized to parallel the use of more and more drastic processes applied to the original wheat grain. First, a parallel between gluten-related disorders and wheat processing and consumption evolution is briefly proposed. Notably, increased use of exogenous vital gluten is considered. Drastic processing in wheat technology are mainly grain fractionation and refining followed by recombination and salt, sugars and fats addition, being able to render ultra-processed cereal-based foods more prone to trigger chronic low-grade inflammation. Concerning bread, intensive kneading and the choice of wheat varieties with high baking quality may have rendered gluten less digestible, moving digestion from pancreatic to intestinal proteases. The hypothesis of a gluten resistant fraction reaching colon and interacting with microflora is also considered in relation with increased inflammation. Besides, wheat flour refining removes fiber co-passenger which have potential anti-inflammatory property able to protect digestive epithelium. Finally, some research tracks are proposed, notably the comparison of NCWGS prevalence in populations consuming ultra-versus minimally-processed cereal-based foods.},

The experiment was designed according to simplex-lattice method and different types of gluten-free flours were used, such as sorghum, rice, corn, and potato starch. The fifteen formulations were subjected to sensory analysis (Mixed Structured Scale - MSS) and seven formulations were selected in respect to taste and grittiness. These formulations were subjected to Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA), which evaluated the attributes: appearance, color, odor, hardness, elasticity, stickiness, grittiness, taste, residual bitterness and overall quality. Results showed significant difference in appearance, color and hardness. The formulations that showed the best sensory results were submitted to chemical analysis and cooking quality of pasta. It was observed that the best results for mixing is sorghum flour, rice flour and potato starch.},

   abstract = {Nutrition and growth during early infancy influence later health and development, but most research has focused on the period of milk feeding, and the possibility that the timing, content or method of complementary feeding (CF) might have similar later effects has received less attention. Such effects are plausible, given that the CF period is one of rapid growth and development when infants are susceptible to nutrient deficiencies and excesses, and during which there are marked changes in diet with exposure to many new foods, tastes and feeding experiences. CF practices could influence later outcome by several potential mechanisms, including programming effects, but also direct effects on food preferences, appetite and eating behavior. Investigating these issues is challenging given the diversity and complexity of CF practices, which limit the feasibility and generalizability of randomized trials in this field. Available evidence relating CF practices to later health and development are currently limited in quantity and quality, but suggest that avoiding the introduction of solid foods before 4 months may reduce the risk of subsequent obesity and allergy. Whilst recommendations for different aspects of CF may be developed in the future based on broad principles, they will need to be tailored for different populations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex conditions whose pathogenesis may be attributed to gene-environment interactions. There are no definitive mechanisms explaining how environmental triggers can lead to ASD although the involvement of inflammation and immunity has been suggested. Inappropriate antigen trafficking through an impaired intestinal barrier, followed by passage of these antigens or immune-activated complexes through a permissive blood-brain barrier (BBB), can be part of the chain of events leading to these disorders. Our goal was to investigate whether an altered BBB and gut permeability is part of the pathophysiology of ASD. METHODS: Postmortem cerebral cortex and cerebellum tissues from ASD, schizophrenia (SCZ), and healthy subjects (HC) and duodenal biopsies from ASD and HC were analyzed for gene and protein expression profiles. Tight junctions and other key molecules associated with the neurovascular unit integrity and function and neuroinflammation were investigated. RESULTS: Claudin (CLDN)-5 and -12 were increased in the ASD cortex and cerebellum. CLDN-3, tricellulin, and MMP-9 were higher in the ASD cortex. IL-8, tPA, and IBA-1 were downregulated in SCZ cortex; IL-1b was increased in the SCZ cerebellum. Differences between SCZ and ASD were observed for most of the genes analyzed in both brain areas. CLDN-5 protein was increased in ASD cortex and cerebellum, while CLDN-12 appeared reduced in both ASD and SCZ cortexes. In the intestine, 75% of the ASD samples analyzed had reduced expression of barrier-forming TJ components (CLDN-1, OCLN, TRIC), whereas 66% had increased pore-forming CLDNs (CLDN-2, -10, -15) compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: In the ASD brain, there is an altered expression of genes associated with BBB integrity coupled with increased neuroinflammation and possibly impaired gut barrier integrity. While these findings seem to be specific for ASD, the possibility of more distinct SCZ subgroups should be explored with additional studies.},

The authors identify a particular exclusionary-type approach that seeks to eliminate dietary gluten. Although the relationship between celiac disease (CD) and ADHD/ASD is not well established, a repeated clinical feature noted in CD is the elevated levels of nitric oxide in serum and urine. Elevated oxidative stress has also been observed in neurodevelopmental conditions, and the author of this correspondence has been the first to propose that chronic, environmental exposure to the air pollutant, nitrous oxide may contribute to these oxidative stress profiles through neural cholinergic perturbation. Therefore, the purpose of this correspondence is to highlight this biochemical connection between these conditions so as to identify the clinical populations who may realize the greatest benefit of these dietary approaches, while minimizing any potential risk of nutrient deficiencies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A gluten-free diet (GFD) may carry high energy and fat load. We verified lipid profile and dietary indicators cross-sectionally and prospectively in patients with celiac disease (CD). METHODS: In any consecutive child receiving a GFD (group 1) or newly diagnosed as having CD (group 2), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, blood pressure (BP), anthropometric data, physical activity, and a 24-hour food diary were collected during follow-up visits (yearly in group 1 and during the first year of GFD in group 2). RESULTS: In group 1 (132 girls, 73 boys, 10.7 +/- 4.2 years), TC (P = 0.006), TG (P = 0.014), and HDL (P = 0.019) were significantly higher in girls than in boys. Compared with the general pediatric population, group 1 girls had higher TC, TG, HDL, and low-density lipoprotein; group 1 boys had lower TC, TG, and low-density lipoprotein and higher HDL. TC was significantly and positively affected by age, sex, and time receiving GFD, whereas HDL was significantly and positively affected by body mass index, diastolic BP, and sex; TG was negatively affected by diastolic BP. Compared with recommendations, group 1 children introduced less calories, iron, and calcium; one-third more sodium; similar amounts of fiber; and twice as many proteins. In group 2 (20 girls, 10 boys, 8.6 +/- 3.55 years), TC did not change over time and TG diminished, whereas HDL, blood glucose, and body mass index increased; saturated fats and caloric intake were below recommendations, whereas proteins were excessively introduced. Fibers were optimal. HDL was inversely correlated to calories and saturated fat (R(2) = 80, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Lipid profiles of children with CD differ across sexes and from reference population. GFD, being unexpectedly appropriate in fibers and fat proportion, may be a contributor.},

   abstract = {The market of gluten-free bakery products is considerably growing since better diagnostic methods allow identifying an increasing number of people suffering coeliac disease and other gluten-related disorders such as dermatitis herpetiformis, gluten ataxia, wheat allergy and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity. The only and safe treatment available nowadays for these types of disorders is to follow a strict and permanent lifelong gluten-free diet. Beside the people needing to follow a gluten-free diet for health reasons, a new segment of consumers has arisen who consume gluten-free products as a lifestyle choice. Among the bakery products, bread is a major staple food consumed daily all over the world. The dough and bread quality characteristics (such as gas retaining ability, mixing tolerance, resistance to stretch and extensibility and crumb structure) are mostly attributed to the presence of gluten. Despite the improved quality of gluten-free breads in the last number of years, most products on the market are still described as low quality product. In addition to the low overall quality of gluten-free products, the nutritional value of a large number of them is quite poor. In this context, this review gives an overview on the consumers, which need to follow a gluten-free diet for health reasons. The trends in this gluten-free bakery segment will also be reviewed based on the current analysis of marketing studies. An overview of the major ingredients used in gluten-free bread products will be given. The choice of the ingredients discussed in this paper is based on a comprehensive study of the leading gluten-free breads available on the market, as well as a detailed study of the scientific literature. The impact of the various ingredients on bread-making process and bread quality is also part of this review. Major emphasis will be placed on the application of sourdough as a means to improve gluten-free bread quality.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Small bowel biopsy is the gold standard for Celiac Disease (CD) diagnosis, nevertheless serum assays are the first step in ascertaining a diagnosis of CD. New ESPGHAN Criteria 2012 (European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition) suggest using exclusively anti-tissue Transglutaminase IgA antibodies (anti-tTGA) as initial approach to symptomatic subjects. The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of anti-tTGA as initial screening assay for CD in a large cohort of pediatric patients. METHODS: We selected 730 subjects aged between 6 months and 4 years ("Group A") and 348 subjects younger than 2 years (which are part of the 730 subjects) ("Group B"). We performed anti-Deamidated Gliadin Peptides IgA and IgG antibodies (a-DGP IgA/IgG) and anti-tTGA assays by ELISA test. We evaluated the agreement between anti-tTGA and a-DGP IgA/IgG assays and compared the diagnostic accuracy of a-DGP IgA/IgG with that of anti-tTGA in both groups of patients. RESULTS: There was a substantial agreement between anti-tTGA and a-DGP IgA in "Group A" and an almost perfect agreement in "Group B"; the strength of agreement between anti-tTGA and a-DGP IgG was moderate in "Group A" and substantial in "Group B". anti-tTGA were more sensitive and specific than a-DGP IgA/IgG in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: anti-tTGA could be used as initial screening assay for CD in all subjects from 6 months of age according to ESPGHAN Criteria 2012.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The recent increase in CD incidence suggests that additional environmental factors, such as intestinal microbiota alterations, are involved in its pathogenesis. However, there is no direct evidence of modulation of gluten-induced immunopathology by the microbiota. We investigated whether specific microbiota compositions influence immune responses to gluten in mice expressing the human DQ8 gene, which confers moderate CD genetic susceptibility. Germ-free mice, clean specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice colonized with a microbiota devoid of opportunistic pathogens and Proteobacteria, and conventional SPF mice that harbor a complex microbiota that includes opportunistic pathogens were used. Clean SPF mice had attenuated responses to gluten compared to germ-free and conventional SPF mice. Germ-free mice developed increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, markers of intraepithelial lymphocyte cytotoxicity, gliadin-specific antibodies, and a proinflammatory gliadin-specific T-cell response. Antibiotic treatment, leading to Proteobacteria expansion, further enhanced gluten-induced immunopathology in conventional SPF mice. Protection against gluten-induced immunopathology in clean SPF mice was reversed after supplementation with a member of the Proteobacteria phylum, an enteroadherent Escherichia coli isolated from a CD patient. The intestinal microbiota can both positively and negatively modulate gluten-induced immunopathology in mice. In subjects with moderate genetic susceptibility, intestinal microbiota changes may be a factor that increases CD risk.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy, triggered by ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Since the use of anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysium antibodies in the early 1990s, two main groups of clinical presentation can be identified: patients with a symptomatic form of the disease, and patients with a pauci (a)-symptomatic form detected during the work-up of another autoimmune disease or due to a family history of celiac disease. The prevalence of both forms of the disease is currently estimated between 1/100 and 1/400. Classical form of the disease is characterized by occurrence of diarrhoea, failure to thrive, and abdominal bloating in young infants in the months following gluten introduction. Serological tests show high level of anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysium antibodies. Until recently, the diagnosis required duodenal biopsies that show villous atrophy. HLA genotype can help for diagnosis: the absence of the HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 alleles has a high negative predictive value. European guidelines recently proposed to reconsider the need for systematic endoscopy in typical symptomatic forms with high level of anti-transglutaminase and positive anti-endomysium. These recommendations are being assessed now. Currently, the gluten-free diet remains the only effective treatment for celiac disease. Children with celiac disease have to exclude from their diet all products containing wheat, barley and rye. Gluten-free diet causes clinical remission within a few weeks, but normalization of the small bowel mucosa and negativity of anti-transglutaminase antibodies are obtained in several months or even years. Gluten-free diet is useful to obtain clinical assessment, but also to prevent long-term complications of celiac disease, mainly osteoporosis, other autoimmune diseases, decreased fertility and cancers.},

Reversal or near-total regression of marked liver steatohepatitis and fibrosis, however, remains a rare event. We report the case of a 20-year-old female presenting with diarrhea due to celiac disease and biopsy proven cirrhosis with portal hypertension who had a remarkable clinical improvement in response to a gluten free diet (GFD). A follow-up liver biopsy 9 months after the initiation of GFD revealed a remarkable regression of both fibrosis as well as steatosis. Villous atrophy, as seen in patients with celiac disease, could lead to a deprivation of trophic factors leading to liver injury and subsequent cirrhosis. A gluten-free dietary regimen can produce a reversal of fibrosis leading to the amelioration of symptoms associated even with advanced liver disease.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The ancient diploid Triticum monococcum is of special interest as a candidate low-toxic wheat species for celiac disease patients. Here, we investigated how an in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion, affected the immune toxic properties of gliadin from diploid compared to hexaploid wheat. METHODS AND RESULTS: Gliadins from Triticum monococcum, and Triticum aestivum cultivars were digested using either a partial proteolysis with pepsin-chymotrypsin, or an extensive degradation that used gastrointestinal enzymes including the brush border membrane enzymes. The immune stimulatory properties of the digested samples were investigated on T-cell lines and jejunal biopsies from celiac disease patients. The T-cell response profile to the Triticum monococcum gliadin was comparable to that obtained with Triticum aestivum gliadin after the partial pepsin-chymotrypsin digestion. In contrast, the extensive gastrointestinal hydrolysis drastically reduced the immune stimulatory properties of Triticum monococcum gliadin. MS-based analysis showed that several Triticum monococcum peptides, including known T-cell epitopes, were degraded during the gastrointestinal treatment, whereas many of Triticum aestivum gliadin survived the gastrointestinal digestion. CONCLUSION: The pattern of Triticum monococcum gliadin proteins is sufficiently different from those of common hexaploid wheat to determine a lower toxicity in celiac disease patients following in vitro simulation of human digestion.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We retrospectively examined the performance of the tissue transglutaminase (TTG), endomysial antibody (EMA) tests, and the ESPGHAN (European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) nonbiopsy criteria in a pediatric population. METHODS: Consecutive celiac serologies and corresponding intestinal biopsy results were obtained on children <18 years old over 3.5 years. Patients were classified into three categories: positive TTG, negative TTG, and IgA deficiency. RESULTS: Of the 17,505 patients with celiac serology performed, 775 had a positive TTG, 574 with a negative TTG were biopsied, and 25 were IgA deficient. Of the patients with a TTG >/=10 x upper limit of normal (ULN), positive EMA, and symptoms, 98.2% had biopsies consistent with celiac disease (CD). Four human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8-positive patients who met the ESPGHAN nonbiopsy criteria did not have CD. In the group with a TTG 3-10 x ULN, 75.7% EMA-positive patients and only 40% EMA-negative patients had CD (P<0.001). Of those with a TTG 1-3 x ULN, 52.2% EMA-positive patients vs. only 13.3% EMA-negative patients had CD (P<0.01). Of the patients with bulbar and duodenal biopsies, 9.8% had CD confined only in the bulb, especially those with a low titer TTG (P<0.01). CD prevalence in our cohort was 34.6%. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the TTG were 98.7%, 86.4%, and 79.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The TTG is a very sensitive screen for CD, but positive predictive value improves with a positive EMA titer. To apply the new ESPGHAN guidelines, clinicians must understand the performance of their celiac serology tests.},

   abstract = {In the present narrative review, we analyzed the relationship between seronegative celiac disease (SNCD) and immunoglobulin deficiencies. For this purpose, we conducted a literature search on the main medical databases. SNCD poses a diagnostic dilemma. Villous blunting, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) count and gluten "challenge" are the most reliable markers. Immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-targeted mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune complexes in the intestinal mucosa of SNCD patients may be useful. In our experience, tTG-mRNA was similarly increased in seropositive celiac disease (CD) and suspected SNCD, and strongly correlated with the IELs count. This increase is found even in the IELs' range of 15-25/100 enterocytes, suggesting that there may be a "grey zone" of gluten-related disorders. An immune deregulation (severely lacking B-cell differentiation) underlies the association of SNCD with immunoglobulin deficiencies. Therefore, CD may be linked to autoimmune disorders and immune deficits (common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)/IgA selective deficiency). CVID is a heterogeneous group of antibodies dysfunction, whose association with CD is demonstrated only by the response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). We hypothesized a familial inheritance between CD and CVID. Selective IgA deficiency, commonly associated with CD, accounts for IgA-tTG seronegativity. Selective IgM deficiency (sIgMD) is rare (<300 cases) and associated to CD in 5% of cases. We diagnosed SNCD in a patient affected by sIgMD using the tTG-mRNA assay. One-year GFD induced IgM restoration. This evidence, supporting a link between SNCD and immunoglobulin deficiencies, suggests that we should take a closer look at this association.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To establish whether the duodenal mucosa microbiota of children with active coeliac disease (CD) and healthy controls (HC) differ in composition and biodiversity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples of duodenal biopsies in 11 CD patients were obtained at diagnosis, and in 6 HC who were investigated for functional intestinal disorders of non-CD origin. Total duodenal microbiota and the belonging to the genus Lactobacillus using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were analysed. The banding patterns obtained in the resulting gels were analysed to determine the differences between the microbiota of CD patients and HC (FPQuest 4.5) while environmental indexes (richness, diversity and habitability) were calculated with the Past version 2.17 program. RESULTS: The intestinal microbiota of patients with Marsh 3c lesion showed similarity of 98% and differs from other CD patients with other type of histologic lesion as Marsh3a, Marsh3b and Marsh2. The main differences were obtained in ecological indexes belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, with significant richness, diversity and habitability reduction in CD patients. In CD bands were categorized primarily with Streptococcus, Bacteroides and E.coli species. In HC the predominant bands were Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Acinetobacter, though the Streptococcus and Bacteroides were lower. CONCLUSIONS: The celiac patients with major histological affectation presented a similar microbiota duodenal. The ecological indexes applied to the genus Lactobacillus were significantly reduced in CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the epidemiological and presenting features, clinical patterns, and complications of celiac disease (CD) in children. METHODS: The clinical charts of children with CD were retrospectively analyzed. Data for children who presented during the first time period (January 2005-October 2008; group 1) were compared to those of children who presented during the second time period (November 2008-April 2012; group 2). RESULTS: Group 1 and 2 consisted of 96 and 95 children, respectively. There were no differences in gender distribution, weight, or height z-scores between the two groups. Mean age at the time of diagnosis in group 2 (9.3 +/- 4.5 years) was significantly higher than in group 1 (6.9 +/- 3.9 years; P < 0.001). Non-classical presentation was more frequent in group 2 (P = 0.01). Associated disorders were observed in 49 children (25.7%) overall. There were significantly more children with type 1 diabetes mellitus in group 2 (P = 0.030). In all, 11 patients (5.8%) were overweight (either obese or at risk of obesity) at presentation. Isolated short stature was the presenting feature in 15 children (7.9%) overall, but was more frequently observed in group 2 (P = 0.003). In total, 15 patients (7.9%) presented with refractory iron deficiency anemia; the frequency was similar in both groups. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was performed in 102 patients, and 82 (80.4%) had metabolic bone disease (MBD). CONCLUSION: The mode of presentation and clinical features of CD in childhood continue to change. Of note, a substantial percentage of patients were overweight at presentation. MBD is a frequent complication, necessitating routine evaluation.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional population survey. SETTING: The study was conducted in Australia, using a nationwide postal omnibus survey. SUBJECTS: Adults aged 18 years and over (n 1184; 52.9% female) selected at random from the Australian Electoral Roll. RESULTS: With cases of stated and suspected coeliac disease (1.2%) excluded, 7.3% of the sample reported adverse physiological effects, predominantly gastrointestinal, that they associated with wheat consumption. Few among this group (5.7%) claimed a formally diagnosed intolerance or allergy requiring avoidance of wheat-based foods. Symptomatic wheat avoidance was highly correlated with dairy avoidance and predicted by gender (female), lesser receptiveness to conventional medicine and greater receptiveness to complementary medicine, but not by neuroticism, reasoning style or tendency to worry about illness. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that many adult Australians are consciously avoiding consumption of wheat foods, predominantly without any formal diagnosis. Reported symptoms suggest a physiological but not allergenic basis to this behaviour. Questions to be answered concern whether symptoms are attributed correctly to wheat, the agents (wheat components, dietary factors or additives) and physiological mechanism(s) involved, the nutritional adequacy of avoiders' diets, and the clinical and psychosocial processes that lead a substantial number of adults to avoid consuming wheat (or any other dietary factor) apparently independently of a medical diagnosis.},

Its role in children has not been well established and continues to evolve. Our objective was to evaluate the utility and impact on clinical management of EUS and EUS-guided interventions in the pediatric population at our institution. METHODS: Retrospective, single-center study including 43 patients undergoing EUS and EUS-FNA between August 2005 and January 2012. RESULTS: Fifty-one EUS procedures were performed in 43 patients, 30 girls, median age 14.5 (range 4-18). The most common indications were suspected biliary obstruction in 11 of 51 (22%), pancreatic cysts in 10 of 51 (20%), acute or recurrent pancreatitis in 9 of 51 (18%), and abdominal pain in 8 of 51 (16%). The most common findings of EUS included normal 11 of 51 (22%), pancreas cyst 6 of 51 (12%), pancreatic pseudocyst 5 of 51 (10%), biliary system sludge or stones 9 of 51 (18%), and acute and chronic pancreatitis 5 of 51 (10%). EUS-FNA was performed in 13 cases: 7 solid masses or nodes, 4 pancreatic pseudocyst, 1 pancreatic cyst, and 1 celiac plexus block. FNA cyst drainage was successful in resolving all 4 pancreatic pseudocysts. EUS prompted a surgical procedure in 13 cases (25%), ERCP in 5 cases (10%), and repeat EUS in 5 cases (10%). EUS led to a new diagnosis in 34 of 43 (79%) patients and prompted further intervention in 24 of 51 (47%) procedures. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort study, we found that EUS and EUS-guided interventions assist in diagnosing and altering clinical management in pediatric patients and should be considered in cases with vexing pancreaticobiliary disorders.},

This systematic review of studies looked at the efficacy of the gluten-free diet, physical activity, nutrient supplementation, and bisphosphonates for low bone density treatment. Case control and cohort designs were identified from PubMed and other academic databases (from 1996 to 2015) that observed newly diagnosed adults with CD for at least one year after diet treatment using the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. Only 20 out of 207 studies met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was assessed using the Strengthening of the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement checklist. Gluten-free diet adherence resulted in partial recovery of bone density by one year in all studies, and full recovery by the fifth year. No treatment differences were observed between the gluten-free diet alone and diet plus bisphosphonates in one study. For malnourished patients, supplementation with vitamin D and calcium resulted in significant improvement. Evidence for the impact of physical activity on bone density was limited. Therapeutic strategies aimed at modifying lifestyle factors throughout the lifespan should be studied.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Studies of adults and children with celiac disease have reported an increased risk of overweight during gluten-free diet (GFD). The fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) variant rs9939609 has been associated with increased risk of developing obesity in children and adults. METHODS: In our study, we analyzed the effect of this variant on weight gain in a cohort of 280 children with celiac disease on GFD. RESULTS: We found that after a mean follow-up time of 3.0 years on GFD, FTO polymorphism influenced significantly the mean change in body mass index z score (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the FTO gene contributes to determine weight changes in children with celiac disease on GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and emerging treatment options are hot topics in the celiac disease (CeD) scientific literature. However, very little is known about the perspective on these issues of CeD patients. METHODS: We performed a large patient survey among unselected CeD patients in Switzerland. RESULTS: A total of 1689 patients were analyzed. 57.5% have previously heard of NCGS. 64.5% believe in the existence of this entity. Regarding a potential influence of NCGS on CeD awareness, 31.7% show a positive and 27.5% a negative perception. Patients with prior use of alternative medicine and women more often have heard of and believe in the existence of NCGS vs. those never having used alternative methods and men, respectively (66.9 vs. 56.9%, p=0.001 and 78.5 vs. 69.0%, p=0.001; 60.7 vs. 44.2%, p<0.001 and 71.0 vs. 60.8%, p=0.002). Women and patients >/=30 years more often show a negative attitude towards NCGS (32.2% vs. 24.8%, p=0.024 and 32.2% vs. 24.2%, p=0.018). With regard to emerging treatment options for CeD, 43.3% have previously heard of novel agents, more women than men (46.0 vs. 38.0%, p=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Perception of and attitude towards NCGS differ depending on sex, age and prior use of alternative medicine. Knowledge of the progress towards emerging treatment options is currently limited.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pepsin-trypsin resistant gliadin (PT-gliadin) promotes intestinal tissue inflammation and increases paracellular permeability of immunogenic gliadin peptides into the lamina propria. This leads to the complications seen in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD). In this study, specific anti-gliadin IgY antibody was produced and evaluated for its efficacy on gliadin induced intestinal integrity impairment and proinflammatory effects on intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cell culture model for CD. METHODS: Caco-2 (passages 20-24) monolayers were subjected to 7 experimental conditions (n=3 each): phosphate buffered saline (PBS; control), pancreatic digested-casein (PD-casein; negative control), PT-gliadin (positive control), non-specific IgY with PT-gliadin, and anti-wheat gliadin IgY with PT-gliadin at a ratio of 1:6,000, 1:3,000 and 1:1,500. Caco-2 monolayers were then evaluated for effects of gliadin and/or anti-wheat gliadin IgY after 24 h exposure. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify anti-inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) 5 days after cells were exposed to PT-gliadin and/or anti-wheat gliadin IgY. RESULTS: Among other conditions, anti-wheat gliadin IgY at a ratio of 1:3,000 (anti-gliadin IgY: PT-gliadin) significantly prevented gliadin toxicity on Caco-2 by maintaining intestinal integrity, inhibiting phenol red permeation, and inhibiting gliadin absorption and production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) as compared to PT-gliadin stimulated cultures (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The anti-wheat gliadin IgY antibody produced in this study has proved to inhibit absorption of gliadin and gliadin-induced inflammatory response in Caco2 cell culture model of CD. Anti-gliadin IgY, therefore has potential to be used as an oral passive antibody therapy to treat CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of persistent villous atrophy (VA) in patients with celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD) varies greatly between studies. Most studies show a relatively high prevalence of mucosal atrophy and inflammation in treated patients, a finding which have led to a concept of non-responsive CD. Few studies have examined the prevalence of long-term mucosal healing. Our study aimed to determine the extent of mucosal healing in a cohort of Norwegian patients with CD treated with GFD for several years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with VA between 1989 and 2009 were included. We performed a follow-up gastroscopy with duodenal biopsies. Two pathologists evaluated the biopsies according to the Marsh-Oberhuber classification. Mucosal healing was defined as Marsh 0 while mucosal recovery was defined as Marsh 0-2. RESULTS: Duodenal biopsies were obtained from 127 adult patients with established CD. After a follow-up time of 8.1 years (median, range 2.3-22.3), 103 (81%) of the patients showed mucosal healing, 120 patients (94%) showed mucosal recovery, and 7 patients (6%) showed persistent VA. In addition, 103 of the 127 patients (81%) had undergone a routine follow-up biopsy 12.6 months (median, range 5.2-28.8) after diagnosis. At the time of the routine follow-up, only 52 of these patients (50.5%) had achieved mucosal recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Although half of the patients had persistent VA at the time of routine follow-up, both long-term mucosal recovery and healing is possible for the vast majority of adult patients with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Developing antigen-specific approaches for diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease requires a detailed understanding of the specificity of T cells for gluten. The existing paradigm is that T-cell lines and clones from children differ from those of adults in the hierarchy and diversity of peptide recognition. We aimed to characterize the T-cell response to gluten in children vs adults with celiac disease. METHODS: Forty-one children with biopsy-proven celiac disease (median age, 9 years old; 17 male), who had been on strict gluten-free diets for at least 3 months, were given a 3-day challenge with wheat; blood samples were collected and gluten-specific T cells were measured. We analyzed responses of T cells from these children and from 4 adults with celiac disease to a peptide library and measured T-cell receptor bias. We isolated T-cell clones that recognized dominant peptides and assessed whether gluten peptide recognition was similar between T-cell clones from children and adults. RESULTS: We detected gluten-specific responses by T cells from 30 of the children with celiac disease (73%). T cells from the children recognized the same peptides that were immunogenic to adults with celiac disease; deamidation of peptides increased these responses. Age and time since diagnosis did not affect the magnitude of T-cell responses to dominant peptides. T-cell clones specific for dominant alpha- or omega-gliadin peptides from children with celiac disease had comparable levels of reactivity to wheat, rye, and barley peptides as T-cell clones from adults with celiac disease. The alpha-gliadin-specific T cells from children had biases in T-cell receptor usage similar to those in adults. CONCLUSIONS: T cells from children with celiac disease recognize similar gluten peptides as T cells from adults with celiac disease. The findings indicate that peptide-based diagnostics and therapeutics for adults may also be used for children.},

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analytical study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Paediatrics, Benazir Bhutto Hospital, Rawalpindi, from February to July 2013. METHODOLOGY: Sixty patients aged 2 - 13 years, admitted in the Paediatric Department of Benazir Bhutto Hospital, Rawalpindi, having at least 3 features from chronic diarrhea, malnutrition, short stature, anemia, abdominal distension and clubbing, were included. Age, gender, weight and height were recorded. Abdominal distension and clubbing were clinically noted. For hemoglobin, blood complete picture was done. For determination of nutritional status and short stature, standard centile charts were used. TTG titer upper GI endoscopy, duodenal biopsy, and histopathology were done in all cases. RESULTS: There were 60 patients; 32 males, 28 females with mean age of 5.85 &amp;plusmn;3.36 years. Frequency of CD was 63.33% in study population. Sensitivity of TTG was 86.84%, with 81.82% specificity, 89.19% positive predictive value, and 78.26% negative predictive value for diagnosing CD. TTG titre more than 50 iu/ml had a 100% positive predictive value. CONCLUSION: TTG is an excellent screening test for the diagnosis of paediatric CD. TTG value &amp;gt; 50 IU/ml has 100% positive predictive value.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Clinical experience suggests that atherosclerotic disease is common in individuals with coeliac disease, but epidemiological studies have had contradicting findings. To summarise the currently available evidence, we systematically reviewed and analysed observational studies of the association of coeliac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis with coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke. DATA SYNTHESIS: We searched for studies comparing CHD or stroke outcomes with individuals with and without coeliac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis. Three investigators independently searched electronic databases, identified relevant studies and extracted data. Study-specific results were combined in random-effects meta-analyses, and heterogeneity was quantified using the I(2) statistic and meta-regression. Twenty-one studies were included in our systematic review and 18 in the meta-analyses. For CHD, the pooled hazard ratio for incident disease was 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93, 1.19) and the overall standardised mortality ratio was 1.21 (0.99, 1.49). For stroke and brain haemorrhage, the corresponding estimates were 1.10 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.21) and 1.43 (0.97, 2.10), respectively. There was moderate to considerable heterogeneity among the study-specific estimates. In addition, many estimates were based on small numbers of outcomes and they had limitations in terms of adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analyses lend some support to an association between coeliac disease and CHD or cerebrovascular disease, but the evidence base was heterogeneous and had limitations. Our systematic review highlighted a need in this area for adequately powered prospective studies with appropriate adjustment for potentially confounding factors.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Celiac disease, an autoimmune disease induced by dietary gluten, is associated with metabolic bone disorders, such as low bone mineral density. However, it is unclear whether this translates into an association between celiac disease and such hard clinical outcomes as bone fractures. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and pool the evidence for the relationship of celiac disease with prevalence and incidence of bone fractures. DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library in January 2014 for studies of celiac disease and bone fractures. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies of any design, in which bone fracture outcomes were compared in individuals with and without celiac disease were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently extracted results from eligible studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the meta-analyses of case-control and cross-sectional studies, bone fractures were almost twice as common in individuals with a clinically diagnosed celiac disease as in those without the disease. In the meta-analyses of prospective studies, celiac disease at baseline was associated with a 30% increase (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14, 1.50) in the risk of any fracture and a 69% increase in the risk of hip fracture (95% CI: 1.10, 2.59). The two studies of unrecognized celiac disease (elevated circulating concentrations of celiac disease-specific autoantibodies but no celiac disease diagnosis) had contradicting findings. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that clinically diagnosed celiac disease and bone fractures co-occur and that celiac disease was associated with an increased risk of hip fractures as well as fractures in general. Further research would be needed to determine whether unrecognized celiac disease is associated with the risk of bone fractures.},

   abstract = {Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EOE) is a relatively recently recognised condition characterised by an increase in oesophageal eosinophils. EOE occurs in children and adults with a strong male preponderance. There has been a sharp increase in EOE in North America, Europe and Australia. The reasons for this increase remain unclear but are likely to be influenced by genetic and environmental factors, as well as early-life exposures. Based on recent population-based data, the estimated EOE prevalence in the USA is 56.7 per 100,000 persons. The peak prevalence was observed in patients between 35 and 39 years of age. Prevalence figures in Asia and the Middle East generally appear to be lower than in Western countries, but population-based studies are not available. A causal association between coeliac disease and EOE appears unlikely. Data on the seasonal variation of EOE remain inconclusive. Further population-based studies are needed to define the epidemiology of EOE.},

   abstract = {Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is an antigen-driven pan-oesophagitis that is defined by the presence of at least 15 eosinophils per high power field on oesophageal histology in conjunction with upper gastrointestinal symptoms. EoE is closely associated with atopic disorders, in particular with food allergy, and as for other atopic diseases in childhood, there is a strong preponderance of male patients who have this disorder. The mechanisms leading to EoE have been characterised at the molecular level. Eotaxin-3, interleukin-5 and interleukin-13 are the key effector molecules in EoE pathogenesis. EoE presents with a diverse range of gastrointestinal symptoms, including regurgitation, vomiting, feeding difficulties or feeding refusal in infancy, as well as heartburn, dysphagia and food bolus impaction in older children and adults. The diagnosis may also be ascertained as an incidental finding in patients undergoing gastroscopy for other suspected conditions, including coeliac disease. EoE is different from gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and does not improve in response to proton pump inhibitors. Therefore, EoE needs to be distinguished from so-called PPI-responsive oesophageal eosinophilia. The long-term prognosis of EoE remains poorly defined, and complications mainly relate to subepithelial remodelling and fibrosis that may result in dysmotility, dysphagia and oesophageal strictures. The treatment of EoE involves elimination diets and topical swallowed aerosolised corticosteroids, while biological therapies targeting molecular mechanisms have so far been unsuccessful. In children, elemental diets have proved highly effective, but multiple food elimination diets are more sustainable in the long term. Further randomised, controlled trials on dietary or pharmacological interventions are needed to inform the optimal long-term management of EoE.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested that hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines may be less immunogenic in individuals with celiac disease (CD). A pre-S vaccine (Sci-B-Vac) has demonstrated superior immunogenicity compared with standard HBV vaccines in several diseases. We compared the short-term immunogenicity of a pre-S vaccine with a HBV vaccine (Engerix B) for repeat vaccination of seronegative, previously immunized patients with CD. METHODS: Participants were 1 to 18-year-old children with CD who despite standard HBV vaccines in infancy had nonprotective hepatitis B surface antibody (HBs-Ab) concentrations (</=10 mIU/mL). Patients were randomized to receive either Engerix B or pre-S vaccine. HBs-Ab concentrations were measured 1 month after the first dose. For those who had not responded after 1 dose, measurement was repeated after the third dose. RESULTS: Children (n = 82) were analyzed (42 pre-S vaccine and 40 Engerix B). Baseline characteristics were similar for both groups, including gluten-free diet status. Both arms showed high response rates following the first injection: 41 (98%) versus 35 (87%) for pre-S vaccine and Engerix B recipients, respectively (P = 0.08). All other patients responded when measured after dose 3. HBs-Ab concentrations (mIU/mL) were higher in the pre-S vaccine group (median 925, interquartile range [IQR] 424-1000) than the Engerix B group (median 363, IQR 106-996, P = 0.005). Twenty (48%) of the pre-S vaccine recipients were "high responders" (>1000 mIU/mL) versus 10 (25%) in Engerix B recipients (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Both vaccines elicited adequate booster responses in most previously vaccinated patients with CD with nonprotective HBs-Ab concentrations. Pre-S vaccine administration resulted in higher Hbs-Ab concentrations. Our data suggest that a single dose of either vaccine is sufficient to raise titers to protective levels in most patients with CD.},

   abstract = {Dietary exclusion of gluten-containing products has become increasingly popular in the general population, and currently approximately 30% of people in the United States are limiting gluten ingestion. Although celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy (WA), and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) constitute a spectrum of gluten-related disorders that require exclusion of gluten from the diet, together these account for a relatively small percentage of those following a gluten-free diet, and the vast majority has no medical necessity for doing so. Differentiating between CD, WA, and NCGS has important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Because of the protean manifestations of gluten-related disorders, it is not possible to differentiate between them on clinical grounds alone. This clinical report will compare and contrast the manifestations of gluten-related disorders, emphasize the importance of differentiating between these conditions, discuss initial and subsequent tests needed to confirm the diagnosis, and provide recommendations on treatment and follow-up for each condition.},

   abstract = {To identify parental influences affecting micronutrient supplementation in children and adolescents (2-18 years of age) with Celiac Disease (CD), a multi-method (survey, focus groups) study was conducted. A 35-item questionnaire consisting of open- and closed-ended questions was launched nationally via Canadian Celiac Association internet sites. Five focus groups were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. The survey and semi-structured interview guide content was vetted for face and content validity. Thematic analyses were conducted on the focus group content and open-ended survey questions, and chi(2) and Fischer's exact analysis were performed on closed-ended survey data. Survey respondents were predominantly mothers (97%) of female children (80 F, 49 M) between the ages of 9-12 (31%) with CD, residing in western provinces (55%) with a combined family income >/=$100 000/year (63%). Seventy-seven percent of parental respondent's children or adolescents consumed micronutrient supplements, for 1-5 years (52%), 7 days a week (65%), as both multi-vitamin and single vitamin preparations (40%). Parental influences on child micronutrient use included health beliefs and knowledge, parental supplement use, supplement characteristics, age of child (above or below 13 years), household routines, and provincial residential status (P < 0.05). Parents relied on health professional recommendation (69%; MD, RD) and the internet (21%) as sources of information regarding child micronutrient supplementation. Parental health beliefs and knowledge, socio-demographic factors, and practitioner recommendation influence micronutrient supplement use in children and adolescents with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intestinal exposure to gliadin leads to zonulin upregulation and consequent disassembly of intercellular tight junctions and increased intestinal permeability. We aimed to study response to gliadin exposure, in terms of barrier function and cytokine secretion, using intestinal biopsies obtained from four groups: celiac patients with active disease (ACD), celiac patients in remission (RCD), non-celiac patients with gluten sensitivity (GS) and non-celiac controls (NC). METHODS: Ex-vivo human duodenal biopsies were mounted in microsnapwells and luminally incubated with either gliadin or media alone. Changes in transepithelial electrical resistance were monitored over 120 min. Media was subsequently collected and cytokines quantified. RESULTS: Intestinal explants from all groups (ACD (n = 6), RCD (n = 6), GS (n = 6), and NC (n = 5)) demonstrated a greater increase in permeability when exposed to gliadin vs. media alone. The increase in permeability in the ACD group was greater than in the RCD and NC groups. There was a greater increase in permeability in the GS group compared to the RCD group. There was no difference in permeability between the ACD and GS groups, between the RCD and NC groups, or between the NC and GS groups. IL-10 was significantly greater in the media of the NC group compared to the RCD and GS groups. CONCLUSIONS: Increased intestinal permeability after gliadin exposure occurs in all individuals. Following gliadin exposure, both patients with gluten sensitivity and those with active celiac disease demonstrate a greater increase in intestinal permeability than celiacs in disease remission. A higher concentration of IL-10 was measured in the media exposed to control explants compared to celiac disease in remission or gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Celiac disease, an immunological response triggered by gluten, affects ~1 % of the Western population. Information concerning gluten intake in the general population is scarce. We determined intake of gluten from wheat, barley, rye and oat in the Danish National Survey of Diet and Physical Activity 2005-2008. The study population comprised a random cross-sectional sample of 1494 adults 20-75 years, selected from the Danish Civil Registration System. METHODS: Protein content in wheat, rye, barley and oat was determined from the National Danish Food Composition Table and multiplied with the amount of cereal used in recipes. Amount of gluten was calculated as amount of cereal protein x0.80 for wheat and oat, x0.65 for rye and x0.50 for barley. Dietary intake was recorded daily during seven consecutive days in pre-coded food diaries with open-answer possibilities. RESULTS: Mean total gluten intake was 10.4 +/- 4.4 g/day (10th-90th percentiles; 5.4-16.2 g/day), in men 12.0 +/- 4.6 g/day and 9.0 +/- 3.4 g/day in women. It was higher among men than among women in all age groups (20-75 years; P < 0.0001); however, this difference was eliminated when adjusting for energy intake. Intake of different gluten sources tended to be higher in men than in women with the exception of gluten from barley. Total gluten intake decreased with increasing age (P < 0.0001) as did gluten intake from wheat (P < 0.0001), whereas intake of gluten from rye (P < 0.0001) and barley (P = 0.001) increased with increasing age, also when adjusted for energy intake or body weight. CONCLUSION: This study presents representative population-based data on gluten intake in Danish adults. Total gluten intake decreased with increasing age.},

A detailed characterisation of five gluten-free starches (corn, wheat, rice, tapioca, potato) was performed in this study. In addition, the influence of these starches, with different compositional and morphological properties, was evaluated on a simple gluten-free model bread system. The morphological characterisation, evaluated using scanning electron microscopy, revealed some similarities among the starches, which could be linked to the baking performance of the breads. Moreover, the lipid content, though representing one of the minor components in starch, was found to have an influence on pasting, bread making, and staling. Quality differences in cereal root and tuber starch based breads were observed. However, under the baking conditions used, gluten-free rendered wheat starch performed best, followed by potato starch, in terms of loaf volume and cell structure. Tapioca starch and rice starch based breads were not further analysed, due to an inferior baking performance. This is the first study to evaluate gluten-free starch on a simple model bread system.},

Instead of enzymatic hydrolysis, in this study we investigated metal-catalyzed oxidation of two model peptides, QQPFP, and PQPQLPY, together with a hordein isolate from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). We established a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) LC-MS method to detect and quantify proline oxidation fragments. In addition to fragmentation, aggregation and side chain modifications were identified, including free thiol loss, carbonyl formation, and dityrosine formation. The immunoreactivity of the oxidized hordein isolate was considerably decreased in all metal-catalyzed oxidation systems. Cleavage of peptides or protein fragments at the numerous proline residues partially accounts for the decrease. Metal-catalyzed oxidation can thus be used in the modification and elimination of celiac-toxic peptides and proteins.},

Sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses revealed novel allelic variation at Gli-2 loci of species of Sitopsis and regular organization of motifs in their repetitive domain. Based on the comprehensive analyses of a large number of known sequences of bread wheat and its diploid genome progenitors, the distributions of four T cell epitopes and length variations of two polyglutamine domains are analyzed. Additionally, according to the organization of repeat motifs, we classified the alpha-gliadins of Triticum and Aegilops into eight types. Their most recent common ancestor and putative divergence patterns were further considered.

   abstract = {The rabbit, which is widely used as an experimental animal and is also popular as a companion animal, has a flat and elongated spleen with the longitudinal hilus running along its visceral surface. The spleen receives via the hilus an arterial supply that is essential for splenic nutrition and normal functioning. However, the distribution and variation of the arteries to the spleen have not been studied in detail. This study investigated anatomical variations of splenic arterial supply in 33 New Zealand White rabbits with a colored latex injection into arteries. We also examined whether the length of the spleen correlated with the number of the splenic branches of the splenic artery. The splenic artery always arose as the first independent branch of the celiac artery and ran along the splenic hilus to usually provide 6 (range, 3 to 10) splenic branches to the spleen. There was a moderate correlation (R=0.6) between the number of splenic branches and the longitudinal length of the spleen. The splenic branches often arose as a trunk or trunks in common with short gastric arteries. The number of common trunk(s) was usually 1 (range, 0 to 4). The data showed that the pattern and number of arterial branches to the spleen varied according to the individual animal, suggesting that such variations should be considered when performing experimental and veterinary surgical treatments in rabbits.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition associated with chronic inflammation of the small intestine, which can lead to malabsorption of nutrients. Dietary proteins, known as glutens, which are present in wheat, barley and rye activate an abnormal mucosal immune response. Clinical and histological improvements usually follow when gluten is excluded from the diet. Coeliac disease can present with a wide range of clinical features, both gastrointestinal (such as indigestion, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bloating, distension or constipation) and non-gastrointestinal (such as fatigue, dermatitis herpetiformis, anaemia, osteoporosis, reproductive problems, short stature, neuropathy, ataxia or delayed puberty). Although some people present with typical symptoms, others have few or no symptoms. People with autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease, or people with a first-degree family history of coeliac disease, have an increased likelihood of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Limited pediatric data exist examining the trend and predictors of anti-tissue transglutaminase (atTG) normalization over time in children with celiac disease (CD). We aimed to evaluate time to normalization of atTG in children after CD diagnosis, and to assess for independent predictors impacting this duration. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was completed in pediatric CD patients diagnosed from 2007 to 2014 at the Stollery Children's Hospital Celiac Clinic (Edmonton, Alberta). The clinical predictors assessed for impact on time to atTG normalization were: initial atTG, Marsh score at diagnosis, gluten free diet compliance (GFDC), age at diagnosis, gender, ethnicity, medical comorbidities, and family history of CD. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was completed to assess time to atTG normalization, and Cox regression to assess for independent predictors of this time. RESULTS: 487 patients met inclusion criteria. 80.5% of patients normalized atTG levels. Median normalization time was 407 days for all patients (95% CI [361-453]), and 364 days for GFD compliant patients (95% CI [335-393]). Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients took significantly longer to normalize at 1204 days (95% CI [199-2209], p < 0.001). Cox regression demonstrated T1DM (HR = 0.36 [0.24-0.55], p < 0.001) and higher baseline atTG (HR = 0.52 [0.43 - 0.63], p < 0.001) were significant predictors of longer atTG normalization time. GFDC was a significant predictor of earlier normalization (OR = 13.91 [7.86-24.62], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: GFDC and lower atTG at diagnosis are predictors of earlier normalization. Patients with T1DM are less likely to normalize atTG levels, with longer normalization time. Additional research and education for higher-risk populations is needed.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune reaction to gluten, leading to intestinal inflammation, villous atrophy, and malabsorption. It is the most common autoimmune gastrointestinal disorder, with an increasing prevalence. A life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) is an effective treatment to alleviate symptoms, normalize autoantibodies, and heal the intestinal mucosa in patients with CD. Poorly controlled CD poses a significant concern for ongoing malabsorption, growth restriction, and the long-term concern of intestinal lymphoma. Achieving GFD compliance and long-term disease control poses a challenge, with adolescents at particular risk for high rates of noncompliance. Attention has turned toward innovative management strategies to improve adherence and achieve better disease control. One such strategy is the development of multidisciplinary clinic approach, and CD is a complex life-long disease state that would benefit from a multifaceted team approach as recognized by multiple national and international bodies, including the National Institutes of Health. Utilizing the combined efforts of the pediatric gastroenterologist, registered dietitian, registered nurse, and primary care provider (general practitioner or general pediatrician) in a CD multidisciplinary clinic model will be of benefit for patients and families in optimizing diagnosis, provision of GFD teaching, and long-term adherence to a GFD. This paper discusses the benefits and proposed structure for multidisciplinary care in improving management of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gluten-free foods have increased in popularity over the past decade and are now being consumed by individuals without celiac disease. However, the physiologic effects of gluten intake in individuals without celiac disease remain unknown. High-abundance plasma proteins involved in inflammation, endothelial function, and other physiologic pathways may represent potential biomarkers of biological effects of gluten intake. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the association between gluten intake and plasma proteomic biomarkers in a population of adults without clinically diagnosed celiac disease. METHODS: Subjects (n = 1095) were participants of the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study, a cross-sectional examination of young adults aged 20-29 y. Dietary gluten intake was estimated by using a 1-mo, 196-item semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. The concentrations of 54 plasma proteins were measured simultaneously by liquid chromatography/multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. The association between gluten intake and each proteomic biomarker was examined by using general linear models. Analyses were then conducted in individuals who do not have the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or DQ8 risk variants required for the development of celiac disease to determine whether any associations observed could have been due to undiagnosed cases of celiac disease. RESULTS: Increased gluten intake was associated with increased concentrations of plasma alpha2-macroglobulin (P = 0.01), a marker of inflammation and cytokine release. The association remained after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, ethnicity, physical activity, energy intake, fiber intake, and hormonal contraceptive use among women. This relation was not modified by HLA risk variants. CONCLUSION: Gluten consumption is associated with increased plasma alpha2-macroglobulin in young adults, which appears to be independent of celiac disease, suggesting possible effects of gluten on inflammation.},

To evaluate the serum concentrations of insulin, ghrelin, adiponectin, leptin, leptin receptor, and lipocalin-2 in children with celiac disease who do and do not adhere to a gluten-free diet (GFD, intermittent adherence). METHODS: Prepubertal, pubertal, and adolescent celiac children were included in this study (74 girls and 53 boys on a GFD and 80 girls and 40 boys off of a GFD). RESULTS: Insulin levels in prepubertal (9.01+/-4.43 muIU/mL), pubertal (10.3+/-3.62 muIU/mL), and adolescent (10.8+/-4.73 muIU/mL) girls were higher than those in boys (5.88+/-2.02, 8.81+/-2.88, and 8.81+/-2.26 muIU/mL, respectively) and were neither age-dependent nor influenced by a GFD. Prepubertal children off of a GFD exhibited higher ghrelin levels than prepubertal children on a GFD. Adiponectin levels were not age-, sex- nor GFD-dependent. Adherence to a GFD had no effect on the expression of leptin, leptin receptor, and lipocalin-2. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to a GFD had no influence on the adiponectin, leptin, leptin receptor, and lipocalin-2 concentrations in celiac children, but a GFD decreased highly elevated ghrelin levels in prepubertal children. Further studies are required to determine whether increased insulin concentrations in girls with celiac disease is suggestive of an increased risk for hyperinsulinemia.},

Two patients, one of them with IgA deficiency, were successfully treated by complete gluten exclusion with enteral nutrition. However the third child with a severe coeliac disease did not achieve clinical and histologic improvement, even on immunosuppressive treatment. If no hidden sources of gluten can be identified, other causes of persistent villous atrophy, dierent from coeliac disease, have to be considered. They include e.g. inflammatory, immune and endocrine diseases of the digestive tract. In severe cases of childhood coeliac disease not responding to a gluten free diet, autoimmune enteropathy and refractory coeliac disease must be taken into account.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Persistent viral infections have been implicated in the etiology of autoimmune diseases in adulthood, but it is not known whether herpesviruses are associated with the development of celiac disease autoimmunity in childhood. We assessed whether herpesvirus infections are associated with transglutaminase type 2 antibody (TG2A) concentrations in children at 6 years of age. METHODS: The present study was embedded within a population-based prospective cohort study. Serum immunoglobulin G levels against Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus type 1 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , and TG2A concentrations with fluorescence enzyme immunoassay in 4420 children at 6 years of age. Children were categorized based on TG2A concentrations into negative (<7 U/mL), positive (>/=7-70 U/mL), and strongly positive (>/=70 U/mL), that is, 10 times upper limit normal. RESULTS: Fifty-nine children (1.3%) were TG2A positive, and of these 31 (53%) had concentrations 70 U/mL or more. Children with TG2A concentrations 70 U/mL or more were less often infected with CMV (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.38, 95% CI 0.14-0.98, P = 0.04) and with any of the 3 viruses (aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.78, P < 0.01) than children with TG2A negative concentrations. In addition, children with TG2A concentrations 70 U/mL or more were less often infected with 2 or more viruses than children with TG2A negative concentrations (aOR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03-0.65, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Both CMV single infection and combined CMV, Epstein-Barr virus and/or herpes simplex virus type 1 infections are inversely associated with strongly TG2A positivity. This may indicate a protective effect of herpesvirus infections in the pathogenesis of celiac disease autoimmunity.},

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of the UofC Celiac Center clinic charts from January 2002 to October 2014. Demographics, serologic testing, intestinal biopsies, and extra-intestinal symptoms at presentation, 12, 24, and greater than 24 months were recorded. Extra-intestinal symptoms included: abnormal liver enzymes, arthralgia/arthritis, dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), alopecia, fatigue, headache, anemia, stomatitis, myalgias, psychiatric disorders, rashes, seizures, neuropathy, short stature, delayed puberty, osteoporosis and infertility. RESULTS: A total of 737 patients with biopsy confirmed CeD or skin biopsy confirmed DH were included. Patients lost to follow up, or with insufficient data were excluded leaving 328 patients (157 pediatrics < 18 years). For pediatrics, the female to male ratio was 2:1 and the mean age at diagnosis was 8.9 years old. For adults, 4:1 and 40.6 years old. Extra-intestinal symptom rates were similar in children (60%) and adults (62%). Short stature (33%), fatigue (28%) and headache (20%) were most common in children. Iron deficiency anemia (48%), fatigue (37%) and headache/psychiatric disorders (24%) in adults. Children had faster/higher rates of symptom resolution compared to adults. Twenty-eight percent of children with unresolved short stature on a GFD were found to have other comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adults with CeD have similar rates of extra-intestinal manifestations. In children short stature, fatigue and headache were most common while anemia, fatigue and headache/psychiatric disorders were most common in adults. Children on a strict GFD showed faster and higher rates of symptom resolution as compared to adults. Unresponsive children with short stature must be assessed for comorbidities.},

It affects approximately 1% of the world population, which is a very high prevalence, affects all age groups and has symptoms both digestive and extra-digestive. Since it is a disease that requires maintaining a gluten-free diet and medical monitoring for life, it is important to know it and establish its diagnosis properly. Along with celiac disease a number of new diseases related to gluten are diagnosed increasingly, including the non celiac gluten sensitivity or wheat allergy. The suffering of celiac disease, or other related diseases, by conditioning diet changes of the affected individual, it may be associated with nutritional imbalances that need to monitor and try to solve.

   abstract = {The intestinal barrier function contributes to gut homeostasis by modulating absorption of water, electrolytes, and nutrients from the lumen into the circulation while restricting the passage of noxious luminal substances and microorganisms. Chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease are associated to intestinal barrier dysfunction. Here, the hypothesis is that a leaky intestinal wall allowing for indiscriminate passage of intraluminal compounds to the vascular compartment could in turn lead to systemic inflammation. An increasing number of studies are now investigating the association between gut permeability and CNS disorders, under the premise that translocation of intestinal luminal contents could affect CNS function, either directly or indirectly. Still, it is unknown whether disruption of intestinal barrier is a causative agent or a consequence in these situations. Here, we discuss the latest evidence pointing to an association between increased gut permeability and disrupted behavioral responses.},

   abstract = {We investigated the association between celiac disease (CD) and bone mass density (BMD) and risk of osteoporotic fractures in the general US population. In children and men >/=18 years, CD was associated with reduced BMD, and in men >/=40 years, CD was associated with increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition, characterized by inflammation of the small intestine. CD has an increasing prevalence, and if unrecognized or untreated, CD can lead to complications from malabsorption and micronutrient deficiencies. We aimed to study whether CD is an independent predictor of reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and FRAX scores in the general US population. METHODS: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009-2010 and 2013-2014. CD was defined by positive tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody test. Multivariable models of BMD and FRAX scores were adjusted for BMI, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, vitamin D and calcium supplements, milk intake, serum calcium, and smoking status, when available. RESULTS: In children, aged 8-17 years, CD was associated with decreased Z-scores, by 0.85 for hip and 0.46 for spine (both P < 0.001). In men aged >/= 18 years, CD was associated with 0.06 g/cm2 decrease in BMD in hip and with 0.11 g/cm2 decrease in BMD in spine (P = 0.08 and P < 0.001, respectively). In women, there were no statistically significant differences in the multiple-adjusted model. In men aged >/= 40 years, CD predicted FRAX scores, resulting in increased scores by 2.25 % (P = 0.006) for hip fracture and by 2.43 % (P = 0.05) for major osteoporotic fracture. CD did not predict FRAX scores in women aged >/=40 years. CONCLUSION: CD is independently associated with reduced BMD in children and adults aged >/=18 years and is an independent risk factor of osteoporotic fractures in men aged >/=40 years.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) remains sometimes difficult because the histological criteria are not fully met. The aim of this study was to refine histological diagnostic criteria of CD. METHODS: One hundred seventy-five duodenal bulb D1 (n = 79) and duodenal D2 (n = 96) biopsies of 96 patients with CD (58 girls, mean age 7 years), 135 normal D2 biopsies (69 girls, mean age 12 years), and 64 D2 biopsies of other digestive disorders (DDs) (39 girls, mean age 13 years) obtained from children during a period of 4 years were reviewed. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was greater for the classification of Corazza-Villanacci than for Marsh-Oberhuber (kappa = 0.812 vs kappa = 0.409, respectively). Between 40 and 70 intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) per 100 epithelial cells (ECs), 32% of patients were CD, whereas 50% had other DD. Above 70 IELs per 100 EC, 53% were CD, and only 6% had other DD. In CD, IELs were significantly located above EC nuclei compared with other DD, (12 IELs/100 EC vs 2 IELs/100 EC, respectively). In 21% of CD cases, D2 were normal and the diagnosis could only be made on D1. Finally, 6% of CD cases showed isolated increase of IELs in D1 without architectural modification. CONCLUSIONS: D1 allowed diagnosis of CD in 21% of cases and IEL >70 per 100 EC correlated strongly with CD. Between 40 and 70 IELs per 100 EC, CD is very likely but other DD must be considered. Finally, the preferential localisation of IELs above EC nuclei favours CD, and increased IEL in D1 may be the sole abnormality.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the authors of epidemiological studies have documented that autoimmune diseases are a major problem of modern society and are classified as diseases of civilization. Autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATDs) are caused by an abnormal immune response to autoantigens present in the thyroid gland - they often coexist with other autoimmune diseases. The most common dysfunctions of the thyroid gland are hypothyroidism, Graves-Basedow disease and Hashimoto's disease. Hashimoto's thyroiditis can be the main cause of primary hypothyroidism of the thyroid gland. Anthropometric, biochemical and physicochemical parameters are used to assess the nutritional status during the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid diseases. Patients with hypothyroidism are often obese, whereas patients with hyperthyroidism are often afflicted with rapid weight loss. The consequence of obesity is a change of the thyroid hormones' activity; however, weight reduction leads to their normalization. The activity and metabolic rate of thyroid hormones are modifiable. ATDs are associated with abnormalities of glucose metabolism and thus increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2. Celiac disease (CD) also increases the risk of developing other autoimmune diseases. Malnutrition or the presence of numerous nutritional deficiencies in a patient's body can be the cause of thyroid disorders. Coexisting deficiencies of such elements as iodine, iron, selenium and zinc may impair the function of the thyroid gland. Other nutrient deficiencies usually observed in patients suffering from ATD are: protein deficiencies, vitamin deficiencies (A, C, B6, B5, B1) and mineral deficiencies (phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, sodium, chromium). Proper diet helps to reduce the symptoms of the disease, maintains a healthy weight and prevents the occurrence of malnutrition. This article presents an overview of selected documented studies and scientific reports on the relationship of metabolic disorders and nutritional status with the occurrence of ATD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The in vitro gluten challenge test is an important diagnostic modality in celiac disease (CD), especially in patients who begin treatment with a gluten-free diet before adequate diagnostic workup or in cases with atypical CD. Available literature was reviewed regarding the accuracy of the in vitro gluten challenge test for CD diagnosis. METHODS: MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched, and studies that used serology and bowel biopsy as the criterion standard for diagnosis were included in our study. Data on authors, publication year, characteristics of the patient and control groups, patients' diet, duration of the gluten challenge test, histology findings, endomysial antibody (EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) levels, CD markers, and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, and human leukocyte antigens before and after the gluten challenge test were extracted. RESULTS: Overall, 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity %/specificity % was 84/99 for EMA after the challenge, 52/96 for EMA without the challenge, 95.5/98.3 for anti-tTG after the challenge, and 95.1/98.3 for anti-tTG without the challenge test. Sensitivity/specificity for immunological markers were 89/97 for the percentage of CD25(+)-lamina propria lymphocytes, 96/91 for the percentage of CD3(+)-lamina propria lymphocytes, and 96.1/85.7 for the percentage of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1-lamina propria lymphocytes. The factors that increased the sensitivity of EMA were longer test duration, and the evaluation of patients on a gluten-containing diet or short-term gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro gluten challenge test can be a useful part of the diagnostic workup of CD, rather than only a model to evaluate its mechanisms.},

The pathogenesis of CD is not clearly understood and is probably attributed to genomic variations and host genetic make-up. Case-control and cohort studies of the association between the TNF-alpha -308 G > A (rs1800629) polymorphism and CD susceptibility have yielded inconsistent results. In this study, PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar web-databases were searched for pertinent reports showing association of TNF-alpha -308 G > A gene with CD risk. A total of eleven reports involving 1774 controls and 1147 CD cases were included. Significant associations in four genetic models, viz. variant allele (A vs. G: p = 0.001; OR = 2.051, 95% CI = 1.452-2.895), variant homozygous (AA vs. GG: p = 0.001; OR = 6.626, 95% CI = 3.569-12.300), recessive (AA vs. GG + AG: p = 0.001; OR = 4.766, 95% CI = 3.177-7.152) and dominant (AA + AG vs. GG: p = 0.008; OR = 1.910, 95% CI = 1.181-3.088) were found in comparison with wild type homozygous GG genotype. However, heterozygous genetic model did not show any association. Sensitivity analysis revealed stable and statistically robust results. Our results suggest that TNF-alpha -308 G > A gene polymorphism significantly contributes to CD susceptibility.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease that can be complicated by impaired nutrition and growth. With the development of sensitive serologic tests, safe endoscopy, and efforts to educate primary care physicians, more children are diagnosed as having CD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the pattern of the presentation of pediatric CD in western New York. METHODS: Chart review of pediatric patients with CD was undertaken. Patients' demographics, presenting features, disaccharidase assay (DA), celiac serology, and Marsh score were reviewed from patients seen at the Digestive Diseases and Nutrition Center, State University of New York at Buffalo from January 2003 through March 2013. RESULTS: A total of 165 patients with CD were evaluated. Mean age was 10.7 +/- 4.3 years, 76 male patients. The presenting features were abdominal pain (n = 87, 52.7%), constipation (n = 65, 38.9%), diarrhea (n = 52, 31.1%), family history of first-degree relative (n = 47, 28.1%), diabetes mellitus type 1 (n = 37, 22.2%), failure to thrive (n = 36, 21.8%), reflux (n = 25, 15.1%), vomiting (n = 24, 14.5%), fatigue (n = 15, 9%), short stature (n = 9, 5.4%), thyroid disease (n = 9, 5.4%), Down syndrome (n = 8, 4.8%). We found no correlation between Marsh score and serum tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin (Ig) A level at diagnosis and no correlation between DA and serum tTG IgA level, presenting feature and tTG IgA level, presenting feature and Marsh score, tTG IgA and DA, or between the age and the presenting feature. CONCLUSIONS: Children newly diagnosed as having CD in western New York presented most frequently with abdominal pain and constipation and were older at the time of diagnosis than those described in the classical presentation of CD. We speculate that our patients may have a different long-term natural history and risk factors than originally described for patients with CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES AND STUDY: In the development of Celiac Disease (CD) both genetic and environmental factors play a crucial role. The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 loci are strongly related to the disease and are necessary but not sufficient for the development of CD. Therefore, increasing interest lies in examining the mechanisms of CD onset from the early beginning. Differences in serum and urine metabolic profiles between healthy individuals and CD patients have been reported previously. We aimed to investigate if the metabolic pathways were already altered in young, 4 month old infants, preceding the CD diagnosis. METHODS: Serum samples were available for 230 four month old infants of the PreventCD project, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, dietary intervention study. All children were positive for HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 and had at least one first-degree relative diagnosed with CD. Amino acids were quantified after derivatization with liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and polar lipid concentrations (acylcarnitines, lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelins) were determined with direct infusion MS/MS. We investigated the association of the metabolic profile with (1) the development of CD up to the age of 8 years (yes/no), (2) with HLA-risk groups, (3) with the age at CD diagnosis, using linear mixed models and cox proportional hazards models. Gender, intervention group, and age at blood withdrawal were included as potential confounder. RESULTS: By the end of 2014, thirty-three out of the 230 children (14%) were diagnosed with CD according to the ESPGHAN criteria. Median age at diagnosis was 3.4 years (IQR, 2.4-5.2). Testing each metabolite for a difference in the mean between healthy and CD children, we (1) could not identify a discriminant analyte or a pattern pointing towards an altered metabolism (Bonferroni corrected P > 0.05 for all). Metabolite concentrations (2) did not differ across the HLA-risk groups. When investigating the age at diagnosis using (3) survival models, we found no evidence for an association between the metabolic profile and the risk of a later CD diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The metabolic profile at 4 months of age was not predictive for the development of CD up to the age of 8 years. Our results suggest that metabolic pathways reflected in serum are affected only later in life and that the HLA-genotype does not influence the serum metabolic profile in young infants before introduction of solid food.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract consists of an enormous surface area that is optimized to efficiently absorb nutrients, water, and electrolytes from food. At the same time, it needs to provide a tight barrier against the ingress of harmful substances, and protect against a reaction to omnipresent harmless compounds. A dysfunctional intestinal barrier is associated with various diseases and disorders. In this review, the role of intestinal permeability in common disorders such as infections with intestinal pathogens, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and food allergies will be discussed. In addition, the effect of the frequently prescribed drugs proton pump inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on intestinal permeability, as well as commonly used methods to assess barrier function will be reviewed.},

   abstract = {Man began to consume cereals approximately 10,000 years ago when hunter-gatherers settled in the fertile golden crescent in the Middle East. Gluten has been an integral part of the Western type of diet ever since, and wheat consumption is also common in the Middle East, parts of India and China as well as Australia and Africa. In fact, the food supply in the world heavily depends on the availability of cereal-based food products, with wheat being one of the largest crops in the world. Part of this is due to the unique properties of wheat gluten, which has a high nutritional value and is crucial for the preparation of high-quality dough. In the last 10 years, however, wheat and gluten have received much negative attention. Many believe that it is inherently bad for our health and try to avoid consumption of gluten-containing cereals; a gluten-low lifestyle so to speak. This is fueled by a series of popular publications like Wheat Belly; Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health. However, in reality, there is only one condition where gluten is definitively the culprit: celiac disease (CD), affecting approximately 1% of the population in the Western world. Here, I describe the complexity of the cereals from which gluten is derived, the special properties of gluten which make it so widely used in the food industry, the basis for its toxicity in CD patients and the potential for the development of safe gluten and alternatives to the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Median arcuate ligament (MAL) syndrome, also called celiac trunk compression syndrome (CACS) or Dunbar syndrome is a rare disorder caused by compression of the celiac artery by median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm, which leads to mesenteric ischemia and chronic abdominal angina. The typical clinical triad of symptoms includes postprandial epigastric pain, weight loss and vomiting. The gold standard for MAL syndrome diagnosis is selective angiography, while in symptomatic patients with angiographically verified stenosis the optimal therapy is surgical treatment. CASE OUTLINE: A 40-year-old male patient was presented with epigastric pain, followed by dyspepsia and weight loss. The upper endoscopy showed gastric and duodenal distention with prominent folds of gastric mucosa and slow peristalsis. Selective angiography showed stenosis (90%) of initial segment of the celiac trunk. Adhesiolysis with the transection of the median arcuate ligament was performed. Due to repeated symptoms, the patient was reoperated on the 10th postoperative day with performed adhesiolysis and gastrostomy for gastric nutrition. Two months later, the patient was rehospitalized for closure of gastrostomy. At five years follow-up, selective angiography showed no stenosis of the initial segment of the celiac artery. CONCLUSION: Despite the existing controversy concerning pathophysiological mechanism, the clinical presentation and treatment modalities of patients with MAL syndrome, it is evident that careful selection and adequate surgical treatment may significantly reduce symptoms in these patients.},

The gastroenterologist may come across osteoporosis or osteopenia in a patient with a gastrointestinal disease. This is often a young patient in whom investigations should be carried out and appropriate treatment initiated, aimed at preventing bone fractures and the formation of the best peak bone mass. Osteoporosis occurs in patients with the following conditions: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, post gastrectomy patients, patients with short bowel syndrome, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, treated with steroids (steroid-induced osteoporosis) and patients using proton pump inhibitors chronically (state of achlorhydria). It is therefore necessary to approve a list of risk factors of secondary osteoporosis, the presence of which would be an indication for screening for osteoporosis, including a DXA study and the development of a separate algorithm for the therapeutic management of secondary osteoporosis accompanying gastrointestinal diseases, especially in premenopausal young women and young men, because there are currently no registered drugs with proven antifracture activity for this group of patients.},

   abstract = {Nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) refers to a clinical phenotype in which patients experience intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms related to ingesting a gluten-containing diet after a diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy has been excluded. CD, an autoimmune disease characterized by villous atrophy triggered by the ingestion of gluten, has increased in prevalence in recent decades, although the majority of patients remain undiagnosed. There is now an increasing public awareness of NCGS and growing interest in the health effects of gluten among health professionals and the lay public. Several randomized controlled trials have explored NCGS but have left many questions unanswered surrounding the pathophysiology, biomarkers, and established diagnostic approach to patients with this condition. Future studies are necessary to establish biomarkers and to elucidate the pathophysiology of this condition because at present, NCGS likely comprises a heterogeneous patient population. In this review, we outline the clinical trials of NCGS as well as the approach to patients with possible NCGS as recommended by an international expert panel. Because maintaining a gluten-free diet has important health, social, and economic consequences, it is necessary for medical professionals to provide practical and evidence-based advice to patients with this condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is a common disorder with a worldwide distribution, although the prevalence among different ethnicities varies. We aimed to measure the prevalence of duodenal villous atrophy among patients of different ethnicities throughout the United States. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of all patients who had duodenal biopsies submitted to a national pathology laboratory between January 2, 2008 and April 30, 2015. The prevalence of villous atrophy was calculated for the following ethnicities by using a previously published algorithm based on patient names: North Indian, South Indian, East Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Jewish, and other Americans. RESULTS: Among all patients (n = 454,885), the median age was 53 years, and 66% were female. The overall prevalence of celiac disease was 1.74%. Compared with other Americans (n = 380,163; celiac disease prevalence, 1.83%), celiac disease prevalence was lower in patients of South Indian (n = 177, 0%; P = .08), East Asian (n = 4700, 0.15%; P </= .0001), and Hispanic (n = 31,491, 1.06%; P </= .0001) ethnicities. Celiac disease was more common in patients from the Punjab region (n = 617, 3.08%) than in patients from North India (n = 1195, 1.51%; P = .02). The prevalence of celiac disease among patients of Jewish (n = 17,806, 1.80%; P = .78) and Middle Eastern (n = 1903, 1.52%; P = .33) ethnicities was similar to that of other Americans. Among Jewish individuals (n = 17,806), the prevalence of celiac disease was 1.83% in Ashkenazi persons (n = 16,440) and 1.39% in Sephardic persons (n = 1366; P = .24). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing duodenal biopsy, individuals from the Punjab region of India constitute the ethnic group in the United States with the highest prevalence of villous atrophy consistent with celiac disease. Compared with other Americans, villous atrophy prevalence on duodenal biopsy is significantly lower among U.S. residents of South Indian, East Asian, and Hispanic ancestry.},

Additionally, the research on the application of calcium supplements in the gluten-free breadmaking was reviewed, and its effect on the technological and sensory properties of baked products was indicated. Calcium-fortified gluten-free products could increase the calcium content in the diet of CD patients, supplying the amount of calcium they need for prophylactic or therapeutic use. Apart from this, the consumption of the naturally GF products as well as functional ingredients beneficially affecting calcium absorption need to be encouraged.},

CD was diagnosed according to the adapted guidelines of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPHGAN). RESULTS: Among 102 tested children and teenagers with ADHD, we did not find anyone with suspected CD, so further diagnostic procedures for CD were not indicated. CONCLUSION: In our sample of children and teenagers with ADHD, the prevalence of CD was not higher than in the general population. On the basis of the obtained results and the results of similar studies, we conclude that there are not enough data to support screening for CD and the introduction of a gluten-free diet in children with ADHD unless there are additional indications.},

AIMS: To evaluate common indications for testosterone panel (TP) testing and prevalence of low testosterone (T) in CD. METHODS: In our case series, we determined common indications for checking TP in CD. Next, we conducted a case-control study to compare TP in CD vs. healthy controls (HC). We compared mean total T (TT), free T (FT) based on serologic, histologic disease activity. Finally, we assessed TT in tissue transglutaminase (tTG)+ vs. tTG- subjects and CD vs. HC obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). RESULTS: 53 coeliac males had TP tested. Common indications included osteoporosis and fatigue. Low FT was observed in 7/13 men with osteoporosis and 5/6 with fatigue. In our case-control study (n=26 each), there was no difference in mean TT or FT between CD vs. HC, tTG+ vs tTG- or Marsh 0 vs. Marsh 3 groups. NHANES data showed no difference in mean TT between tTG+ vs tTG- (n=16 each) or CD vs. HC subjects (n=5 each). CONCLUSIONS: Low T occurs in CD patients at a similar rate as the general population. Common presentations of low T may mimic non-responsive CD symptoms.},

The main treatment for coeliac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet, which can reduce morbidity and mortality and also improve quality of life. Despite the benefits, adhering to this diet is often challenging, with patients often struggling to sustain dietary restriction. Structured follow-up for coeliac disease is recommended in international guidelines for improving adherence and for detecting complications;however, uncertainty exists concerning exactly who should be administering this follow-up care. Here, we undertake a review of the current approaches described in the literature to follow-up patients with coeliac disease, and assess the efficacy of these differing models. We also explore future directions for the care of these patients in the context of the UK National Health Service (a publicly funded healthcare system). Although the focus of this review pertains to follow-up within the UK healthcare system, these problems are recognised to be international, and so the findings of our review are likely to be of interest to all healthcare professionals seeing and managing patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The development of gliadin-specific antibody and T-cell responses were longitudinally monitored in young children with genetic risk for celiac disease (CD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 291 newborn children positive for HLA-DQB1*02 and -DQA1*05 alleles were followed until 3-4 years of age by screening for tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA) by using a commercial ELISA-based kit and antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptide (anti-DGP) by an immunofluorometric assay. Eighty-five of the children were also followed for peripheral blood gliadin-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses by using a carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester-based in vitro proliferation assay. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of tTGA seropositivity during the follow-up was 6.5%. CD was diagnosed in nine of the tTGA-positive children (3.1%) by duodenal biopsy at a median 3.5 years of age. All of the children with confirmed CD were both IgA and IgG anti-DGP positive at the time of tTGA seroconversion and in over half of the cases IgG anti-DGP positivity even preceded tTGA seroconversion. Peripheral blood T-cell responses to deamidated and native gliadin were detected in 40.5% and 22.2% of the children at the age of 9 months and these frequencies decreased during the follow-up to the levels of 22.2% and 8.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-DGP antibodies may precede tTGA seroconversion and thus frequent monitoring of both tTGA and anti-DGP antibodies may allow earlier detection of CD in genetically susceptible children. Peripheral blood gliadin-specific T-cell responses are relatively common in HLA-DQ2-positive children and are not directly associated with the development of CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Determination of antibodies to synthetic deamidated gliadin peptides (anti-DGPs) may work as an alternative or complement the commonly used test for tissue transglutaminase antibodies (TGA) in the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). We analyzed the performance of a time-resolved immunofluorometric anti-DGP assay (TR-IFMA) in the diagnosis of CD in children and also retrospectively analyzed the appearance of anti-DGP antibodies before TGA seroconversion. METHODS: The study included 92 children with biopsy-confirmed CD. Serum samples were taken at the time or just before the clinical diagnosis. The control group comprised 82 TGA-negative children who were positive for human leucocyte antigen-DQ2 or -DQ8. RESULTS: Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimal cutoff value for immunoglobulin (Ig) A anti-DGP positivity was 153 arbitrary units (AUs) with a sensitivity of 92.4% and specificity of 97.6% and that for IgG anti-DGP 119 AU, with a sensitivity of 97.8% and specificity of 97.6%. All 92 children with CD were either IgA or IgG anti-DGP positive at the time of diagnosis. Sera from 48 children with CD were also analyzed retrospectively before the diagnosis. Anti-DGP antibodies preceded TGA positivity in 35 of the 48 children with CD and appeared a median of 1 year earlier. CONCLUSIONS: The TR-IFMA assay for detecting anti-DGP antibodies shows high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CD in children. In a majority of our study population, anti-DGP seropositivity preceded TGA positivity, indicating that earlier detection of CD may be possible by monitoring anti-DGP antibodies frequently in genetically susceptible children.},

   abstract = {Experience suggests that many celiac patients suffer from persistent symptoms despite a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD). We investigated the prevalence and severity of these symptoms in patients with variable duration of GFD. Altogether, 856 patients were classified into untreated (n = 128), short-term GFD (1-2 years, n = 93) and long-term GFD (>/=3 years, n = 635) groups. Analyses were made of clinical and histological data and dietary adherence. Symptoms were evaluated by the validated GSRS questionnaire. One-hundred-sixty healthy subjects comprised the control group. Further, the severity of symptoms was compared with that in peptic ulcer, reflux disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Altogether, 93% of the short-term and 94% of the long-term treated patients had a strict GFD and recovered mucosa. Untreated patients had more diarrhea, indigestion and abdominal pain than those on GFD and controls. There were no differences in symptoms between the short- and long-term GFD groups, but both yielded poorer GSRS total score than controls (p = 0.03 and p = 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, patients treated 1-2 years had more diarrhea (p = 0.03) and those treated >10 years more reflux (p = 0.04) than controls. Long-term treated celiac patients showed relatively mild symptoms compared with other gastrointestinal diseases. Based on our results, good response to GFD sustained in long-term follow-up, but not all patients reach the level of healthy individuals.},

   abstract = {This commentary by the leadership of the North American Society for the Study of Celiac Disease (NASSCD) concerns recent research findings regarding infant feeding practices. Celiac disease has increased markedly in recent decades, and seroprevalence studies indicate that this is a true rise, rather than one due to increased awareness and testing. Prior studies have suggested that infant feeding practices and timing of initial gluten exposure are central to the development of celiac disease. Two recent multicenter randomized trials tested strategies of early or delayed gluten introduction in infants, and neither strategy appeared to influence celiac disease risk. These studies also found that breastfeeding did not protect against the development of celiac disease. While disappointing, these results should spur the study of wider environmental risk factors beyond infant feeding, such as intrauterine and perinatal exposures as well as environmental influences later in life, including drug exposure, microbial infections, and the microbiome. Given that celiac disease can develop at any age, it is imperative to study these proposed triggers so as to elucidate the loss of tolerance to gluten and to develop future intervention strategies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is little information available on the use of social support systems for patients with coeliac disease (CD). We performed a cross-sectional study aiming to examine the association between participation in different types of social support networks and quality of life (QOL) in adults with CD. METHODS: A survey including a validated CD specific QOL instrument was administered online and in-person to adults with CD who were following a gluten-free diet. Participation in social support networks (type, frequency and duration) were assessed. RESULTS: Among the 2138 participants, overall QOL scores were high, averaging 68.9 out of 100. Significant differences in QOL scores were found for age, length of time since diagnosis and level of education. Most (58%) reported using no social support networks. Of the 42% reporting use of social support networks (online 17.9%, face-to-face 10.8% or both 12.8%), QOL scores were higher for those individuals who used only face-to-face social support compared to only online support (72.6 versus 66.7; P < 0.0001). A longer duration of face-to-face social support use was associated with higher QOL scores (P < 0.0005). By contrast, a longer duration and increased frequency of online social support use was associated with lower QOL scores (P < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Participation in face-to-face social support networks is associated with greater QOL scores compared to online social support networks. These findings have potential implications for the management of individuals with CD. Emphasis on face-to-face support may improve long-term QOL and patient outcomes.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine the proportion of pediatric patients with celiac disease (CD) who had transaminases obtained at diagnosis and to determine the proportion with hypertransaminasemia. METHODS: Data from newly diagnosed patients with CD at Nationwide Children's Hospital from February 2007 to March 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) values at diagnosis and after initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) were assessed. RESULTS: Of 388 patients (mean age 10.1 +/- 4.4 years, 235 girls), 185 (47.7%) had transaminases obtained at the time of diagnosis. Twenty-eight of one hundred eighty-five (15.1%) had an elevated ALT and/or AST level with an average ALT 2.52 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and AST 1.87 x ULN. Those with hypertransaminasemia were younger than those with normal levels (6.31 +/- 4.75 vs 11.00 +/- 4.28 years, P < 0.0001). Sex, symptoms at diagnosis, and weight, height, and body mass index z scores were not predictive of elevated transaminases. Of the 21 patients with hypertransaminasemia at diagnosis who had repeat laboratory test results after starting the GFD, 15 (71.4%) normalized whereas 6 (28.6%) remained elevated. CONCLUSIONS: There is variation in practice among pediatric gastroenterologists in the assessment of transaminases in children with CD. Hypertransaminasemia is present at diagnosis in a significant proportion of children with CD although at a lower frequency than previously reported. Younger patients are more likely to have an elevation in transaminases. Abnormal transaminases normalize in the majority of patients within 1 year after initiation of a GFD.},

   abstract = {In the past it was believed that genetic predisposition and exposure to gluten were necessary and sufficient to develop celiac disease (CD). Recent studies however suggest that loss of gluten tolerance can occur at any time in life as a consequence of other environmental stimuli. Many environmental factors known to influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota are also suggested to play a role in the development of CD. These include birthing delivery mode, infant feeding, and antibiotic use. To date no large-scale longitudinal studies have defined if and how gut microbiota composition and metabolomic profiles may influence the loss of gluten tolerance and subsequent onset of CD in genetically-susceptible individuals. Here we describe a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal study of infants at risk for CD which will employ a blend of basic and applied studies to yield fundamental insights into the role of the gut microbiome as an additional factor that may play a key role in early steps involved in the onset of autoimmune disease.},

The combination of genetic susceptibility along with a potential role for gluten in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity makes defining gluten's role in type 1 diabetes extremely important. Evidence supporting the role of a gluten-free diet to improve complications associated with type 1 diabetes is not robust. However there is evidence to support improved growth, bone density and potentially the prevention of additional autoimmune diseases in patients with coeliac disease and type 1 diabetes. The gluten free diet is expensive and challenging to adhere to in people already on a modified diet. Early identification of those who have coeliac disease and would benefit from a gluten-free diet is of utmost importance to prevent complications associated with type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease.},

Currently, genetic testing in screening for CD is used only to exclude a diagnosis or reinforce a strong clinical suspicion. In this paper, we review the most current literature regarding genetic testing in CD. In response to important data revealing that an individual's HLA haplotype is one of the strongest known predictors of CD, we propose genetic screening for at-risk infants to stratify individuals based on genetic risk to ultimately create genetic specific screening algorithms.},

   abstract = {The incidence of celiac disease is increasing worldwide, and human tissue transglutaminase has long been considered the autoantigen of celiac disease. Concomitantly, the food industry has introduced ingredients such as microbial transglutaminase, which acts as a food glue, thereby revolutionizing food qualities. Several observations have led to the hypothesis that microbial transglutaminase is a new environmental enhancer of celiac disease. First, microbial transglutaminase deamidates/transamidates glutens such as the endogenous human tissue transglutaminase. It is capable of crosslinking proteins and other macromolecules, thereby changing their antigenicity and resulting in an increased antigenic load presented to the immune system. Second, it increases the stability of protein against proteinases, thus diminishing foreign protein elimination. Infections and the crosslinked nutritional constituent gluten and microbial transglutaminase increase the permeability of the intestine, where microbial transglutaminases are necessary for bacterial survival. The resulting intestinal leakage allows more immunogenic foreign molecules to induce celiac disease. The increased use of microbial transglutaminase in food processing may promote celiac pathogenesis ex vivo, where deamidation/transamidation starts, possibly explaining the surge in incidence of celiac disease. If future research substantiates this hypothesis, the findings will affect food product labeling, food additive policies of the food industry, and consumer health education.},

   abstract = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and celiac disease (CD) belong to the autoimmune disease family. Despite being separate entities they share multiple aspects. Epidemiologically they share comparable incidence environmental influences, associated antibodies and a recent incidental surge. They differ in their HLA pre-dispositions and specific predictive and diagnostic biomarkers. At the clinical level, celiac disease exhibits extra-intestinal rheumatic manifestations and RA gastrointestinal ones. Small bowel pathology exists in rheumatic patients. A trend towards responsiveness to a gluten free diet has been observed, ameliorating celiac rheumatic manifestations, whereas dietary interventions for rheumatoid arthritis remain controversial. Pathophysiologically, both diseases are mediated by endogenous enzymes in the target organs. The infectious, dysbiotic and increased intestinal permeability theories, as drivers of the autoimmune cascade, apply to both diseases. Contrary to their specific HLA pre-disposition, the diseases share multiple non-HLA loci. Those genes are crucial for activation and regulation of adaptive and innate immunity. Recently, light was shed on the interaction between host genetics and microbiota composition in relation to CD and RA susceptibility, connecting bugs and us and autoimmunity. A better understanding of the above mentioned similarities in the gut-joint inter-relationship, may elucidate additional facets in the mosaic of autoimmunity, relating CD to RA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients with celiac disease experience difficulties in adherence to a gluten-free diet. Methods for testing compliance to a gluten-free diet are costly and cumbersome. Thus, a simple biomarker of gluten intake is needed in a clinical setting and will be useful for epidemiologic studies investigating wider effects of gluten intake. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate plasma total alkylresorcinol concentrations as a measure of gluten intake. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, crossover intervention study in 52 Danish adults with features of the metabolic syndrome, we compared 8 wk of a gluten-rich and gluten-poor diet separated by a washout period of >/=6 wk. We measured fasting plasma concentrations of alkylresorcinols to determine if they reflected differences in gluten intake as a secondary outcome of the original study. In addition, we investigated in 118 Danish adults the cross-sectional association between self-reported gluten intake and plasma alkylresorcinols in the same and a similar study at baseline. We used mixed-model ANCOVA for examining treatment effects, a classification tree to determine compliance to the gluten-poor diet, and linear regression models for examining baseline correlation between plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations and gluten intake. RESULTS: Plasma total alkylresorcinols decreased more during the gluten-poor period (geometric mean: -124.8 nmol/L; 95% CI: -156.5, -93.0 nmol/L) than in the gluten-rich period (geometric mean: -31.8 nmol/L; 95% CI: -63.1, -0.4 nmol/L) (P < 0.001). On the basis of the plasma alkylresorcinol profile, we built a classification tree to objectively determine compliance and found an overall participant misclassification error of 3.9%. In the cross-sectional study we found a 5.6% (95% CI: 2.4%, 8.9%) increase in plasma total alkylresorcinols per 1-g increase in reported gluten intake (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We propose the use of plasma alkylresorcinols to monitor compliance to a gluten-free diet as well as to help investigations into the possible effects of gluten in the wider population. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT017119913 and NCT01731366.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is one of the commonest lifelong disorders in countries populated by individuals of European origin, affecting approximately 1% of the general population. This is a common disease also in North Africa, Middle East and India. The widespread diffusion of CD is not surprising given that its causal factors (HLA predisposing genotypes and consumption of gluten-containing cereals) show a worldwide distribution. Further studies are needed to quantify the incidence of CD in apparently "celiac-free" areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa and Far East. Several reports have shown that CD is increasing in frequency in different geographic areas. Genetic factors do not explain the rising incidence during the last decades; environmental or lifestyle factors may be responsible for these changes over time. The majority of patients with CD are still undiagnosed all over the world, leading to debate about the need of screening program.},

   abstract = {Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome diagnosed in patients with symptoms that respond to removal of gluten from the diet, after celiac disease and wheat allergy have been excluded. NCGS has been related to neuro-psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia and depression. A singular report of NCGS presenting with hallucinations has been described in an adult patient. We report a pediatric case of a psychotic disorder clearly related to NCGS and investigate the causes by a review of literature. The pathogenesis of neuro-psychiatric manifestations of NCGS is unclear. It has been hypothesized that: (a) a "leaky gut" allows some gluten peptides to cross the intestinal membrane and the blood brain barrier, affecting the endogenous opiate system and neurotransmission; or (b) gluten peptides may set up an innate immune response in the brain similar to that described in the gut mucosa, causing exposure from neuronal cells of a transglutaminase primarily expressed in the brain. The present case-report confirms that psychosis may be a manifestation of NCGS, and may also involve children; the diagnosis is difficult with many cases remaining undiagnosed. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to establish the real role of gluten as a triggering factor in neuro-psychiatric disorders.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Implementation of gluten-free diets among nonceliac athletes has rapidly increased in recent years because of perceived ergogenic and health benefits. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on exercise performance, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, perceived well-being, intestinal injury, and inflammatory responses in nonceliac athletes. METHODS: Thirteen competitive endurance cyclists (8 males, 5 females) with no positive clinical screening for celiac disease or history of irritable bowel syndrome (mean +/- SD; age, 32 +/- 7 yr; weight, 71.1 +/- 13.4 kg; height, 177.0 +/- 11.8 cm, VO2max 59.1 +/- 8.0 mL.kg(-)(1).min(-)(1)) were allocated to a 7-d gluten-containing diet (GCD) or GFD separated by a 10-d washout in a controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Cyclists ate a GFD alongside either gluten-containing or gluten-free food bars (16 g wheat gluten per day) while habitual training and nutrition behaviors were controlled. During each diet, cyclists completed the Daily Analysis of Life Demand for Athletes (DALDA) and GI questionnaires (postexercise and daily). On day 7, cyclists completed a submaximal steady-state (SS) 45-min ride at 70% Wmax followed by a 15-min time trial (TT). Blood samples were taken preexercise, post-SS, and post-TT to determine intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) and inflammatory markers (cytokine responses: interleukin [IL] 1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, tumor necrosis factor alpha). Mixed effects logistic regression was used to analyze data. RESULTS: TT performance was not significantly different (P = 0.37) between the GCD (245.4 +/- 53.4 kJ) and GFD (245.0 +/- 54.6 kJ). GI symptoms during exercise, daily, and DALDA responses were similar for each diet (P > 0.11). There were no significant differences in IFABP (P = 0.69) or cytokine (P > 0.13) responses. CONCLUSIONS: A short-term GFD had no overall effect on performance, GI symptoms, well-being, and a select indicator of intestinal injury or inflammatory markers in nonceliac endurance athletes.},

   abstract = {Adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) for nonceliac athletes (NCA) has become increasingly popular despite a paucity of supportive medical or ergogenic evidence. This study aimed to quantify the demographics of NCA and determine associated experiences, perceptions, and sources of information related to GFD. Athletes (n = 910, female = 528, no gender selected = 5) completed a 17-question online survey. Forty-one percent of NCA respondents, including 18-world and/or Olympic medalists, follow a GFD 50-100% of the time (GFD > 50): only 13% for treatment of reported medical conditions with 57% self-diagnosing their gluten sensitivity. The GFD > 50 group characteristics included predominantly endurance sport athletes (70.0%) at the recreationally competitive level (32.3%), between 31 and 40 years of age (29.1%). Those who follow a GFD > 50 reported experiencing, abdominal/gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms alone (16.7%) or in conjunction with two (30.7%) or three (35.7%) additional symptoms (e.g., fatigue) believed to be triggered by gluten. Eighty-four percent of GFD > 50 indicated symptom improvement with gluten-removal. Symptom-based and non-symptom-based self-diagnosed gluten-sensitivity (56.7%) was the primary reason for adopting a GFD. Leading sources of GFD information were online (28.7%), trainer/coach (26.2%) and other athletes (17.4%). Although 5-10% of the general population is estimated to benefit clinically from a GFD a higher prevalence of GFD adherence was found in NCA (41.2%). Prescription of a GFD among many athletes does not result from evidence-based practice suggesting that adoption of a GFD in the majority of cases was not based on medical rationale and may be driven by perception that gluten removal provides health benefits and an ergogenic edge in NCA.},

A group of experts developed an algorithm to drive the management of common gastrointestinal symptoms in infancy by paediatricians and general practitioners. METHODS: The algorithm started from the evidence-based recommendations of the European Society of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and an updated review of the literature. We used the structured quantitative method of nominal group technique to reach a consensus. RESULTS: A practical algorithm for the management of infants with acute diarrhoea was designed based on the consensus reached for each statement. The management of an infant with acute diarrhoea should include a sequence of actions: (i) a semiquantitative estimate of infant dehydration through validated clinical scores, (ii) rehydration therapy and early refeeding with breast milk or regular formula and (iii) effective agents to reduce the severity and duration of the diarrhoea. Finally, in children with prolonged diarrhoea, the search for aetiology should include persistent infections or reinfections, cows' milk protein allergy and coeliac diseases. Lactose should always be withdrawn. CONCLUSION: This algorithm provides an evidence-based sequence of interventions to optimise the management of infants with acute diarrhoea.},

Objectives of the study were to compare dietary adherence in coeliac disease (CD) subjects and in non-coeliac gluten sensitive (NCGS) subjects, and to estimate gluten exposure based on weighed food records and analysis of gluten content in selected food items. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twenty-three subjects with biopsy verified CD on a gluten-free diet and 34 HLA-DQ2+ NCGS subjects on a self-instituted gluten-free diet were enrolled. The latter group was under investigation of CD. Dietary adherence was assessed by frequency questionnaire and structured forms supplied by weighed food records. For the analyses of food samples, the sandwich R5-ELISA, Ridascreen(R) Gliadin competitive method was used. RESULTS: There was no difference in dietary adherence between CD and NCGS subjects (83% vs 68%, p = 0.21). NCGS subjects were mainly self-educated in gluten-free diet compared to CD subjects (91% and 39%, respectively, p < 0.001). In non-adherent subjects, there was no difference in gluten exposure between CD and NCGS (10 vs 138 mg/day, p = 0.83). There was no difference in BMR-factor between CD and NCGS subjects, or between adherent and non-adherent subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Both CD and NCGS subjects were largely adherent, and adherence did not differ between the groups. Gluten exposure varied greatly, and some CD and NCGS subjects reached gluten intake above 500 mg/day, which might have considerable health effects on the individual, especially in case of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {The process of transition from childhood to adulthood is characterised by physical, mental and psychosocial development. Data on the transition and transfer of care in adolescents/young adults with coeliac disease (CD) are scarce. In this paper, 17 physicians from 10 countries (Sweden, Italy, the USA, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, Australia, Britain, Israel and Denmark) and two representatives from patient organisations (Association of European Coeliac Societies and the US Celiac Disease Foundation) examined the literature on transition from childhood to adulthood in CD. Medline (Ovid) and EMBASE were searched between 1900 and September 2015. Evidence in retrieved reports was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. The current consensus report aims to help healthcare personnel manage CD in the adolescent and young adult and provide optimal care and transition into adult healthcare for patients with this disease. In adolescence, patients with CD should gradually assume exclusive responsibility for their care, although parental support is still important. Dietary adherence and consequences of non-adherence should be discussed during transition. In most adolescents and young adults, routine small intestinal biopsy is not needed to reconfirm a childhood diagnosis of CD based on European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) or North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) criteria, but a biopsy may be considered where paediatric diagnostic criteria have not been fulfilled, such as, in a patient without biopsy at diagnosis, additional serology (endomysium antibody) has not been performed to confirm 10-fold positivity of tissue transglutaminase antibodies or when a no biopsy strategy has been adopted in an asymptomatic child.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong disorder. Patients are at increased risk of complications and comorbidity. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a review of the literature on patient support and information in CD and aim to issue recommendations about patient information with regards to CD. METHODS: DATA SOURCE: We searched PubMed for English-language articles published between 1900 and June 2014, containing terms related to costs, economics of CD, or education and CD. STUDY SELECTION: Papers deemed relevant by any of the participating authors were included in the study. DATA SYNTHESIS: No quantitative synthesis of data was performed. Instead we formulated a consensus view of the information that should be offered to all patients with CD. RESULTS: There are few randomized clinical trials examining the effect of patient support in CD. Patients and their families receive information from many sources. It is important that health care personnel guide the patient through the plethora of facts and comments on the Internet. An understanding of CD is likely to improve dietary adherence. Patients should be educated about current knowledge about risk factors for CD, as well as the increased risk of complications. Patients should also be advised to avoid other health hazards, such as smoking. Many patients are eager to learn about future non-dietary treatments of CD. This review also comments on novel therapies but it is important to stress that no such treatment is available at present. CONCLUSION: Based on mostly observational data, we suggest that patient support and information should be an integral part of the management of CD, and is likely to affect the outcome of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is managed by life-long adherence to a gluten-free diet and dietitians have the potential to facilitate this. Patient involvement through shared decision-making is central to behaviour-change skills used by dietitians, although there is little evidence supporting its inclusion in evaluating dietetic interventions. The present study aimed to explore patients' preferences for diet and nutrition-related outcomes in CD. METHODS: Adults with CD or adult carers of children with CD were invited through support networks. Participants took part in a telephone, face-to-face interview or focus group which was audio-recorded and transcribed. Themes were developed using a framework method. Ethical approval was obtained. RESULTS: Twenty-nine adult patients and five parents of CD children participated 0-34 years after diagnosis. Four main outcome-related themes emerged: (i) Participants wanted information specific to their lifestyle and time since diagnosis, focussing on food containing gluten, practical issues, prescribable items and general nutrition. (ii) The degree of satisfaction with the consultation process impacted on participants' experience, including the dietitian's CD expertise, consistency of the dietitian seen, and the frequency and length of appointments. (iii) Health concerns were important to participants and focussed on risk of osteoporosis, unwanted weight gain, and the fat and sugar content of manufactured gluten-free products. (iv) Clinical monitoring, including bone scans and antibody measurements, was mentioned but was not described as being of importance for most participants. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes preferred by CD patients and carers focussed primarily on information and resources received and satisfaction with their dietetic consultation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is increasingly diagnosed through screening of at-risk groups (relatives of individuals and associated autoimmune disorders). The impact of diagnosis and treatment on screen-detected CD patients is poorly studied, particularly in the United States. We therefore compared the quality of life (QOL) between screen-detected and symptom-detected CD patients. METHODS: Patients with a known diagnosis of CD were invited to complete 3 validated survey instruments: the CD Quality of Life (CDQOL), the CD Adherence Test for dietary adherence and the general Psychological General Well-Being index. In addition, demographic details, mode of presentation, and compliance with gluten-free diet (GFD) were assessed. RESULTS: The overall response rate was high at 69%. Of 226 responses received, 211 were eligible for inclusion; the median age was 47, and the median duration of GFD was 4 years. One third of the sample (71, 34%) was screen detected. Of these, 57 (80%) had a relative diagnosed with CD, whereas 14 (20%) had an associated condition. Despite being screen detected, 49 (69%) reported symptoms before diagnosis. GFD adherence was excellent and did not differ between groups. Overall, there were no significant differences between screen-detected and symptom-detected patients with regard to CDQOL, CD Adherence Test, and Psychological General Well-Being scores. CONCLUSIONS: Screen-detected and symptom-detected CD patients do not differ with regard to QOL or disease adherence as measured by validated disease-specific instruments. A high proportion of screen-detected patients reported symptoms before diagnosis, which often improve with GFD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition characterised by gluten-induced intestinal inflammation, and observed at a 5-10 fold greater prevalence in type 1 diabetes. While universal screening for CD in patients with diabetes is frequently advocated, objective data is limited as to benefits on diabetes control, bone health or quality of life related to the adoption of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in the large proportion of patients with diabetes with asymptomatic CD. The Celiac Disease and Diabetes-Dietary Intervention and Evaluation Trial (CD-DIET) study is a multicenter, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a GFD in patients with type 1 diabetes with asymptomatic CD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Children and adults (8-45 years) with type 1 diabetes will be screened for asymptomatic CD. Eligible patients with biopsy-proven CD will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with a GFD for 1 year, or continue with a gluten-containing diet. The primary outcome will evaluate the impact of the GFD on change in glycated haemoglobin. Secondary outcomes will evaluate changes in bone mineral density, blood glucose variability and health-related quality of life between GFD-treated and the regular diet group over a 1-year period. The study was initiated in 2012 and has subsequently expanded to multiple paediatric and adult centres in Ontario, Canada. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The findings from this study will provide high-quality evidence as to the impact of GFD treatment on glycaemic control and complications in asymptomatic children and adults with CD and type 1 diabetes.

   abstract = {The spectrum of gluten-related disorders has widened in recent times and includes celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy. The complex of symptoms associated with these diseases, such as diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain may overlap for the gluten related diseases, and furthermore they can be similar to those caused by various other intestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The mechanisms underlying symptom generation are diverse for all these diseases. Some patients with celiac disease may remain asymptomatic or have only mild gastrointestinal symptoms and thus may qualify for the diagnosis of IBS in the general clinical practice. Similarly, the overlap of symptoms between IBS and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) often creates a dilemma for clinicians. While the treatment of NCGS is exclusion of gluten from the diet, some, but not all, of the patients with IBS also improve on a gluten-free diet. Both IBS and NCGS are common in the general population and both can coexist with each other independently without necessarily sharing a common pathophysiological basis. Although the pathogenesis of NCGS is not well understood, it is likely to be heterogeneous with possible contributing factors such as low-grade intestinal inflammation, increased intestinal barrier function and changes in the intestinal microbiota. Innate immunity may also play a pivotal role. One possible inducer of innate immune response has recently been reported to be amylase-trypsin inhibitor, a protein present in wheat endosperm and the source of flour, along with the gluten proteins.},

   abstract = {Until 1970s, celiac disease (CD) was considered to be an uncommon disease except in Western Europe. The global epidemiology of CD continues to evolve with improvement in the diagnostic tests, simplification of the diagnostic criteria and increase in awareness about the disease. The Asian region is currently at the crossroads of the frontier of knowledge and awareness of CD. In many Asian nations, CD is still considered to be either nonexistent or very rare. A notable exception is India, where CD has been well recognized, especially in the northern part, and 2 population-based studies have revealed a prevalence of 0.3-1.04%. Initial reports from Malaysia, China, Japan and Singapore suggest the existence of CD in these countries. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of the predisposing factors predicts a high probability of occurrence of CD in fair numbers in China. There are no formal reports on CD from Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan and many other nations in this region. With the impending CD epidemic in Asia, there are many challenges. Some of the efforts which are required include determination of prevalence of CD across the region, spreading of awareness among physicians and patients, training of dieticians for proper counseling and supervision of patients, creation of gluten-free food infrastructure in the food supply and creation of patient advocacy organizations. Although the absolute number of patients with CD at present is not very large, this number is expected to increase over the next few years/decades. It is thus appropriate that the medical community across Asia define the extent of the problem and get prepared to handle the impending CD epidemic.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite the availability of specific sierology and point-of-care tests, the phenotypic heterogeneity and the symptoms fluctuation as well as the "open-window" existing among the late and silent forms cause often a delayed celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. Recently, it has been reported that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) mediates inflammation and gastrointestinal barrier failure. The aim of this study was to detect serum HMGB1 levels at CD diagnosis and to evaluate the relationship between serum HMGB1 levels and clinical and histologic phenotypes. METHODS: 49 CD children and 44 healthy children were enrolled. Specific antitissue transglutaminase type 2, antideaminated form of gliadin antibodies, serum HMGB1 levels, and typical histopathological changes in duodenal mucosa were performed in all patients. Mucosal lesions were classified according to Marsh classification. In relation to clinical presentation, we classified patients into: typical, atypical and silent forms. RESULTS: Serum HMGB1 levels were significantly higher in those with CD than those in the healthy control group (P < 0.001). Significant differences in serum HMGB1 levels were detected in children with typical CD form compared to both children with atypical CD form (P < 0.001) and children with silent CD form (P < 0.001). By using the Marsh classification, significant differences were found between subjects with grade 3 B-B1 and 3 C-B2 and villous atrophy, respectively (P < 0.05). On the contrary, no significant differences in serum HMGB1 levels in subgroups of children with grade 3 A compared to grade 3 B-B1 were detected. CONCLUSIONS: HMGB1 is upregulated at diagnosis in all CD children, especially in typical form, and reflecting the histologic severity of disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: To provide an estimate of the prevalence of celiac disease by race/ethnic origin in large sample of US population. METHODS: Data from the 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 NHANES were combined and analyzed. The NHANES is a nationally representative survey with oversampling of certain minorities. Sample-based frequencies were reported and weighted frequencies were used to estimate prevalence. RESULTS: A total of 14,701 participants were checked for tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and endomysial (EMA) IgA antibodies. Seventy-four participants had positive tTG and/or EMA corresponding to prevalence of 0.79 % (95 % CI 0.54-1.04 %). Non-Hispanic white were more likely to be positive for both compared with other races (72.0 vs 31.7 %; p = 0.010) and less likely to be weakly positive for tTG but positive for EMA (3.6 vs 26.4 %; p = 0.03). The prevalence of positive serology according to race was as follows: 1.08 % (95 % CI 0.70-1.45 %) in non-Hispanic white, 0.23 % (95 % CI 0.03-0.43 %) in Mexican, 0.22 % (95 % CI 0.01-0.44 %) in non-Hispanic black, 0.38 % (95 % CI 0.00-0.89 %) in "other Hispanic," and 0.15 % (95 % CI 0.00-0.34 %) in other races including multiracial and undeterminable in non-Hispanic Asian due to the presence of only one positive EMA test. 0.9 % of the NHANES sample participants followed gluten-free diet. Of this group of participants, 85 % were never diagnosed with celiac disease and 99 % of them had negative celiac disease serology. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially 0.79 % of the general US population demonstrate serologic evidence of celiac disease autoimmunity. The prevalence is 4-8 times higher among non-Hispanic white compared with other races. Close to 1 % of the population is electively following gluten-free diet despite having little evidence of the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Many medications can cause diarrhea by increasing motility, inflammation or enteropathy. Olmesartan and mycophenolic acid (CellCept) are drugs that are capable of increasing inflammation and enteropathy in some individuals and, if not recognized, can lead to chronic diarrhea. It is this type of drug-induced diarrhea that is the focus of this review. METHODS: A summary of our findings (recent and earlier published) as well as a review of published works from other centers were conducted. RESULTS: There is increasing evidence that olmesartan use is associated with enteropathy in a small number of individuals who use angiotensin receptor II blockers, and that this enteropathy is characterized by severe diarrhea capable of inducing severe dehydration and, in some instances, failure of organs such as the kidney. Typical patient demographics are Caucasian individuals who are older (>50 years old) and obese or overweight prior to weight loss. Prolonged exposure to olmesartan use for 1-2 years is typical, although case reports of irbesartan and valsartan have been reported as well. Discontinuing olmesartan leads to improvement of symptoms; however, the period for healing is variable, with some patients requiring steroid therapy and even prolonged parental nutrition support. In addition, many histological features of olmesartan-associated enteropathy are also present in celiac disease, including villi shortening and lymphocyte infiltration. Other drug-associated enteropathies have also been reported with mycophenolate mofetil used in transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Of the drug-associated enteropathies discussed in this review, olmesartan can generate the most severe symptoms, albeit quite rare. Therefore, with patients who present with severe diarrhea and weight loss, one should consider olmesartan-associated enteropathy. In addition, many of the features associated with olmesartan-associated enteropathy are also found in celiac disease enteropathy; as such, one should review any celiac disease diagnosis for any use of olmesartan at the time of diagnosis.},

This review aims to provide some insights on dough functionality and process conditions regarding bread quality and to point out recent research dealing with the nutritional composition of those products. Gluten-free dough results from the combination of different ingredients, additives, and the processing aids required for building up network structures responsible for bread quality. Some relationships between dough rheology and bread characteristics were established to identify possible predictor parameters. Regarding bread-making processes, the impact of mixing, dough treatment and baking is stated. Nutritional quality is an important asset when developing gluten-free breads, and different strategies for improving it are reviewed. Gluten-free bread quality is dependent on ingredients and additives combination, but also processing can provide a way to improve bread quality. Nutritive value of the gluten-free breads must be always in mind when setting up recipes, for obtaining nutritionally balanced bread with adequate glycaemic index.},

   abstract = {Down syndrome (DS) is one of the more commonly occurring genetic disorders, where mental retardation is combined with nutritional diseases. It is caused by having a third copy of chromosome 21, and there exist 3 forms; Simple Trisomy 21, Translocation Trisomy and Mosaic Trisomy. Symptoms include intellectual disability/mental retardation, early onset of Alzheimer's disease and the appearance of various phenotypic features such as narrow slanted eyes, flat nose and short stature. In addition, there are other health problems throughout the body, consisting in part of cardiac defects and thyroid function abnormalities along with nutritional disorders (ie. overweight, obesity, hypercholesterolemia and deficiencies of vitamins and minerals). Those suffering DS have widespread body frame abnormalities and impaired brain development and function; the latter leading to impaired intellectual development. Many studies indicate excessive or deficient nutrient uptakes associated with making inappropriate foodstuff choices, food intolerance, (eg. celiac disease) or malabsorption. DS persons with overweight or obesity are linked with a slow metabolic rate, abnormal blood leptin concentrations and exhibit low levels of physical activity. Vitamin B group deficiencies and abnormal blood homocysteine levels decrease the rate of intellectual development in DS cases. Zinc deficiencies result in short stature, thyroid function disorders and an increased appetite caused by excessive supplementation. Scientific advances in the research and diagnosis of DS, as well as preventing any associated conditions, have significantly increased life expectancies of those with this genetic disorder. Early dietary interventions by parents or guardians of DS children afford an opportunity for decreasing the risk or delaying some of the DS associated conditions from appearing, thus beneficially impacting on their quality of life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a composition database of a number of foods representative of different categories of gluten-free products in the Italian diet. DESIGN: The database was built using the nutritional composition of the products, taking into consideration both the composition of the ingredients and the nutritional information reported on the product label. SETTING: The nutrient composition of each ingredient was obtained from two Italian databases (European Institute of Oncology and the National Institute for Food and Nutrition). SUBJECTS: The study developed a food composition database including a total of sixty foods representative of different categories of gluten-free products sold on the Italian market. The composition of the products included in the database is given in terms of quantity of macro- and micronutrients per 100 g of product as sold, and includes the full range of nutrient data present in traditional databases of gluten-containing foods. RESULTS: As expected, most of the products had a high content of carbohydrates and some of them can be labelled as a source of fibre (>3 g/100 g). Regarding micronutrients, among the products considered, breads, pizzas and snacks were especially very high in Na content (>400-500 mg/100 g). CONCLUSIONS: This database provides an initial useful tool for future nutritional surveys on the dietary habits of coeliac people.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date, it is unclear whether individuals with celiac disease following a gluten-free (GF) diet for several years have adequate intake of all recommended nutrients. Lack of a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for individuals with celiac disease could be partly responsible for this still-debated issue. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of a modified European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) FFQ in estimating nutrient and food intake in a celiac population. DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, the dietary habits of individuals with celiac disease were reported using a modified Italian EPIC FFQ and were compared to a 7-day weighed food record as a reference method. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: A total of 200 individuals with histologically confirmed celiac disease were enrolled in the study between October 2012 and August 2014 at the Center for Prevention and Diagnosis of Celiac Disease (Milan, Italy). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nutrient and food category intake were calculated by 7-day weighed food record using an Italian food database integrated with the nutrient composition of 60 GF foods and the modified EPIC FFQ, in which 24 foods were substituted with GF foods comparable for energy and carbohydrate content. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: An evaluation of the modified FFQ compared to 7-day weighed food record in assessing the reported intake of nutrient and food groups was conducted using Spearman's correlation coefficients and weighted kappa. RESULTS: One hundred individuals completed the study. The Spearman's correlation coefficients of FFQ and 7-day weighed food record ranged from .13 to .73 for nutrients and from .23 to .75 for food groups. A moderate agreement, which was defined as a weighted kappa value of .40 to .60, was obtained for 30% of the analyzed nutrients, and 40% of the nutrients showed values between .30 and .40. The weighted kappa exceeded .40 for 60% of the 15 analyzed food groups. CONCLUSIONS: The modified EPIC FFQ demonstrated moderate congruence with a weighed food record in ranking individuals by dietary intakes, particularly food groups.},

   abstract = {Several studies have suggested a protective role of breastfeeding and/or the timing and quantity of gluten introduction in the subsequent development of celiac disease. Especially, prolonged breastfeeding during the introduction of gluten-containing feeding has been associated with a reduced risk of developing celiac disease in infancy. The mentioned results suggest the existence of a 'window of opportunity' between 4 and 6 months of age in which gluten can be introduced in small amounts. Therefore, the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition recommends avoiding gluten introduction before the age of 4 months and after the age of 7 months and that gluten should be preferably introduced during ongoing breastfeeding. However, the influence of breastfeeding in the development of celiac disease is not clear, since some studies report prevention and others do not, and the studies reporting a protective effect of breastfeeding do not make clear if it concerns prevention of the disease or delays the onset of symptoms. In addition, most of the studies on this topic have been observational and retrospective. For these reasons, prospective studies are needed to understand the relationship between early nutrition in particular and environmental factors in general, concerning the development and possible prevention of celiac disease. Some of these studies are ongoing. One example is the European multicenter PreventCD project (www.preventcoeliacdisease.com) among infants with a first-degree family member with celiac disease carrying HLA-DQ2 and/or -DQ8, randomized to a double-blind dietary intervention with 100 mg of gluten daily or placebo between the age of 4-6 months. All included children are already 3 years old, and the first analyses are being prepared (http://www.trialregister.nl).},

   abstract = {Primary prevention of coeliac disease is currently not possible. Previously, a 'window of opportunity' was suggested for primary prevention, by introducing gluten between four and six months of age. However, results from recent prospective studies establish that the timing of gluten introduction and the duration or maintenance of breastfeeding do not influence the development of the disease. Secondary prevention is possible through early diagnosis and treatment. Since coeliac disease is severely underdiagnosed, the only way to achieve large-scale secondary prevention is by mass screening. Prospective studies indicate that important health problems, such as reduced foetal growth and birth weight, delayed growth in height and weight in children, and reduced bone mineral density in both children and adults can be prevented by mass screening. Adherence to a strict gluten-free diet may be considered as tertiary prevention.},

The normal GI tract, except for the esophagus, is populated by eosinophils that are present throughout the mucosa, raising the possibility that eosinophils participate in innate mechanisms of defense. However, data from clinical studies associates increased numbers of eosinophils with inflammatory GI diseases, prompting concerns that eosinophils may have a deleterious effect on the gut. We present clinical features of 4 disease processes that have been associated with eosinophilia and suggest areas requiring investigation as to their clinical significance and scientific relevance.},

Noncoeliac gluten sensitivity is defined as the presence of a variety of symptoms related to gluten ingestion in patients in whom coeliac disease and wheat allergy have been excluded. The pathophysiology and biomarkers of coeliac disease and wheat allergy are well known, but this is not the case for noncoeliac gluten sensitivity. It is also not clear whether noncoeliac gluten sensitivity is caused by consumption of gluten or by consumption of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. Randomized trials on noncoeliac gluten sensitivity in children are lacking and are hardly needed to evaluate its role in paediatric patients with gastroenterology to avoid the use of unnecessary restrictive diets in children and interference with proper diagnosis of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD) are the 2 most common autoimmune childhood diseases that share their HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 genetic origin. There has currently been an increase in both diseases worldwide. In children from the low-population State of Sonora (15 inhabitants/km(2)) in north-western Mexico, there is no information on their genetic risk or the distribution of the related alleles in the general population. AIMS: To compare the HLA-DQ allele frequency in a representative sample of newborns from Sonora with that of T1D and CD patients to determine the risk gradient, and to identify the presence of celiac autoimmunity in the T1D group. METHODS: The study included 397 Sonoran newborns, with 44 cases of T1D, and 25 CD cases. The CD and T1D cases were clinically diagnosed by specialists at the Hospital Infantil del Estado de Sonora, and the autoantibodies were determined by ELISA. Whole blood was collected, gDNA was extracted, and HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 were typed by PCR-SSP. The risk gradient was calculated by comparing the allele frequencies of the cases with those of the newborns. RESULTS: The Sonoran HLA-DQ risk heterodimer proportion was 16.1% for HLA-DQ2 and 13.6% for HLA-DQ8, with an HLA-DQ2:HLA-DQ8 ratio of 1.2:1. The DQ8/DQ2 genotype represented a 1:14 risk for T1D, whereas the DQ8/DQB1*0201 combination showed a 1:6 risk for CD. The prevalence of CD autoimmunity in T1D children was 7%. CONCLUSION: The Sonoran population has a distinctive HLA-DQ allele distribution due to its ancestry. The HLA-DQ8 combinations with DQ2 or one of its alleles conferred the highest risk for both diseases, and T1D and CD frequently appear together.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Due to allergies or other health disorders a certain segment of the population is not able to safely consume some plant proteins, which are the main protein support in human nutrition. Coeliac disease is a prominent autoimmune disorder and requires a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. The aim of this study was to identify suitable combinations of enzymatic hydrolysis and common unit operations in food processing (centrifugation, ultra-filtration) to produce gluten-free wheat gluten hydrolysates for food application. To analyse the hydrolysates, a simple and cheap competitive ELISA protocol was designed and validated in this study as well. RESULTS: The competitive ELISA was validated using gliadin spiked skim milk protein hydrolysates, due to the latter application of the assay. The limit of quantification was 4.19 mg kg(-1) , which allowed the identification of gluten-free (<20 mg kg(-1) ) hydrolysates. Enzymatic hydrolysis, including the type of peptidase, and the downstream processing greatly affected the antigenicity of the hydrolysates. CONCLUSION: Enzymatic hydrolysis and downstream processing operations, such as centrifugation and ultra-filtration, reduced the antigenicity of wheat gluten hydrolysates. Gluten-free hydrolysates were obtained with Flavourzyme after centrifugation (25 g L(-1) substrate) and after 1 kDa ultra-filtration (100 g L(-1) substrate). A multiple peptidase complex, such as Flavourzyme, seems to be required for the production of gluten-free hydrolysates. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess dietary intake of coeliac disease (CD) patients and to determine if they are meeting the dietary reference values for a balanced diet. SUBJECTS/METHODS: 40 women with CD, aged from 23 to 76 participated in our study. Total daily intake was assessed by a three-day food diary. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was calculated using Harris-Benedict equation. Considering physical activity level (PAL) 1.4, the recommended total energy expenditure (TEE) value was determined. The data was evaluated with professional evaluation software Prodi and statistically analysed. RESULTS: 40 participants returned the food diary. The average energy intake was significantly too low to ensure the meeting of all-day energy needs (p<0.05). The meals contained a recommended proportion of protein, but a statistically significantly higher proportion of fat (p<0.05), lower proportion of carbohydrates and a significantly lower intake of dietary fibre (p<0.05). Regarding macro-, micro- elements and vitamins, there was a significant lack in the intake of calcium and iodine, folic acid, vitamin D and vitamin A (p<0.05), meanwhile iron intake was at the lower limit of the recommended intake, whereas zinc, potassium and vitamin K intake were significantly higher according to the recommended values, but were comparable with the intake of the general population in the Central European area. CONCLUSION: Even in subjects with adequate or low daily energy intake, their meals contained too much fat, too few carbohydrates and dietary fibre as well as inorganic substances. The patients with CD should get regular nutritional monitoring and education on the quality and balance of a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The duodenal biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease. However, given improvements in the performance of serological testing, the possibility of accurately diagnosing celiac disease without the need of a biopsy has attracted interest. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition has revised its recommendations to include a diagnostic algorithm that includes sequential serological testing and human leukocyte antigen genotyping for symptomatic children which would enable a diagnosis of celiac disease to be made in the absence of a confirmatory intestinal biopsy. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have evaluated the ESPGHAN guidelines and have mostly corroborated that celiac disease can be accurately diagnosed in specific pediatric patient populations without the need of a biopsy. However, two cautionary points have been raised that warrant further consideration - the success of this approach is highly dependent targeting a population with a high pretest probability of celiac disease, as well, the performance of serology assays must be established and the appropriate use of cutoffs is essential. SUMMARY: The duodenal biopsy will remain the gold standard for diagnosing celiac disease in a majority of patients. However, as serology assays evolve and as a greater understanding of the genetic risk factors of celiac disease is achieved, more patients may be accurately diagnosed without the need for a biopsy.},

   abstract = {The intestinal epithelium of adult humans acts as a differentially permeable barrier that separates the potentially harmful contents of the lumen from the underlying tissues. Any dysfunction of this boundary layer that disturbs the homeostatic equilibrium between the internal and external environments may initiate and sustain a biochemical cascade that results in inflammation of the intestine. Key to such dysfunction are genetic, microbial and other environmental factors that, singularly or in combination, result in chronic inflammation that is symptomatic of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the present review is to assess the scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that defective transepithelial transport mechanisms and the heightened absorption of intact antigenic proinflammatory oligopeptides are important contributing factors in the pathogenesis of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease, once thought to be uncommon in Asia, is now recognized in Asian nations as well. We investigated the prevalence of celiac disease in first-degree relatives of celiac disease patients followed in our centre. METHODS: First-degree relatives were screened prospectively for celiac disease using questionnaire-based interview and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody. Serology positive first-degree relatives underwent duodenal biopsies. Diagnosis of celiac disease was made based on positive serology and villous abnormality Marsh grade 2 or higher. Human leucocyte antigen DQ2/-DQ8 was also assessed in 127 first-degree relatives. RESULTS: 434 first-degree relatives of 176 celiac disease patients were prospectively recruited; 282 were symptomatic (64.9%), 58 were positive for serology (13.3%). Seroprevalence was higher in female than in males (19% vs 8.5%; p=0.001) and highest in siblings (16.9%) than parents (13.6%) and children (5.9%) of celiac patients (p=0.055); 87.4% first-degree relatives were human leucocyte antigen-DQ2/-DQ8 positive. Overall prevalence of celiac disease was 10.9% amongst first-degree relatives. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of celiac disease in first-degree relatives of celiac disease patients was 10.9% in our cohort, and 87% had human leucocyte antigen-DQ2 or -DQ8 haplotype. All first-degree relatives of celiac disease patients should be screen for celiac disease even if asymptomatic or with atypical manifestations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ten to 15% of first-degree relatives (FDRs) of celiac disease (CeD) patients develop CeD. Although intestinal barrier functions (intestinal permeability) are abnormal in the subset of serology-negative FDRs, what leads to the abnormal barrier function is not known. GOALS: To study the ultrastructure and functions of tight junctions in serology-negative FDRs of CeD patients. STUDY: The intestinal permeability was measured in 97 asymptomatic and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG Ab)-negative FDRs (using the lactulose mannitol ratio) and in 75 controls. The ultrastructure of tight junctions using transmission electron microscopy, and the expression of key tight junction proteins (claudin-2, claudin-3, occludin, JAM-A, and ZO-1) and zonulin using real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were assessed in anti-tTG Ab-negative, HLA-DQ2/-DQ8-positive FDRs having normal villi and in disease controls. In addition, the serum zonulin level was measured in 172 anti-tTG Ab-negative FDRs and 198 controls. RESULTS: The intestinal permeability was significantly increased in FDRs than in controls. Ultrastructural abnormalities such as dilatation of the tight junction (P=0.004) and loss of the pentalaminar structure (P=0.001) were more common in FDRs than in disease controls. There was significant underexpression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 (P=0.040) and occludin (P=0.041) in FDRs. There was no significant difference in the serum zonulin level between FDRs and controls (P=0.154). CONCLUSIONS: Even asymptomatic, anti-tTG-Ab-negative FDRs with a normal villous histology have both ultrastructural and functional abnormalities in tight junctions. These findings are indirect evidence of the presence of tight junction abnormalities before the onset of the disease and may have therapeutic implications.},

   abstract = {Notwithstanding a growth in popularity and consumption of gluten-free (GF) food products, there is a lack of substantiated analysis of the nutritional quality compared with their gluten-containing counterparts. To put GF foods into proper perspective both for those who need it (patients with celiac disease) and for those who do not, we provide contemporary data about cost and nutritional quality of GF food products. The objective of this study is to develop a food composition database for seven discretionary food categories of packaged GF products. Nutrient composition, nutritional information and cost of foods from 63 GF and 126 gluten-containing counterparts were systematically obtained from 12 different Austrian supermarkets. The nutrition composition (macro and micronutrients) was analyzed by using two nutrient composition databases in a stepwise approximation process. A total of 63 packaged GF foods were included in the analysis representing a broad spectrum of different GF categories (flour/bake mix, bread and bakery products, pasta and cereal-based food, cereals, cookies and cakes, snacks and convenience food). Our results show that the protein content of GF products is >2 fold lower across 57% of all food categories. In 65% of all GF foods, low sodium content was observed (defined as <120 mg/100 g). Across all GF products, 19% can be classified as source high in fiber (defined as >6g/100 g). On average, GF foods were substantially higher in cost, ranging from +205% (cereals) to +267% (bread and bakery products) compared to similar gluten-containing products. In conclusion, our results indicate that for GF foods no predominant health benefits are indicated; in fact, some critical nutrients must be considered when being on a GF diet. For individuals with celiac disease, the GF database provides a helpful tool to identify the food composition of their medical diet. For healthy consumers, replacing gluten-containing products with GF foods is aligned with substantial cost differences but GF foods do not provide additional health benefits from a nutritional perspective.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CeD) is a highly heritable common autoimmune disease involving chronic small intestinal inflammation in response to dietary wheat. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, and 40 newer regions identified by genome wide association studies (GWAS) and dense fine mapping, account for approximately 40% of the disease heritability. We hypothesized that in pedigrees with multiple individuals with CeD rare [minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.5%] mutations of larger effect size (odds ratios of approximately 2-5) might exist. We sequenced the exomes of 75 coeliac individuals of European ancestry from 55 multiply affected families. We selected interesting variants and genes for further follow up using a combination of: an assessment of shared variants between related subjects, a model-free linkage test, and gene burden tests for multiple, potentially causal, variants. We next performed highly multiplexed amplicon resequencing of all RefSeq exons from 24 candidate genes selected on the basis of the exome sequencing data in 2,248 unrelated coeliac cases and 2,230 controls. 1,335 variants with a 99.9% genotyping call rate were observed in 4,478 samples, of which 939 were present in coding regions of 24 genes (Ti/Tv 2.99). 91.7% of coding variants were rare (MAF <0.5%) and 60% were novel. Gene burden tests performed on rare functional variants identified no significant associations (p<1x10(-3)) in the resequenced candidate genes. Our strategy of sequencing multiply affected families with deep follow up of candidate genes has not identified any new CeD risk mutations.},

   abstract = {The composition of the gut microbiome reflects the overall health status of the host. In this study, stool samples representing the gut microbiomes from 6 gluten-sensitive (GS) captive juvenile rhesus macaques were compared with those from 6 healthy, age- and diet-matched peers. A total of 48 samples representing both groups were studied using V4 16S rRNA gene DNA analysis. Samples from GS macaques were further characterized based on type of diet administered: conventional monkey chow, i.e., wheat gluten-containing diet (GD), gluten-free diet (GFD), barley gluten-derived diet (BOMI) and reduced gluten barley-derived diet (RGB). It was hypothesized that the GD diet would lower the gut microbial diversity in GS macaques. This is the first report illustrating the reduction of gut microbial alpha-diversity (p < 0.05) following the consumption of dietary gluten in GS macaques. Selected bacterial families (e.g., Streptococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae) were enriched in GS macaques while Coriobacteriaceae was enriched in healthy animals. Within several weeks after the replacement of the GD by the GFD diet, the composition (beta-diversity) of gut microbiome in GS macaques started to change (p = 0.011) towards that of a normal macaque. Significance for alpha-diversity however, was not reached by the day 70 when the feeding experiment ended. Several inflammation-associated microRNAs (miR-203, -204, -23a, -23b and -29b) were upregulated (p < 0.05) in jejunum of 4 biopsied GS macaques fed GD with predicted binding sites on 16S ribosomal RNA of Lactobacillus reuteri (accession number: NR_025911), Prevotella stercorea (NR_041364) and Streptococcus luteciae (AJ297218) that were overrepresented in feces. Additionally, claudin-1, a validated tight junction protein target of miR-29b was significantly downregulated in jejunal epithelium of GS macaques. Taken together, we predict that with the introduction of effective treatments in future studies the diversity of gut microbiomes in GS macaques will approach those of healthy individuals. Further studies are needed to elucidate the regulatory pathways of inflammatory miRNAs in intestinal mucosa of GS macaques and to correlate their expression with gut dysbiosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated small bowel disorder that develops in genetically susceptible individuals upon exposure to dietary gluten. Celiac disease could have extra-intestinal manifestations that affect women's reproductive health. The aim of this study was to investigate fertility and outcomes of pregnancy among women with celiac disease. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we analyzed information collected from patients at a tertiary care celiac center and from members of 2 national celiac disease awareness organizations. Women without celiac disease were used as controls. Women completed an anonymous online survey, answering 43 questions about menstrual history, fertility, and outcomes of pregnancy (329 with small bowel biopsy-confirmed celiac disease and 641 controls). RESULTS: Of the 970 women included in the study, 733 (75.6%) reported that they had been pregnant at some point; there was no significant difference between women with celiac disease (n=245/329, 74.5%) and controls (488/641, 76.1%; P=0.57). However, fewer women with celiac disease than controls (79.6% vs. 84.8%) gave birth following 1 or more pregnancies (P=0.03). Women with celiac disease had higher percentages of spontaneous abortion than controls (50.6% vs. 40.6%; P=0.01), and of premature delivery (23.6% vs. 15.9% among controls; P=0.02). The mean age at menarche was higher in the celiac disease group (12.7 years) than controls (12.4 years; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective cohort analysis examining reproductive features of women with celiac disease, we associated celiac disease with significant increases in spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and later age of menarche.},

   abstract = {Celiac Disease (CD) is an interferon (IFN)gamma-mediated duodenal hypersensitivity to wheat gluten occurring in genetically predisposed individuals. Gluten-free diet (GFD) leads to a complete remission of the disease. Valpha24-restricted invariant NKT (iNKT) cells are important to maintain immune homeostasis in the gut mucosa because of their unique capacity to rapidly produce large quantities of both T-helper (Th)1 and Th2 cytokines upon stimulation. We studied the presence of these cells in the CD duodenum. Duodenal biopsies were obtained from 45 untreated-CD patients (uCD), 15 Gluten Free Diet-CD patients (GFD-CD), 44 non-inflamed non-CD controls (C-controls) and 15 inflamed non-CD controls (I-controls). Two populations from Spain and Argentina were recruited. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of Valpha24-Jalpha18 (invariant TCRalpha chain of human iNKT cells), IFNgamma and intracellular transcription factor Forkhead Box P3 (Foxp3), and flow cytometry intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) profile were determined. Both uCD and GFD-CD patients had higher Valpha24-Jalpha18 mRNA levels than non-CD controls (I and C-controls). The expression of Valpha24-Jalpha18 correlated with Marsh score for the severity of mucosal lesion and also with increased mRNA IFNgamma levels. uCD and GFD-CD patients had decreased mRNA expression of FoxP3 but increased expression of Valpha24-Jalpha18, which revealed a CD-like molecular profile. Increased numbers of iNKT cells were confirmed by flow cytometry within the intraepithelial lymphocyte compartment of uCD and GFD-CD patients and correlated with Valpha24-Jalpha18 mRNA expression. In conclusion, we have found an increased number of iNKT cells in the duodenum from both uCD and GFD-CD patients, irrespective of the mucosal status. A CD-like molecular profile, defined by an increased mRNA expression of Valpha24-Jalpha18 together with a decreased expression of FoxP3, may represent a pro-inflammatory signature of the CD duodenum.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE Histological evaluation of intestinal biopsies for the diagnosis of coeliac disease can be challenging and compatible with risk of misdiagnosis. The aim was to evaluate the agreement of pathological diagnosis for coeliac disease in children investigated at four major paediatric university hospitals in Sweden. MATERIALS AND METHODS Intestinal duodenal biopsies were collected from 402 children at median 9.7 years (1.4-18.3 years). A pathologist at each hospital performed the primary evaluation. A designated pathologist, blinded to the primary evaluation, performed a second Marsh classification of biopsies (M0 to M3c) taken from the bulb and duodenum separately. Kappa (kappa) scores between first and second evaluation determined the agreement. Plasma samples were collected at the day of intestinal biopsy and analysed for tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA) using radioligand-binding assays. RESULTS Marsh scores were concordant in 229/356 biopsies (64%, kappa = 0.52, p < 0.0001). Among discordant results, 15/127 (12%) showed M0 in distal duodenum but >/= M2 in the bulb, whereas the opposite was true for 8/127 (6%) of the biopsies. There were fewer collected duodenal biopsies, more missing bulb biopsies and missing CD3 staining among discordant evaluations. The second evaluation revealed a Marsh score compliant with coeliac disease in 22 children of whom seven children were tTGA positive. CONCLUSIONS The variation between university hospitals on the pathological evaluation of biopsies may lead to misdiagnosis of coeliac disease in paediatric patients. Access to clinical and endoscopic information as well as tTGA levels may be useful for the pathologist to complement the evaluation in dubious cases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Risk gene variants for celiac disease, identified in genome-wide linkage and association studies, might influence molecular pathways important for disease development. The aim was to examine expression levels of potential risk genes close to these variants in the small intestine and peripheral blood and also to test if the non-coding variants affect nearby gene expression levels in children with celiac disease. METHODS: Intestinal biopsy and peripheral blood RNA was isolated from 167 children with celiac disease, 61 with potential celiac disease and 174 disease controls. Transcript levels for 88 target genes, selected from celiac disease risk loci, were analyzed in biopsies of a smaller sample subset by qPCR. Differentially expressed genes (3 from the pilot and 8 previously identified) were further validated in the larger sample collection (n = 402) of both tissues and correlated to nearby celiac disease risk variants. RESULTS: All genes were significantly down- or up-regulated in the intestinal mucosa of celiac disease children, NTS being most down-regulated (Fold change 3.6, p < 0.001). In contrast, PPP1R12B isoform C was up-regulated in the celiac disease mucosa (Fold change 1.9, p < 0.001). Allele specific expression of GLS (rs6741418, p = 0.009), INSR (rs7254060, p = 0.003) and NCALD (rs652008, p = 0.005) was also detected in the biopsies. Two genes (APPL2 and NCALD) were differentially expressed in peripheral blood but no allele specific expression was observed in this tissue. CONCLUSION: The differential expression of NTS and PPP1R12B indicate a potential role for smooth muscle contractility and cell proliferation in celiac disease, whereas other genes like GLS, NCALD and INSR suggests involvement of nutrient signaling and energy homeostasis in celiac disease pathogenesis. A disturbance in any of these pathways might contribute to development of childhood celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only management for coeliac disease (CD). Available methods to assess GFD compliance are insufficiently sensitive to detect occasional dietary transgressions that may cause gut mucosal damage. We aimed to develop a method to determine gluten intake and monitor GFD compliance in patients with CD and to evaluate its correlation with mucosal damage. DESIGN: Urine samples of 76 healthy subjects and 58 patients with CD subjected to different gluten dietary conditions were collected. A lateral flow test (LFT) with the highly sensitive and specific G12 monoclonal antibody for the most dominant gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) and a LFT reader were used to quantify GIP in solid-phase extracted urines. RESULTS: GIP were detectable in concentrated urines from healthy individuals previously subjected to GFD as early as 4-6 h after single gluten intake, and remained detectable for 1-2 days. The urine assay revealed infringement of the GFD in about 50% of the patients. Analysis of duodenal biopsies revealed that most of patients with CD (89%) with no villous atrophy had no detectable GIP in urine, while all patients with quantifiable GIP in urine showed incomplete intestinal mucosa recovery. CONCLUSION: GIP are detected in urine after gluten consumption, enabling a new and non-invasive method to monitor GFD compliance and transgressions. The method was sensitive, specific and simple enough to be convenient for clinical monitoring of patients with CD as well as for basic and clinical research applications including drug development.

Previous GWAS also revealed an over-representation of genes involved in type 2 diabetes and anorexia nervosa associated with celiac disease, suggesting involvement of common metabolic pathways for development of these chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to extend these previous analyses to study the gene expression in the gut from children with active celiac disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty six target genes involved in type 2 diabetes and four genes associated with anorexia nervosa were investigated for gene expression in small intestinal biopsies from 144 children with celiac disease at median (range) age of 7.4 years (1.6-17.8) and from 154 disease controls at a median (range) age 11.4.years (1.4-18.3). RESULTS: A total of eleven of genes were differently expressed in celiac patients compared with disease controls of which CD36, CD38, FOXP1, SELL, PPARA, PPARG, AGT previously associated with type 2 diabetes and AKAP6, NTNG1 with anorexia nervosa remained significant after correction for multiple testing. CONCLUSION: Shared genetic factors involved in celiac disease, type 2 diabetes and anorexia nervosa suggest common underlying molecular pathways for these diseases.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is defined as a state of heightened immunologic responsiveness to ingested gluten (from wheat, barley, or rye) in genetically susceptible individuals. Ingestion of the offending proteins leads to inflammation and intestinal mucosal damage, which may result in a spectrum of gastrointestinal symptoms, nutritional abnormalities, and systemic complications ranging from anemia and osteoporosis to secondary autoimmunity and malignancy. The genetic influence in the pathogenesis of celiac disease is indicated by its familial occurrence. Celiac disease does not develop unless a person has alleles that encode for human leukocyte antigen DQ2 or DQ8 proteins. The clinical picture of celiac disease has changed considerably during the past 30 years. Diarrhea, which was the presenting symptom in > 90% of celiac disease patients before 1981, is now the chief complaint in < 40%. In contrast, the increased frequency of atypical celiac disease presentations, including anemia and bone disease, is revealed by the widespread availability of serologic testing. An association between celiac disease and autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, and Sjogren's syndrome, has been well documented. The tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin antibody and the endomysial immunoglobulin antibody are the most sensitive and specific serologic tests, respectively, for identifying individuals who need to undergo an intestinal biopsy. If the suspicion of celiac disease is high, intestinal biopsy should be pursued even if serologic tests are negative. The gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease is a small bowel biopsy showing villous atrophy. The treatment for celiac disease is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Despite the proven benefits of the GFD, it can be exceedingly difficult to completely avoid gluten-containing foods, and adherence to a GFD is estimated to be only 45% to 80%.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) incidence has increased in recent decades, characterised by variations according to sex, age at diagnosis, year of birth, month of birth and region of birth. Genetic susceptibility and exposure to gluten are the necessary factors in CD aetiology, although several environmental factors are considered. METHODS: A nationwide prospective cohort longitudinal study was conducted consisting of 1 912 204 children aged 0-14.9 years born in Sweden from 1991 to 2009. A total of 6569 children were diagnosed with biopsy-verified CD from 47 paediatric departments. Using Cox regression, we examined the association between CD diagnosis and season of birth, region of birth and year of birth. RESULTS: Overall, CD risk was higher for children born during spring, summer and autumn as compared with children born during winter: adjusted HR for spring 1.08 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.16), summer 1.10 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.18) and autumn 1.10 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.18). Increased CD risk was highest if born in the south, followed by central Sweden when compared with children born in northern Sweden. Children diagnosed at <2 years had an increased CD risk if born in spring while those diagnosed at 2-14.9 years the risk was increased for summer and autumn births. The birth cohort of 1991-1996 had increased CD risk if born during spring, for the 1997-2002 birth cohort the risk increased for summer and autumn births, while for the birth cohort of 2003-2009 the risk was increased if born during autumn. CONCLUSIONS: Season of birth and region of birth are independently and jointly associated with increased risk of developing CD during the first 15 years of life. Seasonal variation in infectious load is the likely explanation.},

We aimed to explore how conditions related to maternity, delivery and the neonatal period influence CD onset during childhood. METHODS: Using Sweden's national registers we had access to information on 1 912 204 children born between 1991 and 2009, 6 596 of whom developed CD before 15 years of age. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine how CD is associated with maternity, delivery and the neonatal period. RESULTS: Regardless of sex, a reduction in CD risk was observed in children born to mothers aged >/=35 years (odds ratio [OR] 0.8; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.7-0.9) and with high maternal income (OR 0.9; 95 % CI 0.8-0.9). Being a second-born child, however, was positively associated with CD. Among boys, elective caesarean delivery increased the risk of CD (OR 1.2; 95 % CI 1.0-1.4), while maternal overweight (OR 0.9; 95 % CI 0.8-0.9), premature rupture of the membrane (OR 0.4; 95 % CI 0.2-0.8) and low birth weight showed a negative association. Girls had an increased CD risk compared to boys and in girls the risk was increased by repeated maternal urinary tract infections (OR 1.1; 95 % CI 1.0-1.2). CONCLUSIONS: Elective caesarean delivery and repeated maternal urinary tract infections during pregnancy are associated with increased risk of CD onset during childhood, suggesting the role of dysbiosis during early life. High maternal age and high income reduced the risk of CD, which might be due to infant-feeding practices and life style.},

   abstract = {Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is a rare complication of coeliac disease (CD) and involves malabsorption and villous atrophy despite adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) for at least 12 months in the absence of another cause. RCD is classified based on the T-cells in the intra-epithelial lymphocyte (IEL) morphology into type 1 with normal IEL and type 2 with aberrant IEL (clonal) by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for T cell receptors (TCR) at the beta/gamma loci. RCD type 1 is managed with strict nutritional and pharmacological management. RCD type 2 can be complicated by ulcerative jejunitis or enteropathy associated lymphoma (EATL), the latter having a five-year mortality of 50%. Management options for RCD type 2 and response to treatment differs across centres and there have been debates over the best treatment option. Treatment options that have been used include azathioprine and steroids, methotrexate, cyclosporine, campath (an anti CD-52 monoclonal antibody), and cladribine or fluadribine with or without autologous stem cell transplantation. We present a tertiary centre's experience in the treatment of RCD type 2 where treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine was used, and our results show good response with histological recovery in 56.6% of treated individuals.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Key aims of treatment of coeliac disease are to heal the intestinal mucosa and correct nutritional abnormalities. AIM: We aim to determine prospectively the degree of success and time course of achieving those goals with a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients were enrolled at diagnosis and taught the diet. The first 52 were reassessed at 1 year and 46 at 5 years, 25 being assessed at the three time points regarding dietary compliance (dietitian-assessed), coeliac serology, bone mineral density and body composition analysis by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and intestinal histology. RESULTS: Mean age (range) was 40 (18-71) years and 48 (76%) were female. Dietary compliance was very good to excellent in all but one. Tissue transglutaminase IgA was persistently elevated in 44% at 1 year and 30% at 5 years and were poorly predictive of mucosal disease. Rates of mucosal remission (Marsh 0) and response (Marsh 0/1) were 37% and 54%, and 50% and 85% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Fat mass increased significantly over the first year in those with normal/reduced body mass index. Lean body mass indices more slowly improved irrespective of status at diagnosis with significant improvement at 5 years. Bone mass increased only in those with osteopenia or osteoporosis, mostly in year 1. CONCLUSION: Dietary compliance is associated with a high chance of healing the intestinal lesion and correction of specific body compositional abnormalities. The time course differed with body fat improving within 1 year, and correction of the mucosal lesion and improvement in lean mass and bone mass taking longer.},

   abstract = {Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is a rare and usually rapidly fatal intestinal T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It arises from intraepithelial lymphocytes and has a high association with coeliac disease. The high mortality of EATL is associated not only with the very aggressive and often chemotherapy-refractory nature of the lymphoma. The poor condition of patients due to prolonged and severe malnutrition compromises the ability to deliver chemotherapy. There are no standardized treatment protocols, and the optimal therapy for EATL remains unclear. The primary step of treatment consists of local debulking, preferably as early as possible after EATL diagnosis. Morbidity and mortality seem to rise with advanced stages of disease due to tumour size progression, worse nutritional status and a higher risk of emergency surgery due to perforation. Standard induction therapy for EATL is anthracycline-based chemotherapy, preferably resumed between 2 and 5 weeks after surgery (depending on clinical condition). Intensification of therapy using high-dose chemotherapy followed by consolidation with BEAM and autologous stem cell transplantation is associated with better outcome. Notably, this treatment strategy has only been applied in patients eligible for this aggressive regimen which might reflect selection bias. Unfortunately, prognosis of EATL remains poor; 5-year survival varies from 8 to 60% depending on the eligibility to receive additional steps of therapy. New treatment strategies are urgently needed for a better prognosis of this lethal complication of coeliac disease. Brentuximab vedotin (anti-CD30) might be promising when added to conventional chemotherapy and is suggested as upfront treatment in EATL.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Refractory coeliac disease type II (RCDII) frequently transforms into an enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) and therefore requires intensive treatment. Current evaluated treatment strategies for RCDII include cladribine (2-CdA) and autologous stem cell transplantation (auSCT). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term survival and define clear prognostic criteria for EATL development comparing two treatment strategies. METHODS: A total of 45 patients were retrospectively analysed. All patients received 2-CdA, after which they were either closely monitored (monotherapy, n = 30) or a step-up approach was used including auSCT (step-up therapy, n = 15). RESULTS: Ten patients (22%) ultimately developed EATL; nine of these had received monotherapy. Absence of histological remission after monotherapy was associated with EATL development (p = 0.010). Overall, 20 patients (44%) died with a median survival of 84 months. Overall survival (OS) within the monotherapy group was significantly worse in those without histological remission compared to those with complete histological remission(p = 0.030). The monotherapy group who achieved complete histological remission showed comparable EATL occurrence and OS as compared to the step-up therapy group (p = 0.80 and p = 0.14 respectively). CONCLUSION: Histological response is an accurate parameter to evaluate the effect of 2-CdA therapy and this parameter should be leading in the decisions whether or not to perform a step-up treatment approach in RCDII.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is treated by life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). Novel therapies are under development. Willingness of CD children's parents to alternative therapies and GFD impact were evaluated. METHODS: Parents of celiac children on GFD were investigated on need and preference for novel CD therapies, children's enrolment in trials, compliance to and personal judgment on GFD, health status (HS) and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: About 59.5% surveyed parents expressed the need for alternative therapies with a preference for vaccine-based strategy (39.9%). About 37.7% would accept enrollment in an ad hoc trial, 20.3% would agree to endoscopy during the trial. GFD compliance was 97.4% and well accepted by 93.8%. HS and QoL significantly improved during GFD (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of novel therapies for CD is desirable for over half of parents, with preference for vaccines. Parents frown upon enrolment in new clinical trials and the subsequent need for additional endoscopy.},

AIM: To determine the relationship between adiposity and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in malabsorption disorders. METHODS: Prepubertal children of ages 3-12 with either lactose intolerance (LI) (n = 38, age 8.61 +/- 3.08, male/female 19/19), or celiac disease (CD) (n = 24) were compared to healthy controls (n = 49, age 7.95 +/- 2.64, male/female 28/21). A separate cohort of combined prepubertal and pubertal subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (n = 59, age 16.4 +/- 2.2, male/female 31/27) were also compared to healthy controls (n = 116, male/female 49/67, age 14.6 +/- 4.4). Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D of <50 nmol/l, overweight as body mass index (BMI) of >/= 85th but <95th percentile, and obesity as BMI >/= 95th percentile. RESULTS: Among the controls, 25(OH)D was significantly higher in the normal-weight prepubertal controls vs. the overweight/obese controls (p = 0.001), and similarly so for the combined cohort of prepubertal and pubertal controls (p = 0.031). In contrast, there was no significant difference in 25(OH)D concentration between the normal-weight vs. overweight/obese patients with LI (p = 0.335), CD (p = 0.387), and IBD (p = 0.883).

   abstract = {A fundamental function of the intestinal epithelium is to act as a barrier that limits interactions between luminal contents such as the intestinal microbiota, the underlying immune system and the remainder of the body, while supporting vectorial transport of nutrients, water and waste products. Epithelial barrier function requires a contiguous layer of cells as well as the junctions that seal the paracellular space between epithelial cells. Compromised intestinal barrier function has been associated with a number of disease states, both intestinal and systemic. Unfortunately, most current clinical data are correlative, making it difficult to separate cause from effect in interpreting the importance of barrier loss. Some data from experimental animal models suggest that compromised epithelial integrity might have a pathogenic role in specific gastrointestinal diseases, but no FDA-approved agents that target the epithelial barrier are presently available. To develop such therapies, a deeper understanding of both disease pathogenesis and mechanisms of barrier regulation must be reached. Here, we review and discuss mechanisms of intestinal barrier loss and the role of intestinal epithelial barrier function in pathogenesis of both intestinal and systemic diseases. We conclude with a discussion of potential strategies to restore the epithelial barrier.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Histologic changes in celiac disease (CD) may be patchy or confined to the bulb. Present guidelines recommend obtaining multiple biopsies from the bulb and distal duodenum when evaluating for CD. Adherence to these recommendations among adult gastroenterologists is low. There are no such data for pediatric gastroenterologists. This study compared endoscopic biopsy practices among pediatric gastroenterologists in histologically confirmed patients with CD to those without histologically confirmed CD. METHODS: Retrospective review of esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs) during a 13-month period was performed. Children with histologically confirmed CD and a random sample of age-matched children without CD were identified. Endoscopy and histology reports were reviewed. The site and number of biopsy samples obtained was recorded. The groups were compared for number of biopsies. RESULTS: A total of 98 children with CD were compared with 103 controls without CD. The number of biopsies obtained in the group with CD was higher than the group without CD (5.9 +/- 1.6 vs 3.6 +/- 1.2) (P < 0.0001). In children with CD, 80.5% had >/=5 biopsies compared with 11.7% in the group without CD (P < 0.0001). Only 10% of the children in the group with CD had bulb biopsies documented compared with none in the group without CD. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric gastroenterologists at our center generally obtain the recommended number of biopsies in children with histologically confirmed CD but seldom document biopsies from the bulb. In those without histologic evidence of CD, fewer biopsies are obtained with none documented from the bulb. Failure to take the recommended number of biopsies could result in some missed cases of CD.},

   abstract = {Canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates the homeostasis of intestinal epithelium by controlling the balance between intestinal stem cell self-renewal and differentiation but epigenetic mechanisms enacting the process are not known. We hypothesized that epigenetic regulator, Polycomb Repressive Complex-2 (PRC2), is involved in Wnt-mediated epithelial homeostasis on the crypt-villus axis and aberrancies therein are implicated both in celiac disease and in intestinal malignancies. We found that PRC2 establishes repressive crypt and villus specific trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) signature on genes responsible for, for example, nutrient transport and cell killing in crypts and, for example, proliferation and differentiation in mature villi, suggesting that PRC2 facilitates the Wnt-governed intestinal homeostasis. When celiac patients are on gluten-containing diet PRC2 is out-of-bounds active and consequently its target genes were found affected in intestinal epithelium. Significant set of effective intestinal PRC2 targets are also differentially expressed in colorectal adenoma and carcinomas. Our results suggest that PRC2 gives rise and maintains polar crypt and villus specific H3K27me3 signatures. As H3K27me3 is a mark enriched in developmentally important genes, identified intestinal PRC2 targets are possibly imperative drivers for enterocyte differentiation and intestinal stem cell maintenance downstream to Wnt-signaling. Our work also elucidates the mechanism sustaining the crypt hyperplasia in celiac disease and suggest that PRC2-dependent fostering of epithelial stemness is a common attribute in intestinal diseases in which epithelial hyperplasia or neoplasia prevails. Finally, this work demonstrates that in intestine PRC2 represses genes having both pro-stemness and pro-differentiation functions, fact need to be considered when designing epigenetic therapies including PRC2 as a drug target.

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate whether breast-milk composition and microbiota differ in healthy mothers and mothers with celiac disease (CD) to ultimately contribute to identify additional factors determining CD risk. METHODS: Breast-milk samples from healthy mothers (n = 12) and mothers with CD (n = 12) were collected. Cytokines and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) were analyzed by bead-arrays and flow cytometry and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) were assessed by capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF) detection. Breast-milk microbiota composition was analyzed by conventional and quantitative real-time PCR. RESULT: Breast milk from CD mothers showed significantly lower levels of interleukin (IL) 12p70 (P < 0.042), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 (P < 0.018) and sIgA (P < 0.003) and almost significantly lower levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma (P < 0.058). Six mothers in each group belonged to the secretor Le(a-b+) type, one to the secretor Le(a-b-) type and five to the non-secretor Le(a+b-) type. CD mothers of non-secretor Le(a+b-) type showed increased Lacto-N-tetraose content (P < 0.042) compared with healthy mothers. CD mothers' milk showed reduced gene copy numbers of Bifidobacterium spp. (P < 0.026) and B. fragilis group (P < 0.044). CONCLUSION: CD mothers' breast milk is characterized by a reduced abundance of immunoprotective compounds (TGF-beta1 and sIgA) and bifidobacteria. The reduction in these components could theoretically diminish the protective effects of breast-feeding on the child's future risk of developing CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intestinal dysbiosis has been associated with coeliac disease (CD), but whether the alterations are cause or consequence of the disease is unknown. This study investigated whether the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 genotype is an independent factor influencing the early gut microbiota composition of healthy infants at family risk of CD. DESIGN: As part of a larger prospective study, a subset (n=22) of exclusively breastfed and vaginally delivered infants with either high genetic risk (HLA-DQ2 carriers) or low genetic risk (non-HLA-DQ2/8 carriers) of developing CD were selected from a cohort of healthy infants with at least one first-degree relative with CD. Infant faecal microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and real time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Infants with a high genetic risk had significantly higher proportions of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and lower proportions of Actinobacteria compared with low-risk infants. At genus level, high-risk infants had significantly less Bifidobacterium and unclassified Bifidobacteriaceae proportions and more Corynebacterium, Gemella, Clostridium sensu stricto, unclassified Clostridiaceae, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae and Raoultella proportions. Quantitative real time PCR also revealed lower numbers of Bifidobacterium species in infants with high genetic risk than in those with low genetic risk. In high-risk infants negative correlations were identified between Bifidobacterium species and several genera of Proteobacteria (Escherichia/Shigella) and Firmicutes (Clostridium). CONCLUSIONS: The genotype of infants at family risk of developing CD, carrying the HLA-DQ2 haplotypes, influences the early gut microbiota composition. This finding suggests that a specific disease-biased host genotype may also select for the first gut colonisers and could contribute to determining disease risk.},

   abstract = {The publication of papers on the topic of gluten related disorders has substantially increased over the last few years. This has motivated healthcare professionals to pay attention not only to celiac disease and wheat allergy but also to a condition termed nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Until now this condition has been diagnosed clinically on the basis of exclusion criteria and clinical response to gluten withdrawal. In addition, recent research in this field has shown that other food components distinct from gluten are implicated in NCGS cases, thereby changing our general understanding of NCGS diagnosis in either individuals on gluten containing diets or those already following a gluten-free diet with no proper diagnostic work-up of celiac disease. With this in mind, the assessment of NCGS will require extensive knowledge of celiac disease manifestations and the laboratory tests commonly performed during diagnosis of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {The prevalence of symptomatic adverse reactions to gluten and adherence to gluten-free diet in Latin American countries is unknown. These measurements are strongly linked to gluten-related disorders. This work aimed to estimate the prevalence of adverse reactions to oral gluten and the adherence to gluten-free diet in the adult Mexican population. To reach this aim, a self-administered questionnaire was designed and tested for clarity/comprehension and reproducibility. Then, a self-administered questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the Mexican population. The estimated prevalence rates were (95% CI): 11.9% (9.9-13.5) and 7.8 (6.4-9.4) for adverse and recurrent adverse reactions to gluten respectively; adherence to gluten-free diet 3.7% (2.7-4.8), wheat allergy 0.72% (0.38-1.37); celiac disease 0.08% (0.01-0.45), and NCGS 0.97% (0.55-1.68). Estimated pooled prevalence of self-reported physician-diagnosis of gluten-related disorders was 0.88% (0.49-1.5), and 93.3% respondents reported adherence to gluten-free diet without a physician-diagnosis of gluten-related disorders. Symptom comparisons between those who reported recurrent adverse reactions to gluten and other foods showed statistically significant differences for bloating, constipation, and tiredness (p < 0.05). Gluten-related disorders may be underdiagnosed in the Mexican population and most people adhering to a gluten-free diet are doing it without proper diagnostic work-up of these disorders, and probably without medical/dietician advice.},

Fruit by-products are know from literature to contain a high level of dietary fibre which could improve the bread properties and fibre contents of gluten-free bread. Therefore, a mathematical design was created; three variables were identified from preliminary tests (water (85-100% flour weight, OP 0-8% flour weight and proofing time 35-100 min) as being crucial in the development of acceptable bread. Results illustrated longer proofing times (p<0.05) and lower orange pomace levels (OP) (p<0.001) produced a bread with a greater specific volume. OP had the most significant (p<0.0001) effect on hardness at 2h and 24h post-baking. The optimised formulation was calculated to contain 5.5% OP, 94.6% water and a proofing time of 49 min. Total fibre content of the control bread (2.1%) was successfully increased t o 3.9% in the OP containing bread. Substituting gluten-free flours with orange pomace flour can help improve the total dietary intake of a coeliac while not negating on the quality properties of the bread.},

We aimed to evaluate whether combining IgA tTG and IgG anti-deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) antibody testing and taking into account the antibody levels improves clinical interpretation. METHODS: We calculated likelihood ratios for various test result combinations using data obtained from newly diagnosed CD patients (n=156) [13 children <2 years, 45 children between 2 and 16 years, and 98 adults (>16 years)] and 974 disease controls. All patients and controls underwent duodenal biopsy. IgA anti-tTG and IgG anti-DGP assays were from Thermo Fisher and Inova. RESULTS: Likelihood ratios for CD markedly increased with double positivity and increasing antibody levels of IgA anti-tTG and IgG anti-DGP. Patients with double positivity and high antibody levels (>3 times, >10 times ULN) had a high probability for having CD (likelihood ratio >/=649 for >3 times ULN and infinity for >10 times ULN). The fraction of CD patients with double positivity and high antibody levels was 59%-67% (depending on the assay) for >3 ULN and 33%-36% (depending on the assay) for >10 ULN, respectively. This fraction was significantly higher in children with CD than in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Combining IgG anti-DGP with IgA anti-tTG and defining thresholds for antibody levels improves the serologic diagnosis of CD.},

Immunoassays such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are commonly used to quantify gluten in foods. However, various non-assay related factors can affect gluten quantitation. The effect of gluten-containing grain cultivars, thermal processing, and enzymatic hydrolysis on gluten quantitation by various ELISA kits was evaluated. The ELISA kits exhibited variations in gluten quantitation depending on the gluten-containing grain and their cultivars. Acceptable gluten recoveries were obtained in 200mg/kg wheat, rye, and barley-spiked corn flour thermally processed at various conditions. However, depending on the enzyme, gluten grain source, and ELISA kit used, measured gluten content was significantly reduced in corn flour spiked with 200mg/kg hydrolyzed wheat, rye, and barley flour. Thus, the gluten grain source and processing conditions should be considered for accurate gluten analysis.},

A 61-year-old obese woman developed severe diarrhea soon after bariatric surgery (BS), which was unresponsive to standard medical treatment. After the most common diarrhea etiologies in the immediate postoperative period have been excluded, serological tests were performed. Final diagnosis was determined by anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody positivity. In light of this case report, we propose that CD should be ruled out in any patient presenting with typical or atypical symptoms after BS, regardless of the latency of onset.},

   abstract = {The current review paper highlights the complicacies associated with communities relying on wheat as their dietary staple. Although, wheat is an important source of nutrients but is also linked with allergenic responses in genetically susceptible subjects. The wheat proteins especially alpha-amylase inhibitors, omega-5 gliadins, prolamins, nonprolamin, glucoprotein, and profilins are of significance importance. The allergenic responses are further categorized into IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions. Conjugation and degranulation of the IgEs with the allergens results in release of several mediators. In contrary, non-IgE-mediated wheat allergy depends on immune complexes formed by food and food antibodies and cell-mediated immunity. As results, different diseases tend to occur on the completion of these reactions, i.e., celiac disease, baker's asthma, diarrhea, atopic dermatitis, and urticaria. This instant paper highlighted the concept of food allergy with special reference to wheat. The models are developed that are included in this paper showing the wheat allergen, their possible routes, impact on human health, and indeed possible remedies. The paper would provide the basic information for the researchers, common man, and allied stakeholders to cater the issue in details. However, the issue needs the attention of the researchers as there is a need to clarify the issues of wheat allergy and wheat intolerance.},

   abstract = {Bloating, abdominal discomfort or pain, disturbed bowel habits are very common symptoms, frequently reported by the patients soon after food ingestion. These symptoms may occur in different clinical conditions, such as functional bowel disorders, food adverse reactions, gluten-related syndromes, which frequently are interrelated. Consequently, in clinical practice, it is necessary to perform a correct diagnosis in order to identify, for the single patient, the most appropriate therapeutic strategy, which may include not only specific drugs, but also, and mainly, life style changes (healthy nutritional behavior and constant physical activity). The aim of this review is to provide to the general physician, according to the available evidence, the most appropriate diagnostic work-ups for recognizing the different clinical scenarios (i.e. food allergy and intolerance, functional bowel diseases, gluten-related syndromes), to identify their clinical interrelationships and to suggest the most appropriate management. In fact, as far as food intolerances are concerned, it is well known that the number of patients who believe that their symptoms are related to food intolerance is increasing and consequently they restrict their diet, possibly causing nutritional deficiencies. Furthermore, there is an increasing use of unconventional diagnostic tests for food intolerance which lack accurate scientific evidence; the application of their results may induce misdiagnosis and unhealthy therapeutic choices. Consequently the recognition of food intolerance has to be performed on the basis of reliable tests within an agreed diagnostic workup.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic disorder caused by ingestion of gluten found in wheat, rye and barley. It affects around 1% of children, but 90% of cases are considered to remain undiagnosed. CD classically presents with gastrointestinal manifestations including diarrhoea, bloating, weight loss and abdominal pain, but extra-intestinal features (including oral and dental manifestations) are increasingly being reported. Dental and oral manifestations such as dental enamel defects, delayed eruption of teeth, recurrent aphthous ulcers are well-recognised manifestations of CD. In patients with yet undiagnosed CD, these can sometimes be the only presenting features. Dentists have regular contact with well children, and therefore the visit to the dentist is an opportunity to suspect CD. When CD is suspected, Dental practitioners can liaise with the general medical practitioner to organise screening for coeliac disease. Positive serology will prompt onward referral to a paediatric gastroenterologist to confirm the diagnosis. The recent European Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines revised in 2012 have streamlined the diagnostic pathway for faster diagnosis of CD. Management involves strict adherence to a gluten free diet, which should lead to resolution of symptoms, recovery of intestinal mucosa and prevention of long-term complications associated with it. This article aims to describe CD, inform of recent changes to the diagnostic pathway and highlight the dental manifestations of the condition to equip dental practitioners to aid early diagnosis and initiation of treatment for children with CD.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition caused by the ingestion of gluten-containing foods and affects about 1% of children and young people in the UK. Classic symptoms include diarrhoea, bloating, weight loss and abdominal pain. However, extra-intestinal manifestations, such as iron deficiency anaemia, faltering growth, delayed puberty and mouth ulcers, are increasingly being recognised. Some children have an increased risk of developing coeliac disease, such as a strong family history, certain genetic conditions and type 1 diabetes, therefore there is a need for increased awareness and early diagnosis before symptoms occur. If coeliac disease is suspected, a child should have serological screening with anti-tissue transglutaminase titres. Diagnosis is traditionally confirmed by a small bowel biopsy while the child remains on a 'normal' diet that does not exclude gluten. More recently, for a selective group of children, modification of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines has enabled non-biopsy (serological) diagnosis of coeliac disease. Children's nurses have an important role in recognising and diagnosing coeliac disease earlier as well as offering ongoing dietary support. Enabling children to maintain a gluten-free diet is essential for general wellbeing and preventing long-term complications.},

   abstract = {Assessment of non-HLA variants alongside standard HLA testing was previously shown to improve the identification of potential coeliac disease (CD) patients. We intended to identify new genetic variants associated with CD in the Polish population that would improve CD risk prediction when used alongside HLA haplotype analysis. DNA samples of 336 CD and 264 unrelated healthy controls were used to create DNA pools for a genome wide association study (GWAS). GWAS findings were validated with individual HLA tag single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing of 473 patients and 714 healthy controls. Association analysis using four HLA-tagging SNPs showed that, as was found in other populations, positive predicting genotypes (HLA-DQ2.5/DQ2.5, HLA-DQ2.5/DQ2.2, and HLA-DQ2.5/DQ8) were found at higher frequencies in CD patients than in healthy control individuals in the Polish population. Both CD-associated SNPs discovered by GWAS were found in the CD susceptibility region, confirming the previously-determined association of the major histocompatibility (MHC) region with CD pathogenesis. The two most significant SNPs from the GWAS were rs9272346 (HLA-dependent; localized within 1 Kb of DQA1) and rs3130484 (HLA-independent; mapped to MSH5). Specificity of CD prediction using the four HLA-tagging SNPs achieved 92.9%, but sensitivity was only 45.5%. However, when a testing combination of the HLA-tagging SNPs and the MSH5 SNP was used, specificity decreased to 80%, and sensitivity increased to 74%. This study confirmed that improvement of CD risk prediction sensitivity could be achieved by including non-HLA SNPs alongside HLA SNPs in genetic testing.},

   abstract = {The Central American countries: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama are in transition from a dietary culture based mainly on maize to a wheat-containing diet. Several other changes are occurring, such as a decrease of parasitic and infectious diseases. The environmental changes permit a prediction of an increase of celiac disease and other autoimmune diseases such as type I diabetes and thyroid disease in these genetically heterogeneous countries. At present, celiac disease and gluten-related disorders are considered to be of no relevance at the level of public health in these nations. This review documents the presence of celiac disease in Central America. It draws attention to some of the challenges in planning systematic studies in the region since up until recently celiac disease was unknown. The aim of this review is to disseminate knowledge obtained with preliminary data, to stimulate clinical and basic scientists to study these diseases in Central America and to alert authorities responsible for the planning of education and health, to find possibilities to avoid a rise in these disorders before the epidemics start, as has occurred in the Mediterranean countries.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the perceived importance, knowledge and confidence in nutritional management in a sample of Australian medical students undertaking a 4-year postgraduate medical degree. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: In 2015, students in years 1-4 were anonymously surveyed to assess students' perceived importance of nutrition, and knowledge and confidence in nutritional management. RESULTS: A total of 131 first and second year (preclinical/yr 1-2) medical students (46% response rate) and 66 third and fourth year (clinical/yr 3-4) students (24% response rate) completed the questionnaire. Most preclinical students agreed that medical graduates should understand nutritional issues in managing cardiovascular disease (99%), type 2 diabetes (93%), coeliac disease (95%), and renal impairment (97%). However, students were limited in their confidence to demonstrate this knowledge (range of confidence: 26%-41%) for individual medical conditions. This improved for students in the clinical context of years 3 and 4, although it was still not optimal (range 26%-81%). Few year 3 and 4 students reported confidence in knowledge related to medicolegal issues, respiratory disease, nutritional guidelines and nutrition assessment (all <40%). However the majority (>80%) reported confidence in the dietary management of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and coeliac disease and >60% indicated they would refer onto nutrition professionals. CONCLUSIONS: This cohort of postgraduate medical students recognize the importance of nutrition in disease. The number of students reporting increased confidence in nutritional management of a few select diseases where dietary management is one of the cornerstones of treatment (e.g. type 2 diabetes) rises throughout the course. However, students reported lower levels of knowledge in diseases where diet is secondary to other treatments and preventative strategies (e.g. respiratory disease). Filling the gap by integrating the nutritional management into the range of common chronic diseases during training has the potential to positively impact on patient health outcomes.},

   abstract = {Although many people have symptoms of celiac disease, it can take a while to diagnose. Villous atrophy may be present long before any gastrointestinal symptoms. An important point to acknowledge is that celiac disease could be identified earlier in some women with a positive family history. The disease also could be the cause of some women's reproductive problems. Primary care providers, using comprehensive history taking, are in the unique position to identify individuals who may have celiac disease, assist women in gaining knowledge about a gluten-free diet, order diagnostic testing, and refer to a gastroenterologist. The positive change in fertility with a simultaneous improvement of nutrient deficiencies shortly after adopting a gluten-free diet indicates a possible link between such nutrients and sex hormone function. High levels of homocysteine, which can negatively impact fertility, have also been linked to individuals with problems, such as celiac disease, that decrease vitamin B12 absorption. The purpose of this article is to review the literature and the evidence-based care guidelines for comprehensive screening, diagnostics, and pathophysiology of celiac disease, with a specific focus on the female reproductive system, anemia management, and gluten-free diet integration.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a common lifelong food intolerance triggered by dietary gluten affecting 1% of the general population. Gliadin-specific T-cell lines and T-cell clones obtained from intestinal biopsies have provided great support in the investigation of immuno-pathogenesis of CD. In the early 2000 a new in vivo, less invasive, approach was established aimed to evaluate the adaptive gliadin-specific T-cell response in peripheral blood of celiac patients on a gluten free diet. In fact, it has been demonstrated that three days of ingestion of wheat-containing food induces the mobilization of memory T lymphocytes reactive against gliadin from gut-associated lymphoid tissue into peripheral blood of CD patients. Such antigen-specific T-cells releasing interferon-gamma can be transiently detected by using the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays or by flow cytometry tetramer technology. This paper discusses the suitability of this in vivo tool to investigate the repertoire of gluten pathogenic peptides, to support CD diagnosis, and to assess the efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies. A systematic review of all potential applications of short oral gluten challenge is provided.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was the setting up of a gluten-free sourdough from selected lactobacilli and yeasts isolated from a traditional wheat-based Type I sourdough. A gluten-free matrix was inoculated with Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and Candida humilis, fermented to pH 4.0, and constantly propagated for ten times. A stable association between micro-organisms was observed from the second refreshment with mean values of 9.08 +/- 0.25 log CFU g(-1) for lactobacilli and 7.81 +/- 0.07 log CFU g(-1) for yeasts. In order to have a good workability of the dough, a 230 BU consistency was considered. Rheofermentographic indices remained constant over the ten refreshments, showing an average value of 23.2 mm dough height in about 7.5 h. The CO2 production and retention volumes reached average values of 1430 and 1238 ml respectively. The microbiological and technological data obtained highlighted that a GF sourdough was effectively developed. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Type I sourdough has a long tradition as a leavening agent of baked goods as its use results in an improved texture, flavour, taste and extended shelf-life of the final products. In this study a Type I gluten-free sourdough was obtained. After few refreshments in controlled conditions, the sourdough presented a stable association between Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and Candida humilis, constant fermentation times and technological properties (in terms of dough consistency, dough maximum height, CO2 production and retention). The results showed that the gluten-free sourdough developed in this study can improve the overall quality of gluten-free baked products.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence regarding the effect of time of gluten introduction and breastfeeding on the risk of developing celiac disease (CD). STUDY DESIGN: We included randomized controlled trials and observational studies evaluating the proper timing for introducing gluten to the infant diet, the appropriate quantity of gluten consumption at weaning, and the effect of breastfeeding on CD risk. Studies were located through the electronic databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE). Two independent authors collected the data. RESULTS: A total of 1982 studies were identified, 15 of which were eligible for data extraction. A meta-analysis was performed on 2 randomized controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, and 1 case-control study. There was a 25% increase in CD risk with late (>6 months) vs recommended (4-6 months) gluten introduction (risk ratio [RR], 1.25; 95% CI, 1.08-1.45). There was no significant effect of breastfeeding vs no breastfeeding on CD risk (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.28-1.10), with substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 92%) among studies. CONCLUSION: There is currently no evidence to support that early introduction of gluten to the infant diet increases the risk of CD; however, late introduction of gluten may be associated with increased risk of CD. More studies are needed that control for potential confounders and that evaluate environmental factors in low-risk families.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The low rate of celiac disease diagnosed in children from the United States may be limited by the practice of "serology-led" diagnosis. The frequency of seronegative celiac disease is unknown, but is underestimated in children and may result in misdiagnosis of celiac disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the rate of celiac disease after upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenescopy [EGD]) with no prior positive celiac serology compared with the rate of celiac disease followed by positive serology. METHODS: Charts of all of the first diagnostic EGDs in children (2009-2013) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with confirmed celiac disease were divided into 4 groups: group A, positive EGD/positive serology (histology-led diagnosis); group B, positive serology/positive histology (serology-led diagnosis); group C, positive histology followed by negative serology (control 1); and group D, positive serology followed by negative histology (control 2). RESULTS: A total of 761 upper endoscopic charts were reviewed. Of these, 15 children were confirmed with celiac disease (1.97%). There was no significant difference in the demographic data or clinical symptoms between group A and group B. No significant difference was observed in the rate of celiac disease between histology-led celiac diagnosis (group A) and serology-led celiac diagnosis (group B) (1.18% vs 0.79%, P = 0.273). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of celiac disease in endoscopy-led diagnosis was comparable to that in the serology-led diagnosis, suggesting that to increase the detection of celiac disease in children, an adequate number of intestinal biopsies should be performed in every diagnostic upper endoscopic procedure.},

   abstract = {Gluten-containing cereals are a main food staple present in the daily human diet, including wheat, barley, and rye. Gluten intake is associated with the development of celiac disease (CD) and related disorders such as diabetes mellitus type I, depression, and schizophrenia. However, until now, there is no consent about the possible deleterious effects of gluten intake because of often failing symptoms even in persons with proven CD. Asymptomatic CD (ACD) is present in the majority of affected patients and is characterized by the absence of classical gluten-intolerance signs, such as diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain. Nevertheless, these individuals very often develop diseases that can be related with gluten intake. Gluten can be degraded into several morphine-like substances, named gluten exorphins. These compounds have proven opioid effects and could mask the deleterious effects of gluten protein on gastrointestinal lining and function. Here we describe a putative mechanism, explaining how gluten could "mask" its own toxicity by exorphins that are produced through gluten protein digestion.},

Although several Bifidobacterium strains showed anti-inflammatory activity and prevention of toxic gliadin peptides generation in vitro, few data are available on their efficacy when administered to CD subjects. This study evaluated the effect of administration for three months of a food supplement based on two Bifidobacterium breve strains (B632 and BR03) to restore the gut microbial balance in coeliac children on a gluten free diet (GFD). Microbial DNA was extracted from faeces of 40 coeliac children before and after probiotic or placebo administration and 16 healthy children (Control group). Sequencing of the amplified V3-V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene as well as qPCR of Bidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis group Clostridiumsensu stricto and enterobacteria were performed. The comparison between CD subjects and Control group revealed an alteration in the intestinal microbial composition of coeliacs mainly characterized by a reduction of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, of Actinobacteria and Euryarchaeota. Regarding the effects of the probiotic, an increase of Actinobacteria was found as well as a re-establishment of the physiological Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Therefore, a three-month administration of B. breve strains helps in restoring the healthy percentage of main microbial components.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to determine whether psychological well-being and weight-teasing history of young adults with bowel conditions (i.e. coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome) differed from those without bowel conditions. METHODS: Young adults (aged 18-26 years) completed an online survey that collected demographic information and assessed psychological well-being (mentally and physically unhealthy days, self-esteem, and depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder severity) and weight-teasing history (Perception of Teasing Scale). Each bowel condition participant (cases = 135) was matched to four healthy participants (controls = 504) based on sex and body mass index (BMI) (+/-0.50 BMI units). Conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted and odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were presented for all measures and demographics. RESULTS: Cases were significantly more likely to have poorer overall psychological well-being. Specifically, cases were significantly (P </= 0.05) more likely to have more mentally and physical unhealthy days, depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms than controls. Cases were also significantly more likely to recall being weight teased as a child (P = 0.02, OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.04-1.53) and being more upset from the weight-teasing insults (P = 0.006, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05-1.35) than controls. Cases were also more than 1.5 times more likely to be made fun of (P = 0.03, OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.09-2.43) or laughed at (P = 0.01, OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.15-2.73) because of their weight than controls. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that healthcare providers should monitor the psychological well-being of young adults with bowel conditions and incorporate opportunities for them to develop skills and strategies for coping.},

   abstract = {Background. The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition endorses serological diagnosis (SD) for pediatric celiac disease (CD). The objective of this study was to pilot SD and to prospectively evaluate gastrointestinal permeability and mucosal inflammation at diagnosis and after one year on the gluten-free diet (GFD). We hypothesized that SD would be associated with similar short term outcomes as ED. Method. Children, 3-17 years of age, referred for possible CD were eligible for SD given aTTG level >/=200 U/mL, confirmed by repeat aTTG and HLA haplotypes. Gastrointestinal permeability, assessed using sugar probes, and inflammation, assessed using fecal calprotectin (FC), at baseline and after one year on a GFD were compared to patients who had ED. Results. Enrolled SD (n = 40) and ED (n = 48) patients had similar demographics. ED and SD groups were not different in baseline lactulose: mannitol ratio (L : M) (0.049 versus 0.034; p = 0.07), fractional excretion of sucrose (%FES; 0.086 versus 0.092; p = 0.44), or fecal calprotectin (FC; 89.6 versus 51.4; p = 0.05). At follow-up, urine permeability improved and was similar between groups, L : M (0.022 versus 0.025; p = 0.55) and %FES (0.040 versus 0.047; p = 0.87) (p > 0.05). FC improved but remained higher in the SD group (37.1 versus 15.9; p = 0.04). Conclusion. Patients on the GFD showed improved intestinal permeability and mucosal inflammation regardless of diagnostic strategy. This prospective study supports that children diagnosed by SD have resolving mucosal disease early after commencing a GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: While adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) is essential for effective control of celiac disease, the level of adherence to GFD may vary. We assessed the level of adherence to GFD and identified barriers to adherence in patients with celiac disease. METHODS: Both treatment-naive and follow up patients with celiac disease were recruited from a celiac disease clinic. All the patients were assessed for symptom improvement using celiac symptom index (CSI), weight, and hemoglobin; adherence to GFD using detailed dietary history and food-labeled quiz questionnaire; identification of barriers to GFD using a self-administered 36-point questionnaire; and quality of life using a standard 36-item short form (SF36) questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the patients who were already on GFD, only 53.3% maintained an excellent or good level of adherence, which increased to 92.4% at 6 months with repeated counseling. Among the treatment-naive patients, 64.8% maintained either excellent or good compliance at 1 month after first counseling, which increased to 96.3% at 6 months with repeated counseling. The most common barrier to adherence was non-availability of GFD. Certain barriers could be modified with repeated counseling and education. Response to GFD, as measured by CSI, gain in weight, and improvement in hemoglobin, was better in those having either excellent or good compliance to GFD compared to those who remained poorly adherent. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated counseling increased the level of adherence to GFD.},

   abstract = {Gluten proteins in wheat, rye and barley cause celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine, which affects approximately 1% of the world population. Gluten is comprised of prolamin and glutelin. Since avoidance of dietary gluten is the only option for celiac patients, a sensitive gluten detection and quantitation method is warranted. Most regulatory agencies have set a threshold of 20 ppm gluten in foods labeled gluten-free, based on the currently available ELISA methods. However, these methods may exhibit differences in gluten quantitation from different gluten-containing grains. In this study, prolamin and glutelin fractions were isolated from wheat, rye, barley, oats and corn. Intact and pepsin-trypsin (PT)-digested prolamin and glutelin fractions were used to assess their immunoreactivity and gluten recovery by three sandwich and two competitive ELISA kits. The Western blots revealed varied affinity of ELISA antibodies to gluten-containing grain proteins and no reactivity to oat and corn proteins. ELISA results showed considerable variation in gluten recoveries from both intact and PT-digested gluten fractions among different kits. Prolamin fractions showed higher gluten recovery compared to their respective glutelin fractions. Among prolamins, barley exhibited higher recovery compared to wheat and rye with most of the ELISA kits used. Hydrolysis resulted in reduced gluten recovery of most gluten fractions. These results suggest that the suitability of ELISA for accurate gluten quantitation is dependent upon various factors, such as grain source, antibody specificity, gluten proteins and the level of their hydrolysis in foods.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although celiac disease (CeD) affects 1% of people in the northern part of India, it is believed to be uncommon in the southern and northeastern parts because of significant differences in dietary pattern and ethnicity. We estimated the prevalence of CeD in these three populations. In a subset, we also investigated differences in the prevalence of HLA-DQ 2/8 allelotype and dietary grain consumption. METHODS: A total of 23,331 healthy adults were sampled from three regions of India-northern (n=6207), northeastern (n=8149), and southern (n=8973)-and screened for CeD using IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody. Positive tests were reconfirmed using a second ELISA. CeD was diagnosed if the second test was positive and these participants were further investigated. A subsample of participants was tested for HLA-DQ2/-DQ8 and underwent detailed dietary evaluation. RESULTS: Age-adjusted prevalence of celiac autoantibodies was 1.23% in northern, 0.87% in northeastern, and 0.10% in southern India (P<0.0001). Prevalence of CeD and latent CeD, respectively, was 8.53/1,000 and 3.70/1,000 in northern, 4.66/1,000 and 3.92/1,000 in northeastern, and 0.11/1,000 and 1.22/1,000 in the southern part. The population prevalence of genes determining HLA-DQ2 and/or -DQ8 expression was 38.1% in northern, 31.4% in northeastern, and 36.4% in southern India. Mean daily wheat intake was highest in northern (455 g) compared with northeastern (37 g) or southern part (25 g), whereas daily rice intake showed an inverse pattern. CONCLUSIONS: CeD and latent CeD were most prevalent in northern India and were the least in southern India. The prevalence correlated with wheat intake and did not reflect differences in the genetic background.},

Our aim was to evaluate the clinical features, psychological factors, and health-related quality of life (QoL), before and after diagnosis, in a representative sample of adult Mexican Mestizo patients presenting with CD. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on patients seen at two tertiary referral centers in Mexico. QoL before and after CD diagnosis was evaluated using the EuroQoL 5D, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the disease-specific Celiac Symptom Index (CSI) questionnaires. RESULTS: We included 80 patients (80% were women, with a mean age of 48.6 +/- 14.1 years). The most common symptoms were diarrhea (86%), bloating (77.5%), and abdominal pain (71.3%). Mean symptom duration was 10.33 +/- 6.3 years. Fifty-one patients (63.8%) had a previous diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 23 (28.8%) had one of functional dyspepsia. Questionnaire respondents rated their health status at 50% before diagnosis (0 = worst imaginable state, 100 = best imaginable state) and there was a significant improvement of 26% after diagnosis. Thirty-nine percent of the patients had a CSI score > 45 and they were the ones that had been previously diagnosed most often with IBS (p = 0.13) or dyspepsia (p = .036). CONCLUSIONS: At the time of diagnosis, Mexican Mestizo patients with CD had poor QoL. Long-standing symptoms and a previous diagnosis of functional disorders were associated with worse QoL. As in other populations, our results support the need for a detailed examination of cost-effective strategies for increasing CD awareness in clinical practice.},

OBJECTIVE: To study the adherence to a gluten-free diet of Mexican individuals with celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity at the time of their first medical and nutritional consultation at a tertiary referral center. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed. A specific questionnaire was used to gather information on demographics, clinical condition, and self-reported adherence to a gluten-free diet, and to determine strict compliance and intentional or inadvertent gluten consumption. All questionnaires were applied by a nutritionist with expertise in gluten-related disorders. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with celiac disease and 24 with non-celiac gluten sensitivity were included. Overall, 46 (57.5%) subjects perceived themselves as strictly adherent; however, inadvertent gluten intake was frequent in both celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity patients (39.2 vs. 33.3%; p = 0.2). Intentional consumption was more prevalent in subjects with celiac disease (48.8 vs. 29.1%; p = 0.048) and individuals with non-celiac gluten sensitivity showed better adherence (37.5 vs. 12.5%; p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The importance of a gluten-free diet is underestimated by Mexican patients with celiac disease. The role of a team with expertise in gluten-related disorders is essential to identify inadvertent gluten intake.},

SOURCES OF INFORMATION: MEDLINE was searched from 2000 to 2015 for English-language guidelines on the diagnosis and management of CD published by professional gastroenterological organizations. MAIN MESSAGE: To screen patients for CD, measurement of the immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase antibody is the preferred test. Total serum IgA level should be measured to exclude selective IgA deficiency and to avoid false-negative test results. Patients with positive serologic test results should be referred to a gastroenterologist for endoscopic small intestinal biopsies to confirm the diagnosis. Testing for human leukocyte antigens DQ2 and DQ8 can help exclude the diagnosis. A gluten-free diet should not be started before confirming the diagnosis of CD. CONCLUSION: Serologic testing is very useful for screening patients with suspected CD. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent complications of CD.},

Multiple factors, such as intestinal microbiota, intestinal cytokines, and nutrients are highly involved in production of SIgA in the intestine. Recently, glutamine has been shown to affect intestinal SIgA production; however, the underlying mechanism by which glutamine stimulates secretion of intestinal SIgA is unknown. Here, we review current knowledge regarding glutamine in intestinal immunity and show that glutamine-enhanced secretion of SIgA in the intestine may involve intestinal microbiota, intestinal antigen sampling and presentation, induction pathways for SIgA production by plasma cells (both T-dependent and T-independent pathway), and even transport of SIgA. Altogether, the glutamine-intestinal SIgA axis has broad therapeutic implications for intestinal SIgA-associated diseases, such as celiac disease, allergies, and inflammatory bowel disease.},

For years the recommendations of the ESPGHAN Committee on Nutrition have prevailed, which include avoiding early introduction, before 4 months, and late, after 7 months, and gradually introducing gluten into the diet while the infant is being breastfed, with the aim of reducing the risk of celiac disease, diabetes and gluten allergy. However, 2 independent studies published in The New England Journal of Medicine in October 2014 reached the conclusion that the age of introduction of gluten does not modify the risk of developing celiac disease, and that breastfeeding at any age does not confer protection against celiac disease development. On the other hand, according to available scientific evidence, the introduction of foods other than breast milk or formula into the infants diet is generally recommended around 6 months of age, since the introduction before 4 months could be associated with an increased risk of food allergy and autoimmune diseases, and delaying it beyond 7 months would not have a protective effect. In this context, a group of experts has considered it appropriate to produce a consensus document based on the current scientific evidence and present general recommendations for daily clinical practice on the introduction of gluten into the diet.},

It may also occur in patients who previously had responded to a long-term GFD. RCD may be categorized as RCD1 (normal immunophenotype) and RCD2 (aberrant immunophenotype). RCD1 usually responds to a continued GFD, nutritional support, and therapeutic agents such as corticosteroids. In contrast, clinical response in RCD2 is incomplete and prognosis is often poor. RCD (particularly RCD2) is associated with serious complications, such as ulcerative jejunitis and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). Strict clinical and laboratory criteria should be used to diagnose RCD and specialized tests for aberrancy and clonality should be interpreted in the context of their sensitivity and specificity. Adequate nutritional support and anti-inflammatory treatment may even allow patients with RCD2 to attain a clinical remission.},

   abstract = {Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is a chronic, generalised pain condition usually accompanied by several associated symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, headache, irritable bowel syndrome and mood disorders. Different medical treatments are used to treat fibromyalgia and the recent guidelines suggest that the optimal treatment consists in a multidisciplinary approach with a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment modalities. Among non-pharmacological treatment, nutrition is a promising tool for FM patients. The aim of this review is to update the present knowledge about fibromyalgia and nutrition by means of a systematic search performed on Medline from January 2000 to December 2014. Nutritional deficiencies have been described in FM patients and the benefits of specific diet and nutritional supplementation are shown. Obesity and overweight, often present in FM patients, are related to the severity of FM worsening the quality of life in terms of higher pain, fatigue, worsened sleep quality and higher incidence of mood disorders. Weight control is thus an effective tool to improve the symptoms. Moreover, it seems reasonable to eliminate some foods from the diet of FM patients, for example excitotoxins. Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity is increasingly recognised as a frequent condition with similar manifestations which overlap with those of FM. The elimination of gluten from the diet of FM patients is recently becoming a potential dietary intervention for clinical improvement. In summary, this review reveals the potential benefit of specific dietary interventions as non-pharmacological tools as part of a multidisciplinary treatment for FM patients.},

This work recognises a need to characterize disorders with microscopic and submicroscopic features, currently regarded as functional or non-specific entities, to obtain further understanding of their clinical relevance. The consensus working party reviewed statements about the aetiology, diagnosis and symptoms associated with ME and proposes an algorithm for its investigation and treatment. Following the 5(th) International Course in Digestive Pathology in Bucharest in November 2012, an international group of 21 interested pathologists and gastroenterologists formed a working party with a view to formulating a consensus statement on ME. A five-step agreement scale (from strong agreement to strong disagreement) was used to score 21 statements, independently. There was strong agreement on all statements about ME histology (95%-100%). Statements concerning diagnosis achieved 85% to 100% agreement. A statement on the management of ME elicited agreement from the lowest rate (60%) up to 100%. The remaining two categories showed general agreement between experts on clinical presentation (75%-95%) and pathogenesis (80%-90%) of ME. There was strong agreement on the histological definition of ME. Weaker agreement on management indicates a need for further investigations, better definitions and clinical trials to produce quality guidelines for management. This ME consensus is a step toward greater recognition of a significant entity affecting symptomatic patients previously labelled as non-specific or functional enteropathy.},

   abstract = {Inflammation can lead to malabsorption of important micronutrients such as iron. Malabsorption and nutritional deficiency can be caused by a variety of pathological and environmental factors causing a range of other symptoms commonly caused by both H. pylori infection and coeliac disease (CD). National guidelines suggest the routine taking of duodenal biopsies to exclude CD when investigating patients for iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Studies suggest that in absence of positive antibodies, IDA is rarely caused by CD. Recent British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines discourage the routine duodenal biopsies in low risk cases but despite this guidance, taking duodenal biopsies for IDA is a common practice. Many studies have reported that H. pylori infection is associated with IDA even in patients with CD. In countries with low H. pylori prevalence we still detect more H. pylori than CD standing behind IDA. Despite the strong association between IDA and H. pylori, taking biopsies to diagnose H. pylori infection is not usually a routine part of the diagnostic workup to identify the etiology of IDA. In this review we will discuss the impact of H. pylori in IDA and highlight the possible gaps in identifying the IDA etiology.},

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the influence of gender on (i) age at diagnosis, (ii) clinical manifestations, and (iii) prevalence of associated disorders. METHODS: Clinical data were abstracted from the medical record of adults with biopsy-proven celiac disease. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 385 patients (women, 71%). Women were diagnosed at a younger age (women, 46.1 years; men, 52.6 years; p = 0.001). The prevalence of the following symptoms was higher in women: nausea/vomiting (women, 31%; men, 16%; p = 0.001), constipation (women, 21%; men, 10%; p = 0.007), and malaise/fatigue (women, 43%; men, 33%; p = 0.06). Greasy stools were more prevalent in men (women, 11%; men, 22%; p = 0.006). Autoimmune diseases were observed in 127 (33%) patients with a female to male ratio of 1.6 (women, 37%; men, 23%; p = 0.006). Depression, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia predominated in women. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest clinically relevant gender-related differences in celiac disease. These gender differences should be taken into account when managing adult patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) are the serologic test of choice for diagnosing celiac disease (CD). Our aim was to determine if elevated IgA anti-tTG were associated with increased mortality risk. METHODS: Stored serum samples of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (1988-1992) were available for 6032 individuals aged 50 years old or above, which were screened for IgA anti-tTG, and if positive, for IgA endomysial antibodies. Mortality was determined from the National Death Index records through 2006. Hazard ratios were calculated through Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: From a total of 6032, 85 participants tested positive for IgA anti-tTG (1.4 %) and 5947 tested negative. After a median follow-up of 13 years, IgA anti-tTG positive participants were at increased risk of death in both crude (HR = 1.68; 95 % CI = 1.30-2.18) and adjusted analyses (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.43; 95 % CI = 1.10-1.85) as compared to IgA anti-tTG negative participants. The excess mortality was restricted to IgA anti-tTG positive males (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.69 (95 % CI = 1.26-2.29), as opposed to a hazard ratio of 0.96 (95 % CI = 0.57-1.62) among IgA anti-tTG positive females. Although the most common cause of death in IgA anti-tTG positive participants was cardiovascular disease (36 %), the increased hazard ratio was only observed in respiratory cause of death as compared to IgA anti-tTG negative participants (adjusted hazard ratio = 5.11; 2.76-9.46). CONCLUSION: Men aged 50 years old or above participants of NHANES III with elevated IgA anti-tTG antibodies had increased mortality risk. Elevated IgA anti-tTG antibodies could be a nonspecific marker of serious disease in older men.},

However, NAFLD is often diagnosed by exclusion - that is, obese children with an elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are screened for other liver diseases in the absence of a biopsy. This testing is nonstandardized, and professional society recommendations differ. This study examines the yield of testing for disorders other than NAFLD in this patient population. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in 120 obese, asymptomatic, noncholestatic children with an ALT >/=40 U/L and additional diagnostic testing. RESULTS: No patients were found to have Wilson's, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, celiac disease or Epstein-Barr virus. Only one patient (1/120) was identified with definite disease other than NAFLD, which was muscular dystrophy. The positive predictive value of a screening test was 5%, and the specificity was 97%. Of 70 children with an abdominal ultrasound, no significant abnormalities were identified. CONCLUSION: Extensive testing in asymptomatic, noncholestatic, obese children with an elevated ALT may be of limited diagnostic value and false-positive tests are likely. Large, prospective studies are needed to help focus the work up in this patient population.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: A gluten-free diet (GFD) has been reported to negatively impact the quality of life (QoL) of coeliac disease (CD) patients. The gut-brain axis hormones ghrelin and leptin, with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), may affect QoL of CD patients undergoing GFD. Our aims were to evaluate whether: (a) the circulating concentrations of leptin, ghrelin and BDNF in CD patients were different from those in healthy subjects; (b) GFD might induce changes in their levels; (c) BDNF Val66Met polymorphism variability might affect BDNF levels; and (d) serum BDNF levels were related to dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as a neurotrophin modulator. METHODS: Nineteen adult coeliac patients and 21 healthy controls were included. A QoL questionnaire was administered, and serum concentrations of ghrelin, leptin, BDNF and red blood cell membrane DHA levels were determined at the enrolment and after 1 year of GFD. BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was analysed. RESULTS: Results from the questionnaire indicated a decline in QoL after GFD. Ghrelin and leptin levels were not significantly different between groups. BDNF levels were significantly (p = 0.0213) lower in patients after GFD (22.0 +/- 2.4 ng/ml) compared to controls (31.2 +/- 2.2 ng/ml) and patients at diagnosis (25.0 +/- 2.5 ng/ml). BDNF levels correlated with DHA levels (p = 0.008, r = 0.341) and the questionnaire total score (p = 0.041, r = 0.334). CONCLUSIONS: Ghrelin and leptin seem to not be associated with changes in QoL of patients undergoing dietetic treatment. In contrast, a link between BDNF reduction and the vulnerability of CD patients to psychological distress could be proposed, with DHA representing a possible intermediate.},

As selenium deficiencies in celiac disease are observed, the aim of the study was to determine the selenium content in 27 grain gluten-free products available on the European Union (EU) market. Moreover, selenium content in products based on popular gluten-free cereals like corn, rice, and buckwheat and in relatively new or less popular products based on oat, amaranth, teff, and quinoa was compared. Selenium content in the tested products ranged from 0.9 to 24.5 mug/100 g. The average content of selenium in products based on popular gluten-free cereals was 2.8 mug/100 g and in products based on oat, amaranth, teff, and quinoa was 10.8 mug/100 g. It indicates that products based on less popular grains, especially on oat, should be more frequently chosen as a source of selenium by people on gluten-free diet than traditionally consumed gluten-free grains.},

   abstract = {Malabsorption is a disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that leads to defective digestion, absorption and transport of important nutrients across the intestinal wall. Small intestine is the major site where most of the nutrients are absorbed. There are three main mechanisms of malabsorption; premucosal, mucosal and postmucosal. Premucosal malabsorption is the inadequate digestion due to improper mixing of gastrointestinal enzymes and bile with chyme. This could be because of surgical resection of the small intestine or a congenital deficiency of the enzymes and bile responsible for digestion e.g. postgastrectomy, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis, gallstones, cholangitis etc. Mucosal malabsorption occurs in celiac disease, tropical sprue, Crohn's disease etc. Postmucosal condition arises due to impaired nutrients transport e.g. intestinal lymphangiectasia, macroglobulinemia etc. Disorders of malabsorption lead to decreased iron absorption and produce iron deficiency anemia. Using the index terms malabsorption, postgastrectomy, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis, gallstones, cholangitis, celiac disease, tropical sprue, Crohn's disease intestinal lymphangiectasia, macroglobulinemia and iron deficiency anemia the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched.

As autoimmune mechanisms may play a role in IH, there is a possibility of coexistent coeliac disease with calcium/vitamin D malabsorption. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the prevalence of coeliac disease and antitissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (anti-tTGAbs) in IH and analysed the effect of a gluten-free diet on calcaemic control. METHOD: A total of 171 patients with IH and 126 healthy controls were screened for anti-tTGAb. IH patients with anti-tTGAb >20 RU/ml underwent duodenoscopy and intestinal biopsy; those with biopsy-proven coeliac disease were followed up on a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Eleven of 171 (6.4%) patients with IH and seven of 126 (5.6%) controls had anti-tTGAb (P = 0.81). There was no difference in the clinical and biochemical parameters at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up of 7.2 +/- 4.8 year (mean serum total calcium = 1.88 +/- 0.16 vs 1.82 +/- 0.36 mmol/l, P = 0.52; phosphorus = 1.81 +/- 0.17 vs 1.87 +/- 0.36 mmol/l, P = 0.53) in IH patients with and without anti-tTGAb. Although CaSRAb positivity was comparable in the two groups, IH patients with anti-tTGAb had higher TPOAb positivity (45.5% vs 12.8%, P = 0.02). Coeliac disease was diagnosed in only 2/9 patients with IH on biopsy, both of whom showed improved calcaemic control with a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of coeliac autoimmunity (6.4%) and coeliac disease (1.2%) in patients with IH seems to be similar to that in the general population. Notwithstanding this modest prevalence, it is important to be aware of the potential occurrence of coeliac disease with IH and the beneficial effect of a gluten-free diet on calcium control.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy caused by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. In some reports, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has been identified as an extraintestinal symptom of CD. We aimed to further investigate the possible association between CD and SNHL by examining a greater number of pediatric CD patients. METHODS: The study was carried out from March to September 2014 and included 110 pediatric patients with biopsy-confirmed CD (220 ears) and 41 age- and sex-matched controls (82 ears); participants were evaluated by tympanometry and pure tone audiometry (frequency, 250-8000Hz frequency). RESULTS: Audiometric bone conduction thresholds were significantly different between the CD patients and the controls (p<0.05), but there were no significant differences in pure tone averages for air conduction (p>0.05). When the results for CD patients were analyzed according to duration of disease (</=36 months and >36 months), a significant difference in bone conduction thresholds (p<0.05) was noted, with significant increments at the later stages of disease. However, this difference was not sufficient to define clinical hearing loss, as the pure tone average thresholds remained below 20dB. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that subclinical hearing loss may be present in children with CD, which could presage more serious hearing impairments at older ages and later stages of the disease. Hearing screenings should be recommended for children with CD in order to prevent the potentially unfavorable effects of hearing loss on the emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and sensorimotor development of these patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The gluten-free diet has traditionally been accepted as a healthy diet, but there are articles advocating that it may have some nutritional deficiencies. The current study assesses whether there was any change in the contributions of calories, essential elements, proportion of fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and fiber in children who were diagnosed with celiac diseases, comparing the diet with gluten prior one year after diagnosis with the diet without gluten to the year of diagnosis. The level of clinical or analytical impact that nutritional deficits could have was also assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective,descriptive, observational study in which information was collected from a dietary survey, anthropometric and analytical data at pre-diagnosis of celiac disease and following a gluten diet and one year after celiac disease diagnosis, under gluten-free diet. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients meet the study criteria. A decrease in the intake of saturated fatty acids was found, with an increase of monounsaturated fatty acids and an increase in the intake of phosphorus in the diet without gluten. A deficient intake of vitamin D was found in both diets. Clinically, at year of gluten-free diet there was an improvement in weight and size. Analytically, there was an improvement in hemoglobin, ferritin, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone in plasma. CONCLUSION: The gluten-free diet has minimal deficiencies, similar to those present in the diet with gluten, with an improvement in the lipid profile by increasing the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids to the detriment of saturated fatty acids.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-triggered autoimmune disorder of the small intestine. A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only approved treatment; however, strict adherence is difficult and many suffer from inadvertent gluten exposure. Oral egg yolk anti-gliadin antibody (AGY) is a novel treatment to neutralize gluten and may improve the efficacy of the GFD. AIMS: To determine the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of AGY in patients with CD. METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female). All followed a GFD for at least 6 months (mean 5 years). No safety concerns were identified. Most patients had fewer celiac symptoms (especially tiredness, headache, and bloating), improved quality of life, lowered antibodies, and lowered LMER when taking AGY compared to the run-in period. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, AGY was safe and potentially associated with improved CD-related outcome measures in patients on a GFD. A larger study powered for further safety and efficacy evaluation is planned.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a frequent chronic inflammatory enteropathy caused by gluten in genetically predisposed individuals that carry disease susceptibility genes (HLA-DQ2/8). These genes are present in about 30-40% of the general population, but only a small percentage of carriers develops CD. Gluten is the key environmental trigger of CD, but its intake does not fully explain disease onset; indeed, an increased number of cases experience gluten intolerance in late adulthood after many years of gluten exposure. Consequently, additional environmental factors seem to be involved in CD. Epidemiological studies indicate that common perinatal and early postnatal factors influence both CD risk and intestinal microbiota structure. Prospective studies in healthy infants at risk of developing CD also reveal that the HLA-DQ genotype, in conjunction with other environmental factors, influences the microbiota composition. Furthermore, CD patients have imbalances in the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis), which are not fully normalized despite their adherence to a gluten-free diet. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the disease can promote dysbiosis that aggravates CD pathogenesis, and dysbiosis, in turn, can initiate and sustain inflammation through the expansion of proinflammatory pathobionts and decline of anti-inflammatory mutualistic bacteria. Studies in experimental models are also contributing to understand the role of intestinal bacteria and its interactions with a predisposed genotype in promoting CD. Advances in this area could aid in the development of microbiome-informed intervention strategies that optimize the partnership between the gut microbiota and host immunity for improving CD management.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that children with celiac disease (CD) on gluten-free diet are at increased risk of abdominal pain (AP) associated-functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). STUDY DESIGN: This was a multinational cross-sectional study performed from 2014 to 2015. Patients 4-18 years of age with CD on gluten-free diet for longer than 6 months were recruited from pediatric CD clinics in US and Italy. Control groups included siblings of children with CD (with normal tissue transglutaminase levels) and unrelated controls. Subjects or parents completed the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III. RESULTS: Children (n = 289) were recruited (55% US, 45% Italy): 96 children with CD, 96 sibling controls, and 97 unrelated controls. Chronic AP was present in 30 (30.9%) subjects with CD, 22 (22.7%) sibling controls, and 21 (21.6%) unrelated controls (P = .26 patients with CD vs siblings; P = .18 patients with CD vs unrelated; P = .96 siblings vs unrelated). AP-FGIDs were present in 8 (8.2%) subjects with CD, 8 (8.2%) sibling controls, and 2 (2.1%) unrelated controls (P = 1.00 subjects with CD vs sibling controls; P = .06 subjects with CD vs unrelated controls; P = .06 sibling controls vs unrelated controls). CONCLUSION: This multinational study evaluated the prevalence of chronic abdominal pain and AP-FGIDs in the pediatric population with CD. We found that subjects with CD and controls have a similar prevalence of chronic AP and AP-FGIDs. This suggests that not all types of gastrointestinal inflammation result in AP-FGIDs in children.},

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in which an online questionnaire was sent to all families registered in the Saudi celiac patients support group. We included only children (age 18 years of age and younger) with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease (CD). RESULTS: A total of 113 children were included in the final analysis, the median age was 9.9 years; 62.8% were females. One hundred (88.5%) of the participating families reported that GFD food was not easily available in their areas, 17% of them reported that it was not available at all in their area. One hundred and six (93.8%) reported that the price of GFD food was very expensive and 70 (61.9%) families that the diet was heavily affecting their family budget. Significant social difficulties were reported among the participating families and their children including interference with the child's interaction with other children (49.6%), the families' ability to attend social gatherings (60.2%), the families' ability to eat in restaurants (73.5%), and the families' ability to travel (58.4%). CONCLUSION: There is significant negative socio-economic impact of GFD on children with CD & their families. Health care providers should be aware of these psycho-social difficulties and be well trained to provide a proper education and psychological support for these patients and their families.},

Sixty two of the involved children were females. Ninety two percent of the patients were symptomatic at the diagnosis while eight percent were asymptomatic. The commonest presenting symptoms included: chronic abdominal pain (59.3%), poor weight gain (54%), abdominal distention, gases, bloating (46.1%) and chronic diarrhea (41.6%). Sixty percent of the involved children were reported to be strictly adherent to GFD. Younger age at diagnosis and shorter duration since the diagnosis were associated with a better adherence rate. CONCLUSION: CD has similar clinical presentations among Saudi children compared to other parts of the ward; however, the adherence to GFD is relatively poor. Younger age at diagnosis and shorter duration since the diagnosis were associated with a better adherence rate.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-celiac wheat sensitivity is an emerging wheat-related syndrome showing peak prevalence in Western populations. Recent studies hypothesize that new gliadin alleles introduced in the human diet by replacement of ancient wheat with modern varieties can prompt immune responses mediated by the CXCR3-chemokine axis potentially underlying such pathogenic inflammation. This cultural shift may also explain disease epidemiology, having turned European-specific adaptive alleles previously targeted by natural selection into disadvantageous ones. METHODS: To explore this evolutionary scenario, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of genes pivotal in the CXCR3-inflammatory pathway on individuals diagnosed for non-celiac wheat sensitivity and we applied anthropological evolutionary genetics methods to sequence data from worldwide populations to investigate the genetic legacy of natural selection on these loci. RESULTS: Our results indicate that balancing selection has maintained two divergent CXCL10/CXCL11 haplotypes in Europeans, one responsible for boosting inflammatory reactions and another for encoding moderate chemokine expression. CONCLUSIONS: This led to considerably higher occurrence of the former haplotype in Western people than in Africans and East Asians, suggesting that they might be more prone to side effects related to the consumption of modern wheat varieties. Accordingly, this study contributed to shed new light on some of the mechanisms potentially involved in the disease etiology and on the evolutionary bases of its present-day epidemiological patterns. Moreover, overrepresentation of disease homozygotes for the dis-adaptive haplotype plausibly accounts for their even more enhanced CXCR3-axis expression and for their further increase in disease risk, representing a promising finding to be validated by larger follow-up studies.},

   abstract = {Growth monitoring of apparently healthy children aims at early detection of serious underlying disorders. However, existing growth-monitoring practices are mainly based on suboptimal methods, which can result in delayed diagnosis of severe diseases and inappropriate referrals. We did a systematic review to address two key and interconnected questions underlying growth monitoring: which conditions should be targeted, and how should abnormal growth be defined? We systematically searched for studies reporting algorithms for growth monitoring in children and studies comparing the performance of new WHO growth charts with that of other growth charts. Among 1556 identified citations, 69 met the inclusion criteria. Six target conditions have mainly been studied: Turner syndrome, coeliac disease, cystic fibrosis, growth hormone deficiency, renal tubular acidosis, and small for gestational age with no catch-up after 2 or 3 years. Seven algorithms to define abnormal growth have been proposed in the past 20 years, but their level of validation is low, and their overall sensitivities and specificities vary substantially; however, the Grote and Saari clinical decision rules seem the most promising. Two studies reported that WHO growth charts had poorer performance compared with other existing growth charts for early detection of target conditions. Available data suggest a large gap between the widespread implementation of growth monitoring and its level of evidence or the clinical implications of early detection of serious disorders in children. Further investigations are needed to standardise the practice of growth monitoring, with a consensus on a few priority target conditions and with internationally validated clinical decision rules to define abnormal growth, including the selection of appropriate growth charts.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a global disease, and the only currently available treatment is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Although conceptually simple, the diet changes are substantial and have a profound effect on a patient's life. Untreated coeliac disease is associated with complications, including excess mortality, most of which can be avoided with a strict GFD. However, there are many barriers, including availability, cost and safety of gluten-free foods, and gluten cross-contamination. The GFD can be restrictive in social situations, leading to poor quality of life and, ultimately, nonadherence. As the number of patients with coeliac disease increases worldwide, clinicians need to be aware of the challenges patients face. Heightened awareness by physicians, dietitians and other providers can help maximize successful treatment, improve outcomes, and reduce health-care costs and disease burden. Routine follow-up is necessary to reinforce the need for a GFD, provide social and emotional support, and achieve mucosal healing, leading to reduced risk of complications. Unfortunately, there is wide variation in follow-up practices. The objective of this Review is to increase awareness of the challenges, management and follow-up of patients with coeliac disease to help them achieve GFD adherence and prevent complications whilst preserving their quality of life.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) are autoimmune conditions in which dietary gluten has been proven or suggested to play a pathogenic role. In CD; gluten is established as the instigator of autoimmunity; the autoimmune process is halted by removing gluten from the diet; which allows for resolution of celiac autoimmune enteropathy and subsequent normalization of serological markers of the disease. However; an analogous causative agent has not yet been identified for T1D. Nevertheless; the role of dietary gluten in development of T1D and the potentially beneficial effect of removing gluten from the diet of patients with T1D are still debated. In this review; we discuss the comorbid occurrence of CD and T1D and explore current evidences for the specific role of gluten in both conditions; specifically focusing on current evidence on the effect of gluten on the immune system and the gut microbiota.},

   abstract = {Over recent years we have seen rising many clinical and scientific innovations about celiac disease (CE), however the most important innovation that will contribute to change the future of the research and clinic in this field is the natural history of the disease. For many years it has been though that a genetic predisposition and the exposure to gluten were necessary and sufficient to develop CE. Recent studies, however, suggest that the loss of tolerance to gluten may occur in any moment of life upon certain conditions. Furthermore, several environmental factors known to play a role in shaping the intestinal microflora have also been considered related to the development of CE. Delivery mode, the infant diet and the use of antibiotics are included among these factors. To this day no large scale studies have determined if and how the microbiome composition and its metabolomic profile may influence the loss of tolerance to gluten and the consequent development of CE. In this paper we describe a prospective, multi-centric and longitudinal study on infants at risk for CE that will use different techniques to better understand the role of the microbome during the first steps in the development of the autoimmune disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) affects approximately 1% of the general population while an estimated additional 6% suffers from a recently characterized, rapidly emerging, similar disease, referred to as non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The only effective treatment of CD and NCGS requires removal of gluten sources from the diet. Since required adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is difficult to accomplish, efforts to develop alternative treatments have been intensifying in recent years. In this study, the non-human primate model of CD/NCGS, e.g., gluten-sensitive rhesus macaque, was utilized with the objective to evaluate the treatment potential of reduced gluten cereals using a reduced gluten (RG; 1% of normal gluten) barley mutant as a model. Conventional and RG barleys were used for the formulation of experimental chows and fed to gluten-sensitive (GS) and control macaques to determine if RG barley causes a remission of dietary gluten-induced clinical and immune responses in GS macaques. The impacts of the RG barley diet were compared with the impacts of the conventional barley-containing chow and the GFD. Although remission of the anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) serum responses and an improvement of clinical diarrhea were noted after switching the conventional to the RG barley diet, production of inflammatory cytokines, e.g., interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) by peripheral CD4+ T helper lymphocytes, persisted during the RG chow treatment and were partially abolished only upon re-administration of the GFD. It was concluded that the RG barley diet might be used for the partial improvement of gluten-induced disease but its therapeutic value still requires upgrading-by co-administration of additional treatments.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that affects approximately three million people in the United States. Furthermore, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) affects an estimated additional 6% of the population, e.g., 20 million in the U.S. The only effective treatment of CD and NCGS requires complete removal of gluten sources from the diet. While required adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is extremely difficult to accomplish, efforts to develop additional supportive treatments are needed. To facilitate these efforts, we developed a gluten-sensitive (GS) rhesus macaque model to study the effects of novel therapies. Recently reported results from phase one of this project suggest that partial improvement-but not remission-of gluten-induced disease can be accomplished by 100-fold reduction of dietary gluten, i.e., 200 ppm-by replacement of conventional dietary sources of gluten with a mutant, reduced gluten (RG) barley (lys3a)-derived source. The main focus of this (phase two) study was to determine if the inflammatory effects of the residual gluten in lys3a mutant barley grain could be further reduced by oral supplementation with a prolylendopeptidase (PE). Results reveal that PE supplementation of RG barley diet induces more complete immunological, histopathological and clinical remission than RG barley diet alone. The combined effects of RG barley diet and PE supplementation resulted in a further decrease of inflammatory mediators IFN-gamma and TNF secretion by peripheral lymphocytes, as well as decreased plasma anti-gliadin and anti-intestinal tissue transglutaminase (TG2) antibodies, diminished active caspase production in small intestinal mucosa, and eliminated clinical diarrhea-all comparable with a gluten-free diet induced remission. In summary, the beneficial results of a combined RG barley and PE administration in GS macaques may warrant the investigation of similar synergistic approaches.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Glutamine is a nonessential amino acid which improves intestinal mucosal regeneration and absorption. Glutathione is a vital molecule for antioxidant reactions and is synthesized from cystine. The first aim of the study is to measure the plasma glutamine and cystine in children with celiac disease (CD) and compare them with controls. The second aim of this study is to investigate whether these amino acids are correlated with endomysial antibody (EMA) or not. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Fifty children with CD were compared to 50 healthy, age, and sex matched normal children as control. Plasma glutamine and cystine levels of the children were measured by using tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Plasma glutamine (808 vs 870 mumol/L) and cystine (19 vs 48.5 mumol/L) were significantly lower in the celiac group than the controls (p<0.05). The levels of plasma glutamine (797 vs 928 mumol/L, n=42) and cystine (18 vs 31.5 mumol/L, n=8) were lower (p<0.05) in the EMA-positive than the EMA-negative celiac patients. We could not find any statistically significance between EMA-negative celiac patients and controls for the plasma glutamine (928 vs 870 mumol/L) and cystine (31.5 vs 48.5 mumol/L) (p>0.05). Serum EMA was negatively correlated with plasma cystine (r=-0,321, p=0.023), glutamine (r=-0.413, p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that plasma glutamine and cystine were significantly lower in the celiac children than the controls. Also, these amino acids were negatively correlated with EMA.},

   abstract = {Several studies have shown that a large number of patients who are fulfilling the criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are sensitive to gluten. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a gluten-free diet on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS. In this double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 148 IBS patients fulfilling the Rome III criteria were enrolled between 2011 and 2013. However, only 72 out of the 148 commenced on a gluten-free diet for up to six weeks and completed the study; clinical symptoms were recorded biweekly using a standard visual analogue scale (VAS). In the second stage after six weeks, patients whose symptoms improved to an acceptable level were randomly divided into two groups; patients either received packages containing powdered gluten (35 cases) or patients received placebo (gluten free powder) (37 cases). Overall, the symptomatic improvement was statistically different in the gluten-containing group compared with placebo group in 9 (25.7%), and 31 (83.8%) patients respectively (p < 0.001). A large number of patients labelled as irritable bowel syndrome are sensitive to gluten. Using the term of IBS can therefore be misleading and may deviate and postpone the application of an effective and well-targeted treatment strategy in gluten sensitive patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical manifestations of celiac disease (CD) have changed in the past decades. There are currently little data describing the initial clinical manifestations of CD in children in Iran. This study describes the initial presentation of children with suspected CD from a geographically defined region in Iran. METHOD: Medical records of children seen in 2007 - 2015 from Sistan and Baluchestan province, Iran, with suspected CD were reviewed. After obtaining TTG-IgA and IgA, subjects were divided into three groups according to presenting symptoms: GI, non-GI, and asymptomatic group. Those with elevated TTG-IgA or a strong clinical suspicion for CD underwent endoscopy with duodenal biopsy. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory, histopathology findings and the presence of any CD related conditions were recorded. RESULTS: from 344 children who underwent upper endoscopy and intestinal biopsy, 105 cases with marsh 0 - 1 were excluded from the study and 239 cases considered as a definite celiac disease (Mean+/- SD of age was 6.8 +/- 3.9 years with 145 females). GI symptoms were predominant in the younger age groups while non-GI symptoms were more common in the older children. The most frequent GI and Non-GI symptoms were abdominal pain (41.4%), distension (36.4%), diarrhea (32.2%), under nutrition (51.4%), anemia (36.4%), and decreased bone age (35%). The most common co-morbidities were hypothyroidism (3.7%) and Type 1 diabetes (2.9%). CONCLUSION: GI complaints in Iranian children are a common feature. Screening of children with suspected CD, especially with GI symptom is highly recommended.},

   abstract = {Human milk is considered as the gold standard for infant feeding. Breastfeeding advantages extend beyond the properties of human milk itself. A complex of nutritional, environmental, socioeconomic, psychological as well as genetic interactions establish a massive list of benefits of breastfeeding to the health outcomes of the breastfed infant and to the breastfeeding mother. For this reason, exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for about 6 months and should be continued as long as mutually desired by mother and child. The evidence in the literature on the effect of breastfeeding on health outcomes is based on observational studies due to the fact that it is unethical and practically impossible to randomize children to be breastfed or not. As such, multiple confounders cloud the evidence and one must base conclusions on the accumulating evidence when not contradictory and on the only intervention study, PROBIT (Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial). This review highlights some of the health outcomes related to breastfeeding such as the prevention of infections, the effect of breastfeeding on neurodevelopmental outcome, obesity, allergy and celiac disease. Available evidence as well as some of the contradictory results is discussed.},

   abstract = {Gluten ingestion causes immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy or celiac disease in sensitive individuals, and a strict gluten-free diet greatly limits food choices. Immunoassays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are used to quantify gluten to ensure labeling compliance of gluten-free foods. Anti-gluten antibodies may not exhibit equal affinity to gluten from wheat, rye, and barley. Moreover, because wheat gluten is commonly used as a calibrator in ELISA, accurate gluten quantitation from rye and barley contaminated foods may be compromised. Immunoassays utilizing grain-specific antibodies and calibrators may help improve gluten quantitation. In this study, polyclonal antibodies raised against gluten-containing grain-specific peptides were characterized for their immunoreactivity to gluten from different grain sources. Strong immunoreactivity to multiple gluten polypeptides from wheat, rye, and barley was observed in the range 34 to 43 kDa with anti-gliadin, 11 to 15 and 72 to 95 kDa with anti-secalin, and 30 to 43 kDa with anti-hordein peptide antibodies, respectively. Minimal or no cross-reactivity with gluten from other grains was observed among these antibodies. The anti-consensus peptide antibody raised against a repetitive amino acid sequence of proline and glutamine exhibited immunoreactivity to gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and oat. The antibodies exhibited similar immunoreactivity with most of the corresponding grain cultivars by ELISA. The high specificity and minimal cross-reactivity of grain-specific antibodies suggest their potential use in immunoassays for accurate gluten quantitation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The clinical spectrum of celiac disease (CeD) is wide and its symptoms overlap with those of functional bowel diseases. This study aimed to investigate the relationship among gluten-related disorders, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and uninvestigated dyspepsia in Indian patients. METHODS: Patients with IBS and uninvestigated dyspepsia (using Rome III criteria) were tested for immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody and anti-gliadin antibody (AGA). Those with positive anti-tTG antibody were evaluated for the presence of villous abnormalities. Patients who were only IgA AGA-positive were considered to have gluten sensitivity and those with positive anti-tTG antibody and villous atrophy were considered to have CeD. RESULTS: Of 362 patients with IBS, 22 (6.1%) had positive anti-tTG antibody, among whom 3 (0.8%) had CeD and 19 had potential CeD. Of 358 patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia, 18 (5.0%) were anti-tTG antibody-positive and among them 4 (1.1%) had CeD and 14 had potential CeD. AGA was positive in 104 (28.7%) patients with IBS and 68 (19.0%) with uninvestigated dyspepsia, suggesting the presence of gluten sensitivity. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the relationship between IBS or dyspepsia and CeD or gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Celiac disease (CeD) is a common autoimmune disorder in which ingestion of gluten and related proteins leads to inflammation in the small intestine. Although the histological findings in CeD are characteristic, they are not specific. In this study, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to investigate the differences in metabolic profile of duodenal mucosal biopsies of patients with CeD and controls to find out the biomarker/s of villous atrophy. METHODS: Duodenal mucosal biopsies were collected from 29 CeD patients (mean age 26.2 +/- 10.8 years) and 17 controls (mean age 34.1 +/- 11.1 years) and were subjected to proton NMR spectroscopy following perchloric acid extraction. Assignment of metabolite resonances was carried out and their concentrations were determined. For comparison between the groups unpaired t-test/Wilcoxon rank sum test was used. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis was performed to study the clustering behavior of the samples from CeD patients and controls using the Unscrambler 10.2 software. RESULTS: Partial least squares-discriminant analysis clearly differentiated CeD patients from controls. Significantly higher concentrations of isoleucine, leucine, aspartate, succinate, and pyruvate, and lower concentration of glycerophosphocholine, were observed in the duodenal mucosa of CeD patients compared with controls. The results suggest abnormalities in glycolysis, Krebs cycle (energy deficiency), and amino acid metabolism, which may affect the biosynthetic pathways and consequently contribute to villous atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: NMR spectroscopy with multivariate analysis of duodenal mucosal biopsies revealed a characteristic metabolic profile in CeD patients. The work provided an insight in determining biomarker/s for villous atrophy and diagnosis of CeD patients.},

   abstract = {Wheat is a staple food throughout the temperate world and an important source of nutrients for many millions of people. However, the last few years have seen increasing concerns about adverse effects of wheat on health, particularly in North America and Europe, with the increasing adoption of wheat-free or gluten-free diets. This relates to two concerns: that wheat products are disproportionally responsible for increases in obesity and type 2 diabetes and that wheat gluten proteins cause a range of adverse reactions, including allergies, coeliac disease and 'non-coeliac gluten sensitivity'. The first concern has been refuted in previous publications, and we therefore focus on the second here. Current evidence indicates that allergy to ingested wheat and coeliac disease (and related intolerances) each occur in up to 1% of the population. The extent to which their prevalence has increased is difficult to quantify due to improved diagnosis and increased awareness. However, neither appears to be increasing disproportionally when compared with other immunologically mediated adverse reactions to food. Other adverse reactions to wheat are more difficult to define as their mechanisms are not understood and they are therefore difficult to diagnose. In particular, 'non-coeliac wheat sensitivity' has been reported to occur in 6% or more of the population in the US. However, the application of more rigorous diagnostic criteria is likely to give substantially lower estimates of prevalence. It is therefore unlikely that the health of more than a small proportion of the population will be improved by eliminating wheat or gluten from the diet. In fact, the opposite may occur as wheat is an important source of protein, B vitamins, minerals and bioactive components.},

   abstract = {Links between environmental chemicals and human health have emerged over the last few decades, but the effects from polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were less studied, compared to other commonly known environmental chemicals such as heavy metals, phthalates, arsenic, phenols, and pesticides. Therefore, it was aimed to study the relationships of urinary PAH and adult digestive conditions using a large human sample in a national and population-based study in recent years. Data was retrieved from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, 2011-2012 including demographics, self-reported health conditions, and urinary PAH. Statistical analyses included chi-square test, t test, survey-weighted logistic regression modeling, and population attributable risk (PAR) estimation. Of 5560 American adults aged 20-80 and included in the statistical analysis, urinary 4-hydroxyphenanthrene was significantly associated with celiac disease (odds ratio (OR) 1.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-2.26, P = 0.009). In addition, urinary 2-hydroxyfluorene (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.02-1.78, P = 0.038), 3-hydroxyfluorene (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.07-1.70, P = 0.015), 1-hydroxyphenanthrene (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.08-2.03, P = 0.017), 1-hydroxypyrene (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.05-1.77, P = 0.023), and 2-hydroxynapthalene (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00-1.58, P = 0.054) were significantly associated with kidney stones, although not necessarily failing kidney. There were no statistically significant associations observed in the relationship of urinary PAH and liver problems, although higher levels of PAHs were observed. Urinary PAHs are associated with adult digestive conditions, although the causality cannot be established. From the research perspective, longitudinal monitoring from observational studies and experimental research understanding mechanism would be suggested. Regulation of minimizing PAHs exposure might need to be considered in future health and environmental policies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence for the association of breast feeding, breastfeeding duration or the timing of gluten introduction and the later development of celiac disease (CD). DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, via PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science, for studies published up to 31 August 2015 investigating the association of breastfeeding duration, breast feeding at the moment of gluten introduction or the timing of gluten introduction and the later development of CD. Prospective studies had to enrol infants/children at high risk of CD. For retrospective studies, participants had to be children or adults with CD. The paper quality was assessed by means of a GRADE score and the bias risk was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (for observational cohort studies) and Cochrane Collaboration's tool (for randomised trials). RESULTS: Out of 149 retrieved papers, 48 were considered in depth and 16 were included in this review (9 were prospective and 2 were interventional). We found that neither duration of breastfeeding nor breastfeeding at time of gluten introduction nor the delayed introduction of gluten during weaning were effective in preventing later development of CD. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is no evidence on the optimal breastfeeding duration or the effects of avoiding early (<4 months of age) or late (>/= 6 or even at 12 months) gluten introduction in children at risk of CD. Accordingly, no specific general recommendations about gluten introduction or optimal breastfeeding duration can be presently provided on evidence-based criteria in order to prevent CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between self-reported adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and the ability to determine correctly the appropriateness of particular foods in a GFD. METHODS: Persons with celiac disease were recruited through clinics and support groups. Participants completed a questionnaire with items related to GFD information sources, gluten content of 17 common foods (food to avoid, food allowed, and food to question), GFD adherence, and demographic characteristics. Diagnosis was self-reported. RESULTS: The 82 respondents (88% female) had a median of 6 y GFD experience. Most (55%) reported strict adherence, 18% reported intentional gluten consumption and 21% acknowledged rare unintentional gluten consumption. Cookbooks, advocacy groups, and print media were the most commonly used GFD information sources (85-92%). No participant identified correctly the gluten content of all 17 foods; only 30% identified at least 14 foods correctly. The median score on the Gluten-Free Diet Knowledge Scale (GFD-KS) was 11.5 (interquartile ratio, 10-13). One in five incorrect responses put the respondent at risk of consuming gluten. GFD-KS scores did not correlate with self-reported adherence or GFD duration. Patient advocacy group members scored significantly higher on the GFD-KS than non-members (12.3 versus 10.6; P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Self-report measures which do not account for the possibility of unintentional gluten ingestion overestimate GFD adherence. Individuals who believe they are following a GFD are not readily able to correctly identify foods that are GF, which suggests ongoing gluten consumption may be occurring, even among patients who believe they are "strictly" adherent. The role of patient advocacy groups and education to improve outcomes through improved adherence to a GFD requires further research.},

The present study aimed io assess dietary adherence, knowledge of a GFD, and the emotional and lifestyle impact of a GFD. METHODS: Community dwelling adults following a GFD completed a questionnaire with items related to reasons for avoiding gluten, diagnostic testing, GFD adherence, knowledge and sources of information about a GFD, the Work and Social Adjustment Scale, and the effect of a GFD diet on lifestyle, feelings and behaviours. RESULTS: Strict GFD adherence among the 222 coeliac disease (CD) patients was 56%. Non-CD individuals (n = 38) were more likely to intentionally ingest gluten (odds ratio = 3.7; 95% confidence interval = 1.4-9.4). The adverse impact of a GFD was modest but most pronounced in the social domain. Eating shifted from the public to the domestic sphere and there were feelings of social isolation. Affective responses reflected resilience because acceptance and relief were experienced more commonly than anxiety or anger. Non-CD respondents were less knowledgeable and less likely to consult health professionals. They experienced less anger and depression and greater pleasure in eating than CD respondents. CONCLUSIONS: The findings obtained in the present suggest there is good potential for positive adaptation to the demands of a GFD; nevertheless, there is a measurable degree of social impairment that merits further study. The GFD may be a viable treatment option for conditions other than CD; however, education strategies regarding the need for diagnostic testing to exclude CD are required.},

AIM: To compare the cumulative incidence of CD between Estonian and Finnish children and to identify the risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children were recruited as part of the DIABIMMUNE Study. In the birth cohort (BC) 258 children from Estonia and 305 from Finland, and in the young children's cohort (YCC) 1363 and 1384 children were followed up, respectively. The diagnosis of CD was made in accordance with the ESPGHAN guidelines-the presence of IgA-tTG antibodies and small bowel villous atrophy. RESULTS: During the study period 29 children developed CD. The cumulative incidence of CD was significantly higher in Finland (0.77% vs 0.27%; P=0.01). No difference was seen between the children with CD and the controls in the duration of breastfeeding or the age at cereal introduction. The BC children with CD had had significantly more episodes of infections with fever by the age of 12 months compared to the controls (3.4 vs 1.4; P=0.04). CONCLUSION: The 5-year cumulative incidence of childhood CD is significantly higher in Finland than in Estonia. Sequential infections early in life may increase the risk for developing CD.},

In addition, it aimed to examine the relations of depression level and life quality with adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Twenty-five children with CD and 25 healthy controls were included. The Depression Scale for Children and the General Purpose Health-Related Quality of Life Scale for Children were performed on patients before and after receiving recommendations to follow a GFD. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the depression scores between the patients and the control subjects (P > 0.05). In contrast, total scores and scores of the emotional well-being subscale of the measure of Quality of Life Scale for Children were significantly lower in patients with CD compared with the control group (P < 0.05). No significant improvements were observed in depression or life quality scores of the total subsample of celiac patients, all of whom received a recommendation to follow a GFD (P > 0.05). Significant decrease was observed in the depression scores, however, of celiac patients who were able to actually adhere to the GFD compared with nonadherent patients. CONCLUSIONS: CD negatively affected quality of life in children. Adherence to GFD was associated with reduction in depression symptoms. Improving the adherence of celiac patients to a GFD may have a favorable effect on their depression symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is believed that patients with celiac disease (CeD) are likely to be underweight. Data from west suggest that 8% to 40% of them can be overweight or obese. We reviewed data on body mass index (BMI) of our patients with CeD and derived the correlations between BMI and other disease characteristics. METHODS: We retrospectively studied case records of 210 adolescent and adult patients with CeD at the Celiac Disease Clinic. We classified BMI as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese based on the Consensus Statement for Diagnosis of Obesity, Abdominal Obesity and the Metabolic Syndrome for Asian Indians for those with age >18 years and revised Indian Association of Pediatrics BMI-for-age charts for those between 12 and 18 years. RESULTS: Of 210 patients, 76 (36.2%) were underweight, 115 (54.8%) were normal weight, 13 (6.2%) were overweight, and 6 (2.9%) were obese. There was no difference in the proportion of underweight between male and female patients with CeD. The mean age of underweight patients was similar to those having normal or overweight. There was no difference in the mean duration of symptoms; frequencies of diarrhea, anorexia, and weakness; anemia; titer of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody; and severity of villous atrophy in those with underweight or normal weight or overweight. CONCLUSIONS: In our practice, only one third of patients with CeD had low BMI. A diagnosis of CeD should not be excluded if patient has normal or high BMI.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: First-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with celiac disease (CD) are at high risk for CD and prevalence among them varies from 1.6 to 38%. The risk of having CD among FDRs if the FDR is sister, brother, mother, father, son, or daughter of index patient with CD is not known. We conducted a meta-analysis and calculated pooled prevalence of CD among FDRs, second-degree relatives (SDRs), and specific relations with index patient. METHODS: On search of literature, 2,259 articles appeared of which 54 articles were included in this meta-analysis. Diagnosis of CD was based on standard criteria. RESULTS: Pooled prevalence of CD was 7.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.3%, 8.8%) in 10,252 FDRs and 2.3% (95% CI 1.3%, 3.8%) in 642 SDRs. Pooled prevalence of CD was highest in siblings (8.9%), followed by offsprings (7.9%) and parents (3.0%). Female FDRs had higher prevalence than male FDRs (8.4% vs. 5.2%, P=0.047). While sisters and daughters of index patient had the highest risk of having CD (1 in 7 and 1 in 8, respectively), the risk was 1 in 13 in sons, 1 in 16 in brothers, 1 in 32 in mothers, and 1 in 33 in fathers. There were also differences in the pooled prevalence of CD in FDRs according to their geographic location. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled prevalence of CD among FDRs is 7.5% and varies considerably with their relationship with the index patient. The risk of CD in FDRs also varies according to gender and geographical location.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CeD) is a systemic disease with manifestations not limited to small intestine. The data on association between CeD and infertility is contradictory. There are no recommendations for the screening of female patients with infertility for CeD. AIM: We conducted a meta-analysis to find out whether women with infertility are at higher risk of CeD. METHODS: Literature search was performed using the MeSH keywords "CeD," "gluten," and "infertility." Diagnosis of CeD was based on positive serology and biopsies showing villous atrophy. Data were extracted about CeD patients in 3 groups-women with infertility (including unexplained infertility), unexplained infertility, and controls. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and prevalence, with 95% confidence intervals (CI), were calculated. RESULTS: Of 105 relevant studies, 5 studies were included for calculation of pooled OR. Four additional studies, where data on controls were not available, were also considered for calculation of pooled prevalence of CeD. Women with infertility had 3.5 times higher odds of having CeD in comparison with control population (OR=3.5; 95% CI, 1.3-9; P<0.01). Similarly, women with "unexplained infertility" had 6 times higher odds of having CeD than controls (OR=6; 95% CI, 2.4-14.6). Of 884 women with infertility, 20 had CeD indicating a pooled prevalence of 2.3% (95% CI, 1.4-3.5). Of 623 women with "unexplained infertility," 20 had CeD. The pooled prevalence of CeD in women with unexplained infertility was 3.2 (95% CI, 2-4.9). CONCLUSIONS: CeD is more prevalent in women with "all-cause" infertility and "unexplained" infertility than that in general population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Celiac disease (CD) is emerging in Asia. While a few population-based studies from Asia have reported a prevalence of CD from 0.1% to 1.3%, the exact prevalence of CD in Asia is not known. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of CD in Asia. METHODS: On search of literature, we found 1213 articles, of which 18 articles were included. Diagnosis of CD was based on European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines. RESULTS: Pooled sero-prevalence of CD in Asia was 1.6% in 47 873 individuals based on positive anti-tissue transglutaminase and/or anti-endomysial antibodies. Pooled prevalence of biopsy proven CD in Asia was 0.5% in 43 955 individuals. The prevalence of CD among women was higher than in men (0.5% vs 0.4%, P = 0.04). The pooled prevalence of CD was 0.3% in Iran, 0.5% in Turkey, 0.6% in India, and 0.7% in Israel. The pooled prevalence of CD was significantly higher in Israel and India as compared with that in Iran. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is not uncommon in Asia, and the sero-prevalence and prevalence of CD in Asia are 1.6% and 0.5%, respectively. The prevalence of CD varies with gender and geographic location. There is a need for population-based prevalence studies in many Asian countries to properly estimate the burden of CD in Asia.},

   abstract = {GOALS: We reviewed our celiac disease (CeD) database to study if anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody (ab) titers correlate with severity of villous abnormalities in Indian patients and to find out a cutoff value of anti-tTG ab fold-rise, which could best predict CeD. BACKGROUND: Guidelines for diagnosing CeD suggest that biopsy could be avoided in some patients with high anti-tTG ab titer. STUDY: We reviewed a cohort of 366 anti-tTG ab-positive individuals in whom duodenal biopsies were performed. Anti-tTG ab was obtained before initiation of gluten-free diet. Anti-tTG ab results were expressed in terms of fold-rise by calculating ratio of observed values with cutoff value. CeD was diagnosed if in addition to positive serology, patients had villous atrophy (>Marsh grade 2) and unequivocal response to gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The mean anti-tTG fold-rise in groups with Marsh grade </=2 was 2.6 (+/-2.5), grade 3a was 4.0 (+/-3.9), 3b was 5.7 (+/-5.1), and 3c was 11.8 (+/-8.0). The positive likelihood ratio for diagnosing CeD was 15.4 and 27.4 at 12- and 14-fold-rise of anti-tTG ab titer, respectively. The positive predictive value of diagnosis of CeD was 100% when anti-tTG ab titer was 14-fold higher over the cutoff value. Fifty-seven (43.9%) individuals with anti-tTG titer rise <2-fold high also had CeD. CONCLUSIONS: As severity of villous abnormality increases, titer of anti-tTG also rises. Presence of villous atrophy can be predicted at very high anti-tTG ab titer. In contrast to emerging belief, mucosal biopsies should be performed even if anti-tTG ab titer is <2 times, because many patients with CeD have low titers.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the prevalence of coeliac disease among children with short stature at a tertiary care centre and to define the predictors for coeliac disease, if any, in them. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed the case records of children and adolescents with growth retardation attending the Paediatric Endocrinology Clinic from January 2008 to June 2011. All patients underwent the multi-tier stratified diagnostic protocol for complete evaluation of short stature. Coeliac disease was screened using IgA-anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody. The diagnosis of coeliac disease was made on the basis of the modified European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria. RESULTS: Of 432 patients (238 boys) who presented with short stature, 72 (16.7%) had physiological, while 360 (83.3%) had pathological causes. Endocrine causes were growth hormone deficiency (86 patients, 19.9%), hypopituitarism (31, 7.2%), hypothyroidism (22, 5.1%) and others (7, 1.6%). The systemic causes were: coeliac disease (47, 10.9%), haematological diseases (14, 3.2%), renal diseases (11, 2.5%) and others (24, 5.6%). Chronic diarrhoea (OR 15.7, 95% CI 7.8-31.5) and anaemia (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.9-12.7]) were significant predictors for coeliac disease in patients with short stature. There was a definite response to gluten-free diet in them and the mean (SD) growth velocity measured over at least 6 months of gluten-free diet was 8.1 (3.0) cm/year. CONCLUSION: Nearly 11% of patients presenting with short stature have coeliac disease. In these patients chronic diarrhoea and anaemia were significant predictors of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The condition non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is clinically similar to coeliac disease, but lack objective diagnostic criteria. Symptom relief on gluten-free diet followed by gluten containing food challenge may confirm the condition in clinical settings. AIM: To describe the results of an open bread challenge in patients with suspected NCGS, and to compare the results with recently suggested cut-offs for symptom change. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-six patients (12 males) self-instituted on gluten-free diet with negative coeliac disease diagnostics were examined for NCGS by an open bread challenge. Symptoms were reported by Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, IBS-version (GSRS-IBS) and visual analogue scale (VAS). Results were retrospectively compared to the Salerno and Monash cut-offs for symptom change. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were diagnosed with NCGS. Total GSRS-IBS score and overall symptoms by VAS increased significantly in NCGS (p < .001), but not in non-NCGS patients (p < .12 and p = .08, respectively). Total GSRS-IBS challenge score and overall symptoms by VAS were significantly higher in NCGS than in non-NCGS patients (53 vs. 37, p = .004 and 76 vs. 39 mm, p = .02, respectively). Applying the Salerno and Monash cut-offs, 63 and 75% would be classified with NCGS, respectively. According to total GSRS-IBS absolute agreement was lowest between clinician's diagnosis and Salerno cut-off (63%) and highest between Salerno and Monash cut-offs (88%). CONCLUSION: Clinician diagnosed 85% with NCGS. The proportion of NCGS was lower according to the Salerno and Monash cut-offs. The Salerno cut-off should be the starting point for a common definition of symptom change.},

Immunochemical detection is the method of choice, as it is sensitive, rapid and relatively easy to use. Although a wide range of detection kits are commercially available, there are still many difficulties in gluten detection that have not yet been overcome. This review gives an overview of the currently commercially available immunochemical detection methods, and discusses the problems that still exist in gluten detection in food. The largest problems are encountered in the extraction of gluten from food matrices, the choice of epitopes targeted by the detection method, and the use of a standardized reference material. By comparing the available techniques with the unmet needs in gluten detection, the possible benefit of a new multiplex immunoassay is investigated. This detection method would allow for the detection and quantification of multiple harmful gluten peptides at once and would, therefore, be a logical advancement in gluten detection in food.},

   abstract = {Shared susceptibility alleles in the HLA region contribute to the co-existence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD). The aim of our study was to identify HLA genotype variations that influence co-occurrence of T1D and CD (T1D + CD) and the order of their onset. Totally 244 patients, 67 with T1D, 68 with CD and 69 with T1D + CD, (split into "T1D first" and "CD first"), were analyzed. Control group consisted of 130 healthy unrelated individuals. Two-tailed Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analysis. The genetic background of Slovenian CD patients resembled more northern than southern European populations with DR3-DQ2/DR3-DQ2 (odds ratio [OR] = 19.68) conferring the highest risk. The T1D + CD was associated with DR3-DQ2/DR3-DQ2 (OR = 45.53) and even more with DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 (OR = 93.76). DR3-DQ2/DR7-DQ2 played a neutral role in susceptibility for T1D + CD. The order of the onset of T1D or CD in patients with co-occurring diseases was not influenced by HLA risk genotype profile. DR3-DQ2/DR3-DQ2 was associated with an increased risk for developing CD in patients with T1D, whereas patients with CD carrying DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 were at higher risk for developing T1D. In addition to other genetic factors including HLA class I alleles present on DR3-DQ2 extended haplotype, the second extended haplotype may moderate the risk for T1D + CD conferred by DR3-DQ2. Our results suggested that individuals carrying high-risk genotypes DR3-DQ2/DR3-DQ2 or DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 would more likely develop both T1D and CD than either disease alone.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: Resistance of proteins to gastrointestinal digestion may play a role in determining immune-mediated adverse reactions to foods. However, digestion studies have largely been restricted to purified proteins and the impact of food processing and food matrices on protein digestibility is poorly understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: Digestibility of a total gliadin fraction (TGF), flour (cv Hereward), and bread was assessed using in vitro batch digestion with simulated oral, gastric, and duodenal phases. Protein digestion was monitored by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies specific for celiac-toxic sequences (QQSF, QPFP) and starch digestion by measuring undigested starch. Whereas the TGF was rapidly digested during the gastric phase the gluten proteins in bread were virtually undigested and digested rapidly during the duodenal phase only if amylase was included. Duodenal starch digestion was also slower in the absence of duodenal proteases. CONCLUSION: The baking process reduces the digestibility of wheat gluten proteins, including those containing sequences active in celiac disease. Starch digestion affects the extent of protein digestion, probably because of gluten-starch complex formation during baking. Digestion studies using purified protein fractions alone are therefore not predictive of digestion in complex food matrices.},

   abstract = {AIM: Because of increasing awareness of variations in the use of pancreatic exocrine replacement therapy, the Australasian Pancreatic Club decided it was timely to re-review the literature and create new Australasian guidelines for the management of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI). METHODS: A working party of expert clinicians was convened and initially determined that by dividing the types of presentation into three categories for the likelihood of PEI (definite, possible and unlikely) they were able to consider the difficulties of diagnosing PEI and relate these to the value of treatment for each diagnostic category. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Recent studies confirm that patients with chronic pancreatitis receive similar benefit from pancreatic exocrine replacement therapy (PERT) to that established in children with cystic fibrosis. Severe acute pancreatitis is frequently followed by PEI and PERT should be considered for these patients because of their nutritional requirements. Evidence is also becoming stronger for the benefits of PERT in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. However there is as yet no clear guide to help identify those patients in the 'unlikely' PEI group who would benefit from PERT. For example, patients with coeliac disease, diabetes mellitus, irritable bowel syndrome and weight loss in the elderly may occasionally be given a trial of PERT, but determining its effectiveness will be difficult. The starting dose of PERT should be from 25,000-40,000 IU lipase taken with food. This may need to be titrated up and there may be a need for proton pump inhibitors in some patients to improve efficacy.},

   abstract = {Although the need for effective long-term follow-up for patients with celiac disease (CD) has been recognized by many expert groups, published practice guidelines have not provided a clear approach for the optimal management of these patients. In an attempt to provide a thoughtful and practical approach for managing these patients, a group of experts in pediatric CD performed a critical review of the available literature in 6 categories associated with CD to develop a set of best practices by using evidence-based data and expert opinion. The 6 categories included the following: bone health, hematologic issues, endocrine problems, liver disease, nutritional issues, and testing. Evidence was assessed by using standardized criteria for evaluating the quality of the data, grade of evidence, and strength of conclusions. Over 600 publications were reviewed, and 172 were chosen for inclusion. The thorough review of the results demonstrated that the quality of the data available was often insufficient to provide unequivocal best practices. However, using the available data and the clinical experience of the panel, a practical framework for the management of children with CD was created. These recommendations were developed by our expert panel and do not necessarily reflect the policy of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The potential usefulness of these best practices is underscored by the fact that consensus, measured by the outcome of anonymous voting, was reached by the panel for 24 of the 25 questions. We hope that these best practices may be useful to the pediatric gastroenterology and larger general pediatric communities.},

   abstract = {Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) of childhood. Only a minority of patients with FAP seek medical attention, often presenting to the primary care physician while symptoms are still evolving. The bio-psychosocial model of treatment not only aims to alleviate the illness symptoms but also identifies and remedies the psychological comorbidities and social factors that contribute to illness behavior. Many patients with a mild illness can be managed in the primary care setting. However those with chronic, severe, frequently relapsing, and disabling illness usually are referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist. One of the reason for referral is to exclude organic disorders such as peptic ulcer disease, celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease which can present with chronic abdominal pain. Recent data suggest that psychological therapy is very effective in alleviating symptoms, a subset of patients may require dietary modification and medications as an adjunct to psychological treatment.},

   abstract = {Consumption of legumes is associated with a number of physiological and health benefits. Legume proteins complement very well those of cereals and are often used to produce gluten-free products. However, legume seeds often contain antinutritional compounds, such as phytate, galactooligosaccharides, phenolic compounds, lectins, enzyme inhibitors, whose presence could affect their nutritional value. Screening natural and induced biodiversity for useful traits, followed by breeding, is a way to remove undesirable components. We used the common bean cv. Lady Joy and the lpa1 mutant line, having different seed composition for absence/presence of lectins,alpha-amylase inhibitor, (alpha-AI) and phytic acid, to verify the advantage of their use to make biscuits with improved nutritional properties. We showed that use of unprocessed flour from normal beans (Taylor's Horticulture and Billo) must be avoided, since lectin activity is still present after baking, and demonstrated the advantage of using the cv. Lady Joy, lacking active lectins and having active alpha-AI. To assess the contribution of bean flour to biscuit quality traits, different formulations of composite flours (B12, B14, B22, B24, B29) were used in combinations with wheat (B14), maize (gluten-free B22 and B29), or with both (B12 and B24). These biscuits were nutritionally better than the control, having a better amino acid score, higher fiber amount, lower predicted glycemic index (pGI) and starch content. Replacement of cv. Lady Joy bean flour with that of lpa1, having a 90% reduction of phytic acid and devoid of alpha-AI, contributed to about a 50% reduction of phytic acid content. We also showed that baking did not fully inactivate alpha-AI, further contributing to lowering the pGI of the biscuits. Finally, data from a blind taste test using consumers indicated that the B14 biscuit was accepted by consumers and comparable in terms of liking to the control biscuit, although the acceptability of these products decreased with the increase of bean content. The B22 gluten-free biscuits, although received liking scores that were just above the middle point of the hedonic scale, might represent a good compromise between health benefits (absence of gluten and lower pGI), expectations of celiac consumers and likeness.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with celiac disease (CD) may be at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), yet CVD risk factors are not well defined in CD. The validated Framingham Heart Study 10-year general CVD risk score (FRS) that incorporates traditional CVD risk factors including body mass index (BMI) has not been previously studied in CD patients. AIMS: To compare BMI and FRS in CD patients with population-based controls. METHODS: Biopsy-proven CD patients were ascertained retrospectively and data on BMI, systolic blood pressure, hypertension, smoking status, and diabetes were obtained at initial and follow-up visits. FRS was calculated and compared with 4 matched general population non-CD controls from the 2009 to 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). RESULTS: Of 258 total CD patients, 38.3% were overweight or obese compared with 69.8% of controls (P<0.001). In total, 174 CD patients met the inclusion criteria for FRS calculation. Of these, the median FRS was lower in CD patients compared with controls (3.9 vs. 4.2; P=0.011). In CD patients, tobacco use was significantly lower (P<0.001), whereas systolic blood pressure was significantly higher (P<0.01) than controls. CONCLUSIONS: Global CVD risk is lower among patients with CD compared with population controls. Lower BMI and tobacco use among CD patients could account for this difference. These results suggest that factors other than those measured by FRS could contribute to the increased risk of CVD in CD observed in some studies.},

   abstract = {Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with a number of pathological gastrointestinal conditions other than inflammatory bowel disease, and also with liver disorders. Different factors such as chronic bleeding, malabsorption and inflammation may contribute to IDA. Although patients with symptoms of anemia are frequently referred to gastroenterologists, the approach to diagnosis and selection of treatment as well as follow-up measures is not standardized and suboptimal. Iron deficiency, even without anemia, can substantially impact physical and cognitive function and reduce quality of life. Therefore, regular iron status assessment and awareness of the clinical consequences of impaired iron status are critical. While the range of options for treatment of IDA is increasing due to the availability of effective and well-tolerated parenteral iron preparations, a comprehensive overview of IDA and its therapy in patients with gastrointestinal conditions is currently lacking. Furthermore, definitions and assessment of iron status lack harmonization and there is a paucity of expert guidelines on this topic. This review summarizes current thinking concerning IDA as a common co-morbidity in specific gastrointestinal and liver disorders, and thus encourages a more unified treatment approach to anemia and iron deficiency, while offering gastroenterologists guidance on treatment options for IDA in everyday clinical practice.},

This trafficking dictates the delicate balance between tolerance and immune response causing inflammation. Loss of barrier function secondary to upregulation of zonulin, the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions, leads to uncontrolled influx of dietary and microbial antigens. Additional insights on zonulin mechanism of action and the recent appreciation of the role that altered intestinal permeability can play in the development and progression of chronic inflammatory disorders has increased interest of both basic scientists and clinicians on the potential role of zonulin in the pathogenesis of these diseases. This review focuses on the recent research implicating zonulin as a master regulator of intestinal permeability linked to the development of several chronic inflammatory disorders.},

Very few large series of lymphocytic colitis of childhood occurrence are available in the medical literature. Ten cases each of lymphocytic colitis and of colonic lymphocytosis of other diagnosis, all with duodenal disaccharidases analysis data, were collected from the files of our institution. The electronic medical records were reviewed and multiple variables were analyzed. The ten patients with lymphocytic colitis presented with diarrhea. Of these, three had abdominal pain. The age range was 2-18 years. Nearly all patients were Caucasian (90%) and 70% were female. Endoscopically, most had normal appearing colonic mucosa. Significant past medical history, family medical history and associated comorbidities included celiac disease, Down syndrome, juvenile arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the most revealing observation was that the majority of cases (80%) were associated with lactase deficiency and, for the most part, gastrointestinal symptoms improved simply by treatment with Lactaid or avoidance of dairy products. This association is statistically significant. Our clinicopathological study indicates that the typical pediatric patient is a female Caucasian. A large of portion of the patients had associated lactase deficiency and improved on Lactaid supplement alone.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition recommended in 2008, based on observational data, to avoid both early (<4 months) and late (>/=7 months) introduction of gluten and to introduce gluten while the infant is still being breast-fed. New evidence prompted ESPGHAN to revise these recommendations. OBJECTIVE: To provide updated recommendations regarding gluten introduction in infants and the risk of developing coeliac disease (CD) during childhood. SUMMARY: The risk of inducing CD through a gluten-containing diet exclusively applies to persons carrying at least one of the CD risk alleles. Because genetic risk alleles are generally not known in an infant at the time of solid food introduction, the following recommendations apply to all infants, although they are derived from studying families with first-degree relatives with CD. Although breast-feeding should be promoted for its other well-established health benefits, neither any breast-feeding nor breast-feeding during gluten introduction has been shown to reduce the risk of CD. Gluten may be introduced into the infant's diet anytime between 4 and 12 completed months of age. In children at high risk for CD, earlier introduction of gluten (4 vs 6 months or 6 vs 12 months) is associated with earlier development of CD autoimmunity (defined as positive serology) and CD, but the cumulative incidence of each in later childhood is similar. Based on observational data pointing to the association between the amount of gluten intake and risk of CD, consumption of large quantities of gluten should be avoided during the first weeks after gluten introduction and during infancy. The optimal amounts of gluten to be introduced at weaning, however, have not been established.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is caused due to intake of gluten, a protein component in wheat, barley, and rye. The only treatment currently available for CD is strict lifetime adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) which is a diet that excludes wheat, barley, and rye. There is limited information on barriers to following a GFD. The present study aimed to investigate the compliance with a GFD, barriers to compliance, and the impact of compliance on the quality of life (QOL) in Iranian children and adolescents suffering from CD. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 65 known cases of CD (both males and females), diagnosed in Namazi Hospital, a large referral center in south of Iran, selected by census were studied in 2014. Dietary compliance was assessed using a questionnaire. A disease-specific QOL questionnaire for children with CD (the celiac disease DUX [CDDUX]) was used. Comparisons between categorical variables were performed using chi-square test. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients, 38 females (58.5%) and 27 (41.5%) males, were surveyed. Mean (+/- standard deviation [SD]) age of the respondents was 11.3 (+/-3.8) years. Dietary compliance was reported by 35 (53.8%) patients. The mean (+/- SD) CDDUX score was higher in dietary-compliant patients (33.5 [+/-19.4] vs 26.7 [+/-13.6], respectively, P=0.23). The score of CDDUX in parents of patients in dietary-compliant group was more than the noncompliant patients (28.1 [+/-13.5] vs 22.1 [+/-14], respectively, P=0.1). Barriers to noncompliance were poor or unavailability (100%), high cost (96.9%), insufficient labeling (84.6%), poor palatability (76.9%), and no information (69.23%). CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the patients with CD reported dietary compliance. Poor or unavailability was found to be the most important barrier contributing to noncompliance. The QOL was better in compliant patients. Proposed strategies to improve compliance are greater availability of gluten-free products, better food labeling, and better education about the diet and condition.},

In this study, corn flour was replaced with soy flour at different levels 5%, 10%, and 15% to produce a more nutritionally balanced GF bread. Physical and chemical properties, sensory evaluation and crust and crumb color were measured in bread samples. The results of evaluations showed that protein content of soy flour-supplemented GF bread significantly increased from 9.8% to 12.9% as compared to control along with an increased in fat (3.3%-4.1%), fiber (0.29%- 0.38%), and ash (1.7%-2.2%) content. Moisture (27.9%-26.5%) and carbohydrate (58.3-52.3) content decreased with the incremental addition of soybean flour. The highest total score of sensory evaluation was for the bread sample containing 15% soybean flour. The evaluation of crust and crumb showed that bread samples with 15% soy flour were significantly darker than the other bread samples. In conclusion, adding higher levels of soybean flour into GF bread can improve bread quality, sensory characteristics, and nutritional properties of bread. Nutritional status in patients with celiac disease (CD) can be improved through the produce GF bread in this way.},

   abstract = {Eicosanoids are inflammatory mediators that play a key but incompletely understood role in linking the innate and adaptive immune systems. Here, we show that cytotoxic effector T cells (CTLs) are capable of both producing and responding to cysteinyl leukotrienes (CystLTs), allowing for the killing of target cells in a T cell receptor-independent manner. This process is dependent on the natural killer receptor NKG2D and exposure to IL-15, a cytokine induced in distressed tissues. IL-15 and NKG2D signaling drives the up-regulation of key enzymes implicated in the synthesis of CystLTs, as well as the expression of CystLT receptors, suggesting a positive feedback loop. Finally, although the CystLT pathway has been previously linked to various allergic disorders, we provide unexpected evidence for its involvement in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD), a T helper 1 cell-mediated enteropathy induced by gluten. These findings provide new insights into the cytolytic signaling pathway of NKG2D and the pathogenesis of organ-specific immune disorders. Furthermore, they suggest that the blockade of CystLT receptors may represent a potent therapeutic target for CD or potentially other autoimmune disorders in which NKG2D has been implicated.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Prior studies have shown that dietary gluten avoidance (DGA) is relatively common in children without previously diagnosed celiac disease (CD), and several clinical predictors of DGA have been found. However, available data on predictors of DGA in adults without diagnosed CD are limited. The aim of this study was to determine the independent predictors of DGA in this population. METHODS: We performed a structured medical record review of 376 patients, ages >/= 20 y, who had never been formally diagnosed with CD, presenting for an initial CD evaluation (ICD-9-CM 579.0) between January 2000 and December 2010 at two large Boston teaching hospitals. We collected data including demographic characteristics, medical history, history of CD serology before referral, and self-reported DGA. Predictors of DGA were determined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 47 (SD = 17) years. We found that 41 patients (10.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9-14.5) had avoided gluten at some time in their lives. Most patients had subjective abdominal complaints or bowel movement changes. History of CD seropositivity before referral was noted in 14%. Independent predictors of DGA (P < 0.05) were lactose intolerance (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1-7.5), food allergy (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.04-13.7), and history of positive serology of less-specific CD markers before the referral (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.9). CONCLUSIONS: Gluten avoidance is common in a clinic population of adults without prior CD diagnosis. The recognized predictors suggest that DGA may associate with conditions presenting with nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints and perhaps with the perceived benefits of DGA among patients with prior history of positive CD serology.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Fat malabsorption can occur in celiac disease (CD) owing to villus atrophy and inflammation of small intestinal mucosa. Abnormal fatty acid (FA) status of intestinal mucosa in children with CD was reported earlier. Previously we found significantly reduced availability of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) in children and young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). The aim of this study was to investigate FAs in plasma lipid classes in children with newly diagnosed CD with or without preexisting DM. METHODS: FA composition of plasma samples of children with untreated CD only (n = 20) and with preexisting DM (CDDM, n = 8) were compared with those of healthy controls (n = 21). Detailed analysis of phospholipid, triacylglycerol, and sterol ester FAs was performed by high-resolution capillary gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Significantly decreased docosapentaenoic (C22:5n-3), docosahexaenoic (C22:6n-3), n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), and n-3 LCPUFA values were found in CDDM group compared with controls and patients with CD. When compared with healthy controls, no significant difference was found in plasma FAs of children with newly diagnosed CD only. CONCLUSIONS: Children with CDDM showed marked signs of reduced availability of n-3 PUFA and n-3 LCPUFA in circulating lipids. Although different tissues express membrane FAs differently, our present study suggests that CD on its own does not necessarily lead to detectable disturbances of essential FA metabolism in plasma and supports the concept that DM has significant impact on plasma FA composition in children.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a systemic autoimmune disease that can be associated with gastrointestinal findings (diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, anorexia, lactose intolerance, abdominal distention, and irritability) and/or highly variable non-gastrointestinal findings (iron deficiency anemia, dermatitis herpetiformis, chronic fatigue, joint pain/inflammation, migraines, depression, attention-deficit disorder, epilepsy, osteoporosis/osteopenia, infertility and/or recurrent fetal loss, vitamin deficiencies, short stature, failure to thrive, delayed puberty, dental enamel defects, and autoimmune disorders). Classic celiac disease, characterized by mild to severe gastrointestinal symptoms, is less common than non-classic celiac disease, characterized by absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. The diagnosis of celiac disease relies on characteristic histologic findings on small-bowel biopsy and clinical and/or histologic improvement on a gluten-free diet. Most individuals with celiac disease have celiac disease-associated antibodies; for celiac disease to develop, specific allelic variants of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 must be present. Because 30% of the general population has one or more of the celiac disease-associated alleles and only 3% of these individuals develop celiac disease, presence of celiac disease-associated HLA alleles is not diagnostic of celiac disease; however, their absence essentially excludes the diagnosis. Treatment of manifestations: Lifelong adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (avoidance of wheat, rye, and barley); treatment of nutritional deficiencies (iron, zinc, calcium, fat-soluble vitamins, folic acid); standard treatment of osteoporosis. Prevention of primary manifestations: Lifelong gluten-free diet. Surveillance: For symptomatic individuals responsive to a gluten-free diet, periodic physical examination and assessment of growth, nutritional status, and non-gastrointestinal disease manifestations; repeat small-bowel biopsy one to three years following diagnosis. For symptomatic individuals unresponsive to a gluten-free diet, periodic evaluation for refractory celiac disease, ulcerative enteritis, T-cell lymphoma, and other gastrointestinal cancers. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dietary gluten. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing of first-degree relatives of a proband (including young children) to monitor those with known celiac disease-susceptibility alleles for early evidence of celiac disease in order to institute gluten-free diet early in the disease course. Celiac disease is a multifactorial disorder resulting from the interaction of HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 allelic variants known to be associated with celiac disease susceptibility, less well-recognized variants in non-HLA genes, gliadin (a subcomponent of gluten), and other environmental factors. Some empiric risk data for at-risk relatives are available.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. CD-related enteropathy leads to multiple nutritional deficiencies involving macro- and micronutrients. Currently, medical nutrition therapy consisting of the gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only accepted treatment for CD. KEY MESSAGES: The GFD is the cornerstone of treatment for CD. Prior published studies have concluded that maintenance of the GFD results in improvement of the majority of nutritional deficiencies. In the past, counseling for CD focused mainly on the elimination of gluten in the diet. However, the GFD is not without its inadequacies; compliance to the GFD may result in certain deficiencies such as fiber, B vitamins, iron, and trace minerals. Paucity of fortified gluten-free foods may be responsible for certain deficiencies which develop on the GFD. Weight gain and obesity have been added to the list of nutritional consequences while on the GFD and have been partially attributed to hypercaloric content of commercially available gluten-free foods. Follow-up of patients diagnosed with CD after starting the GFD has been reported to be irregular and, hence, less than ideal. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of the nutritional status using blood tests and use of appropriate gluten-free supplementation are integral components in the management of CD. The ideal GFD should be nutrient-dense with naturally gluten-free foods, balanced with macro- and micronutrients, reasonably priced, and easily accessible. Rotation of the pseudo-cereals provides a good source of complex carbohydrates, protein, fiber, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. Fortification/enrichment of commonly consumed gluten-free commercial grain products should be encouraged. Dietitians specializing in CD play a critical role in the education and maintenance of the GFD for patients with CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using the Coeliac Disease Dutch Questionnaire (CDDUX) in Spanish children with coeliac disease. METHODS: The CDDUX was cross-culturally adapted according to international consensus guidelines. HRQOL was assessed in coeliac members of the Madrid Coeliac Association ages 8 to 18 years using the adapted CDDUX. Cronbach alpha coefficient was determined as a measure of intraquestionnaire reliability and intraclass correlation coefficients as a measure of reliability between scores awarded by children and parents. Demographic and clinical variables associated with HRQOL were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 1602 children of 3122 registered Madrid Coeliac Association members ages 8 to 18 years were invited to participate. The questionnaire was completed by 480 families (30%): 214 only by parents, 214 by parents and their children, and 52 only by children. Cronbach alpha coefficient for the total score for parents was 0.90, and for children 0.88 (0.75-0.90 by scales). Mean total (standard deviation [SD]) HRQOL scores in children and parents were 55.5 (SD 12.7) and 53.89 (SD 12.19), respectively, with no differences detected in paired comparisons between the 2 groups. Significantly worse HRQOL scores were recorded in children showing a nonclassical clinical presentation, in those not adhering to treatment and in those reporting difficulties in following the diet. CONCLUSIONS: The CDDUX questionnaire emerged as reliable for use in Spanish children with celiac disease. Overall, both children and parents felt the disease had no substantial negative impacts on patient HRQOL.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) represents a spectrum, which includes cases with minor histological abnormalities (potential CD). The aim of this work is to evaluate the contribution of immunohistochemical analysis of duodenal biopsies to the diagnosis of gluten-related minor enteropathy. METHODS: Duodenal biopsies from 56 patients with untreated CD and 56 controls were analyzed for CD3 and gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocyte number, gammadelta/CD3 ratio, and density of CD25+ lamina propria cells. A discriminant equation was obtained by which 61 more biopsies with normal villous architecture were blindly evaluated. RESULTS: All of the immunohistochemical parameters were significantly different between patients with CD and controls. None of the single parameters showed sufficient specificity for CD. The combination of all of the 4 markers resulted in the following discriminant equation: discriminant score (Dscore) = (CD3 x 0.06) - (gammadelta x 0.119) + (CD25 x 0.012) + (gammadelta/CD3 x 0.131) - 4.709. Using this Dscore, patients were correctly classified as celiac or controls in 97.3% of the cases. When this equation was applied to a validation set of 61 patients with normal villous architecture and unknown diagnosis, 92.9% of those with a positive score turned out to be patients with potential CD. A normal score, however, did not exclude this condition. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemistry represents a specific tool for the diagnosis of CD, but does lack sensitivity in detecting all of the potential CD cases.},

   abstract = {Gluten is one of the most abundant and widely distributed components of food in many areas. It can be included in wheat, barley, rye, and grains such as oats, barley, spelt, kamut, and triticale. Gluten-containing grains are widely consumed; in particular, wheat is one of the world's primary sources of food, providing up to 50% of the caloric intake in both industrialized and developing countries. Until two decades ago, celiac disease (CD) and other gluten-related disorders were believed to be exceedingly rare outside of Europe and were relatively ignored by health professionals and the global media. In recent years, however, the discovery of important diagnostic and pathogenic milestones led CD from obscurity to global prominence. In addition, interestingly, people feeding themselves with gluten-free products greatly outnumber patients affected by CD, fuelling a global consumption of gluten-free foods with approximately $2.5 billion in United States sales each year. The acknowledgment of other medical conditions related to gluten that has arisen as health problems, providing a wide spectrum of gluten-related disorders. In February 2011, a new nomenclature for gluten-related disorders was created at a consensus conference in London. In this review, we analyse innovations in the field of research that emerged after the creation of the new classification, with particular attention to the new European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines for CD and the most recent research about non-celiac gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In 2012, European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition published novel guidelines on celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. Symptomatic children with serum anti-transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody levels >/=10 times upper limit of normal (ULN) could avoid duodenal biopsies after positive HLA test and serum anti-endomysial antibodies (EMAs). So far, both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with anti-tTG titer <10 times ULN should undergo upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsies to confirm diagnosis. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of serological tests to diagnose CD in asymptomatic patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of 286 patients (age range: 10 months to 17 years) with CD diagnosis based on elevated titer of anti-tTG, EMA positivity, and histology. All patients were distinguished between symptomatic and asymptomatic; histological lesions were graded according to the Marsh-Oberhuber (MO) criteria. Fisher exact test was applied to analyze both groups in terms of diagnostic reliability of serological markers. RESULTS: A total of 196 patients (68.53%) had anti-tTG titers >/=10 times ULN. Among them, a group of 156 patients (79.59%) also had symptoms suggestive of CD ("high-titer" symptomatic); of these, 142 patients (91.02%) showed severe lesion degree (3a, 3b, 3c MO). Conversely, 40 out of 196 patients (20.40%) were asymptomatic ("high-titer" asymptomatic) and 37 patients (92.5%) of them showed severe lesion degree (3a, 3b, 3c MO). No difference in histological damage was found between "high-titer" symptomatic and "high-titer" asymptomatic children (Fisher exact test, P=1.000). CONCLUSIONS: If confirmed in large multicenter prospective studies, the "biopsy-sparing" protocol seems to be applicable to both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with anti-tTG titer >/=10 times ULN, positive EMA, and HLA-DQ2/DQ8.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate complication screening and follow-up patterns in a population with type 1 diabetes mellitus and celiac disease (T1D/CD) in relation to a matched cohort with celiac disease (CD) alone at our center. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the health charts of 41 children with T1D and biopsy-proven CD and compared anthropometrics and complication of screening within 2 years from CD diagnosis. Follow-up patterns were determined 3 years postdiagnosis. This population was then compared with a population with both symptomatic and asymptomatic CD matched for age and sex. RESULTS: In comparison with T1D/CD, patients with CD alone had a significantly lower height, weight and body mass index (BMI z score 0.01 vs 0.81, P = 0.001) and higher rates of screening for anemia (95% vs 71%, P = 0.003) and bone health (49% vs 29%, P = 0.05). Minimal rates of laboratory abnormalities were observed in either group, irrespective of symptoms at presentation, but CD alone more often presented with anemia than T1D/CD. Repeat serology testing was significantly more frequently performed in the T1D/CD group. Follow-up was equally variable with a median of 3 (range 0-4) visits with a gastroenterologist during the first 3 years postdiagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that patients with T1D/CD represent a distinct and possibly milder phenotype from CD alone. Complication screening was variable and negative for the majority of the patients. Guidelines for follow-up may need to be tailored to specific groups to standardize evaluation and complication screening, especially with regard to bone health.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven children with CD (mean age of 8.8 +/- 4.6 years, 21 girls) were enrolled. Anthropometric measurements, bone mineral density (BMD) in lumbar 2-4 vertebrae, and serum alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and phosphorus levels at diagnosis and at follow-up were recorded. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 3.5 +/- 2.3 years. The BMD of patients was significantly lower than that of control subjects at the time of diagnosis but not after 1 year of the GFD. Incidence of low BMD with respect to z-scores for chronological age (CA) was significantly higher than z-scores for height age (HA) (P = 0.006). At the first year of GFD, BMD, BMD z-score, height-for-age z-scores, and weight-for-age z-scores were significantly increased compared with the baseline, but not after 1 year of the GFD. CONCLUSION: In CD, the first year of GFD is important in weight gain, linear growth, and improvement of BMD. A considerable relation of low BMD in children with CD, with respect to z-scores for CA, may be a result of misinterpretation of low BMD due to short stature.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Women with coeliac disease may have a lower bone mineral density due to the malabsorption of calcium before diagnosis. A high sodium excretion is associated with increased calcium and bone loss. Our aim was to describe the bone mineral density (BMD) and sodium excretion in women with coeliac disease. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study BMD of the lumbar spine and hip was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Sodium, potassium and calcium excretion were measured from a 24 h urine collection. RESULTS: In 33 women (51 +/- 16 yr) BMD was 1.14 +/- 0.19 g/cm(2) and 0.94 +/- 0.14 g/cm(2) at the lumbar spine and hip respectively. Age matched Z-scores were -0.1 +/- 1.2 and -0.3 +/- 1.1 at lumbar spine and hip respectively. Sodium excretion was 107 +/- 51 mmol/d; 14 (42%) had a sodium excretion >100 mmol Na/d (145 +/- 45 mmol/d). Potassium and calcium excretion were 87 +/- 25 mmol/d and 4.1 +/- 2.0 mmol/d respectively. In women with Na excretion >100 mmol Na/d, Ca excretion was significantly greater than those with <100 mmol/d (4.9 +/- 2.0 vs 3.4 +/- 1.8, p < 0.05). Sodium excretion and BMI were positively correlated (r = 0.61, p < 0.001) as were sodium and calcium excretion (r = 0.43, p < 0.05). Sodium excretion was inversely related to femoral neck BMD (t = -2.4 p = 0.023) after adjustment for weight, age, years since diagnosis and potassium excretion. Weight, but no other variable, was a predictor of BMD at the lumbar spine (t = 2.58 p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Sodium excretion was inversely related and potassium excretion positively related to femoral neck density which was similar to age matched women without coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Wheat gluten and related proteins can trigger an autoimmune enteropathy, known as coeliac disease, in people with genetic susceptibility. However, some individuals experience a range of symptoms in response to wheat ingestion, without the characteristic serological or histological evidence of coeliac disease. The aetiology and mechanism of these symptoms are unknown, and no biomarkers have been identified. We aimed to determine if sensitivity to wheat in the absence of coeliac disease is associated with systemic immune activation that may be linked to an enteropathy. DESIGN: Study participants included individuals who reported symptoms in response to wheat intake and in whom coeliac disease and wheat allergy were ruled out, patients with coeliac disease and healthy controls. Sera were analysed for markers of intestinal cell damage and systemic immune response to microbial components. RESULTS: Individuals with wheat sensitivity had significantly increased serum levels of soluble CD14 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein, as well as antibody reactivity to bacterial LPS and flagellin. Circulating levels of fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2), a marker of intestinal epithelial cell damage, were significantly elevated in the affected individuals and correlated with the immune responses to microbial products. There was a significant change towards normalisation of the levels of FABP2 and immune activation markers in a subgroup of individuals with wheat sensitivity who observed a diet excluding wheat and related cereals. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a state of systemic immune activation in conjunction with a compromised intestinal epithelium affecting a subset of individuals who experience sensitivity to wheat in the absence of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal diet during pregnancy has been proposed to increase the risk of autoimmune diseases. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the association between maternal consumption of gluten-containing foods during late pregnancy and subsequent risk of celiac disease in the offspring. DESIGN: Genetically susceptible children prospectively followed from birth were screened annually for tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGAs). Children testing persistently positive for tTGAs were further evaluated for celiac disease. Diagnosis of celiac disease was confirmed by intestinal biopsy or was considered likely if the mean tTGA concentration was >100 units in 2 consecutive samples. A questionnaire on the mother's diet in late pregnancy was completed by 3-4.5 mo postpartum. Mothers were divided into 3 groups based on the tertiles of their consumption of gluten-containing foods (servings/d). The association between maternal gluten-containing food consumption and the risk of celiac disease was studied by using a time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: At the time of analysis, 359 (5%) of the 6546 children developed celiac disease. Compared with the middle category of maternal gluten-containing food consumption (servings/d), low (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.13; P = 0.296) and high (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.09; P = 0.202) consumption was not associated with risk of celiac disease in the child after adjustment for country, human leukocyte antigen genotype, family history of celiac disease, maternal education, and sex of the child. Median maternal daily consumption frequency of gluten-containing foods was higher (P < 0.0001) in Finland (5.3; IQR: 3.9-6.9), Germany (4.3; IQR: 3.1-5.5), and Sweden (3.7; IQR: 2.8-4.9) than in the United States (3.4; IQR: 2.3-4.9). No significant interaction was found between country of residence and the mothers' consumption of gluten-containing foods in relation to risk of celiac disease. CONCLUSION: The frequency of gluten-containing food consumption during late pregnancy is not associated with risk of celiac disease in the offspring.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To study whether breastfeeding and breastfeeding status during gluten introduction influences the age at diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). In addition to study, whether the timing of gluten introduction influences the age at diagnosis of CD. METHODS: It was a hospital based observational study. Total 198 patients diagnosed with CD as per modified European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (2012) criteria, aged between 6 months to 6 years were included. Detail history taken with special emphasis on breastfeeding and age of gluten introduction. Standard statistical methods used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Mean+/-standard deviation age of onset and diagnosis of CD in breastfed cases was 2.81+/-1.42 years and 3.68 +/-1.55 years respectively as compared to 1.84+/-1.36 years and 2.70+/-1.65 years respectively in not breastfed cases (p<0.05). Those who had continued breastfeeding during gluten introduction and of longer duration had significantly delayed onset of disease. The age at onset of CD was under one year in 40.42% of the cases, who had started gluten before 6 months of age compared to only 12.58% of those who had started gluten later (p<0.001). The proposed statistical model showed that two variables, i.e., breast feeding status during gluten introduction and age at gluten introduction positively influencing the age at diagnosis of CD. CONCLUSION: Delayed gluten introduction to infant's diet along with continuing breastfeeding, delays symptomatic CD. However, it is not clear from our study that these infant feeding practices provide permanent protection against the disease or merely delays the symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The only treatment for celiac disease is the gluten-free diet. Few studies have assessed the nutritional adequacy of this diet, especially of B vitamins related to homocysteine metabolism. The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional status and serum concentrations of B vitamins involved in homocysteine metabolism, and to determine whether the dietary intake of these vitamins are meeting Dietary Reference Intakes in celiac patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study enrolled a total of 20 celiac patients (36.3 +/- 13.7 years old; 65% women), following strict gluten-free diet (GFD) and 39 healthy controls matched by sex and age. The dietary intake was assessed by 3-day food records, and serum concentrations of homocysteine and vitamins B6, B12, and folate were determined after overnight fasting. Comparisons between the two groups were performed by Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U-test, for continuous variables. Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables. An alpha level of 5% were considered significant. RESULTS: Celiac patients had lower serum folate concentrations (7.7 +/- 3.5 ng/mL, P < 0.05) than controls. All celiac patients had folate intake below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) (130.8 +/- 53.6 mug/d). However, only a small proportion of celiac patients had hyperhomocysteinemia. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac patients treated with GFD presented inadequacy of dietary folate intake and low-serum concentrations of folate, suggesting that more attention should be given to the quality of the nutrients offered by the GFD, as it constitutes a lifelong treatment.},

Yet the actual prevalence is not well established. METHODS: Between April 2015 and March 2016, unselected adults visiting marketplaces, dental practices and a university in The Netherlands were asked to complete a modified validated questionnaire for self-reported gluten sensitivity (srGS). RESULTS: Among the 785 adults enquired, two had celiac disease. Forty-nine (6.2%) reported symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food. These individuals were younger, predominantly female and lived more frequently in urban regions compared with the other respondents. Symptoms reported included bloating (74%), abdominal discomfort (49%) and flatulence (47%). A total of 23 (47%) srGS individuals reported having had tried a gluten-free or gluten-restricted diet. Abdominal discomfort related to fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP)-containing food was more often reported in srGS individuals compared with the other respondents (73.5% vs. 21.7%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Self-reported GS is common in The Netherlands, especially in younger individuals, females and urban regions, although the prevalence was lower than in a comparable recent UK study. It cannot be excluded that FODMAPs are in part responsible for these symptoms.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is associated with an increased risk of major depressive disorder, possibly due to deficiencies in micronutrients in the gluten-free diet. We aimed to investigate whether essential amino acids (i.e., the precursors of serotonin, dopamine and other neurotransmitters) are depleted in the diet and serum of CD patients with major depressive disorder. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study we assessed dietary intake of amino acids and serum levels of amino acids, in 77 CD patients on a gluten-free diet and in 33 healthy controls. Major depressive disorder was assessed with structured interviews (using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus). Dietary intake was assessed using a 203-item food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 55 years and 74% were women. The intake of vegetable protein was significantly lower in CD patients than in healthy controls (mean difference of 7.8 g/d; 95% CI: 4.7-10.8), as were serum concentrations of tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan (all p < 0.005). However, within the CD patient group, the presence of major depressive disorder (n = 42) was not associated with intake or serum levels of essential amino acids. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD on a long-term gluten-free diet, with good adherence, consume significantly less vegetable protein than controls, and their serum levels of several essential amino acids were also lower. Despite its potential adverse effect, intake and serum levels of essential amino acids were not related to major depression.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is caused by inflammatory T-cell responses against the insoluble dietary protein gliadin. We have shown that, in humanized mice, oral tolerance to deamidated chymotrypsin-digested gliadin (CT-TG2-gliadin) is driven by tolerogenic interferon (IFN)-gamma- and interleukin (IL)-10-secreting type 1 regulatory T-like cells (Tr1-like cells) generated in the spleen but not in the mesenteric lymph nodes. We aimed to uncover the mechanisms underlying gliadin-specific Tr1-like-cell differentiation and hypothesized that proteolytic gliadin degradation by splenic macrophages is a decisive step in this process. In vivo depletion of macrophages caused reduced differentiation of splenic IFN-gamma- and IL-10-producing Tr1-like cells after CT-TG2-gliadin but not gliadin peptide feed. Splenic macrophages, rather than dendritic cells, constitutively expressed increased mRNA levels of the endopeptidase Cathepsin D; macrophage depletion significantly reduced splenic Cathepsin D expression in vivo and Cathepsin D efficiently degraded recombinant gamma-gliadin in vitro. In response to CT-TG2-gliadin uptake, macrophages enhanced the expression of Il27p28, a cytokine that favored differentiation of gliadin-specific Tr1-like cells in vitro, and was previously reported to increase Cathepsin D activity. Conversely, IL-27 neutralization in vivo inhibited splenic IFN-gamma- and IL-10-secreting Tr1-like-cell differentiation after CT-TG2-gliadin feed. Our data infer that endopeptidase mediated gliadin degradation by macrophages and concomitant IL-27 production drive differentiation of splenic gliadin-specific Tr1-like cells.},

   abstract = {Lactose is the main carbohydrate in infant feeding, but its impact decreases as the child gets older and consumes less milk and dairy products. Congenital lactose intolerance is a very rare condition. However, lactase activity may be low and need to mature during the first weeks of life in many infants. However, the evidence that unabsorbed lactose is causing infantile crying and colic is contradictory. Unabsorbed lactose has a bifidogenic effect and improves calcium absorption. Lactose malabsorption may occur secondary and thus temporally to other etiologies such as infectious gastroenteritis, cow's milk allergy and celiac disease. One the cause is treated, lactase activity will gradually return to normal. The vast majority of Asian children will develop late onset congenital lactase deficiency. However, this entity only exceptionally causes symptoms before the age of 4-5 years. Symptoms are abdominal cramps, flatulence and watery, acid stools, and decrease the quality of life but lactose intolerance is not associated with "true disease". The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds and confirmed with a lactose breath test, if needed. These patients need to have a lifetime long reduced lactose intake to improve their quality of life.},

Through the development of cooking, the human being has produced high- gluten-content food, so that it could make the most of its nutritional properties. Wheat is becoming one of the key elements of the Mediterranean diet. Amongst gluten- intake-related pathologies- gluten is present mainly in wheat, barley and rye- celiac disease (CD) is the most well-known. CD is a chronic inflammatory condition which affects gastrointestinal tract which develops in genetically predisposed individuals. The most common manifestation of CD is nutrients malabsorption. This protein trigger other pathology, wheat allergy (WA), which is an adverse immunological effect to gluten due to E immunoglobulin. A recent increased in non celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has also been noticed, defined as the emergence of a range of gluten-intake related symptoms in patients for which celiac disease and wheat allergy have been ruled out. This article discusses these three conditions with their phatogenic mecanisms and the different clinic manifestations.},

This study investigated the initial presentation, the diagnostic process, follow-up evaluations, and adherence to a gluten-free diet in CeD patients in a real-life setting in Switzerland from a patient's perspective. METHODS: We performed a large patient survey among unselected CeD patients in Switzerland. RESULTS: A total of 1689 patients were analyzed. The vast majority complained of both gastrointestinal and nonspecific symptoms (71.5%), whereas 1.8% reported an asymptomatic disease course. A total of 35.8% CeD patients were diagnosed by a nongastroenterologist. The diagnostic process differed between nongastroenterologists and gastroenterologists, with the latter more often using duodenal biopsy alone or in combination with serology (94.7% vs. 63.0%) and nongastroenterologists more frequently establishing the diagnosis without endoscopy (37.0% vs. 5.3%, P<0.001). Follow-up serology after 6 months was performed only in half of all patients (49.4%), whereas 69.9% had at least 1 follow-up serology within the first year after diet initiation. About 39.7% had a follow-up endoscopy with duodenal biopsies (after a median of 12 mo; range, 1 to 600 mo). The likelihood of receiving any follow-up examination was higher in patients initially diagnosed by a gastroenterologist. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of CeD patients are diagnosed by nongastroenterologists. Under the diagnostic lead of the latter, more than a third of the patients receive their diagnosis on the basis of a positive serology and/or genetics only, in evident violation of current diagnostic guidelines, which may lead to an overdiagnosis of this entity.},

METHODS: Specifically taking its two components - patients' and doctors' delay - into account, we performed a large systematic patient survey study among unselected CeD patients in Switzerland. RESULTS: We found a mean/median total diagnostic delay of 87/24 months (IQR 5-96), with a range from 0 up to 780 months and roughly equal fractions of patients' and doctors' delay. Both mean/median total (93.1/24 vs. 60.2/12, p<0.001) and doctors' (41.8/3 vs. 23.9/2, p<0.001) diagnostic delay were significantly higher in female vs. male patients, whereas patients' delay was similar, regardless of preceding irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis. Patients with a diagnostic delay shorter than 2 years were significantly less often in need of steroids and/or immunosuppressants, substitution for any nutritional deficiency but more often free of symptoms 6 and 12 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial diagnostic delay in CeD, which is associated with a worse clinical outcome and significantly longer in female patients. This increased diagnostic delay in women is due to doctors' but not patients' delay and cannot be explained by antecedent IBS prior to establishing the CeD diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The only available treatment for celiac disease (CD) is lifelong adherence to gluten free (GF)-diet. However, GF-diet may lead to possible nutrient unbalance resulting in improper nutritional quality of diet. The aim of this study is to evaluate the nutritional quality of GF-diet. METHODS: MEDLINE(R)/PubMed and Cochrane Library were electronically searched for articles published between 1990/01/01 and 2015/09/01. RESULTS: GF-diet was found to be poor in alimentary fiber due in particular to the necessary avoidance of several kinds of foods naturally rich in fiber (i.e. grain) and the low content of fiber of GF product that are usually made with starches and/or refined flours. Micronutrients are also found to be poor, in particular Vit. D, Vit. B12 and folate, in addition to some minerals such as iron, zinc, magnesium and calcium. Moreover, an inadequate macronutrient intake was reported related above all to the focus on the avoidance of gluten that often leaving back the importance of nutritional quality of the choice. In particular, it was found a higher content of both saturated and hydrogenated fatty acids and an increase in the glycemic index and glycemic load of the meal. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the GF-diet is necessary in celiac disease treatment and the attention is on gluten avoidance, the evaluation of nutritional quality of the diet must be considered. Moreover, educational strategies based on the relationship between nutrients and food and human health could be developed to optimize the therapeutic approach in celiac patients.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet is one of the main drivers of the composition and function of the gut microbiota. The scope of this review is to summarize recent studies assessing the role of gut microbiota in clinical pediatric conditions and to review studies using nutritional approaches to favorably modify the gut microbiota to improve health outcomes in children. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies underscore that breastfeeding and infant diet impact the gut microbiome and metagenome. A comprehensive study using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, suggests that the cessation of breastfeeding rather than the introduction of solid foods, drives the functional maturation of the infant gut microbiome toward an adult-like state. There is further support for the view that a disturbed early gut microbiota is implicated in allergic and autoimmune diseases. New studies using prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in various pediatric disorders have yielded promising results, yet the evidence for specific guidelines on their use is still low. SUMMARY: Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with several pediatric disorders but a cause-effect relationship remains to be clearly demonstrated in most conditions. Future studies using new systems biology approaches are anticipated to provide further insight into the functional capacities of the gut microbiome and its establishment in childhood. This may then lay the ground for improved treatment and prevention strategies targeting the gut microbiota.},

In these restaurants, GF pizzas are prepared with GF raw materials, following procedures that minimize the risk of gluten cross-contact. Here, we evaluate the risk of gluten cross-contact of GF pizzas in relation to the preparation procedures, thus aiming at identifying a safe procedure for cooking GF pizzas. Our results show that, when specific requirements are complied with, the simultaneous cooking of GF and WB pizzas is a procedure as safe as having an oven dedicated to GF pizzas or the alternate cooking of GF and WB pizzas in the same oven.},

   abstract = {The downstream cascade of the inflammatory response to gliadin in celiac intestinal mucosa encompasses the early activation of the innate immunity that triggers the adaptive response. Therefore, the in vitro study of the pathogenic mechanism of celiac disease (CD) on enterocytes alone or mucosal T lymphocytes alone does not fully consider all the aspects of gliadin-dependent inflammation. Although the in vitro culture of specimens of intestinal mucosa obtained from celiac patients is the gold standard for the study of CD, this technique presents several technical challenges and the bioptic specimens are not easily available. So, in this paper, we described the gliadin-dependent cytokine production in a bidimensional cellular system, which is able to mimic both the innate and the adaptive steps of the mucosal immune response of CD. In the upper compartment, the intestinal epithelial cells are grown on a filter, and in the lower compartment, the mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood of celiac patients are cultured. Cells were apically exposed to the toxic gliadin peptide p31-43 for 3 h and then with the immunodominant gliadin fragment palpha-9 for 21 h. The incubation with gliadin peptides resulted in increased levels of IL-15, INF-gamma, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-1beta, and CCL 2, 3 and 4 in the basal supernatants, with respect to cells exposed to medium alone. The p31-43-driven epithelial priming of mucosal response consists of transglutaminase (TG2)-mediated deamidation of the immunostimulatory gliadin peptides, as demonstrated by the inhibition of palpha-9 activity, when the system is exposed to blocking anti-TG2 antibody.},

The pathogenesis involves immune-mediated mechanisms requiring further research. Symptoms disappear in a few hours or days after gluten withdrawal and recur rapidly after gluten ingestion. Besides gluten, other wheat proteins as well as fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) may contribute to this syndrome. This syndrome occurs mainly in young women, being rare in children. Its prevalence ranges from 0.6% to 6%, based on primary or tertiary care center estimates. No biomarker is available, but half of patients tests positive for IgG anti-gliadin antibodies, which disappear quickly after gluten-free diet together with symptoms. Also, genetic markers are still undefined. Although currently limited to a research setting, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial strategy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is based on dietary restriction with special care to nutrient intake.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Non-coeliac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCG/WS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms occurring a few hours or days after the ingestion of gluten and wheat proteins in patients testing negative for coeliac disease and wheat allergy. Areas covered: The present review deals with recent scientific acquisitions of this gluten-related syndrome, including pathogenetic mechanisms, clinical picture, symptom score, biomarkers and double-blind placebo-controlled trial for diagnosis, and treatment. The methodology used was a literature search on NCG/WS using Medline and Premedline from 1970 to August 2016. Expert commentary: We discussed the pathogenesis of symptom generation and altered gut physiology in NCG/WS. Possible mechanisms include innate and adaptive immune activation, impaired intestinal epithelial barrier and changes in gut microbiome. These interlinked factors may be exploited for their clinical relevance as possible biomarkers. A systemic immune response to microbial and wheat antigens, together with intestinal cell damage, occurs in patients with NCG/WS. Due to the lack of established biomarkers, it is mandatory to validate the diagnosis of the syndrome by means of a well-defined work-up involving dietary challenge. Finally, dietary and other therapeutic indications have been thoroughly reviewed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine whether exocrine pancreatic function is impaired in patients with coeliac disease (CD) in our population and to evaluate its clinical importance. METHODS: Pancreatic exocrine function was determined by measuring faecal elastase-1 (FE) concentration. CD was diagnosed by serological testing using IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (IgAtTg) and small bowel biopsy using the Marsh classification. MRI of the pancreas was performed to evaluate any morphological changes. The study took place from January 2012 to December 2013. RESULTS: 90 patients (73 women and 17 men) of mean age 43.8+/-17.7 years (range 20-80) were included in the study. Mean time from CD confirmation was 5.8+/-0.7 years (range 1-25). Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) was diagnosed in four (4.4%) patients (one with mild EPI and three with severe EPI). MRI showed no morphological changes in any of the four patients. In all patients with EPI at least one serological nutritional marker was below the lower limit of normal. CONCLUSIONS: EPI is present in a small number of patients with CD. EPI should be excluded in all patients with CD in the presence of overt malnutrition or in cases of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms despite a gluten-free diet. Measurement of a serum nutritional panel, regardless of the presence of clinical symptoms of EPI, can be of clinical importance. MRI should be performed to exclude any morphological change in the pancreas.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disorder of the small intestine. It includes aberrant adaptive immunity with presentation of CD toxic gluten peptides by HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 molecules to gluten-sensitive T cells. A omega-gliadin/C-hordein peptide (QPFPQPEQPFPW) and a rye-derived secalin peptide (QPFPQPQQPIPQ) were proposed to be toxic in CD, as they yielded positive responses when assessed with peripheral blood T-cell clones derived from individuals with CD. We sought to assess the immunogenicity of the candidate peptides using gluten-sensitive T-cell lines obtained from CD small intestinal biopsies. We also sought to investigate the potential cross-reactivity of wheat gluten-sensitive T-cell lines with peptic-tryptic digested barley hordein (PTH) and rye secalin (PTS). Synthesised candidate peptides were deamidated with tissue transglutaminase (tTG). Gluten-sensitive T-cell lines were generated by culturing small intestinal biopsies from CD patients with peptic-tryptic gluten (PTG), PTH or PTS, along with autologous PBMCs for antigen presentation. The stimulation indices were determined by measuring the relative cellular proliferation via incorporation of 3 H-thymidine. The majority of T-cell lines reacted to the peptides studied. There was also cross-reactivity between wheat gluten-sensitive T-cell lines and the hordein, gliadin and secalin peptides. PTH, PTS, barley hordein and rye secalin-derived CD antigen-sensitive T-cell lines showed positive stimulation with PTG. omega-gliadin/C-hordein peptide and rye-derived peptide are immunogenic to gluten-sensitive T-cell lines and potentially present in wheat, rye and barley. Additional CD toxic peptides may be shared.},

It has been described as rare condition and not well documented in the literature. To improve awareness and facilitate diagnosis of this condition, we studied risk factors, pattern of presentation and management plans of celiac crisis. METHODS: It was a descriptive cross sectional study. Patients presenting in emergency room(ER) with profuse diarrhoea leading to severe dehydration, neuromuscular weakness, and metabolic acidosis and electrolyte abnormalities enrolled in the studies after positive serology and small bowel biopsy suggestive of celiac disease. RESULTS: Total 126 patients out of 350 fulfilled the criteria including 54 (42.8%) male and 71 (56.3%) female. The mean age at presentation was 5.25+/-1.18 years. Risk factors were poor social status (97.60%), consanguinity (96.77%), early weaning with gluten contained diet (93.54%), and Presenting complaints were loose motion (100%), loss of neck holding (96.77%), dehydration (96.77%), polyuria (95.96%), inability to walk (67.74%), abdominal distension (85.86%). Electrolytes imbalances were hypokalaemia (2.4+/-0.55), hypocalcaemia (7.29+/-0.66), hypomagnesaemia (1.89+/-0.50), hypophosphatemia (2.8+/-0.68), hypoalbuminemia (3.05+/-0.48) and metabolic acidosis (96%). One hundred & twenty patients were stabilized with GFD and correction of dehydration, acidosis and electrolyte imbalance. Six patients needed parenteral steroids ant total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Recovery time from crisis was mean 5.4+/-2.73 days (range 3-20 days). CONCLUSIONS: Celiac crisis is a common but under recognized problem in developing countries. Commonest presenting feature is neuromuscular paralysis and biochemical abnormality is hypokalaemia.},

Consistent with our previous findings camostat reduced meal size, prolonged the intermeal interval and increased the satiety ratio. Here, we report that blocking CCKAR in the area supplied by the celiac artery attenuated reduction of meal size by camostat more so than the cranial mesenteric artery route. Blocking CCKAR in the area supplied by the cranial mesenteric artery attenuated prolongation of the intermeal interval length and increased satiety ratio by camostat more so than the celiac artery route. Blocking CCKAR in the areas supplied by the femoral artery (control) failed to alter the feeding responses evoked by camostat. These results support the hypothesis that CCKAR in the area supplied by the CA is necessary for reduction of meal size by camostat whereas CCKAR in the area supplied by the CMA is necessary for prolongation of the intermeal interval and increased satiety ratio by this substance. Our results demonstrate that meal size and intermeal interval length by camostat are regulated through different gastrointestinal sites.},

In 240 children, CD was detected through elevated anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies 2 (TG2-IgA) and verified by a small-intestinal biopsy. This substudy included 210 children with TG2-IgA, evaluated both at the initial biopsy occasion and at 1-year follow-up. GFD adherence was evaluated by a combination of TG2-IgA measurements and self-reported adherence (n = 193). RESULTS: After 1 year, 85% (179/210) had normalized TG2-IgA levels (<5 U/mL). Among those who had >50 U/mL at diagnosis, 25% (16/63) still had elevated TG2-IgA, but for the majority their initial values were more than halved. Most reported a high level of GFD adherence ("always" 82% [158/193] and "often" 16% [30/193]), and 75% [145/193] reported always adhering combined with normalized TG2-IgA. Although reporting that they were always adherent, 13 (6.7%) had not yet normalized their TG2-IgA levels completely; however, a majority of these initially had the highest TG2-IgA levels. CONCLUSIONS: GFD adherence is high in adolescents with CD detected by screening of the general population of Swedish 12-year-olds. Almost all of them had normalized serology and reported GFD adherence at the 1-year follow-up. A few adolescents who reported GFD adherence, however, had elevated TG2-IgA levels, suggesting more severe disease and/or nonadherence.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate any potential correlation between anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies of type immunoglobulin A (tTG-IgA) and the degree of gluten-induced enteropathy in children participating in a screening study for celiac disease (CD) and to assess to what extent the revised European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines cover this group of patients. METHODS: The present study is a substudy of a cross-sectional CD screening study, Exploring the Iceberg of Celiacs in Sweden, a 2-phased study performed during 2005 to 2006 and 2009 to 2010. The 13,279 participating children had a blood test obtained, and those with positive tTG-IgA were recommended a small intestinal biopsy. The tTG-IgA levels at the time of biopsy were compared with those at the assessment of the biopsy. RESULTS: There were 267 children included, of whom 230 were diagnosed as having CD. Of all of the children, 67 children had low tTG-IgA levels (<5 U/mL), of whom 55% had Marsh 3 lesions. All of the children with tTG-IgA levels exceeding 10 times the upper limit of normal values of 5 U/mL, that is, 50 U/mL, were diagnosed as having CD. Lowering the cutoff to 3 U/mL, all but 1 child with 30 U/mL got CD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: By adopting the revised ESPGHAN criteria, biopsies could have been omitted in one-fourth of all of the patients. Our results indicate that the criteria may be useful even in screened children. Further studies are needed to confirm whether the 2012 ESPGHAN guidelines should be revised to also apply to the populations being screened.},

Understanding the factors that influence compliance could help inform management and also guide support. With a particular focus on adolescence, this narrative review critiques current literature on the burdens associated with following a GFD and the factors associated with adherence. Studies highlight a variety of burdens faced by individuals with coeliac disease, including the cost, access and availability of gluten-free (GF) foods, as well as the dilemmas experienced when eating out, travelling and socialising with friends. A number of studies report that adolescents face stigmatisation and feel isolated in social situations and at school. Additional burdens that are highlighted are a lack of knowledge regarding CD and GFD difficulties in interpreting food labels, as well as dissatisfaction with the organoleptic properties of GF foods. Factors associated with poor adherence in adolescence include older age, an absence of immediate symptoms, difficulties eating out and poor palatability of GF foods. Conversely, better emotional support and stronger organisation skills have been associated with superior adherence. Significant associations have been reported between HRQoL measures and adherence, although the findings are inconsistent. Limitations in research methodologies exist and data are restricted to just a few countries. Further research specific to adolescence is required to identify independent predictors of adherence.},

   abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders represent a diverse and heterogeneous array of conditions unified by the variable presence of specific behaviours impacting social and communicative functions (social affect) alongside other presentation. Common overt characteristics may come about as a consequence of several different genetic and biological processes differentially manifesting across different people or groups. The concept of plural 'autisms' is evolving, strengthened by an increasingly important evidence base detailing different developmental trajectories across the autism spectrum and the appearance of comorbidity variably interacting with core symptoms and onwards influencing quality of life. Reports that dietary intervention, specifically the removal of foods containing gluten and/or casein from the diet, may impact on the presentation of autism for some, complement this plural view of autism. Evidence suggestive of differing responses to the use of a gluten- and casein-free diet, defined as best- and non-response, has combined with some progress on determining the underlying genetic and biological correlates potentially related to such dietary elements. The preliminary suggestion of a possible diet-related autism phenotype is the result. This review will highlight several pertinent aspects onwards to an effect of food in some cases of autism including research on the pharmacological activity of food metabolites, immune response, issues with gut barrier function and some contribution from the gut microbiota. These represent promising areas in need of far greater research inspection in order to potentially define such a diet-related subgroup on the autism spectrum.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Refractory celiac disease type II (RCDII) and EATL (Enteropathy Associated T-cell Lymphoma) are (pre)malignant complications of celiac disease (CD). Data on malnutrition and intestinal absorption is lacking in these patients. Therefore, the aim of the study is to comprehensively assess nutritional status and intestinal absorption capacity of patients with RCDII and EATL, compared with data of newly diagnosed CD patients. METHODS: Observational study in tertiary care setting in RCDII (n = 24, 63.8 +/- 8.2 y), EATL (n = 25, 62.3 +/- 5.7 y) and CD patients (n = 43, 45.6 +/- 14.8 y). At diagnosis, anthropometry (BMI, unintentional weight loss, fat-free mass index (FFMI), handgrip strength (HGS), nutritional intake, fecal losses and Resting Energy Expenditure (REE)) were assessed. RESULTS: Low BMI (<18.5) was more often observed in RCDII patients than in CD or EATL patients (in 33%, 12% and 12%, respectively, p = 0.029). EATL patients more frequently had unintentional weight loss (>10%) than CD or RCDII patients (in 58%, 19% and 39% of patients, respectively; p = 0.005/0.082). Energy malabsorption (<85%) was detected in 44% and 33% of RCDII and EATL patients, vs 21.6% in CD (NS). Fecal energy losses were higher in RCDII than in CD patients (589 +/- 451 vs 277 +/- 137 kcal/d, p = 0.017). REE was underestimated by predicted-REE with>10% in 60% of RCDII, 89% of EATL, and 38% of CD patients (p = 0.006). Low FFMI and HGS were detected in one third and two thirds of all patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The nutritional status of patients with RCDII and EATL is inferior compared with untreated naive CD patients at presentation. Both malabsorption as well as hypermetabolism contribute to malnutrition.},

Two types of refractory CD are discriminated on the basis of the presence or absence of an atypical population of mucosal lymphocytes that may progress to enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Challenges remain in the secure diagnosis of both types of refractory disease, and evidence on which to base treatment recommendations is flawed by the small numbers of reported patients and the use of different diagnostic strategies. Recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of the condition in conjunction with the development of immunomodulatory agents for managing other inflammatory diseases are helping to shape future approaches to targeted therapy. Progression will depend on collaboration and recruitment to trials. In the meantime, there is evidence to suggest that earlier diagnosis and better follow-up and management of CD may prevent the development of refractoriness.},

BACKGROUND: IATx is a novel surgical strategy for patients with abdominal neoplasms involving the root of the superior mesenteric and/or celiac arteries, but the effects of IATx on clinical and nutritional outcomes are not well-known. METHODS: Six patients aged 24-67 years (mean, 54) underwent consecutive IATx in our center from January 2011 to January 2015. In all patients, selection and harvesting of a segmental autograft of bowel was carried out first, and radical en bloc resection of the neoplasm was performed second. RESULTS: One patient lost the autograft owing to arterial thrombosis 48 hours postoperatively, and another succumbed to a pancreatic fistula at 21 days. The remaining 4 patients survived with no evidence of tumor recurrence currently at 9-, 23-, 23-, and 39-months of follow-up. These 4 patients have had well-functioning autografts and have not required any intravenous fluid hydration since discharge. Serum d-xylose levels recovered fully 2 weeks postoperatively, and plasma proteins and cholesterol levels normalized 12-18 months later. The surviving 4 patients gained body weight without major alterations in lifestyle, work habits, or psychosocial conditions. CONCLUSION: Although IATx is associated with considerable operative risk, this aggressive approach allows patients with selected abdominal neoplasms involving the major mesenteric vessels to be completely resected and attain early intestinal autonomy from parenteral nutrition.},

   abstract = {Despite tremendous growth in the consumption of gluten-free (GF) foods, there is a lack of evaluation of their nutritional profile and how they compare with non-GF foods. The present study evaluated the nutritional quality of GF and non-GF foods in core food groups, and a wide range of discretionary products in Australian supermarkets. Nutritional information on the Nutrition Information Panel was systematically obtained from all packaged foods at four large supermarkets in Sydney, Australia in 2013. Food products were classified as GF if a GF declaration appeared anywhere on the product packaging, or non-GF if they contained gluten, wheat, rye, triticale, barley, oats or spelt. The primary outcome was the 'Health Star Rating' (HSR: lowest score 0.5; optimal score 5), a nutrient profiling scheme endorsed by the Australian Government. Differences in the content of individual nutrients were explored in secondary analyses. A total of 3213 food products across ten food categories were included. On average, GF plain dry pasta scored nearly 0.5 stars less (P< 0.001) compared with non-GF products; however, there were no significant differences in the mean HSR for breads or ready-to-eat breakfast cereals (P>/= 0.42 for both). Relative to non-GF foods, GF products had consistently lower average protein content across all the three core food groups, in particular for pasta and breads (52 and 32% less, P< 0.001 for both). A substantial proportion of foods in discretionary categories carried GF labels (e.g., 87% of processed meats), and the average HSR of GF discretionary foods were not systematically superior to those of non-GF products. The consumption of GF products is unlikely to confer health benefits, unless there is clear evidence of gluten intolerance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether symptoms in non-coeliac patients (non-CD) meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are specifically triggered by gluten. AIM: To assess gluten sensitivity in patients diagnosed with NCGS. METHODS: We studied 35 non-CD subjects (31 females) that were on a gluten-free diet (GFD), in a double-blind challenge study. Participants were randomised to receive either gluten-containing flour or gluten-free flour for 10 days, followed by a 2-week washout period and were then crossed over. The main outcome measure was their ability to identify which flour contained gluten. Secondary outcome measures were based upon Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS) scores. RESULTS: The gluten-containing flour was correctly identified by 12 participants (34%), who were classified as having NCGS. Their mean GSRS dimension scores were significantly higher following gluten challenge compared to baseline. The scores were: pain, 1.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.6 +/- 1.0; reflux, 1.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.9; indigestion, 1.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.2 +/- 1.1; diarrhoea, 1.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.9 +/- 1.5 and constipation, 1.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 2.9 +/- 1.3. Seventeen participants (49%) erroneously considered the gluten-free flour to contain gluten. Their mean GSRS dimension scores were significantly higher following gluten-free flour challenge compared to baseline. The scores were: pain, 1.6 +/- 0.9 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.9; reflux, 1.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.3 +/- 1.1; indigestion, 2.0 +/- 1.1 vs. 3.7 +/- 1.1; diarrhoea, 1.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.0 +/- 1.2 and constipation, 1.6 +/- 0.9 vs. 2.6 +/- 1.3. The other six participants (17%) were unable to distinguish between the flours. CONCLUSION: Double-blind gluten challenge induces symptom recurrence in just one-third of patients fulfilling the clinical diagnostic criteria for non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {The gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only validated treatment for celiac disease (CD), but despite strict adherence, complete mucosal recovery is rarely obtained. The aim of our study was to assess whether complete restitutio ad integrum could be achieved by adopting a restrictive diet (Gluten Contamination Elimination Diet, GCED) or may depend on time of exposure to GFD. Two cohorts of CD patients, with persisting Marsh II/Grade A lesion at duodenal biopsy after 12-18 months of GFD (early control) were identified. Patients in Cohort A were re-biopsied after a three-month GCED (GCED control) and patients in Cohort B were re-biopsied after a minimum of two years on a standard GFD subsequent to early control (late control). Ten patients in Cohort A and 19 in Cohort B completed the study protocol. There was no change in the classification of duodenal biopsies in both cohorts. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, TCRgammadelta+ (T-Cell Receptor gamma delta) T cell and eosinophils significantly decreased at GCED control (Cohort A) and at late control (Cohort B), compared to early control. Duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytosis persisting in CD patients during GFD is not eliminated by a GCED and is independent of the length of GFD. [NCT 02711696].},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To assess safety of prolonged daily administration of Triticum monococcum (Tm) using clinical, serological and histological criteria. Tm is an ancient wheat suitable for production of palatable baked goods that contains gluten devoid of strongly immunostimulatory epitopes and potentially safe for celiac disease (CD) patients as suggested by in vitro and ex vivo studies. METHODS: Protocol involved 60-day administration of 100 g/day Tm water biscuits to CD patients in remission on gluten-free diet. Symptoms Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire (GSRS) and CD-related serology were assessed at time (T) 0, T30 and T60 days, and duodenal biopsy was obtained at T0 and T60. RESULTS: Eight patients (F/M: 6/2, median age 26) were enrolled. One patient was excluded at T0 because of positive serology, and two patients dropped out because of symptoms recurrence. In the five patients completing the study, there was no difference in GSRS score at T0 to T60. All patients had Marsh II lesion at T0, four had Marsh III and one had recurrence of dermatitis herpetiformis at T60. CD-related antibodies converted from negative to positive at T60 in three patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that Tm is toxic for CD patients as judged on histological and serological criteria, but it was well tolerated by the majority of patients, suggesting that Tm is not a safe cereal for celiacs, but that it may be of value for patients with gluten sensitivity or for prevention of CD.},

   abstract = {Endocytosis is a fundamental cell biological process, which carries out essential functions in a polarized epithelial cell such as enterocytes provided with a huge surface area of the brush border membrane. Major tasks of enterocytes, which are regulated by endocytic signals, are digestion and absorption of nutrients and drugs/pharmacological agents, barrier permeability to microorganism, toxins and antigens, and transcytotic crosstalk between intestinal lumen and lamina propria cells with access to the circulation.Investigations on inflammatory bowel diseases such as food allergy, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis focus on immune processes originating within enterocytes as antigen presenting cells. Thus the initiation of oral tolerance, that is, the binding of food antigens to MHC class II proteins, might be localized within late endosomes of enterocytes. Furthermore, the late endosomal compartment of enterocytes seems to be involved in the processing of luminal antigens during the pathogenesis of celiac disease and inflammatory bowel diseases. Investigations of inherited diseases such as microvillus inclusion disease have revealed a pathogenetic defect in the autophagocytotic and/or recycling pathway of enterocytes.Our progress in the cell and molecular biological understanding of the endocytosis and the methodical opportunities of translational research offer now new therapeutic options for patients suffering from endocytosis-related diseases of enterocytes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is evidence that food components beyond gluten cause symptoms in patients with gluten sensitivity without celiac disease (nonceliac gluten sensitivity [NCGS]). We investigated the diets and nutritional characteristics of patients with NCGS. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study of 29 patients with NCGS seen at the outpatient clinic for celiac disease and other food intolerances of the University of Salerno in Italy from September 2015 through April 2016. Our study also included 37 control subjects. An experienced dietitian administered a validated food frequency questionnaire (from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) to collect information on amounts of common foods consumed. Patients and control subjects also completed the Eating Attitudes Test for diet-related disorders. Patients with NCGS completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2-I questionnaire. Differences in frequencies between patients and control subjects were calculated using chi-square test, whereas differences between continuous variables were calculated using Student t test. All tests were 2-tailed with significance level set at P < .05. RESULTS: Comparing the mean value of food daily eaten, we found that patients with NCGS ate smaller amounts of bread, rice, pasta, and cheese than control subjects. The patients ingested lower mean amounts of carbohydrates (P < .001), proteins (P = .001), fiber (P = .002), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (P = .01). More patients with NCGS than control subjects reported avoiding fruit, vegetables, milk, and dairy products, as well as snacks and mixed spices that are traditionally considered unsafe for people with gastrointestinal symptoms. Seven patients and 3 control subjects with scores >/=20 on the Eating Attitudes Test were invited for a psychological consultation; it did not confirm the presence of altered eating behaviors. Patients with NCGS had scores >65 from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, indicating a high level of concern for their health. CONCLUSIONS: In an observational study, we found that patients with NCGS eat different foods than healthy individuals; patients consume lower levels of proteins, carbohydrates, fiber, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Their diets should be routinely analyzed and possibly corrected to avoid nutritional deficiencies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Consumption of milk has been declining sharply in recent decades, particularly in developed countries. One of the reasons for this decline is the diagnosis or perception of lactose intolerance. The aim of this study was to investigate average consumption of milk and dairy products in the Campania region of Italy, one of the main producers of dairy products in the country. METHODS: Individuals aged 18 to 75 y and living in Campania were invited to answer an online questionnaire regarding their average consumption of milk and dairy products. The questionnaire was posted on the public access hospital site, as well as on several Facebook pages of friends and hospital personnel. RESULTS: The study found that 22.2% (260 of 1173) of responders from Campania do not drink milk, and 18.1% (213 of 1173) drink lactose-free milk, mainly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. The vast majority of the sample population chose to avoid consuming milk without undergoing the breath test for lactose intolerance or consulting a doctor. Women and underweight people drink more lactose-free milk than milk containing lactose. The population sample does not avoid dairy products; rather, they seem to be consumed quite frequently. CONCLUSION: The data support the need for mandatory implementation of a nutritional campaign to increase understanding regarding, for example, unnecessary avoidance of milk and excessive consumption of cheese.},
