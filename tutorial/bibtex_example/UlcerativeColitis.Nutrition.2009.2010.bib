   abstract = {Gastrointestinal disturbances (particularly diarrhea) are often induced in response to cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. Oral chemotherapeutic agents can induce diarrhea by damaging the intestinal lining. Two common oral drugs used in cancer treatment that are known to have gastrointestinal side effects are capecitabine and lapatinib. In this brief communication, the authors discuss a case study of a stage IV breast cancer patient whose chemotherapy-induced diarrhea was treated successfully with a multispecies combination of probiotics. This is a unique study in which grade 3 chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (characterized by 7-9 stools per day and associated with incontinence and abdominal cramping) was treated with only a multispecies combination of probiotics. Probiotics have been used to treat diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, and Crohn's disease. More recently, probiotics have been used to treat chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in colon cancer patients. This case study demonstrates that the probiotics can also be used to treat severe cases of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in breast cancer patients. The use of different probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases is an increasingly important area of study, and more research into this area is needed. This study demonstrates that probiotics should be considered for advanced breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.},

   abstract = {Despite the accumulation of positive data, the role of azathioprine (AZA) in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis is still controversial. We looked at the follow-up of the ulcerative colitis patients who, after responding to either steroids or cyclosporin (CsA), received AZA at our referral center for over a decade. The 39 patients (29 m/10f) were treated between 1991 and 2007. Twenty-five of them had responded to CsA, the remaining 14 to corticosteroids. AZA was usually overlapped with either of the two agents at the initial dose of 2mg/kg/day. The definitions of remission, relapse, and AZA toxicity followed commonly agreed criteria. The median duration of the AZA treatment was 14 months (<1-201). Fifty-two percent and 14%, respectively, of the CsA and the steroid responders needed surgery (overall rate=38%). The figures were 32 and 15 at the first year. The majority of the patients had 1-2 relapses often in connection with withdrawal of AZA; only 3 of these relapsers needed hospitalization. AZA caused toxicity in 16/39 (41%) patients, requiring withdrawal in 23% of the cases; leukopenia (17%) and hepatitis/cholestasis (10%) ranked first and second for frequency. All of the patients in whom AZA was stopped (or reduced) relapsed. In conclusion, the 1-year colectomy rates compare favorably with the figures reported by the literature. By contrast, the toxicity rates were higher than expected. Failure to genotype or to use escalating AZA doses can only be hypothesized as causes.},

   abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). Risk factors for the development of CRC in the setting of IBD include disease duration, anatomic extent of disease, age at time of diagnosis, severity of inflammation, family history of colon cancer, and concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis. The current surveillance strategy of surveillance colonoscopy with multiple random biopsies most likely reduces morbidity and mortality associated with IBD-related CRC. Unfortunately, surveillance colonoscopy also has severe limitations including high cost, sampling error at time of biopsy, and interobserver disagreement in histologically grading dysplasia. Furthermore, once dysplasia is detected there is disagreement about its management. Advances in endoscopic imaging techniques are already underway, and may potentially aid in dysplasia detection and improve overall surveillance outcomes. Management of dysplasia depends predominantly on the degree and focality of dysplasia, with the mainstay of management involving either proctocolectomy or continued colonoscopic surveillance. Lastly, continued research into additional chemopreventive agents may increase our arsenal in attempting to reduce the incidence of IBD-associated CRC.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Individualised doses of azathioprine (AZA) may be prescribed by monitoring the levels of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). The measurements of thiopurine metabolites of AZA, 6-thioguanine (6-TGN) and 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP), have also been reported as new markers of AZA activity. OBJECTIVES: To describe TPMT phenotype in our population and to establish a relationship between thiopurine metabolites,and therapeutic activity and adverse effects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data on TPMT were retrospectively collected from 107 patients, and 6-TGN and 6-MMP levels in 18 patients currently on treatment with AZA (Crohn's disease 5, ulcerative colitis 5, autoimmune hepatitis 5). RESULTS: Mean value of TPMT was 20.19U/ml. None of the patients had a TPMT activity<5U/ml. Of the 18 patients on treatment, 13 showed sub-therapeutic levels of 6-TGN (<235pmol/8x10(8) red blood cells). Clinical remission was maintained in 45% of patients. Mean levels of 6-TGN in patients with clinical remission were 259pmol/8x10(8) red blood cells versus 209pmol/8x10(8) red blood cells in non-responders (p=0.37). There was an inverse relationship (r=-0.28) between TPMT and 6-TGN levels. Toxic effects occurred in 6 of 18 patients, with leukopenia in 5 and hyperamylasemia in 1. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of TPMT and monitoring of thiopurine metabolites allows AZA treatment to be optimised, although further studies are necessary to establish therapeutic effectiveness and toxicity ranges.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients hospitalized for ulcerative colitis (UC) are at high risk for colectomy. Despite growing interest in research using administrative data in inflammatory bowel disease, there is no available tool in such research to stratify disease severity or identify patients at high risk for colectomy. METHODS: Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2004, we identified patients hospitalized for UC flare through appropriate ICD-9-CM discharge diagnosis codes (556.x). Our primary outcome of interest was undergoing total colectomy (45.8). Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to identify independent predictors of colectomy. From this, a cumulative risk score was developed. Hospitalizations were divided into 3 strata (low, intermediate, high) based on the odds of colectomy. RESULTS: There were a total of 15,142 hospitalizations with a discharge diagnosis of UC included in our study among whom 366 patients underwent total colectomy (2.4%). Anemia (odds ratio [OR] 2.13), requirement for blood transfusion (OR 2.22), malnutrition (OR 4.53), and total parenteral nutrition (OR 4.30) were independent predictors of colectomy as were transfer in from another hospital (OR 2.06) and admission to a teaching hospital (OR 1.73). The cumulative colectomy risk score ranged from 0-8, with significantly higher risk of colectomy in the high-risk stratum (13.7%) compared to the intermediate-risk (4.2%, P < 0.001) and low-risk (1.3%, P < 0.001) strata. The risk score performed well in its discriminative ability with an area under the curve of 0.70. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a simple and novel risk score to stratify the severity of UC hospitalizations and predict colectomy in this population.},

   abstract = {Elevated colonic luminal serine-protease (Ser-P) activity of diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) patients evokes a proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)-2-mediated colonic hypersensitivity in mice. Despite similarly elevated Ser-P levels in feces, patients with IBD exhibit visceral hypo- or normosensitivity to rectal distension, as opposed to IBS-D. To explain these discrepancies we studied the effect of colonic infusion of fecal supernatants from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients to colorectal mechanical sensitivity of mice and explored the involvement of PAR-4 and its activator Cathepsin-G (Cat-G). Fecal protease activities were assayed in healthy subjects, IBS-D and UC patients in presence or not of antiproteases or Cat-G inhibitor. Following intracolonic infusion of fecal supernatants from healthy subjects, IBS-D and UC patients or PAR-4 activating peptide (PAR-4-AP) or Cat-G, EMG response to colorectal balloon distension was recorded in mice. This nociceptive response was also determined after treatment with pepducin (PAR-4 antagonist) on UC supernatant or after a preincubation with antiproteases or Cat-G inhibitor. In contrast to IBS-D supernatant, UC supernatant promoted colonic hyposensitivity to distension, an effect mimicked by PAR-4-AP or Cat-G. UC supernatant-induced hypoalgesia was inhibited by a cocktail of antiproteases. However, blockade of PAR-4 or Cat-G inhibition resulted in colonic hypersensitivity similar to that observed after IBS-D supernatant infusion. Despite similarly elevated Ser-P activities, IBS-D and UC fecal supernatant display visceral pro- and antinociceptive effects in mice, respectively. Visceral hyposensitivity induced by fecal supernatant from UC patients results from PAR-4 activation by cathepsin-G, counterbalancing the pronociceptive effect of simultaneous PAR-2 activation.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Epigenetic marking such as DNA methylation influence gene transcription and chromosomal stability and may also be affected by environmental exposures. Few studies exist on alteration in DNA methylation profiles (genomic and gene specific methylation) in patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and no studies exist that assess its relationship with lifestyle exposures. RESULTS: The methylation level of both ESR-1 and N-33 genes were significantly higher in UC subjects compared with controls (7.9% vs. 5.9%; p = 0.015 and 66% vs. 9.3%; p < 0.001 respectively). There was no detectable difference in global DNA methylation between patients with UC and age and sex matched controls. No associations between indices of DNA methylation and anthropometric measures or smoking patterns were detected. AIMS & METHODS: To assess genomic methylation and promoter methylation of the ESR-1 (oestrogen receptor-1) and N-33 (tumor suppressor candidate-3) genes in the macroscopically normal mucosa of UC patients as well as to investigate effects of anthropometric and lifestyle exposures on DNA methylation. Sixty eight subjects were recruited (24 UC and 44 age and sex matched controls). Colorectal mucosal biopsies were obtained and DNA was extracted. Genomic DNA methylation was quantified using the tritium-labelled cytosine extension assay (3[H] dCTP) while gene specific methylation was quantified using the COBRA method. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we have shown increased methylation in the promoter regions of the putative tumor suppressor gene N-33 in macroscopically normal mucosa of patients with UC. In addition, we have confirmed that methylation of ESR-1 promoter is higher in UC patients compared with age and sex matched controls. These findings suggest that inactivation through methylation of the putative tumor suppressor genes N-33 and ESR-1 may not be associated with colorectal carcinogenesis in UC.},

In order to improve our understanding of their incidence and impact, we assessed the complications associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) in a population-based study in Medicaid patients. METHODS: We utilized a retrospective cohort design and identified cases of UC and CD using Medi-Cal, the Medicaid program for the State of California. The disease cohort was age- and gender-matched to four controls each and the intestinal and extra-intestinal complications of CD and UC (analyzed separately) were studied over a period of 5 years following the initial diagnosis. RESULTS: For UC, the total number of intestinal complications, per 100 cases, was 92 observed compared to 21 expected; the total number of extra-intestinal complications was 42 observed compared to 30 expected. For CD, the number of intestinal complications was 81 observed compared to 20 expected and for extra-intestinal complications, 37 observed compared to 26 expected (all p < 0.001). For both UC and CD, bleeding was the most frequently seen intestinal complication, while the most common extra-intestinal complication was osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS: IBD is associated with several intestinal and extra-intestinal complications of variable incidence and risk. Success of therapeutic regimens should be measured by decreases in incidence, risks, and costs of these complications, in addition to the usual impact on disease activity.},

A 14-year-old Turkish girl presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and weight loss. UC was diagnosed based on physical examination and laboratory investigations and was confirmed by colonoscopic biopsies. TA developed approximately 1 year later, and was diagnosed with angiography performed for ongoing severe abdominal pain in spite of well-controlled UC. Patients suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases such as UC must be investigated for other inflammatory diseases such as TA, especially if the response to immunosuppressant therapy is unsatisfactory. CONCLUSION: Findings from our patients suggest that paediatricians must remain alert to the possibility of abdominal vasculitis in patients with UC and unresolved abdominal pain in spite of clinical remission.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease is an entity with not wellknown pathogenesis, and important nutritional and metabolic implications because of the high prevalence of malnutrition, the possible implication of dietary factors in its pathogenesis and because of the hypothesis that nutritional intervention could be a primary treatment for the disease. Some nutrients could induce a low antigenic stimuli, regulate inflammatory and immunological responses and stimulate intestinal mucosal trophism. Present available evidence supports enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease as a primary treatment if treatment with steroids is not possible (failure or contraindication) (grade of recommendation A) or either combined treatment with drugs in malnourished patients or those with inflammatory bowel stenosis. In those patients with sustained clinical remission, no benefit of either enteral nutrition or supplements in the absence of nutritional deficits has been shown. Elemental or modified formula (glutamine, omega 3 fatty acids) could not be recommended. In ulcerative colitis, nutritional influence over the activity of the disease has not been shown, although there are some promising results regarding enteric coated W3 fatty acids and a possible role for probiotics. In the treatment and prevention of pouchitis, there could be a role for probiotics (VSL#3). Nutritional treatment should be considered an integral component in the Management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Pneumatosis coli is a relatively rare condition characterized by the presence of gas in the submucosa or subserosa involving mainly the large intestine and, occasionally, the mesenteric attachments. We experienced two cases of pneumatosis coli with ulcerative colitis after colonoscopy that had different clinical courses. Case 1 showed submucosal pneumatosis coli and portal venous air. The air was resolved 30 h later. Case 2 showed subserosal pneumatosis coli and retropneumoperitoneum. The air was eliminated after 3 weeks. The clinical features of pneumatosis coli may depend on the intramural region of the air. Cases 1 and 2 had different air localization, that is, submucosal and subserosal air, and this seems to reflect the differences in the complications. In Case 1 the air expanded to the portal vein, and took only a short time to resolve. In Case 2, however, the air leaked to the retroperitoneal space and took a long time to resolve. In summary, pneumatosis coli as a complication of colonoscopy presented different features depending on the air location. To our knowledge, this is the first report to reveal the difference of air localization and the complications associated with pneumatosis coli after colonoscopy.},

   abstract = {Aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex and probably multifactorial. Nutrition has been proposed to be an important aetiological factor for development of IBD. Several components of the diet (such as sugar, fat, fibre, fruit and vegetable, protein, fast food, preservatives etc.) were examined as possible causative agents for IBD. According to some researchers infant feeding (breast feeding) may also contribute to the development of IBD. Though the importance of environmental factors is evidenced by the increasing incidence in developed countries and in migrant population in recent decades, the aetiology of IBD remained unclear. There are many theories, but as yet no dietary approaches have been proved to reduce the risk of developing IBD. The role of nutrition in the management of IBD is better understood. The prevention and correction of malnutrition, the provision of macro- and micronutrients and vitamins and the promotion of optimal growth and development of children are key points of nutritional therapy. In active disease, the effective support of energy and nutrients is a very important part of the therapy. Natural and artificial nutrition or the combination of two can be chosen for supporting therapy of IBD. The author summarises the aetiological and therapeutic role of nutrition in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The autoimmune phenomena and the autoantibody profile have acquired great importance in ulcerative colitis (UC). Few studies have explored antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) prevalence, but not its association with steroid dependence. We hypothesized that ANAs could be a factor associated to steroid dependence. METHODS: Ninety-seven consecutive patients with UC were included. ANA titers and staining patterns were determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Gender, age, follow-up time, C-reactive protein (CRP), disease extent, Mayo Score Activity Index, extraintestinal manifestations, and steroid dependence were analyzed in univariate and multivariate models. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were included and 49 (50.5%) were females; mean age was 41.7 +/- 22.2 years. Positivity for ANAs was encountered in 52 (53.5%) patients, and none for anti-dsDNA. The prevalence of ANAs was higher in steroid-dependent than in nonsteroid-dependent patients (77.8% versus 48.1%, P = 0.020; odds ratio [OR] = 3.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-12.5), and in those with uveitis (100% versus 51.1%; P = 0.040) or pyoderma gangrenosum (100% versus 51.6%; P = 0.078). No association was observed with gender, age, CRP, disease extent, and Mayo Score Activity Index. The multiple regression analysis model showed an association between steroid dependence and ANAs (P = 0.033, OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.4-14.9). CONCLUSIONS: ANAs are associated with steroid dependence in UC patients. Further studies are required to determine the role of ANAs as serological markers for prediction of steroid dependence in order to perform early therapeutic interventions with biological agents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several antibodies, also called serological markers, are associated with specific forms, disease behavior and phenotype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). AIM: Summarize and analyze the evidence of the utility of serologic markers in IBD, making emphasis on their clinical utility and behavior between populations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Relevant articles were located by computer-assisted search of PubMed (since January 1979 until December 2008). RESULTS: Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and perinuclear Anti-neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (pANCA) are the best studied serological markers. Assessing both ASCA and pANCA allows a better differentiation of Crohn's disease (CD) from ulcerative colitis (UC) than by using the individual tests alone. The ASCA+/pANCA- phenotype is characteristic of CD, while the ASCA-/pANCA+ phenotype is found in UC. The interest on atypical ANCA is growing as it may be a useful tool to distinguish between different IBD forms. Newer markers derived from various microbial species of the gut and glycan markers are of interest as they offer new ways to stratify patients into serologic subgroups. These serological markers may act as prognostic indicators of the severity and behavior of IBD, but more studies are necessary to determine their utility. CONCLUSIONS: There is emerging evidence that combining serological markers may increase the accuracy of diagnosis of a specific form of IBD or its behavior, but the perfect assay or combination of antibodies has not been discovered. They have several limitations, therefore clinicians must be aware of the evidence on serological markers, interpret them with caution and always correlate with the clinical picture.},

   abstract = {Surgery for chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasingly often necessary in children. This study aimed at assessing the results of these operations in order to facilitate adequate preoperative counseling. We reviewed patients treated from 1992 to 2009. The operations, complications and functional outcome were recorded. For those with preserved rectal defecation, continence (Koivusalo score) and quality of life (standardized questionnaire) were assessed in the long term. Eighty five of 192 patients had Crohn disease (CD), 107 of 192 had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 3 of 192 had indeterminate colitis (IC). 12 of 85 CD patients (15%) aged 14 (12-19) years required 13 resections, 1 stricturoplasty, 1 transplantation and 6 other operations including 3 permanent enterostomies for anorectal involvement. Removal of the involved bowel led to significant improvement of nutritional status, growth and quality of life. The transplanted patient had a striking recovery but eventually died 1 year later of unrelated complications. 29 of 107 UC patients (26%) aged 11 (2-15) years required 87 operations. Nine had emergency colectomy for toxic megacolon (3, one death) or severe hemorrhage (6). 28 had restorative proctocolectomy and ileoanostomy (RPCIA) without (16) or with (12) J-pouch under protective ileostomy. Complications were frequent (40%). Permanent ileostomy was required in five children (17%). Twelve months postoperatively, RPCIA patients had 6.5 (2-13) stools/day; all were continent during daytime, and 25% have nocturnal leaks. Mean Koivusalo score (5-12) was 8.8 +/- 2. Quality of life was good in all. All attended normal school and 7 the university, 4 work and 60% of those older than 18 years have sexual partners. Three of 107 children treated as UC with RPCIA had ultimately IC (3%) and were permanently diverted. The nature of IBD involves frustrating surgery. However, it may change life for CD patients and provide a reasonably good quality of life for UC after the first year. Pediatric surgeons should be able to provide adequate preoperative counseling to patients and families.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In severe attacks of ulcerative colitis (UC) treated with intravenous corticosteroids, a fulminant colitis index (FCI) greater or equal to 8 has been associated with a greater likelihood of colectomy (72 vs 16% with an FCI<8). This retrospective study aimed to assess the accuracy of such an association in infliximab-treated patients with moderate-to-severe bouts of UC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was based on the medical files of 43 patients who had received at least one infusion of infliximab to treat moderate-to-severe UC (partial Mayo Clinic score). Remission and clinical response were also assessed using the partial Mayo score. The accuracy of an FCI greater or equal to 8 to predict the likelihood of colectomy was assessed by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, Yule's Q coefficient, Youden's index and statistical significance (Chi(2) test). RESULTS: After treatment with infliximab, 10 patients were in remission (23.3%), 21 (48.8%) had a clinical response, four (9.3%) had treatment failure (without, however, requiring colectomy) and eight (18.6%) had a colectomy. Calculation of the above-mentioned indicators revealed that an FCI greater or equal to 8 was not an indicator of the risk of colectomy in this patient population, and found that only an FCI greater or equal to 16 was statistically significant. However, low values for sensitivity, positive predictive value and Youden's index preclude the clinical application of this latter result. CONCLUSION: In patients treated with infliximab for moderate-to-severe UC attacks, the FCI is not a predictor of colectomy. In such patients, the factors predictive of a response to treatment or likelihood of colectomy, currently acknowledged with corticosteroid treatment, need to be further assessed for infliximab treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal was to compare the predictive values of the Prometheus Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Serology 7 (IBD7) panel (Prometheus Laboratories, San Diego, CA) with the predictive values of routine blood tests in a population of children referred for initial evaluation of suspected IBD. METHODS: Medical records of pediatric patients referred for evaluation of IBD for whom IBD7 testing was performed at Prometheus Laboratories between January 2006 and November 2008 were reviewed. Patients underwent diagnosis by pediatric gastroenterologists on the basis of clinical, radiologic, endoscopic, and pathologic evaluations. RESULTS: A total of 394 records were identified. We excluded 90 records on the basis of age of >21 years, previous diagnosis of IBD, or unclear diagnosis. The prevalence of IBD in this cohort was 38%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and kappa value for the serological panel were 67%, 76%, 63%, 79%, and 42%, respectively, compared with values for a combination of 3 abnormal routine laboratory test results of 72%, 94%, 85%, 79%, and 47%. The antiflagellin antibody assay, the newest assay added to the panel, had sensitivity of 50% and specificity of 53%. Repeat serological testing failed to produce consistent results for 4 of 10 patients. CONCLUSION: Despite its recent inclusion of the antiflagellin assay, the IBD7 panel has lower predictive values than routine laboratory tests in pediatric screening for IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC), developing from dysplastic lesions, is the main long-term complication of pancolitis. The aims of the present study were to assess the risks for neoplasia and advanced neoplasia (AN), respectively, in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients with pancolitis, and to search for protective and risk factors for colorectal neoplasia. METHODS: A total of 855 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with longstanding pancolitis (276 UC, 56 IBD unclassified (IBDu), and 523 CD) had pathological examination of a proctocolectomy specimen (n=255) or multiple biopsy samples from a surveillance colonoscopy (n=600) after median disease duration of 115 months. Risk factors for low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and AN, respectively, were searched for in the whole group of patients and in a case-control comparison after matching for IBD phenotype. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients eventually developed colorectal neoplasia: 14 adenomas, 28 nonadenomatous LGD, and 33 ANs. The 25-year cumulative risks for neoplasia and AN, respectively, were 32.8+/-5.7% and 25.9+/-5.7% in UC and IBDu vs. 12.1+/-2.7% and 3.9+/-2.0% in CD (P<0.0001). In CD, patients with UC-like endoscopic appearance (n=126) had an increased risk for AN compared with those with discrete lesions (at 25 years, 10.6+/-7.2 vs. 1.5+/-0.9%). In the case-control comparison, factors associated with an increased risk of AN were primary sclerosing cholangitis (hazard ratio (HR) 4.72 (1.54-14.52)) and family history of CRC (HR 3.37 (1.02-11.14)), whereas previous segmental colectomy was protective (HR 0.25 (0.07-0.88)). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of AN in longstanding pancolitis is higher in UC or IBDu than in CD. In CD, this risk is significantly increased in patients with UC-like endoscopic lesions. The surveillance program should focus on these latter patients.},

   abstract = {Abdominal pain is a common symptom of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis). Pain may arise from different mechanisms, which can include partial blockage and gut distention as well as severe intestinal inflammation. A majority of patients suffering from acute flares of IBD will experience pain, which will typically improve as disease activity decreases. However, a significant percentage of IBD patients continue experiencing symptoms of pain despite resolving inflammation and achieving what appears to be clinical remission. Current evidence suggests that sensory pathways sensitize during inflammation, leading to persistent changes in afferent neurons and central nervous system pain processing. Such persistent pain is not only a simple result of sensory input. Pain processing and even the activation of sensory pathways is modulated by arousal, emotion, and cognitive factors. Considering the high prevalence of iatrogenic as well as essential neuropsychiatric comorbidities including anxiety and depression in IBD patients, these central modulating factors may significantly contribute to the clinical manifestation of chronic pain. The improved understanding of peripheral and central pain mechanisms is leading to new treatment strategies that view pain as a biopsychosocial problem. Thus, improving the underlying inflammation, decreasing the excitability of sensitized afferent pathways, and altering emotional and/or cognitive functions may be required to more effectively address the difficult and disabling disease manifestations.},

   abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is present in the lumen of the human large intestine at millimolar concentrations. However, the concentration of free (unbound) sulfide is in the micromolar range due to a large capacity of fecal components to bind the sulfide. H(2)S can be produced by the intestinal microbiota from alimentary and endogenous sulfur-containing compounds including amino acids. At excessive concentration, H(2)S is known to severely inhibit cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal oxidase of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and thus mitochondrial oxygen (O(2)) consumption. However, the concept that sulfide is simply a metabolic troublemaker toward colonic epithelial cells has been challenged by the discovery that micromolar concentration of H(2)S is able to increase the cell respiration and to energize mitochondria allowing these cells to detoxify and to recover energy from luminal sulfide. The main product of H(2)S metabolism by the colonic mucosa is thiosulfate. The enzymatic activities involved in sulfide oxidation by the colonic epithelial cells appear to be sulfide quinone oxidoreductase considered as the first and rate-limiting step followed presumably by the action of sulfur dioxygenase and rhodanese. From clinical studies with human volunteers and experimental works with rodents, it appears that H(2)S can exert mostly pro- but also anti-inflammatory effects on the colonic mucosa. From the available data, it is tempting to propose that imbalance between the luminal concentration of free sulfide and the capacity of colonic epithelial cells to metabolize this compound will result in an impairment of the colonic epithelial cell O(2) consumption with consequences on the process of mucosal inflammation. In addition, endogenously produced sulfide is emerging as a prosecretory neuromodulator and as a relaxant agent toward the intestinal contractibility. Lastly, sulfide has been recently described as an agent involved in nociception in the large intestine although, depending on the experimental design, both pro- and anti-nociceptive effects have been reported.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine is considered a safe and effective treatment of severe steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). However, few data are available concerning its safety profile in pregnant women. We report here the experience of 5 GETAID centers. METHODS: In a retrospective study data on patients with severe UC treated with cyclosporine during pregnancy were extracted from medical records of consecutive patients treated between 2001 and 2007. RESULTS: Eight patients (median age 30.5 years old) were identified. At the time of flare-up the median duration of pregnancy was 11.5 weeks of gestation (range 4-25). Seven patients had pancolitis. All patients had more than 3 commonly used clinical and biological severity criteria. Three patients had severe endoscopic lesions and 5 patients had not. All patients received intravenous corticosteroids for at least 7 days before introduction of cyclosporine. Two patients received azathioprine during treatment with cyclosporine. No severe infections or other complications due to treatment were observed. Treatment was effective in 7/8 patients. One patient received infliximab due to cyclosporine therapy failure with a good outcome. No colectomy was performed during pregnancy. Seven pregnancies were conducted to term, but 1 in utero death occurred due to maternal absence of S-protein. Two newborns were premature, including 1 case of hypotrophy. No malformations were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, treatment with cyclosporine for steroid-refractory UC during pregnancy can be considered safe and effective.},

   abstract = {Several substances, including glutamine and propionic acid but in particular butyric acid, have been proposed to be important for colonic health. beta-Glucans lead to the formation of comparatively high amounts of butyric acid, and germinated barley foodstuff obtained from brewer's spent grain (BSG), containing high amounts of beta-glucans and glutamine, has been reported to reduce the inflammatory response in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis. The present study examines how 3 barley products, whole grain barley, malt, and BSG, affect SCFA in the hindgut and serum of rats and whether the addition of Lactobacillus rhamnosus 271 to each of these diets would have further effects. Amino acids in plasma and the cecal composition of the microbiota were also analyzed. The butyric acid concentration in the distal colon and serum was higher in the malt groups than in the other groups as was the serum concentration of propionic acid. The concentrations of propionic and butyric acids were higher in the cecum and serum of rats given L. rhamnosus than in those not given this strain. The proportion of plasma glutamine and the cecal number of bifidobacteria were lower in the malt groups than in the other groups. L. rhamnosus decreased the number of cecal bifidobacteria, whereas plasma glutamine was unaffected. We conclude that malt together with L. rhamnosus 271 had greater effects on propionic and butyric acid concentrations in rats than the other barley products. This is interesting when developing food with effects on colonic health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Mesalamine is a mainstay therapeutic agent in chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) in which condition it reverses crypt architectural changes and reduces colitis-associated cancer (CAC). The present study addressed the possibility that mesalamine reduces beta-catenin-associated progenitor cell activation, Akt-phosphorylated beta-catenin(Ser552) (P-beta-catenin), and colitis-induced dysplasia (CID). METHODS: Effects of mesalamine on P-beta-catenin staining and function were assessed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in biopsy specimens of CUC in mild or "refractory" severe mucosal inflammation. Effects of mesalamine on epithelial proliferation and activation of Akt and beta-catenin were assessed in interleukin (IL)-10(-/-) colitis and CID by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Dysplasia was assessed by counting the number and lengths of lesions per colon. RESULTS: Data from IL-10(-/-) and human colitis samples show that mesalamine reduced Akt activation and P-beta-catenin levels in the middle and upper crypt. Reductions in P-beta-catenin in CUC biopsy specimens with severe inflammation suggested that mesalamine reduced P-beta-catenin levels in tissue refractory to mesalamine's anti-inflammatory effects. In IL-10(-/-) mice, mesalamine reduced CID concordant with inhibition of crypt Akt and beta-catenin signaling. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the model that mesalamine contributes to chemoprevention in CAC by reducing beta-catenin signaling within intestinal progenitors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: we aimed to analyze clinical and inflammatory markers of steroid non-response in patients with moderate/severe ulcerative colitis (UC) at the time of diagnosis. METHODS: this study included patients who were graded as having moderate/severe UC and received corticosteroids as first-line therapy. Demographic, clinical and laboratory findings and pediatric ulcerative colitis activity scores (PUCAS) were recorded. Response to corticosteroids was assessed 30 days after the induction and long-term therapy. RESULTS: twenty-eight children were diagnosed as having moderate/severe UC. Their mean age +/- SD was 1 2.2 +/- 4 years, and 17% were under 5 years of age. PUCAS at their initial admission was 56.9 +/- 11.8. UC was observed at the left colon in 9 patients (32.1%), and pancolitis in 19 (67.9%). At the end of the 30th day, UC was completely remitted in 15 patients (53.5%), partially remitted in 2 (7.1%), and no response in 11 (39.2%). Short-term follow-up showed partial remission in 2 patients, and overall remission with steroid in 17 (60.7%). Non-responders were given second-line treatment; steroid dependency was documented in 2 patients (7.1%) and another 2 (7.1%) patients underwent colectomy. Predictors for steroid non-response were analyzed and only PUCAS at the initial admission was found to be associated with non-response to steroids (51.4 +/- 11.4 vs. 65.4 +/- 6.8, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: approximately half of the pediatric patients had complete response to steroid therapy in a long period. PUCAS could be used as a potential marker of "failed response" to steroid, but should be supported with a number of prospective randomized controlled studies.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and 2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89 months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive, multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab, thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.},

Only two environmental factors have an established role in IBD. Smoking is a risk factor for CD and a protective factor for UC; appendectomy is a protective factor for UC. Many other environmental factors for IBD have been investigated. These are infectious agents, diet, drugs, stress and socio-economic factors. They are detailed in this paper. Among them, adherent invasive E. coli, infectious gastroenteritis, oral contraceptives and antibiotics could play a role in CD. To date, three theories integrate environmental factors to pathogenesis of IBD: hygiene, infection and cold chain. Much work remains to be done to identify risk factors for IBD. As exemplified by smoking, research of environmental risk factors of IBD is useful since it may lead to an improved disease course among patients and perhaps, to appropriate prevention among predisposed subjects. Further studies in this field are eagerly awaited.},

For instance, patients with Crohn's Disease (CD) or Ulcerative Colitis (UC) have a 12-20% increased risk for developing CRC. Preventive strategies utilizing nontoxic natural compounds that modulate immune responses could be successful in the suppression of inflammation-driven colorectal cancer in high-risk groups. The increase of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) expression and its transcriptional activity has been identified as a target for anti-inflammatory efforts, and the suppression of inflammation-driven colon cancer. PPARgamma down-modulates inflammation and elicits antiproliferative and proapoptotic actions in epithelial cells. All of which may decrease the risk for inflammation-induced CRC. This review will focus on the use of orally active, naturally occurring chemopreventive approaches against inflammation-induced CRC that target PPARgamma and therefore down-modulate inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The National UK IBD audit tool is an electronic database created to improve the quality and safety of care for IBD patients by auditing individual patient care, service resources and organisation against national standards. We used the National UK IBD audit tool to compare the organisation and process of IBD care between services in Oxford (UK) and Milan (Italy), as a pilot study to evaluate its application outside national boundaries. METHODS: Clinical and demographic data of patients with CD and UC, consecutively admitted during a 2month period, were collected and compared between the centres, to each other and to the UK IBD standards obtained by previous audit analyses performed in Oxford in 2006. RESULTS: 20 and 26 patients with UC were admitted in Oxford and Milan, as well as 21 and 20 patients with CD, respectively. Most admissions in Milan were planned admissions for moderately active treatment-refractory disease. No patient died. Oxford had a higher surgery rate. Endoscopy for UC consisted mainly of colonoscopy in Milan (92%) and flexible sigmoidoscopy in Oxford (64%). In CD, Oxford data revealed a higher use of immununomodulators and CT scan, compared with higher use of bowel ultrasound in Milan. CRP was the preferred biomarker of disease activity. The following areas did not reach the standards set for the 2006 UK IBD Audit: the lack in Milan of IBD specialist nurses and few dietitian visits, as well as little attention to heparin prophylaxis and abdominal radiography in UC. Both sites paid little attention to stool cultures and revealed a high rate of active smokers in CD and little attention to bone protection in steroids users. Since the 2006 audit in Oxford, improvements include IBD specialist nurse visits, dietitian visits, number of active smokers, stool samples, prophylactic heparin, bone protection and nutritional assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent procedural differences between Oxford and Milan identified by audits of both UC and CD could be resolved by organisational change, with an improvement in the service. The UK IBD audit tool is an easy instrument to assess the processes and outcomes of care delivery in IBD and can be applied also outside UK.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Enterohepatic Helicobacter species (EHS) have previously been found in adults with hepatobiliary diseases. Here, we report the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori and EHS in liver and gastric tissue in children and adolescents with chronic liver disease (CLD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-seven consecutive children and adolescents with CLD with or without ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease (UC/CD) were investigated. Tissue samples were analysed using a Helicobacter genus-specific 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and DNA-sequence analysis. Sera from 61 subjects were also analysed using enzyme immunoassay and immunoblotting. RESULTS: The Helicobacter PCR was positive in 3/23 (13%) livers from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and UC, and in 1/2 livers from patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and UC. Sequenced PCR products matched the 16S rDNA of H. hepaticus, H. muridarum, H. canis, and H. pylori, respectively. H. ganmani and H. bilis were detected in gastric tissues from two AIH patients. H. hepaticus and H. pullorum were found in livers from two patients with acute liver failure and intrahepatic cholestasis. Antibody reactivity to Helicobacter cell-surface proteins was negative. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori and EHS can be detected in the livers of some patients with UC and concomitant liver disease, as well as in other children with liver diseases. Multicentre studies from different locations are needed to find out whether these bacteria play a pathogenetic role or whether their presence is an epiphenomenon.},

   abstract = {In order to increase dietary folic acid intake and to improve nutritional status regarding folate by controlling homocysteine concentrations, ten patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease in the colon and ulcerative colitis) received individualized nutritional guidance and were followed up as outpatients for 2 months. The following procedures were performed at the beginning of the study (T0), after 1 month (T1) and at the end of the study (T2): collection of anthropometric data (weight and height), dietary data (24 h diet recall), and blood under fasting condition for the determination of serum folic acid, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and vitamin B12. Plasma folic acid deficiency was not detected but hyperhomocysteinemia was present in six individuals and C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased (>0.5 mg/dl) in seven patients. After the patients were instructed there was a significant increase in vitamin B6 intake (about 35%) and in folate intake (49.6%). Mean plasma levels of folic acid, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 did not change, but there was a significant decrease of CRP at T1, 0.36 mg dl(-1) on average (P = 0.01), which was maintained at T2. We conclude that the increased folate intake reported by this group of patients was not reflected in improved serum concentrations of folic acid and homocysteine. However, the guidelines for the patients probably induced them to choose a more adequate diet, providing nutrients that help control the inflammatory process.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are corticosteroid-dependent or -refractory are at higher risk of developing disease- and treatment-related complications. AIMS: To identify retrospectively clinical factors present at diagnosis that predict the occurrence of corticosteroid dependency and refractoriness in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. METHODS: A total of 310 IBD patients (134 CD, 176 UC) were observed for 2140 person years and their use of systemic corticosteroids was determined. Outcomes of corticosteroid dependency and refractoriness were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the clinical factors associated with outcomes. RESULTS: Seventy-seven (57.5%) CD and 95 (54.0%) UC patients had received corticosteroids during study period. In CD, thrombocytosis [Hazard ratio (HR):3.0] predicted, whereas colonic CD (HR:0.3) negatively predicted corticosteroid dependency. Stricturing phenotype (HR:4.5) predicted corticosteroid-refractory CD. For UC, thrombocytosis (HR:3.9) and extensive colitis (HR:1.7) predicted corticosteroid dependency. Presence of anaemia (HR:10.8) at diagnosis and initial requirement of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (HR:18.8) predicted corticosteroid-refractory UC. The cumulative risks of surgery were 17.8% and 5.4% for CD and UC patients respectively at 1 year after starting corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytosis at diagnosis predicted corticosteroid-dependency in IBD. Stricturing phenotype of CD and the presence of anaemia in UC predicted subsequent course of corticosteroid refractoriness.},

   abstract = {The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is multifactorial and involves interactions of gut luminal content with mucosal barrier and especially immune cells. Malnutrition is a frequent issue during IBD flares, especially in Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and nutritional support is frequently used to treat malnutrition but also in an attempt to modulate intestinal inflammation. The use of oral or enteral nutrition intervention in IBDs may be effective, alone or in combination with drugs, to achieve and maintain remission. However, standard diets are less effective than new-generation biotherapies and could be improved by supplementation with specific immunomodulatory amino acids. Experimental studies evaluating glutamine, the preferential substrate for enterocytes, are promising. Some clinical studies with oral glutamine in CD are until now disappointing, but new formulations and targeting could enhance glutamine efficacy at the site of mucosal lesions. The role of arginine, involved in nitric oxide and polyamines synthesis, still remains debated. However, the effects of these amino acids in IBD have been poorly documented in humans. Other candidates like glycine, cysteine, histidine, or taurine should also be evaluated in the future.},

   abstract = {Dysregulation of intestinal epithelial cell performance is associated with an array of pathologies whose onset mechanisms are incompletely understood. While whole-genomics approaches have been valuable for studying the molecular basis of several intestinal diseases, a thorough analysis of gene expression along the healthy gastrointestinal tract is still lacking. The aim of this study was to map gene expression in gastrointestinal regions of healthy human adults and to implement a procedure for microarray data analysis that would allow its use as a reference when screening for pathological deviations. We analyzed the gene expression signature of antrum, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and transverse colon biopsies using a biostatistical method based on a multivariate and univariate approach to identify region-selective genes. One hundred sixty-six genes were found responsible for distinguishing the five regions considered. Nineteen had never been described in the GI tract, including a semaphorin probably implicated in pathogen invasion and six novel genes. Moreover, by crossing these genes with those retrieved from an existing data set of gene expression in the intestine of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients, we identified genes that might be biomarkers of Crohn's and/or ulcerative colitis in ileum and/or colon. These include CLCA4 and SLC26A2, both implicated in ion transport. This study furnishes the first map of gene expression along the healthy human gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, the approach implemented here, and validated by retrieving known gene profiles, allowed the identification of promising new leads in both healthy and disease states.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are chronic disabling lifelong diseases which may be disturbed by severe flares and anatomical complications requiring surgery. Until the very last years there was no clear indication that treatment was able to modify the long-term natural history of the disease. In particular, there are no data demonstrating a clear improvement through the period 1950-2003 in disease activity, occurrence of complications and need for surgery, in spite of an increased use of immunosuppressants since the 1990s. However, in inflammatory bowel disease, both thiopurines and methotrexate are very efficient in about one half of the patients, and in responders, may heal the mucosa and decrease the need for surgery. The early use of immunosuppressants in selected patients may have an impact on occurrence of severe flares and complications, and need for surgery. Moreover, anti-TNF now used for 10 years in Crohn's disease and for 5 years in ulcerative colitis demonstrated in two thirds of the patients a remarkable anatomic effect, healing the mucosa, closing fistulae and preventing strictures. Infliximab does prevent endoscopic recurrence following ileal resection for Crohn's disease. Actually, because irreversible anatomical damage may develop during the first years of disease, there is a need to classify early in the course of the disease patients who will benefit from anti-TNF and classical immunosuppressants, respectively. There is the need in the next few years to better define these subgroups and to compare different strategies within each group through randomized interventional studies.},

   abstract = {Current smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease and worsens its course, increasing the need for steroids, immunosuppressants, and re-operations. On the contrary, smoking protects against ulcerative colitis and after disease onset improves its course, decreasing the need for colectomy. Smoking cessation improves Crohn's disease and worsens ulcerative colitis. Achieving smoking cessation in Crohn's disease is thus an important goal of therapy, whereas patients with ulcerative colitis should not be discouraged to quit, because the beneficial effect of smoking for their disease is counterbalanced by the deleterious respiratory and cardiovascular effects of tobacco. Physical activity improves quality of life without detrimental effect on disease activity, and may contribute to increase muscle mass and to prevent osteoporosis. Regarding nutrition, a Western diet may be associated with an increased risk of IBD, and a case-control study revealed an increased consumption of linoleic acid before diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Liquid diets may improve Crohn's disease flares and decrease the need for steroids; however, there are no defined diets able to improve the disease course, and in Crohn's disease, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids did not show a significant benefit. Obesity is becoming more prevalent in IBD and may be associated with higher disease activity. In total, adhering to four simple lifestyle factors - never smoking, physical activity, prudent diet and body mass index <25 - may have a strong impact both on the prevention of major chronic diseases and on the course of IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are lifelong inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases starting in about one third of patients during childhood. Treatment strategies aim to control this chronic inflammatory process. Owing to recent advances in the understanding of IBD, immunosuppressive agents (mainly against TNFalpha directed) as well as biological drugs are more and more often used. This therapeutic approach clearly improved the clinical condition of the majority of patients with IBD. However, with this more aggressive treatment strategy, safety concerns clearly arise. Recently, the description of a series of a particularly severe form of T cell lymphoma in pediatric and young adult patients with IBD under immunomodulator and biological combination therapy raised the question of the risks of treatment-induced side effects or complications. As reviewed in the present article, there is a slightly increased risk of not only lymphoma development in IBD patients, potentially related to the inflammatory process, but also to the use of immunosuppressive therapies. On the basis of the literature data, were analyzed current treatment strategies for children with moderate-to-severe IBD, who are candidates to receive immunomodulator and/or biological agents potentially accelerating the risk of lymphoma development. Comparative clinical studies in IBD are still missing; however, it is prudent to think about adapting immunosuppressive therapies to the inflammatory process of the underlying disorder and if possible to reduce them to monotherapy. Alternative treatment strategies for heavy immunosuppression exist (eg, enteral nutrition in Crohn disease or colectomy in patients with ulcerative colitis) and should be considered whenever appropriate. There is a major need for comparative studies before evidence-based guidelines can be established for safest and best treatment strategies of pediatric patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cathepsin G (Cat-G) is a neutrophil serine-protease found in the colonic lumen of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Cat-G is able to activate protease-activated receptor-4 (PAR(4) ) located at the apical side of enterocytes, leading to epithelial barrier disruption. However, the mechanisms through which Cat-G triggers inflammation are not fully elucidated. The aims of our study were to evaluate in vivo the effects of UC fecal supernatants and Cat-G on epithelial barrier function and inflammation, and the connection between these two parameters. METHODS: Male balb/c mice were used in this study. We evaluated the effect of a 2-hour intracolonic infusion of 1) fecal supernatants from UC patients pretreated or not with specific Cat-G inhibitor (SCGI); 2) PAR(4) -activating peptide (PAR(4) -AP); and 3) Cat-G on colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and paracellular permeability (CPP). The involvement of PAR(4) was assessed by pretreating animals with pepducin P4pal-10, which blocks PAR(4) signaling. We investigated the role of myosin light chain (MLC) kinase by using its inhibitor, ML-7, and we determined phosphorylated MLC (pMLC) levels in mice colonic mucosa. RESULTS: UC fecal supernatants, Cat-G, and PAR(4) agonist increased both CPP and MPO activity in comparison with healthy subjects fecal supernatants. ML-7 inhibited the CPP increase triggered by Cat-G by 92.3%, and the enhanced MPO activity by 43.8%. Intracolonic infusion of UC fecal supernatant determined an increased phosphorylation level of MLC. CONCLUSIONS: These observations support that luminal factors such as Cat-G play an important proinflammatory role in the pathogenesis of colitis, mainly depending on CPP increase by MLC phosphorylation.},

   abstract = {Impairment of the colonic epithelial barrier and neutrophil infiltration are common features of inflammatory bowel disease. Luminal proteases affect colonic permeability through protease-activated receptors (PARs). We evaluated: (i) whether fecal supernatants from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) trigger alterations of colonic paracellular permeability and inflammation, and (ii) the roles of cathepsin G (Cat-G), a neutrophil serine protease, and its selective receptor, PAR(4), in these processes. Expression levels of both PAR(4) and Cat-G were determined in colonic biopsies from UC and healthy subjects. The effects of UC fecal supernatants on colonic paracellular permeability were measured in murine colonic strips. Involvement of Cat-G and PAR(4) was evaluated using pepducin P4pal-10 and specific Cat-G inhibitor (SCGI), respectively. In addition, the effect of PAR(4)-activating peptide was assessed. UC fecal supernatants, either untreated or pretreated with SCGI, were infused into mice, and myeloperoxidase activity was determined. PAR(4) was found to be overexpressed in UC colonic biopsies. Increased colonic paracellular permeability that was triggered by UC fecal supernatants was blocked by both SCGI (77%) and P4pal-10 (85%). Intracolonic infusion of UC fecal supernatants into mice increased myeloperoxidase activity. This effect was abolished by SCGI. These observations support that both Cat-G and PAR(4) play key roles in generating and/or amplifying relapses in UC and provide a rationale for the development of new therapeutic agents in the treatment of this disease.},

This is a chronic and relapsing condition of unknown aetiology that comprises chiefly ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Although there are treatments for IBD, they have frequent side effects and they are not always effective; therefore there is a need for new therapies that could alleviate this condition. Two bioactive peptides present in milk (transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and casein macropeptide, also named glycomacropeptide) have been shown to have intestinal anti-inflammatory activities. In fact, TGF-beta is currently added to formulas intended for patients with IBD, and several studies indicate that these formulas could induce clinical remission. In this paper, evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory effect of TGF-beta and bovine glycomacropeptide, as well as their mechanisms of action, is reviewed, focusing on the evidence obtained in animal models.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Healthy colonic mucosa uses butyrate as the major energy source. In ulcerative colitis (UC) butyrate oxidation has been shown to be disturbed, but it remains unclear whether this is a primary defect. The aim of this study was to measure mucosal butyrate oxidation in UC (involved and noninvolved colon) and in pouchitis and to study the relationship with endoscopic as well as histological disease activity. METHODS: Butyrate oxidation was measured in 73 UC patients, 22 pouchitis patients, and 112 controls (95 colon, 17 ileum) by incubating biopsies with 1 mM 14C-labeled Na-butyrate and measuring the released 14CO2. RESULTS: Compared with that in normal colon, butyrate oxidation was significantly impaired in endoscopically active but not in quiescent disease or uninvolved colon segments. The severity of the metabolic defect was related to histological disease activity and decreased epithelial cell height. In active pouchitis, butyrate oxidation was significantly decreased compared with that in normal ileum and excluded pouches without inflammation. The histological pouchitis score correlated significantly with butyrate oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: Active UC and pouchitis show the same inflammation-related metabolic defect. Our data suggest that the defect is a consequence of inflammation and that pouchitis is metabolically similar to active UC.},

There is evidence to support the use of probiotics in necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants and pouchitis. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics seem to ameliorate atopic diseases, in particular atopic dermatitis. The efficacy of probiotics has been shown comparable to Mesalazine regarding the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. In addition there is evidence that probiotics are useful in the prevention of pouchitis or in therapy of irritable bowel syndrome. Recent data indicate that commensals and probiotics could play a role in nutrient fermentation and energy metabolism and may be helpful in the prevention and therapy of obesity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC) is produced by Brassica food plants. PEO is a PEITC Essential Oil containing >95% natural PEITC. PEITC is known to produce various health benefits but its effect in alleviation of ulcerative colitis signs is unknown. RESULTS: In two efficacy studies (acute and chronic) oral administration of PEO was effective at remitting acute and chronic signs of ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. Disease activity, histology and biochemical characteristics were measured in the treated animals and were compared with appropriate controls. PEO treatment significantly improved body weights and stool consistency as well as decreased intestinal bleeding. PEO treatment also reduced mucosal inflammation, depletion of goblet cells and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Attenuation of proinflammatory interleukin1beta production was observed in the colons of PEO-treated animals. Expression analyses were also carried out for immune function related genes, transcription factors and cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-activated mouse macrophage cells. PEO likely affects an intricate network of immune signaling genes including a novel concentration dependent reduction of total cellular Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) as well as nuclear phosphorylated-STAT1 (activated form of STAT1). A PEO-concentration dependent decrease of mRNA of C-X-C motif ligand 10 (a STAT1 responsive chemokine) and Interleukin 6 were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: PEO might be a promising candidate to develop as a treatment for ulcerative colitis patients. The disease attenuation by PEO is likely associated with suppression of activation of STAT1 transcription and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although it is known that extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) commonly occur in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), little research has examined rates of EIMs and their relation to other disease-related factors in this population. The purpose of this study was to determine the rates of EIMs in pediatric IBD and examine correlations with age, sex, diagnosis, disease severity, and distribution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were prospectively collected as part of the Pediatric IBD Collaborative Research Group Registry, an observational database enrolling newly diagnosed IBD patients <16 years old since 2002. Rates of EIM (occurring anytime during the period of enrollment) and the aforementioned variables (at baseline) were examined. Patients with indeterminate colitis were excluded from the analysis given the relatively small number of patients. RESULTS: One thousand nine patients were enrolled (mean age 11.6 +/- 3.1 years, 57.5% boys, mean follow-up 26.2 +/- 18.2 months). Two hundred eighty-five (28.2%) patients experienced 1 or more EIMs. Eighty-seven percent of EIM occurred within the first year. Increased disease severity at baseline (mild vs moderate/severe) was associated with the occurrence of any EIM (P < 0.001), arthralgia (P = 0.024), aphthous stomatitis (P = 0.001), and erythema nodosum (P = 0.009) for both Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) during the period of follow-up. Statistically significant differences in the rates of EIMs between CD and UC were seen for aphthous stomatitis, erythema nodosum, and sclerosing cholangitis. CONCLUSIONS: EIMs as defined in this study occur in approximately one quarter of pediatric patients with IBD. Disease type and disease severity were commonly associated with the occurrence of EIMs.},

   abstract = {The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) is highest during the peak reproductive years, hence the increased concern with the safety of IBD drugs during pregnancy. Over the past 11 years, anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy has emerged as a treatment approach for refractory IBD patients who have failed to achieve or maintain remission with corticosteroids and immunomodulator agents. The TNF-alpha inhibitors (anti-TNFs; infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol) have proven successful in inducing and maintaining remission of moderate-to-severe IBD, but recommendations for the use of these compounds during pregnancy have lacked consensus. Balanced against the potential risk of these drugs on the fetus is the well-established fact that high disease activity has been found to poorly affect pregnancy outcomes in IBD, and the potential use of anti-TNF agents may control disease flare and severity during pregnancy. Concerns regarding the effect of anti-TNFs on the pregnancy and fetus have been assuaged by registry data which has demonstrated an overall positive safety record. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization categorize anti-TNF agents as safe during pregnancy. New knowledge regarding the physiologic timing of placental transfer of therapeutic antibody subclasses and pegylated antibody fragments from the mother into the fetus has also helped to allay concerns. This review will examine the present state of knowledge regarding the use of anti-TNFs in pregnant women with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The composition of the fecal mircoflora and its changes on ageing have rarely been investigated in large samples of both patients and volunteers. METHODS: We analysed the fecal flora by conventional microbiological testing (Kyberstatus, Institute of Microecology, Herborn, Germany) of stool samples from 35 292 adults (age: 46.3 +/- 0.08 [18 to 96] years, 9564 males, 24 784 females; remaining = missing data) with different intestinal and non-intestinal diagnoses for total colony-forming units (CFU) (per g stool) as well as relative abundance of Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides spp., Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and Lactobacillus spp. with respect to age, gender, and clinical data available (e. g., stool consistency and pH). RESULTS: The total CFU was stable and showed no age- or gender-related changes. Individual bacterial species constantly and significantly increased with age (E. coli, Enterococci spp.), or decreased at higher age (Bacteroides spp.), or were stable throughout the life span (Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria). Gastrointestinal diagnoses (Crohn's disease, n = 198; ulcerative colitis, n = 515; irritable bowel syndrome, n = 7765; other GI diagnoses, n = 10 478) tended to exhibit some specificity of the bacterial profile, and when GI diagnoses were excluded, the age-related bacterial profile of the remaining group (n = 15 619, m:f = 4197:11 422) was not different. CONCLUSION: Conventional microbiological investigations of the fecal microbiota showed both bacteria-specific as well as a general pattern of ageing of the colonic microbiota, with the last decades (more than 60 years) demonstrating the most profound changes. It remains to be shown whether these changes reflect direct changes of the gut microbiota, the mucosal innate immunity, or indirect consequences of age-related altered nutrition.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed in patients who have undergone colectomy. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2006, colectomy was performed in 212 patients, 37 of whom were diagnosed preoperatively with UC. The mean ages at diagnosis and at colectomy were 10.6+/-4.3 years and 13.7+/-3.7 years, respectively. Inflammatory bowel disease serology at diagnosis in 29 patients showed that 26 (90%) were pANCA+. Serology was negative in 3. Ten (27%) had nonspecific inflammation of the upper digestive tract. Radiographs in 25 patients indicated no abnormalities in the small intestine. Before colectomy, patients (n=35) were treated with corticosteroid (97%), 5-ASA (69%), immunomodulator (66%), infliximab (29%), and cyclosporin (11%). The mean postoperative follow-up was 2.6+/-2 years. Six patients (16%) were found to have CD. All 6 patients were pANCA+ with elevated anti-OmpC (n=4), ASCA immunoglobulin A (n=2), and ASCA immunoglobulin G (n=1). The CD group had higher mean anti-OmpC compared with the UC group, 16.9+/-5.2 and 6.2+/-3.4, respectively (P<0.005). Weight z score at time of surgery was lower in the CD group (-1.38+/-0.79) than in the UC group (0.29+/-0.24), P<0.05. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of CD remains in a small fraction of patients who undergo colectomy for medically refractory UC. A lower weight and a higher anti-OmpC titer may be predictive of CD.},

   abstract = {Inflammation is a necessary part of the immune response. However, when inflammation persists, the resultant state of chronic inflammation may have a number of secondary consequences associated with increased risk of chronic disease. Among these is an increased rate of mutation. There is evidence to suggest that the accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species may be a causal factor in chronic inflammation. These reactive species are also produced through the oxidative burst associated with the inflammatory process, and may interact with various cellular components including proteins, lipids and, most important for mutagenesis, nucleic acids. DNA strand breaks are commonly produced, leading to chromosomal mutation. Oxidized bases, abasic sites, DNA-DNA intrastrand adducts, and DNA-protein cross-links also occur. Not only do the nucleic acid products act directly as pro-mutagenic lesions, lipid peroxidation products may also lead to secondary DNA damage, including pro-mutagenic exocyclic DNA adducts. While frameshift and chromosomal mutations have been associated with chronic inflammation, much of the evidence reveals base pair substitution mutations associated with polymerase stalling near the lesions, and base pair mis-incorporation. There are also indirect effects of ROS/RNS through inhibition of DNA repair enzymes and/or effects on metabolic activation of known carcinogens. Certain disease states, including the Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are associated with enhanced levels of chronic inflammation, and show evidence of enhanced levels of genetic damage in the colonic mucosa. Mutations may provide at least part of the cause of enhanced susceptibility to chronic diseases associated with chronic inflammation.},

   abstract = {The field of nutrigenomics recognizes gene-diet interactions, with regard to both the impact of genetic variation on nutrient requirements, and conversely nutrient regulation of the expression of genes. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory bowel diseases for which twin studies reveal genetic susceptibility that is impacted by diet and environment. Apparently contradictory data on the role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease would be entirely explainable if genetic variability determined dietary requirements and intolerances. Considering Crohn's disease, we recognize three major classes of genes. The first of these involves bacterial recognition through pattern recognition receptors and autophagy genes, while the second act through secondary immune response, and the third concern epithelial barrier integrity. Despite genetic overlap with CD, the first two groups of genes appear to be less important in ulcerative colitis, while other genes, particularly those involved in barrier function, gain prominence. Case-control studies suggest that these different genetic groups reflect distinct dietary requirements. Such studies suggest nutrigenomic approaches to maintaining disease remission at present, and preventing disease development in the future.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) comprising Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions with polygenic susceptibility. Interactions between TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha receptor play a fundamental role in inflammatory response. This study investigates the role that selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the TNF-alpha receptor (TNSFRSF1B) gene play in the risk of IBD in a New Zealand Caucasian population. DNA samples from 388 CD, 405 UC, 27 indeterminate colitis patients, and 293 randomly selected controls, from Canterbury, New Zealand were screened for 3 common SNPs in TNSFRSF1B: rs1061622 (c.676T > C), rs1061624 (c.*1663A > G), and rs3397 (c.*1690T > C), using TaqMan technologies. Carrying the rs1061624 variant decreased the risk of UC in the left colon (OR 0.73, 95% CI = 0.54-1.00) and of being a smoker at diagnosis (OR 0.62; 95% CI = 0.40-0.96). Carrying the rs3397 variant decreased the risk of penetrating CD (OR 0.62, 95% CI = 0.40-0.95). Three marker haplotype analyses revealed highly significant differences between CD patients and control subjects (chi(2) = 29.9, df = 7, P = .0001) and UC cases and controls (chi(2) = 46.3, df = 7, P < .0001). We conclude that carrying a 3-marker haplotype in the TNSFRSF1B gene may increase (e.g., haplotype of GGC was 2.9-fold more in the CD or UCpatients) or decrease (e.g., TGT was 0.47-fold less in UC patients) the risk of IBD in a New Zealand Caucasian population.},

   abstract = {The Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are debilitating conditions, characterised by lifelong sensitivity to certain foods, and often a need for surgery and life-long medication. The anti-inflammatory effects of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated acids justify their inclusion in enteral nutrition formulas that have been associated with disease remission. However, there have been variable data in clinical trials to test supplementary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in inducing or maintaining remission in these diseases. Although variability in trial design has been suggested as a major factor, we suggest that variability in processing and presentation of the products may be equally or more important. The nature of the source, and rapidity of getting the fish or other food source to processing or to market, will affect the percentage of the various fatty acids, possible presence of heavy metal contaminants and oxidation status of the various fatty acids. For dietary supplements or fortified foods, whether the product is encapsulated or not, whether storage is under nitrogen or not, and length of time between harvest, processing and marketing will again profoundly affect the properties of the final product. Clinical trials to test efficacy of these products in IBD to date have utilised the relevant skills of pharmacology and gastroenterology. We suggest that knowledge from food science, nutrition and engineering will be essential to establish the true role of this important group of compounds in these diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been reported that pro-inflammatory cytokines levels like IL-6 and TNF-alpha can determine the degree of inflammation of ulcerative colitis (UC). AIMS: To measure the gene expression of IL-6 and TNF-a in patients with UC and controls and to correlate with histological activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 36 patients with UC, 13 healthy controls and 11 with inflammation. After total ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction, complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and relative expression was determined through real-time PCR for IL-6 and TNF-a. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman correlation. RESULTS: The expression of IL-6 increases in patients with active UC compared to controls (p = 0.004) as well as UC patients in remission (p = 0.014). There was no significant difference between patients with active UC and controls with inflammation. (p = 0.446). Gene expression of TNF-alpha was higher in biopsies from patients with UC activity compred with control subjects (p = 0.004), as well as those in remission (p = 0.001). The expression of IL-6 correlated significantly (p = 0.02) with histological activity. CONCLUSIONS: The gene expression of IL-6 and TNF-alpha is increased in active UC. Interleukin 6 is better marker of bowel inflammation because its expression correlates with histological activity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Studies suggest that synbiotic therapy could prove more effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) than therapies limited to probiotics or prebiotics. This study compared the effect of each of these therapies in the treatment of UC. METHODS: One hundred twenty outpatients with UC were randomly sorted into three groups of 40 patients each for probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic therapy. The probiotic group ingested one daily capsule consisting of Bifidobacterium longum 2 x 10(9) colony-forming units and the prebiotic group ingested daily 8.0-g doses of psyllium. The synbiotic group underwent both treatments. All patients completed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaires (IBDQs) at the onset of the trial, at the 2-wk midpoint, and at the 4-wk end of the trial. Blood variables were also evaluated in a subset of 32 patients randomly selected from all groups and values were compared with IBDQ scores. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients in the probiotic group, 31 in the prebiotic group, and 32 in the synbiotic group qualified for analyses. The remaining 26 patients had incomplete questionnaires. Total IBDQ scores improved within groups by the end of the trial (probiotics 162 to 169, NS; prebiotics 174 to 182, NS; synbiotics 168 to 176, P = 0.03). Individual scores improved as follows: probiotics, emotional function (P = 0.03); prebiotics, bowel function (P = 0.04); and synbiotics, systemic and social functions (P = 0.008 and P = 0.02). C-reactive protein decreased significantly only with synbiotic therapy (from 0.59 to 0.14 mg/dL, P = 0.04). There were no adverse events. CONCLUSION: Patients with UC on synbiotic therapy experienced greater quality-of-life changes than patients on probiotic or prebiotic treatment. These data suggest that synbiotic therapy may have a synergistic effect in the treatment of UC.},

METHODS: Sixty-one adolescents (mean age 15 years, SD+/-4.13) were included in the study. Intestinal biopsies from inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa of IBD patients and from controls with functional abdominal pain were cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The number of microbes belonging to the same group was calculated per weight of collected tissue. The mucus thickness in frozen samples was measured under a fluorescent microscope. RESULTS: The ratios of different bacterial groups in inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa of IBD patients and controls were specific for particular diseases. Streptococcus spp. were predominant in the inflamed mucosa of Crohn's disease (CD) patients (80% of all bacteria), and Lactobacillus spp. were predominant in ulcerative colitis patients (90%). The differences were statistically significant (P=0.01-0.001). Lower number of bifidobacteria was observed in the whole IBD group. A relation was also found between clinical and endoscopic severity and decreased numbers of Lactobacillus and, to a lesser extent, of Streptococcus in biopsies from CD patients. The mucus layer in the inflamed sites was significantly thinner as compared to controls (P=0.0033) and to non-inflamed areas in IBD patients (P=0.031). CONCLUSION: The significantly thinner mucosa of IBD patients showed a predominance of some aerobes specific for particular diseases, their numbers decreased in relation to higher clinical and endoscopic activity of the disease.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) affect bone metabolism and are frequently associated with the presence of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. Although several mechanisms may contribute to skeletal abnormalities in IBD patients, inflammation and inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 may be the most critical. It is not clear whether the changes in bone metabolism leading to decreased mineral density are the result of decreased bone formation, increased bone resorption, or both, with varying results reported in experimental models of IBD and in pediatric and adult IBD patients. New data, including our own, challenge the conventional views, and contributes to the unraveling of an increasingly complex network of interactions leading to the inflammation-associated bone loss. Since nutritional interventions (dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation) are of limited efficacy in IBD patients, understanding the pathophysiology of osteopenia and osteoporosis in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is critical for the correct choice of available treatments or the development of new targeted therapies. In this review, we discuss current concepts explaining the effects of inflammation, inflammatory mediators and their signaling effectors on calcium and phosphate homeostasis, osteoblast and osteoclast function, and the potential limitations of vitamin D used as an immunomodulator and anabolic hormone in IBD.},

   abstract = {Growth impairment and associated pubertal delay are common complications of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn's disease (CD). Chronic undernutrition (related primarily to inadequate intake) and pro-inflammatory cytokines are the two major and interrelated contributory factors. Pathogenic mechanisms include interference with growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis, with gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion patterns, and direct cytokine effects on growing bone. Chronic corticosteroid therapy compounds disease-related causes of growth impairment. The influence on growth of polymorphisms in IBD susceptibility or modifier genes is under study. Accurate recognition of impaired growth requires appreciation of normal growth. Pre-illness standard deviation scores (SDS) for height should be obtained and compared with height SDS at diagnosis, so that the impact of disease on growth can be fully appreciated. The greater the deficit prior to recognition of IBD, the greater is the demand for catch-up growth. Height velocity should be regularly monitored and its adequacy for age and pubertal stage assessed. Restoration and maintenance of pre-illness growth pattern indicate success of therapy. Current treatment regimens limit use of corticosteroids, via optimization of immunomodulatory drugs, use of enteral nutrition in CD, and, if necessary, surgery for ulcerative colitis and for intestinal complications of localized CD. Biologic agents with the potential for mucosal healing hold promise of growth enhancement even among children, whose growth with previously available therapies remained compromised. For all therapies, there is a window of opportunity to achieve normal growth before puberty is too advanced.},

In fact, the experimental basis to expect clinical efficacy of probiotics in IBD is quite robust. In spite of this however, only minimal evidence of benefit by any probiotic is currently available in Crohn's disease, either in adult or in pediatric populations. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, several probiotic formulations and especially the proprietary preparation VSL#3 (a high-concentration mixture) have been found effective as adjuvant therapy, both in inducing and maintaining remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It has yet to be established whether the manifestations of IBD are similar in paediatric and adult ages. The objective of this study was to compare the phenotypic expression of the disease between patients with childhood-onset IBD and adulthood-onset cases, all afferent to the same clinical centre. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Descriptive and multivariate analyses were completed on retrospective and prospective data of paediatric-onset and adult-onset consecutive cases who were diagnosed and followed at the same tertiary referral hospital of the University of Padua, Italy, during a period of 14 years (1994-2008). Paediatric-onset patients were further divided into age brackets (0-5, 6-12, and 13-17 year-olds). Analyses were conducted using the SAS package, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). RESULTS: Three hundred twelve patients were analysed. At disease onset, the manifestations which were more frequent among the 133 paediatric patients (50.4% with diagnosis of Crohn disease [CD], 43.6% with ulcerative colitis, and 6% with unclassified IBD) with respect to the adult-onset patients were perianal disease (12.8%) (P < 0.0001) and extraintestinal manifestations (14.3%) (P = 0.043). Among the 179 adult patients (55.3% with diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, 36.3% with CD, and 8.3% with unclassified IBD) instead, severe abdominal pain (P = 0.008), diarrhoea (P = 0.005), and anorexia (P < 0.0001) were more frequently observed. During the follow-up, the presence of extraintestinal manifestations (50.4%) (P = 0.005) and perianal disease (44.8% of the patients with childhood-onset CD) (P = 0.006) was observed more often in the paediatric-onset group. CONCLUSIONS: In our cases, the phenotypic expression of IBD developing in paediatric age differs from that seen in adults.},

Selected probiotics strains have been proven to be clinically effective in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. None of the probiotics thus far tested has been shown to be effective in induction of remission or in maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease. The multispecies probiotics mixture of 8 strains seems effective in the maintenance of remission in pouchitis. Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional bowel disorder manifested by chronic, recurring abdominal pain or discomfort associated with disturbed bowel habit in the absence of structural abnormalities likely to account for these symptoms. Recently conducted appropriately powered studies with different (combinations of) probiotics show positive results on reduction of symptoms, although a considerable placebo effect is also found. Mechanistic studies aimed at pathophysiological mechanisms of inflammatory bowel diseases can identify new targets for probiotic bacteria.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The colonic mucus layer plays an important role in the protection of the intestinal epithelium and mainly consists of mucin glycoproteins (primarily MUC2 in the colon) trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) and secretory IgA. Butyrate is a major end product of fermentation of dietary fibres and is associated with beneficial effects on colonic health. Earlier in-vitro and animal studies showed that butyrate modulates MUC2 and TFF3 expression and mucin secretion, although data from human studies are not yet available. METHODS: Sixteen healthy volunteers and 35 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients in clinical remission self-administered a 60 ml rectal enema containing 100 mmol/l butyrate or placebo once daily for 2 and 3 weeks, respectively. After each treatment, biopsies were taken from the distal sigmoid for quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis of MUC2 and TFF3. In addition, mucosal sections were stained with high iron diamine-alcian blue to distinguish between sialomucins and sulphomucins. To analyse total mucin secretion and secretory IgA concentrations, 24 h faeces were collected during the day before the endoscopic examination. RESULTS: The butyrate intervention did not significantly modulate the expression of MUC2 (fold change: 1.04 and 1.05 in healthy volunteers and ulcerative colitis patients, respectively) or TFF3 (fold change: 0.91 and 0.94 in healthy volunteers and UC patients, respectively). Furthermore, the percentage of sialomucins, mucus secretion and secretory IgA concentrations were not affected by the butyrate intervention in both the groups. CONCLUSION: Butyrate exposure in healthy volunteers and UC patients in remission did not affect the measured parameters of the colonic mucus layer.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Butyrate, produced by colonic fermentation of dietary fibers is often hypothesized to beneficially affect colonic health. This study aims to assess the effects of butyrate on inflammation and oxidative stress in subjects with chronically mildly elevated parameters of inflammation and oxidative stress. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with ulcerative colitis in clinical remission daily administered 60 ml rectal enemas containing 100mM sodium butyrate (n=17) or saline (n=18) during 20 days (NCT00696098). Before and after the intervention feces, blood and colonic mucosal biopsies were obtained. Parameters of antioxidant defense and oxidative damage, myeloperoxidase, several cytokines, fecal calprotectin and CRP were determined. RESULTS: Butyrate enemas induced minor effects on colonic inflammation and oxidative stress. Only a significant increase of the colonic IL-10/IL-12 ratio was found within butyrate-treated patients (p=0.02), and colonic concentrations of CCL5 were increased after butyrate compared to placebo treatment (p=0.03). Although in general butyrate did not affect colonic glutathione levels, the effects of butyrate enemas on total colonic glutathione appeared to be dependent on the level of inflammation. CONCLUSION: Although UC patients in remission were characterized by low-grade oxidative stress and inflammation, rectal butyrate enemas showed only minor effects on inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters.},

Early observational series suggested a benefit in the setting of severe, hospitalized patients. However, the recent completion of two large multi-center, double-blind placebo-controlled trials confirmed a role for infliximab for outpatients with refractory, moderate-severe disease with evidence for clinical remissions, mucosal healing, and a reduction in colectomies. Despite this evidence, there are numerous questions remaining regarding the optimal positioning in the setting of moderate-severe disease, potential benefits of concomitant immune suppression and the need for maintenance treatment after induction therapy. Additional clinical trials have demonstrated a less profound benefit for adalimumab at similar doses that are used in Crohn's disease. Other biological agents that have targeted T cells such as visiluzimab and abatacept were not demonstrated to be effective in controlled trials.},

   abstract = {Underweight and specific nutrient deficiencies are frequent in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In addition, a significant number of children with IBD, especially Crohn's disease (CD) have impaired linear growth. Nutrition has an important role in the management of IBD. In adults with CD, enteral nutrition (EN) is effective in inducing clinical remission of IBD, although it is less efficient than corticosteroids. Exclusive EN is an established primary therapy for pediatric CD. Limited data suggests that EN is as efficient as corticosteroids for induction of remission. Additional advantages of nutritional therapy are control of inflammation, mucosal healing, positive benefits to growth and overall nutritional status with minimal adverse effects. The available evidence suggests that supplementary EN may be effective also for maintenance of remission in CD. More studies are needed to confirm these findings. However, EN supplementation could be considered as an alternative or as an adjunct to maintenance drug therapy in CD. EN does not have a primary therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis. Specific compositions of enteral diets-elemental diets or diets containing specific components-were not shown to have any advantage over standard polymeric diets and their place in the treatment of CD or UC need further evaluation. Recent theories suggest that diet may be implicated in the etiology of IBD, however there are no proven dietary approaches to reduce the risk of developing IBD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Osteonecrosis (ON) of the femoral head can lead to femoral head collapse, necessitating total hip replacement. Reports of patients suffering from both ON and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) have prompted us to evaluate the relationship between ON and IBD, especially Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. METHODS: A review of the data from three new cases, along with data from all the published cases of patients presenting ON and IBD found through a systematic search of the Pub Med database. RESULTS: We encountered some diagnostic problems: The ON diagnosis could not be confirmed in some patients who did not meet the ON diagnostic criteria. Reviewed data was too weak to assess the exact incidence of ON in IBD. Corticosteroid therapy, especially in high dose regimens, is likely the most important etiological factor. No evidence supporting other physiopathological hypothesis, such as total parenteral nutrition, osteoporosis, or coagulation disorders, was found. Finally, the multifocal form of ON appears particularly common in IBD, with some patients presenting multiple lesions of the hip, shoulder, knee and talus. CONCLUSIONS: ON in IBD, which is frequently multifocal, appears to be a complication of corticosteroid therapy, especially when high doses are used. We recommend regular ON checkups for corticosteroid-treated IBD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been extensively studied. However, the use of probiotics and prebiotics is poorly documented, despite evidence of efficacy of particular probiotic strains in specific forms of IBD. METHODS: A case-control study comprising interviewer-administered questionnaires was conducted in IBD patients and healthy controls. Data regarding use and knowledge of probiotics and prebiotics, demographic, and clinical information were collected. RESULTS: In total, 334 participants (234 IBD, 100 controls) were interviewed. Significantly more IBD patients than controls had ever used probiotics to manage their health (Crohn's disease [CD] 43%, ulcerative colitis [UC] 51%, controls 21%, P < 0.001). Prebiotic use was negligible. On logistic regression analysis, having UC (odds ratio [OR] 4.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.27-8.12) or CD (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.66-5.60) were the strongest predictors of probiotic use. Within IBD patients the strongest predictor of probiotic use was current steroid use (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.11-5.18). IBD patients had greater probiotic knowledge scores than controls (P = 0.003), although 20% of IBD probiotic users could not provide a definition of a probiotic. Less than half of IBD probiotic users discussed probiotic use with healthcare professionals, with commercial advertising being the primary source of information. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD use probiotics to manage their health but frequently choose strains without evidence of efficacy in IBD. Patients rely on nonclinical sources of information and often do not disclose probiotic use to healthcare professionals. Conventional healthcare providers should inquire about probiotic use among their patients and offer evidence-based advice.},

The purposes of the study were to investigate if: (1) dietary fibres can bind 5-ASA in vitro, and (2) consumption of dietary fibres is related to disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) treated with 5-ASA. METHODS: In vitro: 15 g of Ispaghula Husk, wheat bran, citrus-pectin, or wheat flour were incubated in a 37 degrees C buffered solutions of 5-ASA (1 g/l) for 3 hours at pH 6 and 7. The concentrations of 5-ASA were determined before and after the incubation using HPLC. In vivo: patients with UC were interviewed two to three times during 6 months. The fibre consumption was estimated and related to the disease activity (CAI, CRP, Faecal-calprotectin) and quality of life (IBDQ). RESULTS: In vitro: 5-ASA was bound to Ispaghula Husk (5.3-10.0 mg/g) and wheat bran (4.6-5.5 mg/g), and to a minor degree to citrus-pectin. No differences were found in relation to pH. In vivo: 29 patients completed the scheduled interviews. No significant changes in fibre consumption were observed over time; however, patients consuming a diet high in fibre (>20 g/day) had significantly lower CRP (p <0.01) and faecal-calprotectin (p <0.01) than those consuming less fibre (<20 g/dg). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a high intake of fibre had a lower disease activity than those with low intake. Ispaghula Husk bound 5-ASA in vitro, independent of pH. The effect might be clinically relevant in patients with UC treated with 5-ASA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls. DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4 patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20 IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P = 0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7 ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400 microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis should be explored further.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clinical results of bone mineral density for children with inflammatory bowel disease are commonly reported using reference data for chronological age. It is known that these children, particularly those with Crohn disease, experience delayed growth and maturation. Therefore, it is more appropriate to compare clinical results with bone age rather than chronological age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and bone age was assessed using the Tanner-Whitehouse 3 method from a standard hand/wrist radiograph. Results were available for 44 children ages 7.99 to 16.89 years. Areal bone mineral density measurements were converted to z scores using both chronological and bone ages for each subject. RESULTS: Areal bone mineral density z scores calculated using bone age, as opposed to chronological age, were significantly improved for both the total body and lumbar spine regions of interest. When subjects were grouped according to diagnosis, bone age generated z scores remained significantly improved for those with Crohn disease but not for those diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Grouping of children with Crohn disease into younger and older ages produced significantly higher z scores using bone age compared with chronological for the older age group, but not the younger age group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, in accordance with those presented in the literature, suggest that aBMD results in children with Crohn disease should include the consideration of bone age, rather than merely chronological age. Bone size, although not as easily available, would also be an important consideration for interpreting results in paediatric populations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4) years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236), 1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE, it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions are a significant reason for therapeutic failure during thiopurine treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Some smaller series in this patient population have shown that a switch to mercaptopurine may be successful in many cases of azathioprine intolerance. AIM: To assess the long-term outcome of mercaptopurine treatment in a large patient population with azathioprine intolerance. METHODS: We identified 135 patients (74 women; median age 40 years) with Crohn's disease (n = 88) or ulcerative colitis (n = 47) and reviewed their medical records. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients (52%) tolerated mercaptopurine and were followed up for 736 (362-1080) days; 65 patients discontinued mercaptopurine due to adverse events after 25 (8-92) days. Mercaptopurine was tolerated in 71% (12/17) with hepatotoxicity and in 68% (13/19) with arthralgia/myalgia during azathioprine treatment. Previous abdominal surgery was more common in mercaptopurine intolerant patients [39/65 (60%) vs. 27/70 (39%); P = 0.02] and thiopurine methyltransferase activity was higher in mercaptopurine tolerant patients than in mercaptopurine intolerant patients [13.2 (11.4-15.3) vs. 11.8 (9.6-14.2) U/mL red blood cells; P = 0.04; n = 81]. CONCLUSIONS: A trial of mercaptopurine should be considered in azathioprine intolerance, as half of the patients tolerate a switch to mercaptopurine. Patients with hepatotoxicity or arthralgia/myalgia during azathioprine treatment might benefit more often than those with other types of adverse events.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polyamines are important in cell growth and wound repair, but have also been implicated in inflammation-induced carcinogenesis. Polyamine metabolism includes back-conversion of spermine to spermidine by the enzyme spermine oxidase (SMO), which produces hydrogen peroxide that causes oxidative stress. In ulcerative colitis (UC), levels of spermine are decreased compared to spermidine. Therefore, we sought to determine if SMO is involved in UC. METHODS: Colon biopsies and clinical information from subjects undergoing colonoscopy for evaluation of UC or colorectal cancer screening were utilized from 16 normal controls and 53 UC cases. Histopathologic disease severity was graded and the Mayo Disease Activity Index (DAI) and endoscopy subscore assessed. SMO mRNA expression was measured in frozen biopsies by TaqMan-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Formalin-fixed tissues were used for SMO immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: There was a 3.1-fold upregulation of SMO mRNA levels in UC patients compared to controls (P = 0.044), and a 3.7-fold increase in involved left colon versus paired uninvolved right colon (P < 0.001). With worsening histologic injury in UC there was a progressive increase in SMO staining of mononuclear inflammatory cells. There was a similar increase in SMO staining with worsening endoscopic disease severity and strong correlation with the DAI (r = 0.653, P < 0.001). Inflammatory cell SMO staining was increased in involved left colon versus uninvolved right colon. CONCLUSIONS: SMO expression is upregulated in UC tissues, deriving from increased levels in mononuclear inflammatory cells. Dysregulated polyamine homeostasis may contribute to chronic UC by altering immune responses and increasing oxidative stress.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: L-arginine (L-Arg) is a semi-essential amino acid that is the substrate for both nitric oxide and polyamine synthesis. Cellular uptake of L-Arg is an active transport process that is subject to competitive inhibition by L-ornithine (L-Orn) and L-lysine (L-Lys). We investigated L-Arg utilization in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Serum was collected from 14 normal controls and 22 UC patients with pancolitis of moderate or severe activity by histopathology score. The Mayo Disease Activity Index (DAI) and endoscopy subscore were assessed. Serum amino acid levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Arginine availability index (AAI) was defined as [L-Arg]/([L-Orn] + [L-Lys]). RESULTS: Serum L-Arg levels were significantly associated with histopathologic grade (P = 0.001). L-Arg levels were increased in subjects with severe colitis when compared to those with moderate colitis or normal mucosa. L-Orn + L-Lys levels were also increased in severe colitis, so that AAI was not significantly increased. L-Arg levels were also strongly associated with the endoscopy subscore (P < 0.001). There was a strong correlation between DAI and L-Arg levels (r = 0.656, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Serum L-Arg levels correlate with UC disease severity but availability is not increased due to competitive inhibition by L-Orn and L-Lys. Our findings suggest that L-Arg uptake by cells in the inflamed colon is defective, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of UC. Studies delineating the mechanism of uptake inhibition could enhance our understanding of UC or lead to novel treatment options.},

The secondary aims were to determine the accuracy of MRE in grading disease activity and determine the interobserver agreement for individual MRE parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pediatric patients scheduled to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy, ileocolonoscopy with biopsies, and barium enteroclysis for suspected IBD were included and underwent MRE. MRE images were evaluated by 3 observers. The accuracy of MRE was calculated using the clinical diagnosis based on endoscopic, histopathological, and barium enteroclysis examinations as reference standard. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were available for analysis. IBD was correctly diagnosed in, respectively, 61%, 61%, and 91% of the patients by the 3 observers, with a specificity of 80%, 90%, and 60%. Differentiation between Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was accurately done in, respectively, 67%, 53%, and 80% of patients with CD and 0%, 14%, and 43% of patients with UC. Disease activity was understaged on MRE in the majority of patients. Intraclass correlation coefficients for measurements of bowel thickness were 0.52 (observer 1-2; observer 1-3) and 0.34 (observer 2-3). Interobserver agreement on bowel wall enhancement and stenosis was moderate to good (kappa 0.59, 0.56, and 0.56 and kappa 0.62, 0.32, 0.30, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity and specificity values of MRE for diagnosing pediatric IBD were moderate to good. CD, but not UC, was accurately diagnosed by MRE in a large proportion of patients. Activity was understaged in a large proportion of patients. Interobserver agreement for individual MRE parameters was fair to good.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the multidrug transporter MDR1 have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in different studies. However, the data are highly controversial. Recently, 6 haplotype tagging SNPs (tSNPs), representing the haplotype variations of the MDR1 gene, were identified. The aims of this study were to genotype these variants and correlate them to disease phenotype in New Zealand IBD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 784 IBD patients and 200 healthy subjects were genotyped for 5 tSNPs and the triallelic MDR1 variant G2677T/A using the Sequenom MassArray platform. Furthermore, the effects of these variants were examined in correlation with phenotypic clinical features. RESULTS: Heterozygous carriers for the variants C1236T, rs2235046 (an SNP in intron 16), and G2677T/A showed a lower risk of developing ulcerative colitis (C1236T: odds ratio [OR] = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.42-0.93, P = 0.03; G2677T/A: OR = 0.59, CI = 0.39-0.89, P = 0.02; and rs2235046: OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.38-0.91, P = 0.009) as compared with homozygotes. None of the analyzed markers were associated with Crohn's disease on a genotypic level. Subgroup analysis revealed an association for 2 variants with IBD when stratified for age of onset (C1236T SNP and rs3789243). The MDR1 variant C3435T was associated with disease behavior in CD (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.01-2.08, P = 0.04), whereas the SNP rs3789243 was found to be associated with pancolitis in UC patients (OR = 1.35, CI = 1.00-1.82, P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study support the role of MDR1 as a candidate gene for ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, our results suggest the possibility of a heterozygous advantage for certain MDR1 variants for this disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 1 (NOD1) gene encodes a pattern recognition receptor that senses pathogens, leading to downstream responses characteristic of innate immunity. We investigated the role of NOD1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on IBD risk in a New Zealand Caucasian population, and studied Nod1 expression in response to bacterial invasion in the Caco2 cell line. FINDINGS: DNA samples from 388 Crohn's disease (CD), 405 ulcerative colitis (UC), 27 indeterminate colitis patients and 201 randomly selected controls, from Canterbury, New Zealand were screened for 3 common SNPs in NOD1, using the MassARRAY iPLEX Gold assay. Transcriptional activation of the protein produced by NOD1 (Nod1) was studied after infection of Caco2 cells with Escherichia coli LF82. Carrying the rs2075818 G allele decreased the risk of CD (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.50-0.88, p < 0.002) but not UC. There was an increased frequency of the three SNP (rs2075818, rs2075822, rs2907748) haplotype, CTG (p = 0.004) and a decreased frequency of the GTG haplotype (p = 0.02).in CD. The rs2075822 CT or TT genotypes were at an increased frequency (genotype p value = 0.02), while the rs2907748 AA or AG genotypes showed decreased frequencies in UC (p = 0.04), but not in CD. Functional assays showed that Nod1 is produced 6 hours after bacterial invasion of the Caco2 cell line. CONCLUSION: The NOD1 gene is important in signalling invasion of colonic cells by pathogenic bacteria, indicative of its' key role in innate immunity. Carrying specific SNPs in this gene significantly modifies the risk of CD and/or UC in a New Zealand Caucasian population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that has periods of exacerbated symptoms and periods that are symptom-free. The treatment of active UC with probiotic bacteria could possibly induce remission. We evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety profile of probiotic preparation VSL#3 in the treatment of mild to moderate acute UC in the pediatric population. METHODS: Eighteen eligible patients between the ages of 3-17 with mild to moderate acute UC received open-label VSL#3 daily in 2 divided doses for 8 weeks. The disease activity pre- and post-VSL#3 therapy was assessed by the simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI); Mayo ulcerative colitis endoscopic score; inflammatory markers: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP); serum cytokine profiling; and rectal tissue microbial profiling done at baseline and at week 8. RESULTS: Thirteen patients completed 8 weeks of VSL#3 treatment and 5 patients were withdrawn due to lack of improvement. Remission (defined as SCCAI <or=3) was achieved in 56% of children (n = 10); response (decrease in SCCAI >or=2, but final score <or=5) in 6% (n = 1); and no change or worsening in 39% (n = 7). Post-VSL#3 treatments demonstrated a bacterial taxonomy change in rectal biopsy. The VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials and no biochemical and clinical adverse effects attributed to VSL#3 were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of pediatric patients diagnosed with mild to moderate UC with VSL#3 resulted in a remission rate of 56% and a combined remission/response rate of 61%.},

PPs may play a role in the extension of ulcerative colitis (UC) into the terminal ileum. We sought to clarify the magnified endoscopic findings of the PPs in the terminal ileum of UC patients. Eighteen UC patients underwent magnifying chromoendoscopy before initial treatment to evaluate the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) on the PPs domes and the surrounding villi. In 8 UC patients, as in healthy controls, the PPs' domes were slightly elevated, covered with the regular FAE lining, and surrounded by dense and bulky villi; however, in 10 UC patients, the PPs' domes were irregular, and the surrounding villi were sparse and atrophic. These abnormal findings within the PPs were associated with minimal mucosal lesions but not with backwash ileitis; both electron microscopy and magnifying endoscopy confirmed that these lesions were reversible following remission with prednisolone-mesalazine therapy. Similar to Crohn's disease patients, UC patients commonly had abnormalities in the FAE on PPs' domes and the surrounding villi on magnifying endoscopy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aetiology of ulcerative colitis (UC) is largely unknown, although it is plausible that dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may be protective. Metabolites derived from n-3 PUFAs are less proinflammatory than those from n-6 PUFAs. Earlier, no prospective cohort studies have investigated this hypothesis, using dietary information collected from food diaries. The aim of this study was to investigate the total dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs and the specific n-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the risk of developing incident UC. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-five thousand six hundred and thirty-nine participants, living in Norfolk UK, aged 45-74 years (median age at recruitment of 59.2 years), completed 7-day food diaries. These were interpreted using a computer programme, which converted food items into nutrients, including n-3 PUFAs. The cohort was monitored for participants who developed UC. Each case was matched with four controls and an analysis performed using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: In the cohort, 22 incident cases of UC were identified after a median follow-up time of 4.2 years (range 1.8-8.3 years). A statistically significant protective odds ratio (OR) for the trend across tertiles was found for DHA [OR = 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.22-0.86, P = 0.02] and borderline statistically significant differences for trends for total total n-3 PUFAs (OR = 0.56, 95% CI=0.28-1.13, P = 0.10) and EPA (OR = 0.53, 95% CI=0.27-1.03, P = 0.06) after adjusting for age, sex, total energy intake, smoking, and other fatty acids. CONCLUSION: Total dietary n-3 PUFAs, EPA, and DHA, particularly DHA were associated with protection from UC in a cohort aged over 45 years. If the association is causal, then increasing the population's intake of n-3 PUFAs from oily fish may help prevent UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are poorly characterized. We examined the prevalence of EIMs at diagnosis, subsequent incidence, and risk factors for EIMs. METHODS: Data for 1649 patients from the PediIBD Consortium Registry, diagnosed with IBD before 18 years of age (1007 [61%] with Crohn's disease, 471 [29%] with ulcerative colitis, and 171 [10%] with indeterminate colitis), were analyzed using logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier, log rank tests, and Cox models. RESULTS: EIMs were reported prior to IBD diagnosis in 97 of 1649 patients (6%). Older children at diagnosis had higher rates compared with younger children, and arthritis (26%) and aphthous stomatitis (21%) were most common. Among the 1552 patients without EIM at diagnosis, 290 developed at least 1 EIM. Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative incidence were 9% at 1 year, 19% at 5 years, and 29% at 15 years after diagnosis. Incidence did not differ by IBD type (P = 0.20), age at diagnosis (P = 0.22), or race/ethnicity (P = 0.24). Arthritis (17%) and osteopenia/osteoporosis (15%) were the most common EIMs after IBD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In our large cohort of pediatric IBD patients, 6% had at least 1 EIM before diagnosis of IBD. At least 1 EIM will develop in 29% within 15 years of diagnosis. The incidence of EIMs both before and after diagnosis of IBD differs by type of EIM and may be slightly higher in girls, but is independent of the type of IBD, age at diagnosis, and race/ethnicity.},

Only one gene, ECM1, has been reported for ulcerative colitis alone. We now need to further explore these new genes before to understand their biological role.

Despite frank inflammation, Crohn disease patients with colitis had significantly lower, albeit enhanced, HBD2 levels than did ulcerative colitis patients.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Western countries is on the rise. No prospective studies have been conducted on the epidemiology of pediatric IBD in Poland. The aim of the study was to define the characteristics of new pediatric IBD and assess the incidence of new IBD among children in Poland between 2002 and 2004. METHODS: Patient records from 24 pediatric gastroenterology centers servicing the whole population of Poland were collected. IBD diagnosis was based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological features. RESULTS: There were 491 new IBD patients, representing an overall incidence of IBD of 2.7 cases/100,000 children/year. The incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) was 0.6, ulcerative colitis (UC) 1.3, and indeterminate colitis (IC) 0.8. The age-related incidence of IBD was 1.8 in the 0- to 10-year-old age group, rising to 3.7 for the 11- to 18-year age group. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of IBD (as well as CD, UC and IC) in Poland is lower than that in Western countries. The relative contribution of UC and IC to the overall IBD incidence is higher in Poland than in most Western countries. These findings may suggest a tendency towards under- or misdiagnosis.},

   abstract = {The major aim of this work was to optimize the properties of novel polymeric films based on blends of ethylcellulose and Nutriose (a water-soluble, branched dextrin). Such blends were recently shown to be highly promising for the site-specific delivery of drugs to the colon in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, in particular Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Importantly, and in contrast to various other colon targeting approaches, the system is adapted to the pathophysiological conditions in the disease state. However, it is yet unknown how desired membrane properties, especially water uptake and dry mass loss kinetics as well as mechanical stability can be adjusted to the specific needs of particular drug treatments. Different highly efficient and easy to apply tools were identified altering the membrane's properties, in particular their mechanical resistance required to withstand the shear forces resulting from the motility of the upper GIT and the hydrostatic pressure built up within the devices upon contact with aqueous media. This includes the variation of the Nutriose:ethylcellulose blend ratio and initial plasticizer content. Importantly, Nutriose also exhibits significant pre-biotic activity, normalizing the microflora in the patients' colon, which is of major clinical benefit in the case of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify novel polymeric films allowing for the site-specific delivery of drugs to the colon of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases. Ethylcellulose was blended with different types of bacteria-sensitive starch derivatives. The water uptake and dry mass loss kinetics of the systems were monitored upon exposure to media simulating the contents of the stomach, small intestine and colon (including fresh fecal samples from Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis patients). Importantly, ethylcellulose:Nutriose FB 06 and ethylcellulose:Peas starch N-735 films showed highly promising water uptake and dry mass loss kinetics in all the investigated media, indicating their potential to minimize premature drug release in the upper gastro-intestinal tract, and allowing for controlled release once the colon is reached. This can be attributed to the fact that the starch derivatives serve as substrates for the enzymes, which are secreted by the bacteria present in the colon of inflammatory bowel disease patients. Thus, the identified new polymeric films are adapted to the pathophysiological conditions in the gastro-intestinal tract in the disease state. Furthermore, Nutriose is known to provide pre-biotic effects, which can be of great benefit for these patients.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to prepare and characterize novel types of polymer coated pellets allowing for the site-specific delivery of drugs to the colon. 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)-loaded beads were prepared by extrusion-spheronization and coated with different Nutriose:ethylcellulose blends. In vitro drug release from these systems was measured under various conditions, including the exposure to fresh fecal samples from inflammatory bowel disease patients under anaerobic conditions. Nutriose is a starch derivative, which is preferentially degraded by enzymes secreted by the microflora in the colon of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Interestingly, the release of 5-ASA (which is commonly used for the local treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases) could effectively be suppressed upon exposure to release media simulating the conditions in the upper GIT, irrespective of the degree of agitation and presence or absence of enzymes. But as soon as the pellets came into contact with fecal samples of inflammatory bowel disease patients, the release rate significantly increased and the drug was released in a time-controlled manner. Thus, this novel type of colon targeting system is adapted to the pathophysiology of the patient. Furthermore, culture media containing specific colonic bacteria are presented providing an interesting potential as substitutes for fresh fecal samples.},

   abstract = {Fournier gangrene is a very rare and a rapidly progressing, polymicrobial necrotizing faciitis or myonecrosis of the perineal, perianal and genital regions, with a high mortality rate. Infection is associated with superficial traum, urological and colorectal diseases and operations. The most commonly found bacteria are Escherichia coli followed by Bacteroides and streptococcal species. Diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and immunosuppression are perpetuating co-factors. Fournier's gangrene complicating inflammatory bowel disease has been reported in three patients so far, two with Crohn's disease. A 78-year-old man diagnosed with ulcerative pancolitis was referred for fever, and painful perianal and scrotal swelling after perianal surgery for a horseshoe-type perianal abscess. Since bowel disease diagnosis, patient was on mesalazine and achieved long-term remission. Perianal abscess occurred suddenly one week before perianal surgery without any evidence of pre-existing fistula or other abnormalities. Physical examination showed extensive edema and crepitus of perineum and genitalia and patient had symptoms of significant toxicity. The diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene was made and patient underwent emergency surgery with extensive surgical debridement of the scrotal and perianal area and Hartman procedure with a diverting colostomy. In addition, patient started on therapy with mesalazine 3gr, methylprednisolone 16 mg, parenteral nutrition and broad spectrum of antibiotics. Two days after the first operation the patient needed a second operation for perianal debridement. On the fourth day, blood cultures showed E. coli. Patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged after 34 days of hospitalization. On follow up, disease review is scheduled and colostomy closure is planned.},

Although the bulk of the published experience regarding osteoporosis is derived from the postmenopausal population, this review will focus on gastrointestinal disorders implicated in osteoporosis, with an emphasis on inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. The unique aspects of gastrointestinal diseases associated with osteoporosis include early onset of disease (and, therefore, prolonged exposure to risk factors for developing osteoporosis, particularly with inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease), malabsorption, and maldigestion of nutrients necessary for bone health and maintenance (eg, calcium, vitamin D), as well as the impact of glucocorticoids. These factors, when added to smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, hypogonadism, and a family history of osteoporosis, accumulate into an imposing package of predictors for osteoporotic fracture. This paper will review the identification and treatment strategies for patients with gastrointestinal disorders and osteoporosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In this study we aimed to determine, in pediatric patients, whether norovirus infection could be associated with exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and ascertain whether the clinical expression of norovirus gastroenteritis was similar in patients with IBD compared with non-IBD controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a case-control retrospective chart review, over a 10-month interval, of patients with IBD with an exacerbation of their disease. The presence of norovirus in stool and/or rectal swab samples, as determined by an enzyme-linked immunoassay, was assessed. In addition, sex, age, type of IBD, presence or absence of diarrhea, hematochezia, and the need for hospitalization were determined. A similar number of control patients who did not have IBD were used as controls. RESULTS: Nine patients with IBD (8 ulcerative colitis/1 Crohn disease) had exacerbations with diarrhea. Eight had norovirus antigen in at least 1 sample. All 9 patients with IBD presented with bloody diarrhea and 6 of the 8 norovirus-positive patients with IBD required hospitalization. All of the control patients experienced diarrhea; however, no hematochezia was noted and no hospitalization was required. Several patients with IBD and controls remained positive for norovirus months after the initial positive stool and/or rectal swab sample. The virus appeared to be more common during winter months. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that norovirus may be associated with exacerbations of IBD. When norovirus accompanies IBD it is more likely to be associated with hematochezia than when the infection occurs in the absence of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress contributes to the propagation and exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but the status of erythrocyte antioxidant defense remains unknown. METHODS: Erythrocyte activities of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) were determined in 174 IBD patients and 105 controls and referred to IBD activity, inflammation severity, nutritional status, systemic oxidative stress, anemia, and treatment. RESULTS: Catalase and GPx1 activities were decreased in active IBD, whereas SOD1 became upregulated by IBD-related oxidative stress. In Crohn's disease (CD) corticosteroids decreased SOD1 activity. SOD1 correlated indirectly with CD activity and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and directly with transferrin. In ulcerative colitis (UC) anemia downregulated SOD1. Decreases in GPx activity corresponded with IBD activity, anemia, inflammation, and malnutrition. Oxidative stress in UC and corticosteroids in CD also downregulated GPx. Catalase activity was decreased by CD-related anemia, correlating directly with hemoglobin, and indirectly with CD activity, inflammatory and protein oxidative stress markers. When co-analyzed, anemia but not CD activity significantly contributed to catalase downregulation. In UC, catalase activity corresponded indirectly with UC endoscopic activity and inflammation and directly with hemoglobin. UC activity, anemia, and treatment with azathioprine negatively affected catalase. As indicators of active IBD, GPx1 showed a diagnostic accuracy of 73%, whereas catalase showed 63% as compared to 74% of C-reactive protein and ESR. CONCLUSIONS: Erythrocyte antioxidant defense is impaired in active IBD. SOD1, GPx1, and CAT activities are differently affected by the disease type, activity, anemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, and treatment. As an active IBD indicator, GPx1 was comparable to C-reactive protein and ESR.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK), menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of these vitamins.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two main disorders, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, that cause chronic, recurrent inflammation of the intestine. An inappropriate immune response to the enteric ecosystem has been postulated to cause IBD. Genomewide association studies provide the information of diverse genetic variations and susceptibilities to patients with IBD. Through the application of these studies, the pathogenesis of IBD may result in part from genetic abnormalities that regulate epithelial barrier function and innate and adaptive immune responses. Crohn's disease shows strong association with CARD15, ATG15L1, and IRGM, which are involved in the innate immunity. In the adaptive immune response, IL23R, MST1, IL12B, and STAT3 polymorphisms are associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Current pharmacologic treatment of IBD, including 5-aminosalycylate, steroids, and immunomodulator therapy, are mainly aimed at suppressing inflammation non-specifically, except biologic therapies such as anti-tumor necrosis factor molecule, which block specific proinflammatory molecules. For nutritional issues in IBD, the mainstay of therapy has been supportive, with particular attention paid to the prevention, recognition, and therapy of nutritional deficiencies, and individual outcomes to specific dietary factors have been controversial. Parenteral nutritional support and exclusionary diets have been investigated and are not the subject of this review. The emerging concepts of nutrition-gene interaction gave birth to unique scientific fields, nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics. These studies provide information about 1) the genetic variability that induces an individual's response to nutrition according to particular states of health and disease and 2) changes in gene expression that develop as a result of nutrition-gene interaction. For IBD, the role of diet in the regulation of the immune response against gut flora is the subject of current intensive evaluation. These approaches may lead clinicians to derive a personalized nutritional prescription based on individual genetic variations and may result in a significant impact on IBD treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study was designed to elucidate the contribution of parental height to the stature of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), who often exhibit growth impairment. Accordingly, we compared patients' final adult heights and target heights based on measured parental heights and examined predictors of final adult height in pediatric IBD patients. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed the growth of 295 patients diagnosed between ages 1 and 18 (211 Crohn's disease [CD], 84 ulcerative colitis [UC]) and their family members (283 mothers, 231 fathers, 55 siblings). RESULTS: Twenty-two percent had growth impairment (height for age Z-score <-1.64, equivalent to <5th percentile on growth curve) in more than 1 measurement since diagnosis; most growth-impaired patients had CD (88% CD versus 12% UC). Parents of the growth-impaired group had lower mean height Z-scores compared to parents of nongrowth-impaired patients (-0.67 versus 0.02 for mothers [P < 0.001]; -0.31 versus 0.22 for fathers [P = 0.002]). For 108 patients who reached adult heights and had available parental heights, the growth-impaired group continued to demonstrate lower adult height Z-scores (-1.38 versus 0.07; P < 0.001). Adult heights were within 1 SD of target heights even for the growth-impaired group. Only 11.3% remained persistently growth-impaired in adulthood. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated lower parental height and minimum patient height Z-score as significant predictors of lower final adult height in IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Parental height is a powerful determinant of linear growth even in the presence of chronic inflammation, and should be an integral part of the evaluation of growth in IBD children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: This prospective study was undertaken to clarify the role of body mass and composition as a determinant of bone mineral density (BMD) in recently diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: A nested subgroup of 101 adult subjects of the population-based Manitoba IBD Cohort Study were enrolled. Baseline BMD and body composition were measured and repeated 2.3 +/- 0.3 years later. RESULTS: Greater weight, height, and body mass measurements were positively correlated with bone density at all sites (P < 0.01). Although both fat tissue and lean tissue showed positive relationships with BMD, lean tissue showed a much stronger correlation than fat tissue, especially for the total hip (r = 0.66, P < 0.001 versus r = 0.23, P < 0.05) and total body measurements (r = 0.59, P < 0.001 versus r = 0.04, P NS). Increase (or decrease) in hip bone density was strongly associated with an increase (or decrease) in all body mass variables (r = 0.49-0.54, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Measures of body mass are important determinants of baseline BMD in recently diagnosed IBD patients. Furthermore, change in body mass is correlated with change in BMD, especially at the total hip. Early optimization and maintenance of nutrition and body weight, particularly toward lean tissue mass, may play an important role in preventing IBD-related bone disease.},

   abstract = {Although the use of concomitant immunosuppressants (IS) with biologics has been demonstrated to reduce the immunogenicity of chimeric (infliximab), humanized (natalizumab), human (adalimumab) antibodies and antibody fragments (certolizumab pegol), to date concomitant IS with biologics has not impacted on the short or intermediate responses in the treatment of Crohn's disease in most induction and maintenance trials. The optimal strategy to reduce antibodies to infliximab is to use an induction and maintenance strategy rather than episodic therapy. Any potential benefit of concomitant IS use with biologic agents needs to be balanced against the risk of combination therapy including serious infections and the risk of neoplasia. The discovery of genetic polymorphism for production of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), a key enzyme in the metabolism of thiopurine antimetabolites, has made it possible to rationalize therapy in terms of patient and dosage selection. TPMT screening prior to initiation of thiopurine antimetabolites is currently recommended to avoid treating patients with low or absent TPMT activity with potentially toxic doses of thiopurines. Routine monitoring of blood counts and liver enzymes is recommended even in individuals with normal TPMT activity. The ability to monitor thiopurine metabolites may make it possible to optimize therapeutic response by guiding clinicians on dose escalation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We previously reported that IBD patients who are non-responders to thiopurines with preferential shunting of metabolites to hepatotoxic 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleotides compared to 6-thioguanine nucleotides can reverse the ratio of 6-MMP/6-TGN and respond to thiopurines with the addition of allopurinol. The objective of this study is to report long term efficacy and safety, along with results for an additional 11 patients. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients at the University of Chicago IBD Center treated with allopurinol in addition to thiopurines. RESULTS: Twenty five patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis were enrolled. Within the first month of therapy 6-TGN metabolite levels increased from a mean of 186.5+/-17.4 (SE) to 352.8+/-37.8 pmol/8x10(8) (p=0.0001). Over the same period 6-MMP levels decreased from a mean of 11,966+/-1697 to 2004+/-536 pmol/8x10(8) (p<0.0001). The mean daily dosage of prednisone decreased from 19.8+/-3.8 mg to 5.3+/-2.7 mg (p=0.03). Thirteen patients have a minimum of one year follow-up. Nine of these thirteen patients have continued on therapy for at least 2 years. All thirteen of these patients continue to be in clinical remission at the last follow-up visit. No patients have had evidence of sustained thrombocytopenia or abnormal liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: In AZA/6-MP non-responders with increased 6-MMP/6-TGN ratios, addition of allopurinol continues to demonstrate safety and efficacy for long-term maintenance and steroid-sparing in IBD.},

   abstract = {The clinical manifestations of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are highly variable, with significant diversity in phenotypes of the diseases. This diversity may manifest as a difference in age of onset. Pediatric-onset disease may present differently and have a different natural history, with ramifications for disease management. Clear evidence exists at present that pediatric-onset UC may be different than adult-onset UC. The primary difference in disease phenotype is extent of disease. Approximately 60-70% of patients with pediatric-onset UC present with pancolitis, as opposed to approximately 20-30% in adults. Patients are more likely to have severe disease and become steroid-dependent. CD may be affected by an age gradient. There is an inverse linear relationship between age and colonic CD, the younger the patient, the more likely is the patient to have colonic CD. This inverse relationship is true through age 10. In addition, pediatric patients are more likely to have upper gastrointestinal involvement than their adult peers. Comparing adult and pediatric phenotypes is fraught with methodological obstacles. Disease behavior, with the exception of growth failure, seems to parallel disease behavior in adults. Patients with growth retardation are a high risk group for complications and should be managed as such.},

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in IBD patients. Anthropometric measures, biochemical markers of nutrition and bone mineral density measurement were completed for these patients as well as healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Seventy-seven Crohn's disease (CD) and 43 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were enrolled, and 37 healthy volunteers were recruited as healthy controls (HC). The T value of CD patients, UC patients and HC was -1.72 +/- 1.20, -1.26 +/- 1.12 and -0.62 +/- 0.87 respectively and the T value of CD patients was significantly lower than that of HC (P = 0.000). The prevalence of osteoporosis in CD, UC and HC was 23.3%, 14.0% and 0 respectively. The prevalence of osteoporosis in CD was higher than that in HC (P = 0.003). Logistic regression analysis indicated that low BMI (BMI < or = 18.4 kg/m(2)) was an independent risk factor for osteoporosis both in CD (OR = 11.25, 95%CI 3.198 - 39.580, P = 0.000) and in UC (OR = 14.50, 95%CI 1.058 - 88.200, P = 0.045) patients. Age, disease duration, clinical activity active index (CDAI), oral steroid therapy, immunosuppressant treatment and serum vitamin D concentration were not found to be correlated with osteoporosis in IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low bone mineral density is common in both CD and UC patients and low BMI is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis in IBD patients.},

   abstract = {A number of studies have been performed examining the influence of various probiotic organisms, either alone or in combination, on immune parameters, infectious outcomes, and inflammatory conditions in humans. Some components of the immune response, including phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity and mucosal immunoglobulin A production (especially in children), can be improved by some probiotic bacteria. Other components, including lymphocyte proliferation, the production of cytokines and of antibodies other than immunoglobulin A appear less sensitive to probiotics. Probiotics, including lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, administered to children can reduce incidence and duration of diarrhoea, but the precise effects depend upon the nature of the condition. Probiotic supplementation can reduce the risk of travellers' diarrhoea in adults, but does not affect duration. The effect of probiotics on other infectious outcomes is less clear. Probiotics may benefit children and adults with irritable bowel syndrome and adults with ulcerative colitis; studies in Crohn's Disease are less clear. Probiotics have little effect in rheumatoid arthritis. Probiotic supplementation, especially with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, can reduce risk and severity of allergic disease, particular atopic dermatitis; early supplementation appears to be effective. Overall, the picture that emerges from studies of probiotics on immune, infectious and inflammatory outcomes in humans is mixed and there appear to be large species and strain differences in effects seen. Other reasons for differences in effects seen will include dose of probiotic organism used, duration of supplementation, characteristics of the subjects studied, sample size, and technical differences in how the measurements were made.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) frequently receive immunosuppressive therapy. The immune response in these patients to vaccines has not been well studied. We conducted a prospective, open label study to evaluate the serologic response to influenza vaccine in children with IBD. METHODS: Serum was obtained from 146 children and young adults with IBD (96 Crohn's disease, 47 ulcerative colitis, and 3 indeterminate colitis) for baseline influenza titer, immediately followed by immunization with trivalent (A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (B)) inactivated influenza vaccine. Patients returned for repeat titers 3-9 weeks later. Seroprotection against each influenza strain was defined as hemagglutination inhibition titer > or = 40. Patients were categorized as nonimmunosuppressed (NIS; aminosalicylates only, antibiotics only, or no therapy) or immunosuppressed (IS; any immunosuppressive agent). IS patients were further subcategorized as: (i) tacrolimus, (ii) tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor, (3) immunomodulator, and (4) corticosteroids only. RESULTS: More patients were seroprotected against strains A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 than B strain (P<0.02), regardless of immunosuppression status. The proportion of seroprotected patients and geometric mean titers at post-vaccination were similar between NIS and IS groups for all three strains. Subanalysis of patients not seroprotected at baseline showed that those receiving anti-TNF therapy were less likely to be seroprotected against strain B (14%) compared to patients in the NIS group (39%, P=0.025). There were no serious vaccine-associated adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination produces a high prevalence of seroprotection in IBD patients, particularly against A strains. The vaccine is well tolerated. Routine influenza vaccination in IBD patients is recommended, irrespective of whether patients receive immunosuppressive medications.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Data suggest an increase in the incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We examined the trend of the incidence of IBD in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective investigation was conducted on a cohort of children diagnosed with IBD between 1991 and 2002 who were registered in the IBD center at Texas Children's Hospital. The diagnosis of IBD was based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and histological examinations. RESULTS: There were 272 children eligible for the analysis; 56% diagnosed with Crohn disease (CD), 22% with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 22% with indeterminate colitis. The male-to-female ratio was 1.2:1 in CD, 0.6:1 in UC, and 0.8:1 in indeterminate colitis. From 1991 to 2002, the incidence rate has doubled from 1.1/100,000/year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.36) to 2.4/1001,000/year (95% CI 2.10-2.77). This trend was valid for CD but not for UC. Whites had higher incidence rate of IBD than African Americans or Hispanics: 4.15/100,000/year (95% CI 3.48-4.82) versus 1.83/100,000/year (95% CI 1.14-2.51), and 0.61/100,000/year (95% CI 0.33-0.89), respectively. African Americans were predominantly diagnosed with CD. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the rising incidence of IBD among children with evidence of more CD than UC. Recognition of these results will have important implications for diagnosis and management of IBD in children.},

Malnutrition is a common presenting symptom in both pediatric ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and is associated with increased morbidity. Providing macronutrients can improve growth; likewise, identifying and correcting micronutrient deficiencies can improve comorbid conditions like osteopenia and anemia. Although many patients manipulate their diets to help treat their inflammatory bowel disease, only parenteral nutrition with bowel rest and exclusive enteral nutrition therapy have been shown effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.},

There are numerous methods for the assessment of nutritional status, but the gold standard has not yet been established. The aims of the study were to estimate the prevalence of undernutrition and to evaluate methods for routine nutritional assessment of active IBD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with active Crohn disease, 53 patients with active ulcerative colitis and 30 controls were included in the study. The nutritional status was assessed by extensive anthropometric measurements, percentage of weight loss in the past 1-6 months and biochemical markers of nutrition. RESULTS: All investigated nutritional parameters were significantly different in IBD patients compared to control subjects, except MCV, tryglicerides and serum total protein level. Serum albumin level and body mass index (BMI) were the most predictive parameters of malnutrition. According to different assessment methods the prevalence of undernutrition and severe undernutrition in patients with active IBD were 25.0%-69.7% and 1.3%-31.6%, respectively, while in the control subjects no abnormalities have been detected. There was no statistically significant difference of nutritional parameters between UC and CD patients except lower mid-arm muscle circumference in UC group. CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition is common in IBD patients. BMI and serum albumin are simple and convenient methods for the assessment of the nutritional status in IBD patients. Further studies with larger group of patients are necessary to elucidate the prevalence of malnutrition and the most accurate assessment methods in IBD patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Experimental colitis induced by chemical agents leads to upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in distant unaffected small intestine and to a decrease in nutrient absorption. To preclude any possible proximal diffusion of these chemicals, we designed a novel method for ulcer induction in the colon by electrocautery. METHODS: Under light anesthesia, a colonic ulcer was induced in rats by a special electrocautery probe introduced in the descending colon through the rectum allowing the injection of a controlled electrolytic current. A direct current (3-7 mA) was delivered through the electrodes for 30s and then for another 30s after reversing the polarity of the electrodes. Then, the probe was moved for a distance of +/-0.5 cm and the current injection was repeated. Rats were sacrificed at various time intervals after ulcer induction (3-96 h). Samples from colon and jejunum were taken for histological assessment and determination, by ELISA, of the levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). In other groups of animals, jejunal amino acid absorption was determined in vivo at 24 and 48 h post electrocautery. RESULTS: A colonic ulcer persisted for 72 h after cauterization. A significant upregulation of the levels of different cytokines was observed in the colon and jejunum post cauterization and persisted for at least 48 h. In the jejunum, IL-1beta increased from 81+/-9 to 652+/-110 (p<0.01) and 243+/-47 (p<0.05) pg/mg protein at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Similarly, jejunal TNF-alpha levels increased by approximately 2 folds at 24 and 48 h post ulcer induction (p<0.05). A similar but higher increase in cytokines was observed in the colon. Jejunal alanine absorption (0.2+/-0.02 micromol/20 min/cm) decreased significantly at 24 and 48 h after colitis induction (0.12+/-0.01 and 0.14+/-0.02, respectively; p<0.01). DISCUSSION: This model may be used as an alternative or a complement to chemical models of colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rifaximin, Food and Drug Administration approved for traveler's diarrhea, has been used in adult patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This retrospective review was undertaken to determine its role in the treatment of pediatric IBD. METHODS: A review of children with IBD, who were treated with rifaximin from 2005 to 2007 at our institution, was performed. Collected data included diagnosis, age, medication history, recent therapy, symptom, and interval to improvement. Response was rated as none, moderate, or optimum relief for each symptom. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were identified, 12 with Crohn disease and 11 with ulcerative colitis (UC) with a median age of 13 years. The most common complaints were diarrhea in 20 patients (87%), abdominal pain in 17 (74%), and bloody stools in 15 (65%). Rifaximin was given at doses ranging between 10 and 30 mg/kg (Table 1). Of the 20 patients who presented with diarrhea 5 (25%) had relief of diarrhea within 1 week of starting rifaximin and total of 12 patients (60%) experienced relief within 4 weeks. Abdominal pain resolved in 3 of 17 patients (17.6%) within 1 week and in 12 of 17 (70.6%) within 4 weeks. Visible bleeding resolved in 10 of 15 patients (66.7%) within 4 weeks of therapy (Table 2). Analysis of concurrent medications showed 61% experienced relief of symptoms when addition of rifaximin was the only meaningful treatment change. CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin was well-tolerated and showed favorable results. Larger doses of rifaximin were statistically better for abdominal pain. Further studies are needed to evaluate efficacy and optimal dosing of rifaximin in this population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In certain clinical situations, such as acute and severe episodes of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's Disease (CD), that do not respond to conventional intravenous steroid treatment, we need potent, fast-acting drugs to induce clinical remission and avoid surgery. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral tacrolimus treatment of acute and severe UC or CD to induce their remission, and also to assess its efficacy in delaying or avoiding surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a retrospective study that included all patients under 18 years of age with acute and severe bouts of CD (colonic or ileocolonic location) or UC who were treated with oral tacrolimus at our institution from January 1998 to December 2007. RESULTS: We included a total of 8 patients (4 males and 4 females), 6 presented with UC and 2 had CD. The mean age of our patients at the start of the treatment was 11.8 years (range 2.75-16.58 y) and the mean time from diagnosis to the start of tacrolimus therapy was 4 months (range 1-96 m). An initial response was obtained in 50% of patients. Plasma trough levels of tacrolimus remained between 5-11 ng/ml. Six of the eight patients (75%) required surgery. In one patient with UC and in another with CD, surgery was avoided. In 2 of the 6 patients with UC, surgery was postponed beyond 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus is useful in inducing clinical remission in patients with acute and severe bouts of UC or CD, and so can avoid or delay the surgery; it may also be used as a bridging agent until the new maintenance therapy with other immunosuppressants is effective.},

Although biological agents are alternative treatments, they may not be suitable or available to some patients. AIM: To review the evidence for use of nonbiological drugs in the treatment of patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines. METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed for English language publications with predetermined search criteria to identify relevant studies. RESULTS: Published evidence from uncontrolled series and controlled clinical trials has been used to produce a practical approach relevant to clinical practice which incorporates the indication, optimal dose, and side effects of various therapies including tacrolimus, methotrexate, thalidomide, tioguanine, mycophenolate mofotil, leucocyte apheresis, nutritional therapy, antibiotics, probiotics, allopurinol, rectal acetarsol and ciclosporin in the treatment of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Approaches to optimise thiopurine efficacy are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines may respond to alternative anti-inflammatory chemical molecules, but the evidence base for many of these alternatives is limited and further trials are needed.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory disorders of the intestinal tract with excessive production of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and reactive oxygen species. Although nitric oxide (NO) is reported to be involved in the onset and progression of IBDs, it remains controversial as to whether NO is toxic or protective in experimental colitis. We investigated the effects of oral nitrite as a NO donor on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis in mice. Mice were fed DSS in their drinking water with or without nitrite for up to 7days. The severity of colitis was assessed by disease activity index (DAI) observed over the experimental period, as well as by the other parameters, including colon lengths, hematocrit levels, and histological scores at day 7. DSS treatment induced severe colitis by day 7 with exacerbation in DAI and histological scores. We first observed a significant decrease in colonic nitrite levels and increase in colonic TNF-alpha expression at day 3 after DSS treatment, followed by increased colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and increased colonic expressions of both inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) at day 7. Oral nitrite supplementation to colitis mice reversed colonic nitrite levels and TNF-alpha expression to that of normal control mice at day 3, resulting in the reduction of MPO activity as well as iNOS and HO-1 expressions in colonic tissues with clinical and histological improvements at day 7. These results suggest that oral nitrite inhibits inflammatory process of DSS-induced experimental colitis by supplying nitrite-derived NO instead of impaired colonic NOS activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children in central and western Slovenia during a 12-year period (1994-2005). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients with newly diagnosed IBD during the period of 1994-2005 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: In the 12-year study period, 137 children received new diagnoses of IBD, 60% had Crohn disease (CD), 28% had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 12% had indeterminate colitis (IC). The mean annual incidence of IBD for the whole 12-year period was 4.03/100,000 children; for CD 2.42, for UC 1.14, and for IC 0.47. The annual incidence of IBD rose from 3.04 in the period 1994-1999 to 5.14 in the period 2000-2005. The incidences of CD, UC, and IC rose from 1.99, 0.77, and 0.28, respectively, in the first 6 years to 2.88, 1.57, and 0.69, respectively, in the second 6-year period. The most common type of CD at presentation was inflammatory. Pancolitis was the most frequent form of UC. Almost half of the patients had a severe form of CD at its onset. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of total pediatric IBD in central and western Slovenia is high and seems to be still rising. CD is the most prevalent form of IBD; its incidence is comparable with that reported in other central and western European countries. The incidences of UC and IC are rising more rapidly than the incidence of CD.},

   abstract = {Biological therapies are an important step in the management of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. In consideration of high cost and safety issues there is the need to have clear recommendations for their use. Despite the American Gastroenterological Association and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation have published exhaustive Inflammatory Bowel Disease guidelines, national guidelines may be necessary as cultural values, economical and legal issues may differ between countries. For these reasons the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Group for the study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease have decided to elaborate the Italian guidelines on the use of biologics in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The following items have been chosen: definitions of active, inactive, steroid dependent and resistant disease; measures of activity; anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy use in active steroid dependent and refractory luminal Crohn's Disease, in fistulising Crohn's Disease, in steroid dependent and resistant active Ulcerative Colitis; risk of cancer; risk of infections during anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy; special situations. These guidelines are based on evidence from relevant medical literature and clinical experience of a national working group.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have reported on the surgical outcomes of colectomy in pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients diagnosed with UC who underwent colectomy at UCSF between 1980 and 2005 to identify early (within 30 days) and later complications of surgery. RESULTS: Complete medical records were available for 31 patients [12.4 +/- 3.3 (range 6-19) years] with UC who underwent colectomy at UCSF Children's Hospital. Total colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) was performed in 21 of the 31 patients (12 without diverting ileostomy). Five of the 31 patients had an initial colectomy with IPAA and J-pouch performed later; 4 had an initial subtotal colectomy for urgent indications. Only one of 31 had IPAA with S-pouch. The median number of early postoperative complications was 1.0; 4 required additional surgery to treat complications. The most common early complications were small intestinal obstruction in 6 (19%) and wound infection in 4 (13%). Preoperative medications included corticosteroids in 25 (81%), 6-mercaptopurine/azathioprine in 10 (32%), and 5-aminosalicylates in 19 (61%). Medication exposure was not related to postoperative complications. Late complications included pouchitis in 12 (39%), anastomotic, anal, or rectal strictures in 5 (16%), and fistulas in 5 (16%); 1 (3%) was subsequently diagnosed as having Crohn disease. CONCLUSIONS: Postcolectomy morbidity is common among pediatric patients with UC. Preoperative medications were not associated with postoperative complications. Investigations to determine preoperative factors affecting surgical outcomes and long-term satisfaction following this surgery in a large pediatric cohort are needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The management of low-grade (LGD) and indefinite dysplasia (IND) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) remains controversial, as outcomes after a diagnosis of LGD or IND in previous studies vary widely. METHODS: All patients evaluated were from a single institution referral center who had a history of UC and a diagnosis of either LGD or IND between 1994 and 2008 as confirmed by 2 expert gastrointestinal (GI) pathologists. Data were collected by chart review of electronic and paper medical records. All patients who did not undergo a colectomy within 90 days of their dysplasia diagnosis were included in the final analysis. Hazard ratios for risk factors as well as incidence rates and Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to calculate the progression to high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or colorectal cancer (CRC). RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included in the analysis, of whom 2 patients with IND and 2 patients with LGD developed HGD or CRC over a mean duration of 49.8 months. In total, the incident rate for advanced neoplasia for all patients was 2.7 cases of HGD or CRC per 100 person-years at risk. For flat and polypoid LGD the incident rate of advanced neoplasia was 4.3 and 1.5 cases per 100 person-years at risk, respectively. Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) had an incident rate of 10.5 cases per 100 years of patient follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: We report a low rate of progression to HGD or CRC in patients who underwent surveillance for LGD or IND; polypoid dysplasia showed less risk of progression than flat dysplasia.},

   abstract = {Bacterial sensing is crucial for appropriate response by the innate and adaptive immune system against invading microorganisms. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in bacterial recognition, CARD15 and TLR4, increased the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a New Zealand Caucasian case-control cohort. We now consider the effects of SNPs in CD14, TLR9, and BPI, analyzed individually, in association with one another, and with SNPs in CARD15 or TLR4 in this same population group. SNPs in CD14 (c.-159 C>T), TLR9 (c.-1237T>C) and BPI (c.645A>G) showed no significant allele or genotype frequency differences between IBD cases and controls. Genotype-phenotype mapping reveals an association with BPI and ileocolonic Crohn's disease (CD) as well as an association with CD14 and early-onset ulcerative colitis (UC). Genotype interaction analyses using three different statistical approaches provided significant evidence of interaction for the following combinations: CARD15/TLR4 (CD and UC), CARD15/CD14 (CD and UC), CD14/TLR4 (UC only), and CD14/BPI (UC only). A trend for an association between BPI and TLR4 was observed in UC patients, but failed to reach statistical significance. Our findings support the idea of gene-gene interactions for genes involved in closely related pathways (i.e. bacterial detection). There is evidence that carrying two SNPs in genes may lead to statistical significance for genes and SNPs that do not otherwise confirm as risk alleles for disease aetiology when analysed alone.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fecal lactoferrin (FL) is a noninvasive biomarker that is elevated in Crohn disease (CD) compared to irritable bowel syndrome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate FL in identifying children with active versus inactive CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fresh stool samples were collected from children with CD scheduled for endoscopy or a clinic visit, and from new outpatients who were scheduled for colonoscopy. FL was determined using a polyclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Physical global assessment, endoscopic findings, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the Pediatric CD Activity Index (PCDAI) were recorded for patients with CD. The PCDAI scores symptoms, laboratory parameters, physical examination, and extraintestinal manifestations. A score of </=10 is inactive disease, 11 to 30 is mild active, and </=31 is moderate to severe active. RESULTS: Of 101 study patients (4- to 20-year-old, 66 boys), 31 had active CD, 23 had inactive CD, and 37 had noninflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) conditions. Four patients with ulcerative colitis and 6 patients with polyposis were excluded from analysis. FL was significantly elevated in CD versus non-IBD (P < 0.001) and in active versus inactive CD (P < 0.001). The PCDAI and ESR were higher in active CD than in inactive CD (both P < 0.001). Using an FL cutoff of 7.25 mug/g, FL has 100% sensitivity and 100% negative predictive value in detecting active CD. Using an FL cutoff level of 60 mug/g, FL had 84% sensitivity, 74% specificity, 81% positive predictive value, and 77% negative predictive value for detecting active CD. CONCLUSIONS: FL is a promising biomarker of active CD and may be more practical to use when it is not feasible to obtain all of the necessary clinical information for the PCDAI.},

   abstract = {Mucosal healing (MH) has emerged as an important treatment goal for patients with IBD. Historically, the therapeutic goals of induction and maintenance of clinical remission seemed insufficient to change the natural history of IBD. Evidence has now accumulated to show that MH can alter the course of IBD, as it is associated with sustained clinical remission, and reduced rates of hospitalization and surgical resection. In patients with ulcerative colitis, MH may represent the ultimate therapeutic goal because inflammation is limited to the mucosa. In patients with Crohn's disease, which is a transmural disease, MH could be considered as a minimum therapeutic goal. This Review focuses on the definition of MH and discusses the ability of each available IBD medication to induce and maintain MH. The importance of achieving MH is also discussed and literature that demonstrates improvement of disease course with MH is reviewed. Finally, we discuss how best to integrate the treatment end point of MH into clinical practice for the management of patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {THE AIM: The aim of this thesis was to elucidate more differences between a familial and sporadic inflammatory bowel disease by comparing certain clinical data. METHODS: We assessed 248 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) observed in 1994-2004 in the Academic Department of Gastroenterology at the Medical Faculty in Hradec Kralove. To get information about the defined characters we obtained from the questionary and the hospital data. RESULTS: We did not identify any relationship between the onset of the disease and a certain age group, yet males seem to be more prone to familial Crohn's disease. The more frequent familial form of Crohn's disease was the fibro-stenotic one. There were no differences in the onset of the disease. We did not prove the differences in extraintestinal signs, alergy and comorbidities. We did not find any differences in therapy response in relation to the type of nutrition (enteral, parenteral) and the administration of immunosupresive drugs. The biological therapy in sporadic and familial Crohn's disease did not differ either. Surgical intervention was more frequent in Crohn's patients compared to the patients with ulcerative colitis; yet no difference was identified between familial and sporadic cases. Appendectomy carried out before the onset of the disease was later diagnosed as Crohn's disease in more instances than ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSION: We did not prove significant differences comparing certain clinical data in familial and sporadic form of inflammatory bowel disease, yet males seem to be more prone to familial Crohn's disease. Small bowel was involved more often in familial form of Crohn's disease than in sporadic form.},

Although infrequent, acute pancreatitis, and less often chronic pancreatitis, may occur as a result of the disease itself or secondary to the medications used in the treatment. The increased incidence of acute pancreatitis in Crohn's disease can be explained based on the high predisposition to cholesterol as well as pigment stones as a result of ileal disease, anatomic abnormalities of the duodenum, immunologic disturbances associated with IBD, and, above all, to the side effects of many medications used in the treatment. Sulfasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid, azathioprine, and 6-mercaptopurine are well known to cause acute pancreatitis as a result of a possible idiosyncratic mechanism. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis share many clinical manifestations and treatment modalities. Nonspecific elevations of serum pancreatic enzymes in IBD make it difficult to avoid over diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, particularly in patients with Crohn's disease who suffer from abdominal pain often. The IBD-pancreas association is further reflected in many reports of exocrine as well as endocrine pancreatic insufficiency.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Leptin and adiponectin (APN) are adipokines produced by adipocytes that participate in the modulation of immune and inflammatory responses. In Crohn's disease (CD), fat wrapping surrounding the inflamed intestine produces high levels of leptin and APN. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), apoptosis resistance of lamina propria T lymphocytes (LPL-T) is one of the mechanisms that maintains chronic inflammation. We addressed the mechanism by which leptin and APN regulate inflammation and apoptosis in IBD. METHODS: Immune cell infiltration, several factors expressed by adipose tissue (AT), and spontaneous release of cytokines by adipocytes were measured. The presence of APN and leptin in intestinal mucosa was detected and their effect on LPL-T apoptosis, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 (SOCS3), Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, and cytokine production was studied. In addition, the effects of globular and high-molecular-weight (HMW) APN on LPL-T cytokine production and apoptosis were studied. RESULTS: Higher levels of several chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors were present in AT near active than near inactive disease. A significantly higher amount of inflammatory infiltrate was present in AT near active CD than near ulcerative colitis, controls, and near the inactive area of CD. There were no changes in the ratios of APN molecular weight in control and IBD adipocyte products. Leptin and APN inhibited anti-CD3-stimulated-LPL-T apoptosis and potentiated STAT3 phosphorylation, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL expression in IBD and control mucosa. However, SOCS3 expression was suppressed only in IBD. Both globular and HMW APN have similar effects on LPL-T cytokine production and apoptosis. Leptin and APN enhanced interleukin (IL)-10 production by anti-CD3-stimulated LPL-T in IBD only. APN, but not leptin, increased anti-CD3-induced IL-6 levels in LPL-T only in IBD patients. IL-10 exerts its anti-inflammatory activity in the presence of SOCS3 suppression by leptin or APN. CONCLUSION: Leptin and APN maintain the inhibition of anti-CD3-stimulated LPL-T apoptosis by enhancing Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL overexpression and promoting STAT3 phosphorylation while suppressing SOCS3.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet is a major factor in the etiology of colorectal cancer, with high fish consumption possibly decreasing colorectal cancer risk, as was shown in several observational studies. To date, no intervention trials have examined the possible beneficial effects of fish intake on colorectal cancer risk. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the effects of a 6-mo intervention with oil-rich or lean fish on apoptosis and mitosis within the colonic crypt. DESIGN: In a multicenter, randomized, controlled intervention trial, patients with colorectal polyps, inactive ulcerative colitis, or no macroscopic signs of disease were recruited (n = 242) and randomly allocated to receive dietary advice plus either 300 g oil-rich fish (salmon) per week (n = 82), 300 g lean fish (cod) per week (n = 78), or only dietary advice (DA) (n = 82). Apoptosis and mitosis were measured in colonic biopsy samples collected before and after intervention (n = 213). RESULTS: The total number of apoptotic cells per crypt did not increase in the salmon or cod group: -0.10 (95% CI: -0.36, 0.16) and -0.06 (95% CI: -0.32, 0.20), respectively, compared with the DA group. The total number of mitotic cells per crypt decreased nonsignificantly in the salmon group (-0.87; 95% CI: -2.41, 0.68) and in the cod group (-1.04; 95% CI: -2.62, 0.53) compared with the DA group. Furthermore, the distribution of mitosis within the crypt did not significantly change in either group. CONCLUSION: An increase in the consumption of either oil-rich or lean fish to 2 portions weekly over 6 mo does not markedly change apoptotic and mitotic rates in the colonic mucosa. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00145015.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to study fecal calprotectin in Scottish children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and compare its diagnostic accuracy with blood parameters. METHODS: Stool samples from 48 Scottish children (29 males, 19 females) had calprotectin measured at IBD diagnosis. The median age at diagnosis was 11.2 years (interquartile range [IQR] 8.7-13.0 years). There were 33 patients with Crohn's disease, 5 with ulcerative colitis, and 10 with IBD type unspecified. IBD was diagnosed by standard criteria. Calprotectin was measured using a commercially available kit (PhiCal Test) and 47/48 patients had comparative blood results available at diagnosis. RESULTS: The fecal calprotectin concentrations were raised in 96% (46/48) of patients studied. The median calprotectin value was 750 microg/g (IQR 235.8-1251 microug/g). In comparison with standard blood tests, 32/45 (71.1%) had abnormal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 19/38 (50.0%) had abnormal C-reactive protein, 29/46 (63.0%) had raised platelets, 12/45 (26.7%) had hypoalbuminemia, and 38/46 (82.6%) had abnormal hemoglobin. We identified 7/47 (14.9%) patients with raised calprotectin at diagnosis who did not have any abnormalities detected in the blood tests performed. All 48 patients (100%) had at least 1 abnormal blood test and/or raised calprotectin at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Calprotectin is significantly more likely to be raised than any commonly employed blood tests at IBD diagnosis. When used in combination with these bloods tests an abnormality was demonstrated in 1 or both tests in all patients at diagnosis in this study. Fecal calprotectin measurement is a significant advance when used contemporaneously and in addition to a routine panel of blood tests in the diagnosis of pediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: : A multicenter, double-blind study was conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of balsalazide in pediatric patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Sixty-eight patients, 5 to 17 years of age, with mild-to-moderate active UC based on the modified Sutherland UC activity index (MUCAI) were randomized to receive oral balsalazide 2.25 or 6.75 g/day for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was clinical improvement (reduction of the MUCAI score by > or =3 points from baseline). Clinical remission (MUCAI score of 0 or 1 for stool frequency) and histological improvement after 8 weeks were also assessed. Pharmacokinetic parameters for balsalazide, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid were determined at 2 weeks. Adverse events and laboratory changes were monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: : Clinical improvement was achieved by 45% and 37% of patients and clinical remission by 12% and 9% of patients receiving 6.75 and 2.25 g/day, respectively. Improvement in histologic grade was achieved by 8 of 16 (50%) and 3 of 10 (30%) patients receiving 6.75 and 2.25 g/day, respectively. No significant differences were seen in efficacy. Pharmacokinetics in 12 patients were characterized by large interpatient variability and low systemic exposure. Adverse events were similar between the treatment groups, the most common being headache and abdominal pain. No clinically significant changes were observed in laboratory values, including those indicative of hepatic or renal toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: : Balsalazide is well tolerated and improves the signs and symptoms of mild-to-moderate active UC in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subjective physician assessment is the cornerstone of routine ulcerative colitis (UC) management. Endoscopic and histologic assessment of UC provides objective measures of inflammatory disease activity. The level of agreement between physician impression of UC activity and endoscopic disease activity has not been evaluated. The aim was to assess the level of agreement between physician's clinical impression of UC disease activity and endoscopic and histologic findings of inflammation. METHODS: Using the Medical Archival Retrieval System at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, we reviewed clinical information on all UC patients between 1995 and 2008 who had clinic visits recorded prior to colonoscopy. Clinical UC disease activity was defined by the physician's clinical impression and the endoscopic and histologic activity by colonoscopy with biopsy. The level of agreement between colonoscopy assessment of UC with histologic and clinical assessment was determined by sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the kappa coefficient. RESULTS: There were 369 UC patients who had a clinic visit proximate to a colonoscopy. The mean age of patients was 46 +/- 16 years (50% female). The performance of clinical impression in recognizing disease activity, as determined by endoscopy, was relatively poor: sensitivity = 56.0%, predictive value negative = 56.8%, kappa coefficient = 0.35. In contrast, the performance of histological evaluation in recognizing disease activity was markedly better: sensitivity = 93.5%, predictive value negative = 89.1%, kappa coefficient = 0.70. CONCLUSIONS: The physician's clinical impression of UC activity shows poor agreement with endoscopy and histology, with over one-third of patients with chronic inflammation underrecognized by clinical impression. The consequences of underestimated UC activity by clinical assessment may include undertreatment of active disease and uncontrolled chronic inflammation.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and both diseases lead to high morbidity and health care costs. Complex interactions between the immune system, enteric commensal bacteria and host genotype are thought to underlie the development of IBD although the precise aetiology of this group of diseases is still unknown. The understanding of the composition and complexity of the normal gut microbiota has been greatly aided by the use of molecular methods and is likely to be further increased with the advent of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approaches, which will allow an increasingly more holistic assessment of the microbiome with respect to both diversity and function of the commensal gut microbiota. Studies thus far have shown that the intestinal microbiota drives the development of the gut immune system and can induce immune homeostasis as well as contribute to the development of IBD. Probiotics which deliver some of the beneficial immunomodulatory effects of the commensal gut microbiota and induce immune homeostasis have been proposed as a suitable treatment for mild to moderate IBD. This review provides an overview over the current understanding of the commensal gut microbiota, its interactions with the mucosal immune system and its capacity to induce both gut homeostasis as well as dysregulation of the immune system. Bacterial-host events, including interactions with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on epithelial cells and dendritic cells (DCs) and the resultant impact on immune responses at mucosal surfaces will be discussed.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease involving superficial inflammation of the mucosa of the colon, rectum, and anus, sometimes including the terminal ileum. When in clinical activity, the disease is characterized by various daily evacuations containing blood, mucus and/or pus alternating periods of remission. OBJECTIVE: To compare nutritional parameters (dietary, biochemical and anthropometric) among patients with ulcerative colitis followed up on an outpatient basis over a period of 1 year and during periods of intestinal inflammatory activity and remission. METHODS: Sixty-five patients were studied over a period of 1 year and divided into two groups: group 1 with inflammatory disease activity (n = 24), and group 2 without disease activity (n = 41). Anthropometric measures, biochemical parameters, quantitative food intake, and qualitative food frequency were analyzed. RESULTS: A significant reduction in body mass index and weight and in the intake of energy, proteins, lipids, calcium, iron and phosphorus was observed in the group with inflammatory activity (group 1) when compared to the period of clinical remission. The most affected food groups were cereals, legumes, oils, and fats. In contrast, in group 2 significant differences in triceps and sub scapular skin fold thickness, total protein, hemoglobin and hematocrit were observed between the first and final visit. Calcium and vitamin B6 intake, as well as the consumption of legumes, meat and eggs, and sugar and sweets, was significantly higher than on the first visit. CONCLUSION: Patients with ulcerative colitis followed up on an outpatient basis tend to be well nourished. However, the nutritional aspects studied tend to worsen during the period of inflammatory disease activity.},

The aim of this study was to compare the body composition of outpatients with IBD during remission and active phase. In order to evaluate disease activity we used Crohn's Disease Activity Index for Crohn's disease (CD) patients and Lichtiger's Index for ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. All patients underwent the analysis of BMI, arm muscle area (AMA) and triceps plus subscapula skinfold thickness (TST+SST) to identify total, muscle and fat mass, respectively. In total 102 patients were evaluated (CD, n 50; UC, n 52) and the majority was young women. Malnutrition according to BMI was found in 14.0 % of patients with CD and 5.7 % of UC patients. Muscle mass depletion was detected in more than half of the CD and UC patients. The BMI, TST+SST and AMA values were lower in the active phase only in CD patients (P < 0.05). Fat mass depletion was associated with active phase in both CD and UC patients. Body composition parameters obtained using BMI, TST+SST and AMA were not correlated with the presence of fistula in CD patients (P>0.05). In conclusion, patients without signs of malnutrition had fat mass depletion especially in the active phase and muscle mass depletion occurred both in CD and UC patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of oral beclomethasone diproprionate (BDP) in inducing clinical and endoscopic remission in children with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis (UC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with active UC (pancolitis or left-sided colitis) were enrolled in an open-labeled, randomized, head-to-head study. Group 1 (n = 15) received oral BDP (5 mg/day) for 8 weeks, followed by maintenance therapy with oral mesalazine, 5-aminosalycilate (5-ASA); group 2 (n = 15) received oral 5-ASA (80 mg . kg . day). Assessments were carried out (at 4, 8, and 12 weeks) for clinical scores and for endoscopy (at 12 weeks), together with a final clinical assessment after 1 year follow-up. RESULTS: Patients treated with BDP showed a significant reduced clinical activity within 4 weeks (P < 0.001 vs pretreatment values) with 80% achieving clinical remission compared with 33% treated with only 5-ASA (P < 0.025). A significant reduction in clinical activity was achieved by 5-ASA after 8 weeks. Comparing clinical activity between BDP and 5-ASA, the former did significantly better at 8 (P < 0.003) and at 12 weeks (P < 0.015). In 73% of BDP-treated patients colonoscopy showed remission compared with 27% of 5-ASA (P < 0.025). Both treatments led to better scores compared with pretreatment values (P < 0.001, both). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was significantly reduced (P < 0.025 or less) with both treatments, whereas C-reactive protein dropped significantly (P < 0.02) only in BDP. CONCLUSIONS: Oral BDP was well tolerated and acts significantly faster and more effectively than 5-ASA in inducing clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in pediatric mild-to-moderate UC.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that starch-entrapped microspheres would produce favourable fermentation profiles and microbial shifts during in vitro fermentation with the faecal microbiota from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In vitro fermentation was carried out using a validated, dynamic, computer-controlled model of the human colon (Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek gastro-intestinal model-2) after inoculation with pooled faeces from healthy individuals, patients with inactive IBD (Crohn's disease (CD)) or patients with active IBD (ulcerative colitis (UC)). Starch-entrapped microspheres fermented more slowly and produced more butyrate than fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) when fermented with the faecal microbiota from patients with active UC. When fermented with the microbiota from patients with inactive CD, starch-entrapped microspheres also fermented more slowly but produced similar amounts of butyrate compared with FOS. Starch-entrapped microspheres showed a greater ability to maintain a low pH during simulated-distal colon conditions compared with FOS. After fermentation with the microbiota from inactive CD patients, starch-entrapped microspheres resulted in lower concentrations of some potentially harmful gut bacteria, included in Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Fusobacterium and Veillonella, compared with FOS. These findings suggest that slow fermenting starch-entrapped microspheres may induce a favourable colonic environment in patients with IBD through high butyrate production, maintenance of low pH in the distal colon and inhibition of the growth of potentially harmful bacteria.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) status and its relation to disease phenotype in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 301 Scottish patients with early-onset IBD-197 Crohn disease (CD), 76 ulcerative colitis (UC), 28 indeterminate colitis (IC)-and 78 healthy control individuals were studied. ASCA status (IgA, IgG) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ASCA status was then analyzed in relation to CD phenotype. RESULTS: Patients with CD had a higher prevalence of ASCA than patients with UC and healthy controls: 82/197 versus 12/76, odds ratio (OR) 3.80 (1.93-7.50) and 82/197 versus 6/78, OR 8.56 (3.55-20.62), respectively. Univariate analysis showed that positive ASCA status was associated with oral CD (17/25 vs 59/153, OR 3.39 [1.38-8.34]), perianal CD (39/77 vs 38/108, OR 1.89 [1.04-3.44]) and the presence of granulomata (63/132 vs 15/52, OR 2.25 [1.13-4.48]) and also with markers of disease severity: raised C-reactive protein (44/90 vs 12/49, OR 2.95[1.36-6.37]), hypoalbuminemia (44/85 vs 20/74, OR 2.28[1.19-4.37]), and surgery (27/49 vs 54/147, OR 2.11 [1.10-4.06]). From multivariate analysis, the presence of oral disease (adjusted P = 0.001, OR 22.22 [3.41-142.86]) and hypoalbuminemia (adjusted P = 0.01, OR 4.78 [1.40-16.39]) was found to be independently associated with ASCA status. No association was demonstrated between ASCA and IBD candidate genes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD had a higher prevalence of ASCA than did other patients with IBD. ASCA status described patients with CD who had a specific phenotype, showing an association with markers of disease severity and oral CD involvement.},

   abstract = {The current paradigm of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), involves the interaction between environmental factors in the intestinal lumen and inappropriate host immune responses in genetically predisposed individuals. The intestinal mucosal barrier has evolved to maintain a delicate balance between absorbing essential nutrients while preventing the entry and responding to harmful contents. In IBD, disruptions of essential elements of the intestinal barrier lead to permeability defects. These barrier defects exacerbate the underlying immune system, subsequently resulting in tissue damage. The epithelial phenotype in active IBD is very similar in CD and UC. It is characterized by increased secretion of chloride and water, leading to diarrhea, increased permeability via both the transcellular and paracellular routes, and increased apoptosis of epithelial cells. The main cytokine that seems to drive these changes is tumor necrosis factor alpha in CD, whereas interleukin (IL)-13 may be more important in UC. Therapeutic restoration of the mucosal barrier would provide protection and prevent antigenic overload due to intestinal "leakiness." Here we give an overview of the key players of the intestinal mucosal barrier and review the current literature from studies in humans and human systems on mechanisms underlying mucosal barrier dysfunction in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for developing ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated colorectal cancer (CRC). Several studies have shown that extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) might possess anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and antiapoptotic effects. We have evaluated EVOO diet effects on the severity of repeated colitis-associated CRC. METHODS: Six-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomized into two dietary groups: sunflower oil (SFO) and EVOO diets, both at 10%. Mice were exposed to 15 cycles of 0.7% dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) for 1 week followed by distilled water for 10 days. After, the rats were sacrificed and colonic damage was both histologically and biochemically assessed. RESULTS: Disease activity index (DAI) was significantly higher on SFO vs. EVOO diet at the end of the experimental period. EVOO-fed mice showed less incidence and multiplicity of tumors than in those SFO-fed mice. beta-catenin immunostaining was limited to cell membranes in control groups, whereas translocation from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm and/or nucleus was showed in DSS-treated groups and its expression was higher in SFO-fed animals. Cytokine production was significantly enhanced in SFO-fed mice, while this increase was not significant in EVOO-fed mice. Conversely, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxidase synthase (iNOS) expression were significantly lower in the animal group fed with EVOO than in the SFO group. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that EVOO diet has protective/preventive effect in the UC-associated CRC. This beneficial effect was correlated with a better DAI, a minor number of dysplastic lesions, a lower beta-catenin immunoreactivity, a proinflammatory cytokine levels reduction, a non modification of p53 expression and, COX-2 and iNOS reduction in the colonic tissue.},

The effectiveness of the probiotic treatment was assessed from changes in patient's stool pattern, body composition, and selected biochemical indicators of disease activity and nutritional status. Fifty patients entered consecutively in the trial between December 2005-June 2009 (CONTROL GROUP: 29; Treatment Group: 21). Twenty of them completed treatment with probiotics. Effectiveness of regular pharmacological treatment was recorded with 24 control patients. Thirty-six days of probiotic treatment per patient were accumulated. Probiotic treatment obedience rate was 99.3%. Five days of treatment were lost due to non-availability of the product. No adverse reactions were reported after probiotic treatment. Two deaths were recorded after completion of the study, one on each group. Improvement in the quality of the stools [RR Relative risk: 1.69; 95% IC: 0.87-3.27]; frequency [RR: 1.35; 95% IC: 0.15-11.90]; and volume [RR: 1.11; 95% IC: 0.16-7.63] was observed in treated patients, although biological variability prevented these trends to become statistically significant. Probiotic treatment also resulted in reduction of occurrence of nocturnal depositions [RR: 1.75; 95% IC: 0.53-5.73]. Probiotic treatment prevented the onset of undesirable changes in stool pattern of treated patients who presented free of symptoms, but observed effect was no superior to that of medication administered. Probiotic treatment did not influence upon presence of blood in stools. Probiotic treatment also resulted in reduction of disease activity and ESR Erythro-sedimentation rate, respectively [Change in the Clinical Activity Index: CONTROL GROUP: -1.1 +/- 3.2 vs. Treatment Group: -4.1 +/- 3.3; p < 0.05; Change in ESR: CONTROL GROUP: 3.6 +/- 16.4 vs. Treatment Group: -6.7 +/- 15.6; p < 0.05]. Adjuvant probiotic treatment resulted in increase of body weight, at the expenses of increase of MAMC Mid-arm Muscle Circumference and sum of skinfolds. Probiotic effect upon body weight was not attributed to increased food intakes in treated patients. In spite of clinical heterogeneity associated to mucosal damage in UC, probiotic treatment might result in beneficial effects upon patient's stool pattern, body composition, and selected biochemical indicators of disease activity. Invariance of food intakes could imply that observed changes in response variables were not the result of a placebo effect of used probiotic combination.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for developing coronary artery disease. An increase in inflammatory cytokines may result in a decrease in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) enzyme activity, leading to a characteristic lipoprotein profile with increased triglycerides and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels as seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Similar to SLE, patients with IBD have high circulatory levels of inflammatory cytokines. However, in these patients characteristic lipoprotein profiles have not been reported. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to identify and describe dyslipidemia and lipoprotein profiles in an IBD patient population. METHODS: Medical records of patients diagnosed with IBD (Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]) at an academic medical center between 2000 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed for lipoprotein lipid measurements, serum albumin levels, risk factors, and treatment to modify lipoprotein concentrations. The lipoprotein guidelines and risk factors are based on the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults. Only patients with documented IBD diagnosis and lipoprotein profiles are included in the study. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006 population database was used for control values. RESULTS: A total of 393 patients (152 men and 241 women) diagnosed with IBD (188 CD and 205 UC) who were not on statins qualified for the study. Patients were grouped on the basis of gender (male and female) and IBD disease type (CD and UC). Compared with the male NHANES samples (with similar mean age and body mass index), total cholesterol and HDL-C were significantly lower and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides were significantly greater in male patients with IBD. In female patients with IBD, the mean values for total cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglycerides were significantly lower and LDL-C significantly greater compared with the female NHANES samples. CONCLUSION: Given low levels of HDL-C and increased levels of LDL-C, a more aggressive approach in profiling and treating dyslipidemia seems warranted in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are immunologically mediated with genetic and environmental influences. Genetic factors include defective immunoregulation, mucosal integrity/repair and bacterial killing. Commensal bacteria activate pathogenic bacterial antigen-specific effector T cells that cause chronic inflammation in genetically susceptible hosts but induce protective immune responses in normal subjects. Both host and microbial specificities are important. Some bacterial species are aggressive, some are neutral and others protective, but each species has different effects in various hosts. Molecular techniques demonstrate contraction of certain bacterial populations in IBD, especially clostridial subsets, and expansion of others, including Enterobacteriaceae. The balance of beneficial and detrimental bacterial species determines homeostasis vs. inflammation; this balance can be manipulated by antibiotics, probiotics and prebiotics to treat and prevent relapses of IBD. Adherent/invasive Escherichia coli that adhere to and invade epithelial cells and resist killing by macrophages are increased in ileal CD. HYPOTHESIS: Invasive, translocating, intracellular commensal bacteria induce Th1 and Th17 responses that cause CD in susceptible individuals with genetically determined innate immune defects. UC is caused by bacterial metabolic products that induce epithelial injury by blocking epithelial metabolism or overwhelming the genetically susceptible host's ability to degrade reactive oxygen species.},

Thirteen patients (5 women and 8 men; mean age 31.8 years; mean BMI 19.0 kg/m(2)) and 10 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. The resting energy expenditure (mREE) levels were determined by indirect calorimetry. The mREEs of the UC patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls (26.4 +/- 3.6 vs 21.8 +/- 1.7 kcal/kg/day), although the mREEs of the UC patients were almost the same as the predicted REEs (pREEs) calculated by the Harris-Benedict equation (26.4 +/- 2.4 kcal/kg/day vs 26.5 +/- 2.6 kcal/kg/day). The mREE/pREE ratio, which reflects stress, was 1.0 +/- 0.15. In the UC patients, a significant correlation was observed between the mREEs and the clinical activity index. In conclusion, UC patients showed a hyper-metabolic status as evaluated by their mREE/body weight. Energy expenditure was significantly correlated with disease activity. From our observations, we recommend that nutritional management with more than 30-35 kcal/ideal body weight/day (calculated by the mREE x activity factor) may be optimal for active severe or moderate ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Low bone mineral density (BMD) has recently been recognized as a potential health problem in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our aim was to investigate the familial resemblance of BMD in pediatric patients with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this population-based study from western Sweden, we assessed 144 children with IBD, 83 with ulcerative colitis, 45 with Crohn disease, 16 with indeterminate colitis, and their parents (136 mothers and 130 fathers) with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). After adjustment for sex, age, weight, height, and parental IBD, we correlated the BMD of the patients to the BMD of their mothers, fathers, and the midparent value ([mother's BMD + father's BMD]/2) at different skeletal sites and calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) to evaluate the extent of familial resemblance. RESULTS: The BMD of the children with IBD was clearly related to the BMD of their parents. The strongest correlation was found in the femoral neck with r = 0.55 (P < 0.001, 95% CI 0.41-0.66) between BMD of the children and the midparent value. The group of children with IBD had an odds ratio of 5.96 for decreased BMD (lumbar spine z score < -1 standard deviation) given that decreased BMD was diagnosed in both parents. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that BMD in children and adolescents with IBD is significantly related to that of their parents. In a clinical setting, it may be helpful to assess the parents of children with IBD with DEXA to interpret the children's DEXA measurements.},

   abstract = {In patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis parenteral nutrition (PN) is indicated when enteral nutrition is not possible or should be avoided for medical reasons. In Crohn's patients PN is indicated when there are signs/symptoms of ileus or subileus in the small intestine, scars or intestinal fistulae. PN requires no specific compounding for chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. In both diseases it should be composed of 55-60% carbohydrates, 25-30% lipids and 10-15% amino acids. PN helps in the correction of malnutrition, particularly the intake of energy, minerals, trace elements, deficiency of calcium, vitamin D, folic acid, vitamin B12, and zinc. Enteral nutrition is clearly superior to PN in severe, acute pancreatitis. An intolerance to enteral nutrition results in an indication for total PN in complications such as pseudocysts, intestinal and pancreatic fistulae, and pancreatic abscesses or pancreatic ascites. If enteral nutrition is not possible, PN is recommended, at the earliest, 5 days after admission to the hospital. TPN should not be routinely administered in mild acute pancreatitis or nil by moth status <7 days, due to high costs and an increased risk of infection. The energy requirements are between 25 and 35 kcal/kg body weight/day. A standard solution including lipids (monitoring triglyceride levels!) can be administered in acute pancreatitis. Glucose (max. 4-5 g/kg body weight/day) and amino acids (about 1.2-1.5 g/kg body weight/day) should be administered and the additional enrichment of TPN with glutamine should be considered in severe, progressive forms of pancreatitis.},

   abstract = {The epithelium in inflamed intestinal segments of patients with Crohn's disease is characterized by a reduction of tight junction strands, strand breaks, and alterations of tight junction protein content and composition. In ulcerative colitis, epithelial leaks appear early due to micro-erosions resulting from upregulated epithelial apoptosis and in addition to a prominent increase of claudin-2. Th1-cytokine effects by interferon-gamma in combination with TNFalpha are important for epithelial damage in Crohn's disease, while interleukin-13 (IL-13) is the key effector cytokine in ulcerative colitis stimulating apoptosis and upregulation of claudin-2 expression. Focal lesions caused by apoptotic epithelial cells contribute to barrier disturbance in IBD by their own conductivity and by confluence toward apoptotic foci or erosions. Another type of intestinal barrier defect can arise from alpha-hemolysin harboring E. coli strains among the physiological flora, which can gain pathologic relevance in combination with proinflammatory cytokines under inflammatory conditions. On the other hand, intestinal barrier impairment can also result from transcellular antigen translocation via an initial endocytotic uptake into early endosomes, and this is intensified by proinflammatory cytokines as interferon-gamma and may thus play a relevant role in the onset of IBD. Taken together, barrier defects contribute to diarrhea by a leak flux mechanism (e.g., in IBD) and can cause mucosal inflammation by luminal antigen uptake. Immune regulation of epithelial functions by cytokines may cause barrier dysfunction not only by tight junction impairments but also by apoptotic leaks, transcytotic mechanisms, and mucosal gross lesions.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine current evidence for dietary supplementation with zinc and other micronutrients for primary prevention of multiple micronutrient deficiencies that are known to result from therapies used in the treatment of gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological observations and clinical findings have strengthened the concept that both nutritional deficiencies and nutritional excesses impair the gastrointestinal response(s) and alter susceptibility to inflammation and other diseases. The interaction of micronutrient intake, biochemical indicators of nutritional status, and four specific gastrointestinal inflammation states are reviewed. These conditions include celiac disease and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies resulting from the sustained adherence to a gluten-free diet; micronutrient nutrition as an important determinant of immunity for two major types of inflammatory bowel disease: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies which may be exacerbated by the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. SUMMARY: For each inflammation 'state', enhancement of micronutrient status can improve immunocompetance and minimize therapeutic side-effects. The impact of single-micronutrient deficiencies on immune responses, and the possible impact of uncorrected micronutrient status are discussed.},

   abstract = {Nutrition plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) primarily in prevention and treatment of malnutrition and growth failure. Furthermore, in Crohn disease (CD), nutrition can induce remission, maintain remission, and prevent relapse. Malnutrition is common in IBD and the mechanisms involved include decreased food intake, malabsorption, increased nutrient loss, increased energy requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions. At the time of diagnosis, up to 85% of pediatric patients with CD and 65% of those with ulcerative colitis (UC) have weight loss. Growth failure occurs in 15% to 40% of children with IBD and is less common in UC compared with CD, both at diagnosis and during follow-up. In CD, nutritional therapy with enteral formulas induces remission at a rate comparable with that achieved with steroids. In adults with CD, limited information suggests that enteral nutrition (EN) may play a role in maintenance of remission. In children with CD colitis, one study suggested that children without colitis respond better to EN than children with colitis, and another study found no such difference but reported a trend toward earlier relapse in those with isolated colonic involvement. Finally, nutrition may play a role in IBD via the possible protective effect of breastfeeding against UC and CD. In summary, although only CD may benefit from nutrition as primary therapy for remission induction and possibly maintenance of remission, nutrition plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in IBD, and may have a protective role, via the effect of breast-feeding on disease occurrence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids remain one of the most popular medication choices for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. While corticosteroids may improve symptoms, they do not always result in mucosal healing and have significant adverse effects. Steroids which act topically, with less systemic side-effects may be more desirable. Oral budesonide, a topically acting corticosteroid with extensive first pass hepatic metabolism, is effective in Crohn's disease and in enema formulation for left-sided ulcerative colitis. Data are limited regarding the role of oral budesonide in ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the safety and efficacy of oral budesonide for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searching of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed. Two authors independently reviewed all identified titles and abstracts. Full text articles of all potentially relevant studies were retrieved. Reference lists of review articles were searched in an attempt to identify additional studies. Abstracts of the major gastroenterology scientific meetings, held over the past 3 years, were hand searched. The ClinicalTrials.gov website as well as the Cochrane Registry of Controlled Trials was searched to identify any ongoing trials. Direct communication with pharmaceutical manufacturers was established to identify any ongoing or unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis, with either a parallel arm or cross-over design, were considered eligible for inclusion. There were no exclusions based on patient age or the type, dose or duration of budesonide therapy. The primary outcome was the induction of clinical remission in ulcerative colitis. Secondary outcomes included clinical, histologic and endoscopic improvement, endoscopic mucosal healing, change in disease activity index scores, adverse events and study withdrawals. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Studies were reviewed for eligibility, data were extracted and quality assessed by 2 independent investigators. It was not possible to perform a meta-analysis of the included studies due to significant heterogeneity, with each study comparing budesonide to a different control medication. MAIN RESULTS: Three studies met the inclusion criteria. Oral budesonide was significantly less likely to induce clinical remission than oral mesalamine after 8 weeks of therapy (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91). There was no significant benefit of oral budesonide in comparison to placebo for inducing clinical remission after 4 weeks of treatment (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.39). A small pilot study reported no statistically significant difference in endoscopic remission between budesonide and prednisolone (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.42). The study was small and not powered to evaluate the impact of budesonide on clinical remission. Suppression of plasma cortisol was significantly more common in prednisolone treated patients (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.33). Two multicenter studies are ongoing. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At present, there is no evidence to recommend the clinical use of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis. Mesalamine is superior to budesonide for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract and is broadly classified into Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In the last decade, our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of this group of disorders has been improved. More specifically, recent development of biologics and use of immunomodulator agents in IBD have made it possible to robustly control mucosal inflammation and heal mucosal ulcerations and thus provide an opportunity to potentially modify disease course and prevent complications and future surgery. However, unfortunately we have not identified reliable, sensitive and specific markers to predict disease course and to identify those patients with aggressive and progressive course that would benefit from early use of biologics to prevent future complication and surgery. Thus, optimal medical management of IBD has remained multifaceted and individualized. Our primary therapeutic goals have remained unchanged and are to: [1] improve patient quality of life by treating flare ups [induction of remission], maintaining remission, and treating symptoms like diarrhea; [2] predict and prevent/treat complication; [3] prevent/treat nutritional deficiency and maintain optimal nutrition, [4] provide appropriate psychosocial support, and of course [5] attempt to modify disease course in those with aggressive disease. We can achieve these goals by appropriate use of therapeutic agents that include 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, antibiotics, nutritional support, and the biologic agents. Information from well designed double blind placebo controlled trials combined with knowledge of the potential impact of patient and disease characteristics on disease course which can assist us to individualized treatment plan will be the guide for us to appropriately use these therapeutic agents. For example, age of the onset of the disease, patient gender and race, mode of the disease presentation, disease location, disease-associated complications such as perianal disease/fistula, and serology and genetic markers can all help to individualize disease treatment. These factors can help to determine whether one should start with 5-ASA/antibiotic/steroid [step-up where there is no risk factors for aggressive disease course] or whether one should initiate biologic therapy at diagnosis [top-down approach], and whether it is most advisable to use monotherapy with biologic treatment [e.g. in young, Caucasian male or elderly] or use a combination therapy with a biologic and an immunomodulator. Ongoing research promises, in a near future, development of more robust set of markers to be able to model disease behavior to more accurately predict disease course and thus decide on therapeutic approach with most appropriate efficacy/risk ratio for a given patient. Furthermore, current basic laboratory research has provided a large number of potential therapeutic targets to treat IBD with new promising highly specific and targeted agents.},

The aim of this study was to assess whether IS co-treatment is useful in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on scheduled IFX infusions. METHODS: 121 consecutive patients with IBD (23 UC, 98 CD) treated by IFX and who received at least 6 months of IS co-treatment (azathioprine (AZA) or methotrexate (MTX)) were studied. In each patient, the IFX treatment duration was divided into semesters which were independently analysed regarding IBD activity. RESULTS: Semesters with IS (n=265) and without IS (n=319) were analysed. IBD flares, perianal complications and switch to adalimumab were less frequently observed in semesters with IS than in those without IS (respectively: 19.3% vs 32.0%, p=0.003; 4.1% vs 11.8%, p=0.03; 1.1% vs 5.3%, p=0.006). Maximal C-reactive protein (CRP) level and IFX dose/kg observed during the semesters were lower in semesters with IS. Within semesters with IS, IBD flares and perianal complications were less frequently observed in semesters with AZA than in those with MTX. In multivariate analysis, IS co-treatment was associated with a decreased risk of IBD flare (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.79) CONCLUSION: In patients with IBD receiving IFX maintenance therapy, IS co-treatment is associated with reduced IBD activity, IFX dose and switch to adalimumab. In this setting, co-treatment with AZA seems to be more effective than co-treatment with MTX. Benefit of such a combination treatment has to be balanced with potential risks, notably infections and cancers.},

A fluorescent in situ hybridization technique was applied to colonic biopsies to assess the microbiota composition of the crypts and crypt abscesses. RESULTS: Crypts colonized by bacteria were observed in 42.9% and 3.6% of ASLC and IBD patients, respectively (P = 0.019). Crypt abscesses colonized by bacteria were observed in 28.6% and 0.0% of ASLC and IBD patients, respectively (P = 0.035). CONCLUSION: These results do not support the hypothesis that crypt abscesses in IBD are the result of localized dysbiosis arising from persistence of living bacteria colonizing the crypts.},

   abstract = {Despite advances in our understanding of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis and increased ability to treat patients with severe and refractory disease, patients continue to suffer from disease complications, and increasing numbers of both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients are admitted annually in the USA. The rapid evolution in IBD medications and treatment paradigms has contributed to a disparity in clinical care which may vary between expert centers routinely treating large numbers of IBD patients and hospitals with low annual IBD admissions. High-volume centers handling in excess of 150 IBD annual admissions have improved operative and inpatient outcomes compared with hospitals caring for IBD patients less frequently. Although the precise reason for this disparity in clinical outcomes is not known, we hypothesize that expert centers provide superior IBD supportive therapy. This supportive care includes additional diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to help patients achieve optimal outcomes. We review information regarding disparities in the quality of IBD clinical care then focus on supportive therapy for IBD patients, including diagnostic approaches to identify confounding factors contributing to poor IBD outcome, supportive therapeutic approaches to optimize the outcome in hospitalized IBD patients, and future directions exploring brain-body interaction in the treatment of pain, stress and sleep deprivation in patients suffering from IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is increased in inflamed colonic mucosa and has a role in immune regulation and apoptosis resistance. Fecal OPG may be useful in predicting corticosteroid resistance in hospitalized children with severe ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed to determine whether fecal OPG predicts the need for second-line therapies in children hospitalized for UC. METHODS: We included 83 children with UC admitted for intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Children were classified as responders/nonresponders based on the need for therapy escalation. Fecal OPG results were compared with those of four other fecal markers. RESULTS: Of the enrolled children, seven had day 1 samples only, 53 children had day 3 samples only, and 23 had both. Twenty-two children failed corticosteroid therapy and required infliximab (n = 20) or colectomy (n = 2). On the third treatment day the median fecal OPG levels were significantly higher in the nonresponders group compared with the responders: 77 pmol/L (interquartile range [IQR] 27-137) versus 13 pmol/L (3-109); P = 0.007. The best day 3 fecal OPG cutoff to predict second-line therapy was >50 pmol/L with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 69% (area under the receiver operator curve [ROC] of 0.70%-95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.82). Fecal OPG was superior to day 3 fecal calprotectin, lactoferrin, and S100A12 as a predictor of corticosteroid nonresponse, but equivalent to the less commonly used M2-pyruvate kinase. CONCLUSIONS: Day 3 fecal OPG may guide the decision to institute second-line therapy in children with severe UC. The role of OPG in the inflammatory response in pediatric UC deserves further study.},

   abstract = {This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and 1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants. Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: 5-ASA in a pH sensitive tablet (Asacol) is administered as three doses/day to treat ulcerative colitis. Once daily dosing may improve patient adherence. Simulation of colonic levels of 5-ASA can be used to compare dosing regimens. AIM: To create a dynamic model of colonic concentrations of delayed-release 5-aminosalicylic acid (Asacol). METHODS: Using published data, we created a computer model with STELLA software to simulate amounts of colonic 5-ASA in the total colon, right, transverse, descending and sigmoid/rectum after daily and three time/day Asacol. RESULTS: The model predicted similar total and regional amounts of 5-ASA with both regimens. Distribution of 5-ASA was 38% in the right colon, 33% in the transverse colon and 14% each in the descending and sigmoid/rectal colon. Simulated increases in colonic motility and defecation rate exaggerated this 5-ASA distribution, resulting in negligible amounts of 5-ASA in the sigmoid/rectal region. CONCLUSIONS: This computer model suggests that Asacol can be administered as a single daily dose. The model supports experimental and clinical observations that alternate dose or route of administration may be necessary to achieve adequate 5-ASA amounts in the distal colon during acute exacerbations of ulcerative colitis. This simulation cannot account for all sources of variability in the clinical setting, but provides a rationale for further investigation.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 21 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) received 5 mg/kg of infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14. The following parameters were evaluated: clinical manifestations; activity indices of IBD, including the Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index for Crohn disease, the Lightiger Colitis Activity Index and the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for ulcerative colitis, and the modified Harvey-Bradshaw Index for Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis; and the reduction or suspension of corticosteroid use. RESULTS: All of the patients had improvements in clinical manifestations after the first infusion of infliximab. At week 22, 18 of 21 (85.7%) patients were categorized as being in remission, 3 of 21 (14.3%) patients were categorized as having clinical improvement, and none of the patients were categorized as having no response. There was a statistically significant difference in all of the IBD activity indices at weeks 2, 6, 14, and 22 compared with time 0. The corticosteroid use was completely discontinued in 6 of 15 patients by week 22. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is effective in the treatment of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents up to week 22.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dietary linoleic acid, an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is metabolised to arachidonic acid, a component of colonocyte membranes. Metabolites of arachidonic acid have pro-inflammatory properties and are increased in the mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis. The aim of this investigation was to conduct the first prospective cohort study investigating if a high dietary intake of linoleic acid increases the risk of developing incident ulcerative colitis. DESIGN AND SETTING: Dietary data from food frequency questionnaires were available for 203 193 men and women aged 30-74 years, resident in the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Germany or Italy and participating in a prospective cohort study, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). These participants were followed up for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Each case was matched with four controls and the risk of disease calculated by quartile of intake of linoleic acid adjusted for gender, age, smoking, total energy intake and centre. RESULTS: A total of 126 participants developed ulcerative colitis (47% women) after a median follow-up of 4.0 years (range, 1.7-11.3 years). The highest quartile of intake of linoleic acid was associated with an increased risk of ulcerative colitis (odds ratio (OR) = 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.23 to 5.07, p = 0.01) with a significant trend across quartiles (OR = 1.32 per quartile increase, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.66, p = 0.02 for trend). CONCLUSIONS: The data support a role for dietary linoleic acid in the aetiology of ulcerative colitis. An estimated 30% of cases could be attributed to having dietary intakes higher than the lowest quartile of linoleic acid intake.},

Although the recent Montreal classification system allowed classification of upper GI involvement in Crohn's disease (CD), independent of other locations, a consensus regarding the definition of what qualifies as significant "involvement" is still lacking. Reported incidence data vary considerably depending on the definitions used and the selected target population. Pediatric data suggest that upper endoscopy is useful in differentiating CD from ulcerative colitis, when inflammation is otherwise predominantly confined to the colon; however, this question has yet to be studied in adults. Infliximab therapy for upper GI-CD seems as effective as that seen for more distal GI inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the judgmental and mathematical approaches in weighting the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI). METHODS: The PUCAI was previously weighted mathematically using multivariate regression modeling on 157 children with ulcerative colitis (UC). Independently, a Delphi group of 36 experts in pediatric UC judgmentally provided weights to the PUCAI's items. The agreement between the tools was evaluated using the 95% limits of agreement method. Validity was assessed on a prospective cohort of 48 UC children, using three constructs: colonoscopic appearance, physician's global assessment, and the Mayo score. Responsiveness was compared on a longitudinal cohort of 75 children. RESULTS: The weights of the resulting PUCAI tools were quite similar, but the Delphi group retained the laboratory items, excluded by the mathematical modeling. This difference was reflected by the Bland and Altman method. Both tools performed equally well in the validation and responsiveness cohorts. CONCLUSION: The judgmentally weighted PUCAI had good validity and responsiveness. The mathematical weighting, however, performed just as well without the laboratory items, resulting in a more feasible index. Therefore, the mathematical modeling has proven to be superior in weighting the PUCAI.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare four faecal markers for their ability to predict steroid refractoriness in severe paediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). Construct validity and responsiveness to change were also assessed. METHODS: This was a prospective multicentre cohort study. Stool samples from 101 children (13.3 + or - 3.6 years; Pediatric UC Activity Index (PUCAI) at admission 72 + or - 12 points) were obtained at the third day of intravenous steroid therapy. Repeated samples at discharge were obtained from 24 children. Predictive validity was assessed using diagnostic utility statistics to predict steroid failure (ie, the need for salvage treatment). Concurrent validity was assessed using correlational analysis with the following constructs: PUCAI, Lindgren and Seo scores, physician's global assessment, albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP). Responsiveness was assessed using test utility and correlational strategies. RESULTS: Median values (IQR) were very high at baseline for all four markers (calprotectin 4215 microg/g (2297-8808); lactoferrin 212 microg/g (114-328); M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) 363 U/g (119-3104); and S100A12 469 microg/g (193-1112)). M2-PK was numerically superior to the other three markers and CRP in predicting response to corticosteroid treatment (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 0.75 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.85; p<0.001) vs <0.65 for the others). However, it did not add to the predictive ability of the PUCAI (area under the ROC 0.81 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.89)). M2-PK also had the highest construct validity but with a modest mean correlation with all constructs (r=0.3; p<0.05). None of the markers was responsive to change (Spearman's rho correlation with change in the PUCAI <0.1; p>0.05, area under the ROC curve <0.65; p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The four markers were greatly elevated in severe paediatric UC. Only M2-PK had good construct and predictive validity, and none was responsive to change. The PUCAI, a simple clinical index, performed better than the faecal markers in predicting outcome following a course of intravenous corticosteroids in severe UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) concordance has been investigated in a few studies. We investigated MEFV mutations and prevalence of FMF disease in Turkish children with IBD and their relationship with the disease severity. METHODS: Sixteen patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 14 with Crohn's disease (CD) and three with indeterminate colitis (IC) were enrolled in the study (median age 13 years, range 0.6-16 years, n = 19 boys). Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients were evaluated as well as the parameters of disease severity. All patients were screened for 12 common MEFV mutations. RESULTS: MEFV mutations were detected in 17 of 66 (25.7%) alleles. Seven patients (four patients with CD, two with IC, and one with UC) were also diagnosed as FMF. FMF disease was found in seven of all IBD patients (21.2%) and four of them had CD. M694V was the leading mutation, and as a disease-causing mutation, it was found to be significantly more frequent in CD patients than UC patients (Fisher's exact test P = 0.03). Demographics, laboratory evaluations, growth parameters, extraintestinal manifestations, and treatment with immunosuppressive agents other than steroids were comparable between the patients with and without FMF in most aspects. CONCLUSIONS: Although this is a small cohort, disease-causing MEFV mutations and FMF disease rate were increased among our patients with IBD. The increase was prominent among CD patients, whereas in UC the rate was similar to the Turkish healthy control population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite claims of rarity, some studies indicate that the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease has increased in Iran during the past decades. Establishment of a registry and the clinical characteristics are presented in this study. METHODS: Two hundred ninety-three patients with ulcerative colitis and 207 with Crohn's disease, referred to tertiary referral gastrointestinal centers in Tehran from 2004 through 2007, were assessed. Demographic and clinical features, intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations, inflammatory bowel disease in relatives, measles infection and vaccination, nutrition during infancy, and drugs and surgical interventions were assessed. RESULTS: The mean+/-SD age at the diagnosis was 33.8+/-12.9 years in Crohn's disease and 37.1+/-13.7 years in ulcerative colitis. Male:female ratio was 0.9:1.0 for Crohn's disease and 0.7:1.0 for ulcerative colitis. A total of 177 (85.5%) patients with Crohn's disease, and 254 (86.7%) patients with ulcerative colitis had never smoked. Measles vaccination was mentioned in 150 (72.5%) of Crohn's disease and 214 (73%) of ulcerative colitis patients. Breastfeeding during infancy was reported in 178 (86%) and 257 (87.7%) of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients, respectively. Appendectomy was reported in 37 (17.9%) of Crohn's disease and 16 (5.5%) of ulcerative colitis patients, whereas tonsillectomy was reported in 11.6% of each group. CONCLUSION: Demographic and clinical characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease patients are similar to that of other developing countries, in this study, more inflammatory bowel disease cases have been assessed in comparison with previous studies, which may be due to different time scales of socioeconomic evolution and environmental factors in Iran.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Adipokines are fat-derived hormones and cytokines with immune-modulating and metabolic properties. Most of them are associated with insulin resistance. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate circulating levels of adipokines and glucose homeostasis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to evaluate possible associations with the course and characteristics of the disease. METHODS: Serum leptin, resistin, visfatin, retinol-binding protein-4, adiponectin, glucose, insulin, and inflammatory parameters were analyzed in 93 patients with inactive IBD (49 with Crohn's disease [CD], 44 with ulcerative colitis [UC]), 35 patients with active IBD (18 with CD, 17 with UC), and 37 age- and body mass index-matched healthy controls. Ninety-two patients were followed for 6 mo. RESULTS: Leptin was similar in patients with IBD and controls, whereas resistin and visfatin were increased in patients with active disease but not in those in remission. In active and inactive disease, adiponectin was decreased (P < 0.001) and retinol-binding protein-4 was increased (P < 0.001) compared with controls. About 60% of patients with IBD showed increased levels of insulin, whereas serum glucose remained normal, resulting in increased homeostasis model assessment values in most patients. Hyperinsulinemia was associated with the decrease in adiponectin (r = -0.572, P < 0.001) and proved to be an independent protective factor for 6-mo maintenance of remission (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: IBD led to largely similar alterations in circulating adipokines and hyperinsulinemia in patients with CD and those with UC. The unexpected protective effect of hyperinsulinemia on relapse rate denotes the role of the metabolic-inflammatory response as a modulator in IBD.},

   abstract = {The Dutch national practice guideline 'Diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in adults' describes the multidisciplinary approach for adult patients with (suspected) IBD, recommended following analysis of the literature according to the principles of evidence based guideline development. The symptoms on first presentation of a patient with IBD are mainly connected with the localisation and severity of the disease and less with the resulting diagnosis 'Crohn's disease' or 'ulcerative colitis'. There is no test by which the diseases can be distinguished with certainty. Clinical course, ileocolonoscopy and histopathological investigation following biopsy form the 'gold standard' for diagnosis of IBD. The final diagnostic step is disease assessment according to the Montreal classification in order to enable unambiguous communication with medical professionals. The first aim of treatment is to treat and stabilise active disease (induction therapy); at the same time maintenance therapy is initiated. A step-up approach is recommended for both treatment aims. Surgical intervention is indicated if the medical treatment is ineffective, in case of intractable gastrointestinal bleeding, in clinically significant gastrointestinal stenosis due to fibrotic scar tissue, or if complications of the inflammation occur such as abscess, peritonitis, or complicated fistula formation. Nutrition and diet do not play a primary therapeutic role in treatment of adult patients with IBD. However, supportive nutritional care is warranted. Probiotics have a demonstrable effect in preventing pouchitis, but not in the treatment of IBD. Alternative medicine has no role to play in the treatment of IBD. The risk of developing colorectal carcinoma is slightly elevated in IBD patients. Therefore, endoscopic surveillance strategies, aimed at early detection of dysplasia, is indicated according to a schedule in which the frequency increases according to the time elapsed since first clinical signs of IBD.},

The present guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the indications, application and type of parenteral formula to be used in acute and chronic phases of illness. Parenteral nutrition is not recommended as a primary treatment in CD and UC. The use of parenteral nutrition is however reliable when oral/enteral feeding is not possible. There is a lack of data supporting specific nutrients in these conditions. Parenteral nutrition is mandatory in case of intestinal failure, at least in the acute period. In patients with short bowel, specific attention should be paid to water and electrolyte supplementation. Currently, the use of growth hormone, glutamine and GLP-2 cannot be recommended in patients with short bowel.},

   abstract = {Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract commonly denoted as inflammatory bowel diseases. It has been proposed that these diseases result from aberrant mucosal immune responses to nonpathogenic microbial residents of the intestines. Recently, it was established that continuous interactions between the innate and the adaptive intestinal immune cells and the microbiota are directly involved in maintaining the physiological noninflammatory state of the intestinal mucosa. In light of the complexity of this mucosal homeostasis, it is astonishing that the inflammatory bowel diseases are relatively rare. Recently, altered functions of the innate immune system have been identified. As such, both hyperresponsiveness and hyporesponsiveness of innate cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: High-fat diets have been shown to be a risk factor for ulcerative colitis (UC). Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered to increase lipid peroxidation, while the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid exerts a chemopreventative effect. We evaluated the effect of high-fat diets (20%) enriched with fish or soybean oil on colonic inflammation and DNA damage in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (28-30 days) were fed an American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-93 diet for 47 days and divided into five groups: control normal fat non-colitic (C) or control colitis (CC), high soybean fat group (HS) colitis, high fish fat group colitis, or high-fat soybean plus fish oil colitis. UC was induced from day 35 until day 41 by 3% dextran sulfate sodium. On day 47, the rats were anesthetized; blood samples collected for corticosterone determination, and the distal colon was excised to quantify interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-10, and interferon-gamma levels, myeloperoxidase activity, histological analyses, and DNA damage. The disease activity index was recorded daily. RESULTS: The disease activity index, histological analysis, myeloperoxidase activity, IL-4, interferon-gamma, and corticosterone levels did not differ among the colitic groups. IL-10 was significantly increased by the high fish fat group diet in relation to HS, but only the high soybean-fish fat diet increased the IL-10/IL-4 ratio (anti-inflammatory/pro-inflammatory) to levels closer to the C group and reduced DNA damage compared to the HS group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The data show that high-fat diets did not exacerbate UC and suggest that the soybean and fish oil mixture, more than the fish oil alone, could be a complementary therapy to achieve a cytokine balance in UC.},

   abstract = {Patients with chronic colitis (ulcerative colitis or colonic Crohn's disease) have an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Although most of the molecular alterations reported in sporadic CRC have also been observed in colitis-associated CRC, they do not occur at the same timing and frequency, indicating a different pathophysiology. In particular, recent work highlighted the importance of chronic mucosal inflammation as a key factor favouring colorectal carcinogenesis in these patients. This may also be one of the reasons explaining the role of 5-aminosalicylates as chemopreventive agents for CRC in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with colonic involvement. Beside chemoprevention, colonoscopic screening and surveillance have been shown to be the cornerstone for CRC prevention and early detection in this particular patients' population. Periodic surveillance colonoscopy to detect dysplasia has been shown to decrease the mortality attributed to CRC. More recently, progress in imaging techniques increased our ability to identify dysplasia, and should probably now be considered to be an integral part of surveillance colonoscopy. In the future, further improvement of our knowledge of CRC biology, refinement of imaging techniques, as well as molecular discovery (e.g. identification of specific mutations in stool DNA extracts), might lead to develop more accurate diagnostic strategies to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to CRC in patients with ulcerative colitis or colonic Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Effectiveness of enteral nutrition therapy is not only connected with improvement of the nutritional status of the patient, but also with its strong anti-inflammatory activity. Angiogenic growth factors play an important role in the early stage of inflammation. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) stimulate the angiogenesis and healing processes. The objective of our study was to assess the influence of the enteral nutrition therapy on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) concentrations in serum in children with different diseases of gastro-intestinal tract, in which enteral nutrition therapy is effective method of treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty two children (29 boys, 33 girls, mean age: 12.5 yrs, range: 6-18 yrs) and 25 healthy controls were included into the study. The Crohn's disease group (CD) consisted of 25 patients, ulcerative colitis group (UC)-18 patients, acute pancreatitis (AP) group-12 patients and severe malnutrition (N) group-7 patients. Serum VEGF and TGF-beta 1 concentrations were assessed at baseline, before starting and after 2 and 4 weeks of enteral nutrition therapy using ELISA immunoassays (R and D Systems, USA). RESULTS: Before starting enteral nutrition, we found increased VEGF concentration in CD group (Me = 600 pg/ml) compared to UC group (266.9 pg/ml), AP group (552.6 pg/ml), N group (238.5 pg/ml) and controls (172 pg/ml) (p < 0.05). We found decrease of VEGF concentrations during enteral nutrition in CD, UC and N group and increase in AP at the beginning, followed by decrease to the initial values. Assessing TGF-beta 1, we found its concentration increased before starting enteral nutrition in UC group (37.5 ng/ml) compared to CD group (29.7 ng/ ml) and controls (24.8 ng/ml) (p < 0.05). During enteral nutrition we observed decrease of TGF-beta 1 concentration in UC group and increase in CD group (32,7 ng/ml) and AP group (26,6 ng/ml) (p < 0.05) The best improvement of nutritional status was observed in CD patients compared to N and AP patients. CONCLUSIONS: Differentiation of serum VEGF and TGF-beta 1 concentrations, what was observed in various gastro-intestinal diseases, reflects different mechanisms of enteral nutrition therapy acting on the inflammatory process. The most efficient therapeutic effect was seen in CD, where stimulation of TGF-beta 1 production was observed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence base for the medical (pharmaceutical and nutritional) treatment of paediatric inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Key clinical questions were formulated regarding different treatment modalities used in the treatment of paediatric (not adult-onset) IBD, in particular the induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Electronic searches were performed from January 1966 to December 2006, using the electronic search strategy of the Cochrane IBD group. Details of papers were entered on a dedicated database, reviewed in abstract form, and disseminated in full for appraisal. Clinical guidelines were appraised using the AGREE instrument and all other relevant papers were appraised using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology, with evidence levels given to all papers. RESULTS: A total of 6285 papers were identified, of which 1255 involved children; these were entered on the database. After critical appraisal, only 103 publications met our criteria as evidence on medical treatment of paediatric IBD. We identified 3 clinical guidelines, 1 systematic review, and 16 randomised controlled trials; all were of variable quality, with none getting the highest methodological scores. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive review of the evidence base for the treatment of paediatric IBD, highlighting the paucity of trials of high methodological quality. As a result, the development of clinical guidelines for managing children and young people with IBD must be consensus based, informed by the best-available evidence from the paediatric literature and high-quality data from the adult IBD literature, together with the clinical expertise and multidisciplinary experience of paediatric IBD experts.},

   abstract = {Involvement of intestinal microbes in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis) is well established. However, the mechanisms by which bacteria lead to intestinal injury in IBD remain unclear and are the focus of current research. Using adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) strain LF82, which is linked to Crohn disease, we recently demonstrated the ability of these intestinal microbes to disrupt the integrity of epithelial cells in an in vitro cell model. This disruption provides the bacteria a capacity to penetrate into and beyond the epithelial monolayer, replicate in cells, disseminate within the host, and induce a chronic immune response. These findings provide a link between microbes related to IBD, disruption of the intestinal epithelial cell barrier, and disease pathogenesis.In this addendum, we provide a synopsis on current data concerning the role of AIEC in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation, summarise our recent findings, and highlight the central role of the epithelium in mucosal defence. We also discuss, in more detail, the potential implications of our findings and present ideas for future studies and targets for intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Exclusive enteral nutrition is used as primary therapy in Crohn's disease. Nutrition support is frequently required in children with both Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis when acutely unwell and during periods of recovery. There is considerable controversy about nutritional needs during phases of active and inactive disease. It is, for example, often assumed that in acute illness a child requires increased nutritional support however the precise relationship between illness severity and energy expenditure is uncertain. This study explores the relationship between disease activity and resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Patients were recruited from the regional paediatric gastroenterology unit at Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust. Disease activity was assessed using standard scoring systems (Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index; Simple Colitis Activity Index) and biochemical markers of inflammation (C-Reactive Protein, CRP). Fat free mass was estimated from skinfold thickness and Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis. Resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry. A logarithmic correction and a linear regression model were used for analysis of REE corrected for body size. RESULTS: 55 children were studied; 37 (67%) with Crohn's disease and 18 (33%) with Ulcerative Colitis. Median PCDAI was 10 (range 0-60), 22 (59%) had PCDAI > or =10 (active disease). Median SCAI was 1.5 (range 0-12). Within disease groups there were strong correlations between REE/KgFFM(0.52) and disease activity; PCDAI (r -0.386, p 0.018) in Crohn's disease and SCAI (r -0.456, p 0.057) in Ulcerative Colitis. In the cohort as a whole there was no increase in REE/KgFFM(0.52) with increasing CRP (r 0.129, p 0.361). Using the regression model each mg/l increase in CRP was associated with a reduction in REE of nearly 1.5 kCal/day. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to demonstrate a significant relationship between REE and disease activity in children with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the impact of disease and treatment on the pattern of growth in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range 6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), - 0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The experimental data show that in mucosal injury of the alimentary system serotonin metabolism and secretion is disturbed. Such suggestions are also drawn in discussions concerning pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: To perform a quantitative evaluation of 24-hour urine excretion of a major serotonin metabolite-5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The studied group comprised 50 patients with exacerbated UC, aged 21-56 years. Among them 25 had mild and 25 severe exacerbation according to Trulove's and Witts criteria. The control group comprised 25 healthy persons. On the study day the patients remained on standard liquid diet--Nutrdrink 3 x 400 ml with the caloric value of 1800 kcal. 5-HIAA concentration was measured by ELISA method applying IBL antibodies (RE 59131), and the results were presented in mg/dl and then the value of 24-hour urine excretion was calculated. Results. In the group o patients with severely exacerbated UC 5-HIAA excretion was significantly lower that in healthy volunteers--1.66 +/- 0.98 mg/24 hi 5.77 +/- 0.46 mg/24 respectively (p < 0.05). The results of 5-HIAA excretion showed positive correlation with serum albumin concentration. In the group of patients with mild colitis such significant changes and correlations were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: (1) In severe exacerbations of UC serotonin metabolism is largely changed. (2) 24-hour serotonin excretion can have a predictive value in UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease with a heterogeneous clinical evolution. The prevalence and incidence of UC vary widely and depend on multiple factors including ethnicity and geographic location. GOAL: To determine the frequency of new cases of UC and their clinical characteristics in a large cohort from a referral hospital in Mexico City. STUDY: Patients with confirmed diagnosis of UC were included during a period between January 1987 and December 2006. Demographic and clinical data were collected from medical records. RESULTS: A total of 848 new cases of UC were diagnosed during a 20-year period. All the patients had endoscopic and histologic confirmation. The mean of annual new UC cases increased from 28.8 in the first period (1987 to 1996) to 76.1 in the second period (1997 to 2006) (P<0.00008). The incidence of new cases increased 2.6-fold comparing both periods of time. This study consisted of 467 females and 382 males, with a mean age at diagnosis of 31.3+/-12.3 years. The clinical manifestations were pancolitis (59.1%), and extraintestinal manifestations (41.5%). Most of the patients, 762 (89.8%) were taking sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid, 282 (33.3%) used oral or systemic steroids, 237 (28%) were taking azathioprine. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of new UC cases has increased significantly in the last 10 years in Mexico, largely due to the unique genetic make-up and the environmental factors (infectious diseases including parasites) not found in other countries.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic and relapsing disorder without any curative medical treatment. Different drugs have been focused to get clinical remission during the flare, maintenance of remission and improving the quality of life of inflammatory bowel disease patients. Recently, new therapeutic agents blocking the tumoral necrosis factor alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine have been approved for the use in these kind of patients. OBJECTIVE: To establish the first Mexican Consensus for the use of anti tumoral necrosis factor alpha agents in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A group of gastroenterologist and colorectal surgeons from different regions of the country were invited to attend to this meeting. The consensus was divided in 7 sections and a total of 53 items were evaluated for all participants. The Delphi system was used in this consensus and several clinical trials were considered in order to provide recommendations according to evidence based medicine. Finally, conclusions were obtained after discussing all items. RESULTS: This is the first mexican Consensus that provides the recommendations about the use of anti tumoral necrosis factor alpha agents in inflammatory bowel disease patients CONCLUSIONS: It is important to have a deep knowledge about the anti tumoral necrosis factor alpha in the following conditions: indications and contraindications; parameters of clinical efficacy; predicting factors of medical treatment response; strategies for preventing and treating immunogenicity; efficacy and safety as well as the clinical factors for using these agents as first line of therapy (top-down).},

In the present study, we determined the diagnostic utility of high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs CRP) and beta2 microglobulin (beta2M) levels and analyzed their correlation with the histological activity of ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: A total of 60 consecutive patients with UC were studied. Truelove-Witts index, histological activity, and beta2M and CRP levels were determined. Patients were grouped as non-active, mild, moderate, or severe following Riley's classification. Statistical analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 41.3 +/- 14.5 years. Thirty patients were women (50%). Twenty-one patients had distal UC (35%). The correlations between serum hsCRP and beta2M with histological activity showed coefficients of 0.39 (p = 0.01) and 0.33 (p = 0.02), respectively. The diagnostic utility was determined by ROC curves, which showed that the cutoff with the greatest area under the curve (AUC) for hsCRP and beta2M were > or = 0.36 (AUC = 0.73) and > or = 1.3 (AUC = 0.69), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with UC, hsCRP and beta2M levels are positively correlated with histological activity.},

Epidemiological data from some series have reported that IC is diagnosed in between 9% and 20% of colectomy specimens. AIM: To determine the prevalence of IC in Mexican patients and to describe their clinical features. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective database analysis of all patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who underwent colectomy between January of 1990 and December of 2006. Demographic data, clinical, laboratory, and histopathological results were analyzed. RESULTS: We found 80 patients in the database who had undergone total colectomy whose average age was 44.8 years. IC was found in 7 patients (8.7%) from colectomy specimens among Mexican patients with IBD, with a mean age at diagnosis of 33.6 years. Subgroup analysis showed that a younger age at diagnosis and toxic megacolon were factors of statistical significance associated with IC. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IC was 8.7% in our group. A younger age of onset and toxic megacolon were the most important associated factors in patients with IC.},

RESULTS: A total of 94 females and 106 males patients with UC were analyzed. The age at diagnosis was 31.4 +/- 13.2 years and the mean of disease duration was 6.7 +/- 5.2 years. We found a high prevalence of abnormal function livers tests in 40% of UC patients. The pattern of abnormal function liver test was hepatitis in 70%, cholestatic (20%) and mixed (10%). The most common cause of abnormal function liver test was transient elevation in 50 patients (63%) followed by fatty liver disease (11.2%), primary sclerosing cholangitis (6.3%), drug-toxicity (6%) and others (13.5%) including chronic hepatitis C, total parenteral nutrition, granulomatous and ischemic hepatitis. In the multivariate logistic regression model, active disease, colectomy and abdominal sepsis were factors that persisted associated with the development of abnormal liver tests in UC patients. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of abnormal function liver tests (40%) was found in Mexican UC patients is likely to be related to active disease, colectomy and the presence of sepsis.},

RESULTS: A total of 103 female and 112 male UC patients were analyzed. The mean age at diagnosis was 30.5 +/- 10.8 years. The prevalence of overall parasitic infections was 24% and distributed as follows: Blastocystis hominis in 22 patients (10%), Endolimax nana in 19 cases (9%), and Entamoebahistolytica in 11 cases (5%). A significantly increased frequency of protozoa infection was found in those patients with persistent activity and intermittent activity as compared to active than inactive group (p = 1 x 10(-7), OR 13.05, 95% CI 4.28-42.56, and p = 0.003, OR 1.42-14.47, respectively). Interestingly, this association remained significant when we compared the persistent activity group versus intermittent activity group (p = 0.003, OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.35-6.59). Subgroup analysis showed no association between protozoa infection (E. histolytica, B. hominis, and E. nana) and other clinical variables such as gender, extent of disease, extraintestinal complications, medical treatment and grade of disease activity. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of intestinal protozoa infections in Mexican UC patients was 24% and these microorganisms could be a contributing cause of persistent activity despite medical treatment in our population.},

   abstract = {Pouchitis is a common complication that develops after an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis after colectomy for ulcerative colitis. In some cases, pouchitis becomes chronic and refractory to conventional therapies including antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, probiotics, and anti-inflammatory drugs. We report a case of an adolescent with chronic pouchitis who not only improved with infliximab therapy but remains in long-term remission with maintenance therapy without any adverse effects. Infliximab is a safe and effective therapy for refractory pouchitis and may obviate the need for pouch removal and a permanent ileostomy.},

In 16 children who received 133 standard 2- to 3-hour infusions, followed by fifty 1-hour infusions, chart review revealed a frequency of infusion reactions of 2% with both infusion protocols (3/133 and 1/50). The first reaction with the rapid infusion occurred in a patient who had experienced an identical reaction with the longer infusion, but was mistakenly not premedicated. Our data suggest rapid infusion over 1 hour in selected pediatric patients is safe and cost-effective.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human polymorphisms affecting gut epithelial barrier and interactions with bacteria predispose to the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The intestinal transporter PepT1, encoded by the SLC15A1 gene, mediates intracellular uptake of bacterial products that can induce inflammation and NF-kappaB activation upon binding to NOD2, a protein often mutated in CD. Hence, we tested SLC15A1 polymorphisms for association with IBD. METHODS: Twelve SLC15A1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 1783 individuals from 2 cohorts of Swedish and Finnish IBD patients and controls. An in vitro system was set up to evaluate the potential impact of SLC15A1 polymorphism on PepT1 transporter function by quantification of NOD2-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. RESULTS: The common allele (C) of a coding polymorphism (rs2297322, Ser117Asn) was associated with CD susceptibility both in Sweden and in Finland, but with genetic effects in opposite directions (risk and protection, respectively). The best evidence of association was found in both populations when the analysis was performed on individuals not carrying NOD2 common risk alleles (Sweden allelic P = 0.0007, OR 1.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-2.92; Finland genotype P = 0.0013, OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.90). The PepT1 variant encoded by the C allele (PepT1-Ser117) was associated with reduced signaling downstream of NOD2 (P < 0.0001 compared to Pept1-Asn117). CONCLUSIONS: A functional polymorphism in the SLC15A1 gene might be of relevance to inflammation and antibacterial responses in IBD. Whether this polymorphism truly contributes to disease susceptibility needs to be further addressed, and should stimulate additional studies in other populations.},
