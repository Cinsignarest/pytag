   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Nonresponse or relapse of symptoms is common in patients with celiac disease treated with gluten free diet. Refractory sprue (RS) is defined as initial or subsequent failure of a strict gluten-free diet to restore normal intestinal architecture and function in patients who have celiac-like enteropathy. The aims of this study were: 1) to identify causes of persistent symptoms in patients referred with presumed diagnosis of nonresponsive celiac disease (NCD); and 2) to characterize patients with true RS. METHODS: Patients were identified who had been systematically evaluated for NCD between January 1997, and May 2001. Patient records and small bowel biopsy results were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were referred with a presumed diagnosis of NCD. Six did not have celiac disease and had other diseases responsible for their symptoms. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss were the most common reasons for evaluation in cases of NCD, whereas weight loss, steatorrhea, and diarrhea were the most common presenting features of RS (nine patients). Of the 49 patients with celiac disease, 25 were identified as having gluten contamination. Additional diagnoses accounting for persistent symptoms included: pancreatic insufficiency, irritable bowel syndrome, bacterial overgrowth, lymphocytic colitis, collagenous colitis, ulcerative jejunitis, T-cell lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, fructose intolerance, protein losing enteropathy, cavitating lymphadenopathy syndrome, and tropical sprue. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, we conclude the following: 1) gluten contamination is the leading reason for NCD; 2) of NCD cases, 18% are due to RS; and 3) alternative diseases or those coexistent with celiac disease and gluten contamination should be ruled out before a diagnosis of RS is made.},

   abstract = {Individuals with celiac disease present with a wide array of symptoms and signs. Celiac disease can result in substantial injury to the small intestine, deleterious effects on other organ systems, and an overall doubling of mortality. The role of the gastroenterologist is primarily to make the diagnosis and then to ensure that patients with celiac disease receive up-to-date and accurate instructions on diet. It is our opinion that gastroenterologists should participate in the follow-up of what is in fact a form of inflammatory bowel disease. The failure to identify and treat patients with substantial problems may result in an excess of preventable morbidity and mortality. Intestinal biopsy is the definitive method of making the diagnosis of celiac disease, provided the patient has not excluded gluten from his or her diet, because exclusion of gluten results in negative serologic test results and normal small intestinal biopsy samples. The removal of gluten from the diet can result in a total recovery of gut function and a correction of most other consequences. The response is usually so complete that patients should consider themselves to be basically healthy as long as they stay away from the offending foods. However, the execution and maintenance of the "theoretically simple" exclusion of gluten is difficult. The condition is permanent and mandates adherence to a lifelong gluten-free diet; even small amounts of gluten can result in injury to the intestinal lining. The diet is restrictive and requires the patient to be careful about food choices. Therefore, patient education and motivation are crucial to a successful outcome. The correction of vitamin and mineral deficiencies may be helpful in aiding recovery; vitamin D and calcium supplementation often is recommended. No drug therapy has been proven to suppress the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of anxiety and depression has been reported in untreated coeliac disease (CD) patients. At present, the role of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on psychological disorders is still poorly known. The aim of this study was to evaluate state and trait anxiety and depression in adult CD patients before and after 1 year of GFD. METHODS: A total of 35 CD patients were studied before and after 1 year of GFD. A total of 59 healthy subjects matched for gender, age and socio-economic status were studied as a control group. State and trait anxiety were assessed with the STAI test; depression was assessed using the modified version of the SDS Zung self-rating depression scale (M-SDS). The tests were administered before (TO) and after 1 year of GFD (T1). RESULTS: At T0, CD patients showed high levels of state anxiety in a significantly higher percentage compared to controls (71.4% versus 23.7%; P < 0.0001), while there was no significant difference in trait anxiety between groups (25.7% versus 15.2%; P:ns); the percentage of subjects with depression was significantly higher in the CD group than in the control group (57.1% versus 9.6%; P < 0.0001). At T1, a significant decrease in the percentage of state anxiety was found in CD patients (T0: 71.4% versus T1: 25.7%; P < 0.001), while there were no significant changes in the percentage of trait anxiety (T0: 25.7% versus T1: 17.1%; P:ns) or depression (T0: 57.1.% versus T1: 45.7%; P:ns), which was still present in a significantly higher percentage in treated CD compared to controls (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In CD patients anxiety is present in a predominantly reactive form and it decreases after GFD. Depression is present in a higher percentage in CD patients and 1 year of GFD fails significantly to affect depressive symptoms. The presence of depression after GFD could be related to the reduction in quality of life in CD patients. The non-regression of depression after GFD could suggest that these patients need psychological support.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selective deamidation of glutamine residues by tissue transglutaminase (tTG) turns gliadin peptides into stronger activators of T cells from celiac disease (CD) patients. We examined the possibility that these modified peptides could be more specific epitopes for circulating antibodies than are native peptides. METHODS: Two native synthetic peptides and their respective modified sequences were used as antigens for ELISA assays: peptide-1, with residues 56-75 of alpha-type gliadin; and peptide-2, with residues 134-153 of gamma-type gliadin. We examined 40 CD patients [31 not being treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD) and 9 being treated with a GFD] and 30 non-CD patients. RESULTS: An enhanced response against deamidated peptides was observed in 4 (IgA) and 22 (IgG) of 31 untreated CD patients for peptide-1 and in 25 (IgA) and 29 (IgG) patients for peptide-2. Higher anti-gliadin antibody and anti-tTG IgA concentrations correlated with increased IgA reactivity to modified peptides. Among the nine treated CD patients, eight also displayed an improved IgG signal for the deamidated sequence. Deamidation of peptides did not increase the reactivity of non-CD sera. CONCLUSIONS: Selective deamidation specifically increases circulating antibody recognition of gliadin peptides in CD patients. This suggests that deamidated gliadin peptides are more specific CD B-cell epitopes than native peptides; this finding may be relevant for designing improved diagnostic tests.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on growth and glycemic control for 11 case subjects diagnosed with celiac disease (cd(+) group) and started on a GFD were collected prospectively, and two control subjects without celiac disease matched for age, sex, and duration of diabetes (cd(-) group) were selected for comparison. RESULTS: In the period between diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and start of a GFD in the cd(+) compared with the cd(-) group, BMI standard deviation score (SDS) was lower (-0.2 vs. 0.7, P = 0.015), as was HbA(1c) (8.9 vs. 9.8%, P = 0.002). In a regression model the cd(+) group had lower BMI SDS (P < 0.001) and lower HbA(1c) (P = 0.04), independent of other variables. On a GFD, BMI SDS increased by 12 months in the cd(+) group and then was no different than the cd(-) group (1.1 vs. 1.0, P = 0.11), whereas HbA(1c) improved further within case subjects compared with pre-GFD (8.9 vs. 8.3%, P = 0.002). On a GFD, case subjects in contrast to control subjects showed no deterioration in HbA(1c) during the years of puberty (8.3 vs. 10.0%, P = 0.022) CONCLUSIONS: In children with type 1 diabetes, untreated celiac disease resulted in lower BMI SDS and lower HbA(1c). Recovery of BMI SDS with a GFD was associated with further improvement in HbA(1c) as compared with pre-GFD, with no expected deterioration in glycemic control during puberty. These apparent clinical benefits need confirming by larger studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The standard evaluation of a patient with iron deficiency anemia includes a complete evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract to identify a source of bleeding. However, even after a careful examination, many patients remain without a diagnosis. Because iron deficiency anemia results from iron loss or defective absorption, we sought to determine the prevalence of potential gastrointestinal sources for iron deficiency anemia in patients without gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: Over a 10-month period, 668 outpatients were referred to the University Hematology Department with iron deficiency anemia, defined by a hemoglobin concentration less than 14 g/dL (less than 12 g/dL in women), mean corpuscular volume less than 80 fL, and ferritin level less than 30 microg/L. After excluding patients with obvious causes of blood loss, inadequate diet, chronic diseases, or malignancies, there were 81 eligible patients, 10 of whom refused investigation. The remaining 71 patients (51 women, median age 59 years) underwent colonoscopy, as well as gastroscopy with gastric (antrum and body) and duodenal biopsies. RESULTS: A likely cause of iron deficiency anemia was detected in 60 patients (85%). Diseases associated with bleeding were found in 26 patients (37%), including colon cancer (10 patients), gastric cancer (2), peptic ulcer (7), hiatal hernia with linear erosions (5), colonic vascular ectasia (3), colonic polyps (2), and Crohn's disease (1). Causes not associated with bleeding were found in 36 patients (51%), including 19 with atrophic gastritis, 4 with celiac disease, and 13 with Helicobacter pylori gastritis. Six (8%) patients had coincident gastrointestinal findings, and 11 (15%) had no cause identified. Patients with an identified nonbleeding-associated cause were younger than those with a bleeding-associated cause (median, 56 vs 70 years; P = 0.001) and included 59% of women (n = 30) versus 30% of men (n = 6) (P = 0.04). Hemoglobin level was not related to the site and severity of disease. CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal diseases that do not usually cause bleeding are frequently associated with iron deficiency anemia in patients without gastrointestinal symptom or other potential causes of gastrointestinal bleeding.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Iron deficiency anemia has been reported as the most frequent extraintestinal symptom in adult celiac disease. Prospective studies on the effect of gluten-free diet on recovery from iron deficiency anemia are lacking. The aim of this study was to verify in adult patients with celiac disease the efficacy of and the time course of recovery from iron deficiency anemia by a gluten-free diet alone. METHODS: We studied 190 consecutive adult patients with iron deficiency anemia, screened for celiac disease by duodenal biopsies. New diagnosed celiac patients were invited to follow a gluten-free diet alone without iron supplementation. After 6 months of diet, duodenal biopsies were performed and hematological tests were repeated at 6, 12, and 24 months. RESULTS: Celiac disease was diagnosed in 26 (24 women, 2 men; 13.7%) adult patients. After 6 months of gluten-free diet 14 of 18 (77.8%) female patients recovered from anemia, but only 5 of 18 (27.8%) reversed from iron deficiency. At 12-month control all but one patient (94.4%) recovered from anemia and 9 patients (50%) from iron deficiency. After 24 months of diet, only the patient who did not recover from anemia at 12-month control was still anemic, whereas 10 patients (55.5%) reversed from iron deficiency. A significant inverse correlation (r = -0.7141, p = 0.0003) between increase of Hb concentrations and decrease of individual histological scores of duodenitis was observed. CONCLUSIONS: A screening for celiac disease should be carried out in adult patients with iron deficiency anemia. Recovery from anemia occurs between 6 and 12 months on a gluten-free diet alone as a consequence of normalization of histological alterations of the intestinal mucosa.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus can frequently coexist, presumably due to a common genetic predisposition. The present study was designed to evaluate the frequency of coeliac disease among Hungarian diabetic children and to study the effect of gluten-free diet on glycaemic control. A total of 205 diabetic children (age range 2.0-17.0 years, median 11.6 years) were screened for coeliac disease by determination of IgA-endomysium (EMA) antibodies. In the positive cases, a jejunal biopsy was performed and, in addition to routine histology, the number of intraepithelial gamma/delta T-cells was also determined. Insulin requirement, glycosylated haemoglobin level and body mass index of diabetic children with coeliac disease were determined before and 3 months after the introduction of gluten-free diet. IgA-EMA was positive in 24 cases, 17 of them (8.3% of all diabetic children) had a subtotal villous atrophy and thus coeliac disease was diagnosed. In all but two of these children, the mean number of gamma/delta T-cells was elevated (above 7 cells/mm). Of the remaining seven patients with positive EMA but normal villous structure, five (2.4%) had elevated number of epithelial gamma/delta T-cells, indicating probable latent coeliac disease. The insulin requirement of the children had significantly increased 3 months after the introduction of gluten-free diet (median values 0.64 versus 0.48 U/kg per day, P<0.05). Median body mass indices also showed significant elevation after this period (16.8 versus 14.2 kg/m(2), P<0.05) CONCLUSION: the frequency of coeliac disease was high in the studied group. Introduction of a gluten-free diet improved the somatic development of these children. A latent form of coeliac disease is also frequent in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cereals are among the major foods that account for food hypersensitivity reactions. Salt-soluble proteins appear to be the most important allergens contributing to the asthmatic response. In contrast, very limited information is available regarding cereal allergens responsible for allergic reactions after ingestion of cereal proteins. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the allergenic reactivity of ingested and inhaled cereal allergens in different ages, in order to investigate if the response to different allergens would depend on the sensitization route. METHODS: We included 66 patients in three groups. Group 1: 40 children aged 3 to 6 months who suffered from diarrhoea, vomiting, eczema or weight loss after the introduction of cereal formula in their diet and in which a possibility of coeliac disease was discarded. Group 2: 18 adults with food allergy due to cereals tested by prick tests, specific IgE and food challenge. Group 3: eight patients previously diagnosed as having baker's asthma. Sera pool samples were collected from each group of patients and IgE immunoblotting was performed. RESULTS: We found an important sensitization to cereal in the 40 children. The most important allergens were wheat followed by barley and rye. Among the adults with cereal allergy, sensitization to other allergens was common, especially to Lolium perenne (rye grass) pollen. Immunoblotting showed similar allergenic detection in the three groups. CONCLUSION: Clinically significant reactivity to cereal may be observed in early life. Inhalation and ingestion routes causing cereal allergy seem to involve similar allergens. The diet control was more effective in children. The possibility of cereal allergy after the introduction of cereal formula during the lactation period should not be underestimated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Bone metabolism in celiac patients is not well understood and there are no previous histomorphometric studies on bone of patients with celiac disease. The aim of the study was to investigate bone metabolism in celiac patients using bone histomorphometry, measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) and biochemical parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patient groups included 19 men and 23 women with previously diagnosed celiac disease in remission (group I), 7 women not in remission (group II) and 19 women and 9 men with newly diagnosed celiac disease (group III). Static and dynamic parameters of bone structure, formation and resorption were measured using undecalcified sections. The following parameters were obtained: bone volume (BV/TV; %), osteoid volume (OV/BV; %), osteoid surface (OS/BS; %), resoprtion surface (ES/BS; %), osteoid thickness(Oth; microm), mineral apposition rate (MAR; microm/day), and mineralization lag time (MinLag; day). BMD was measured at the spine (L2-4) and left femoral neck, trochanter and Ward's triangle. Serum calcium (S-Ca; mmol/L), alkaline phosphatase (AP; U/L), intact parathyroid hormone (S-PTH; ng/L), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (S-25(OH)D; nmol/L), cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of human type I collagen (S-ICTP; microg/L) and C-terminal extension peptide of type I procollagen (S-PICP; microg/L) were analysed. RESULTS: In the histomorphometric analysis there were no significant differences in static or dynamic parameters between the groups. Very low bone mass (< 10%) was found in one patient in every group. OV/BV was increased (> 3.5%) in all groups (31% in group I, 13% in group II and 29% in group III). OS/BS was increased (> 36.5%) in groups I and III (17% and 29% respectively). In group II OS/BS was normal in all patients. Mineralization defect was found in four patients in group I and in two patients in group III with otherwise normal histomorphometric results. ES/BS was increased in three patients in group I and III and in one patient in group II. One female patient in group III had increased osteoid parameters, resorption surface, S-PTH and low concentration of vitamin D reflecting hyperparathyroid changes in bone. S-PTH was increased (66-87 ng/L) in four patients in group III and one of these patients had hyperparathyroid histological changes in bone. CONCLUSIONS: Static and dynamic histomorphometry of iliac crest bone biopsy are useful tools to evaluate bone metabolism in celiac disease especially if hyperparathyroidism or mineralization defect are suspected. Hyperparathyroidism may be a problem in the patients before introducing gluten-free diet. Mineralization defect and osteomalacic changes are common later on irrespective of whether the patients are in remission or not.},

The objective of this study was to present the clinical, electrophysiologic, and neuroradiologic features in a series of patients with this syndrome. Thirty-two patients with the constellation of epilepsy, occipital calcifications, and celiac disease were identified in our epilepsy clinic. The mean age was 11 years and the mean length of follow-up was 7.4 years. The 1990 criteria of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition were used to diagnose celiac disease. The Kruskal-Wallis statistics test was employed with a signficance of P < .05. Thirty-one patients had partial seizures, 21 of them with symptoms related to the occipital lobe. In most patients, the epilepsy was controlled or the seizures were sporadic. Three developed severe epilepsy. Occipital calcifications were present in all cases. Computed tomography in 7 patients showed hypodense areas in the white matter around calcifications, which decreased or disappeared after a period of gluten-free diet in 3 patients. A favorable outcome of epilepsy was detected in patients with the earliest dietary therapy. This study presents the largest series of children with this syndrome outside Italy. White-matter hypodensities surrounding calcifications are rarely reported. A prompt diagnosis of celiac disease might improve the evolution of the epilepsy and may improve cognitive status.},

   abstract = {The concept of coeliac disease has expanded from a gastrointestinal disease with malabsorption to a systemic immunological disease with a genetic basis. Epidemiological studies indicate that environmental factors, like the infant feeding pattern, affect the clinical presentation while population-screening studies indicate that the prevalence, at least in Caucasian populations, is similar. Secondary complications, like malignancies, osteopenia - osteoporosis, gynaecological and obstetrical problems and autoimmune diseases, are common. The risk is reduced or prevented by treatment with a gluten-free diet. The basis for such a secondary prevention is: 1. early case-finding by a) knowledge about different presentations of the disease and factors affecting that, b) generous serological testing in patients with vague symptoms, c) screening of risk groups, and, 2. support for children and adolescents with coeliac disease to comply with the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are, as yet, no data available about the incidence of celiac disease in Libya. The aim of this study was to test the occurrence of serologic markers in a group of Libyan children with positive clinical and histologic findings indicative of celiac disease diagnosis. METHODS: Thirty-nine children with untreated celiac disease and 50 healthy school children, all younger than 14 years, were included in the study. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antigliadin, antitissue transglutaminase, and anticalreticulin antibodies was used to evaluate the serologic markers of the celiac patients. Immunoglobulin A antiendomysial antibodies were detected by indirect immunofluorescence using human umbilical cord tissue. RESULTS: Clinical symptoms at presentation were weight loss (82%), abdominal distension (61.5%), diarrhea or steatorrhea (59%), pallor (41%), abdominal pain (20.5%), constipation (15%), vomiting (10%), and short stature (7.7%). Most of these symptoms disappeared after introduction of a gluten-free diet. Of 39 patients, only 23 (59%) were endomysium positive and positive also in all other serologic markers. The second group of patients with positive clinical and biopsy findings but antiendomysial antibody-negative findings was subdivided into two subgroups according to the IgA antigliadin antibody results. Individuals in the IgA gliadin-negative subgroup also lacked IgA autoantibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings stress the importance of serologic testing not only for screening but also for confirmation of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: While coeliac disease is clearly induced by dietary gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals, other environmental factors may influence the onset of disease. Two studies have suggested that cigarette smoking has a protective role, but a third has not. METHODS: We examined the relationship between cigarette smoking and coeliac disease in individuals with coeliac disease diagnosed in adulthood from two large population-based disease registers and age and sex-matched controls from local general practitioner lists. Participants were mailed a three-page lifestyle and general health questionnaire. Smoking habits of coeliacs were compared with controls and with habits reported in the Health Survey for England 1995. RESULTS: An inverse association between current smoking and adult coeliac disease was identified (odds ratio: 0.77 (95% CI 0.56-1.06)) and remained when comparing ever smoked versus never smoked (odds ratio: 0.83 (0.68-1.00)). When the smoking habits of the coeliacs were compared with the national figures, the number of coeliacs who currently smoked was 40% lower than expected (smoking ratio 0.60, 0.46-0.78). This inverse association was accounted for by the behaviour of the 35-54-year age group (odds ratio for ever smoked 0.67 (0.51-0.89)). There was no association with having ever smoked in the younger age group (odds ratio: 1.44 (0.75-2.78)) or the older group (odds ratio: 0.92 (0.67-1.26)). CONCLUSIONS: There was an inverse association between adult coeliac disease and cigarette smoking which was accounted for by middle-aged coeliacs having never smoked. These results are consistent with an age-dependent interaction between cigarette smoking and the other environmental factors implicated in coeliac disease, including gluten.},

   abstract = {HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 61-year-old woman in poor general health was admitted to hospital because of progressive diarrheo, flatulence, fatigue and weight loss. The patient had a history of coeliac disease with poor dietary compliance over many years. Hence, the present clinical deterioration was unresponsive to a gluten-free diet. INVESTIGATIONS: Laboratory results showed signs of inflammation and malabsorption. The endoscopy of the duodenum revealed a flattened mucosal architecture, as is typical for coeliac disease. Enteroscopy revealed many small jejunal lesions. Histological examination of mucosa showed typical signs of coeliac disease without definite signs of lymphoma. Immunhistochemical analysis showed atypical intraepithelial T-cells, while the molecular biological study revealed a monoclonal T-cell clone, both supporting the diagnosis of an enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATCL). DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY: The patient was enrolled in a study on intestinal non-Hodgkin lymphomas and accordingly received 6 courses of CHOP-chemotherapy. Clinical and histological improvement has lasted for over a year. CONCLUSION: Patients with coeliac disease unresponsive to a gluten-free diet or with a deteriorating clinical condition may have an enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. This can manifest itself in the form of an ulcerative jejunitis. In the early stages of disease, immunhistochemical and molecularbiological analyses may lead to the correct diagnosis.},

The patient was followed-up for 36 mo and showed a normal insulin response to an intravenous glucose tolerance test and no markers of autoimmunity. It is possible that undiagnosed coeliac disease over a long period could lead to a direct autoimmune mechanism against pancreatic beta cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings seem to confirm the theory that undiagnosed coeliac disease can induce an autoimmune process against the pancreatic beta cells and that, following a gluten-free diet, the immunological markers for diabetes mellitus type 1 will disappear.},

METHODS: The study involved 80 consecutive subjects undergoing upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy for suspected coeliac disease (subsequently confirmed in 40 cases), 195 coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet, and 70 patients with different gastrointestinal disor ders and normal duodenal histology. Anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies levels were measured using commercial kits. RESULTS: The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were, respectively, 95% and 89.1%, 100% and 97.3%, and 100% and 98.2%: the agreement between the markers was substantial or almost perfect. In terms of follow-up, the positivity of the markers varied according to the strict adherence to, and duration of the gluten-free diet; the agreement between antiendomysium and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies was almost perfect. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-endomysium and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are both highly efficient for routine laboratory screening: the choice of one or the other will depend on the available facilities. However, neither can replace intestinal biopsy for general population screening because, in this case, their respective positive predictive values are only 15.7% and 21.8%. During follow-up, anti-gliadin retain their value as an early predictor of gluten ingestion.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Macroamylasemia (MA) is a benign condition caused by circulating macroamylase complexes of pancreatic or salivary amylase bound to plasma proteins, which cannot be cleared by the renal glomeruli. In most cases, the macromolecular amylase represents a complex of normal amylase and either immunoglobulin A or G and may be a specific antigen-antibody complex. Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent intolerance to ingested gluten that results in immunologically mediated inflammatory damage of the small intestinal mucosa. Several recent population-based serologic surveys have shown CD to be a common disorder, possibly affecting 1 in 200 to 250 individuals in most countries studied, including the United States, where overt CD is rare, indicating a high proportion of subclinical disease. The diagnosis of CD currently rests on the histological demonstration of the characteristic lesion in the small intestine and the subsequent clinical response to the introduction of a gluten-free diet. MA associated with CD has been described in adult patients, and in a few cases, MA decreased or resolved after a strict gluten-free diet. A few single cases of MA have been described in childhood, but no association with CD has been reported so far. We report a girl with CD, autoimmune thyroiditis, and MA, in whom CD-related antibodies to amylase and to exocrine pancreas tissue resolved with a gluten-free diet. CASE REPORT: An 11-year-old girl was referred for chronic abdominal pain and growth retardation associated with persistent hyperamylasemia and suspected chronic pancreatitis. We confirmed elevated serum amylase, normal serum lipase, and very low 24-hour urine amylase and amylase clearance/creatinine clearance ratio, consistent with MA. Serologic tests for CD were positive, and the diagnosis was confirmed by small bowel biopsy showing subtotal villous atrophy. Thyroid function tests showed a pronounced hypothyroidism, associated with high titers of thyroid microsomal and thyroglobulin antibodies. Screening for other autoantibodies-including antinuclear, islet cell, glutamic acid decarboxylase, protein tyrosine phosphatase islet antigen 512, adrenal gland, and cytoplasmic neutrophil granulocyte antibodies-was negative. A diagnosis of CD, MA, and hypothyroidism attributable to autoimmune thyroiditis was made. A gluten-free diet and oral replacement with L-thyroxine was started with clinical improvement. Serum amylase and amylase clearance/creatinine clearance ratio normalized, consistent with resolution of MA. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The patient's serum samples were obtained at the time of CD diagnosis and at 3 and 12 months after instituting a gluten-free diet. Serum samples from 10 consecutive untreated celiac children were disease controls, and 39 participants with no gastrointestinal symptoms and no family history of CD served as healthy controls. The origin of MA as determined by complexes of amylase with circulating immunoglobulins was tested by the measurement of amylase on supernatants after precipitation of immune complexes with either protein A Sepharose or polyethylene glycol. The precipitation of >60% of amylase activity was consistent with the presence of MA. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) circulating autoantibodies to amylase were measured using recently developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using porcine amylase as antigen. Results were expressed as arbitrary units (AUs). Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test for unpaired data. IgA and IgG antibodies to exocrine pancreas tissue were detected by indirect immunofluorescence on human pancreas cryosections. RESULTS: Serum immunoprecipitation with either protein A Sepharose or polyethylene glycol reduced amylase activity from 1698 to 89 U/L (94.8%) and to 75 U/L (95.6%), with only marginal reduction in control serum samples. The ELISA for autoantibodies to amylase detected high values, both IgA (3531 AU) and IgG (1855 AU), in the serum sample from the patient at CD diagnosis. IgA autoantibodies (mean +/- standard deviation) were 3.4 +/- 2.5 AU in healthy controls, and 2.1 +/- 1.2 AU in celiac controls; IgG autoantibodies were 10 +/- 4.8 AU in healthy controls and 8.5 +/- 3.2 AU, respectively. Autoantibodies to exocrine pancreas tissue were documented in patient sera at the time of CD diagnosis, both IgA and IgG, but not in control groups. Preincubation of patient's serum with excess of alpha-amylase specifically inhibited antibody binding to coated amylase in the ELISA, and partially inhibited immunoreactivity to exocrine pancreas. Autoantibodies to alpha-amylase and to exocrine pancreas declined in CD patients after institution of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Few cases of MA have been described in children, and in all amylase determination was part of the clinical investigation for abdominal pain or trauma. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

   abstract = {Summary. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of metformin on insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue mass and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in fructose fed rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed for six weeks either on a standard diet (C group) or on a high-fructose diet (F group, 10% in drinking water). In each group, half of the animals received metformin in drinking water for the last 4 weeks (500 mg/kg x day, C+M and F+M). Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (6 mU insulin/kg.min) were performed on awake unrestrained rats to test insulin resistance. Six-week fructose diet induced a reproducible insulin resistance (31.1 +/- 1.9 C vs 22.5 +/- 3.2 mg glucose/kg.min F, p<0.05). Metformin treatment prevented insulin resistance (31.1 +/- 1.9 C vs 30,2 +/- 1.8 mg glucose/kg x min F+M, ns). To measure SNS activity, rats received, ten minutes before sacrifice, an i.p. injection of NSD (m-hydroxybenzylhydrazine, inhibitor of DOPA decarboxylase, 100 mg/kg). DOPA accumulation was used as an index of SNS activity and measured in superior cervical, coeliac ganglias, retroperitoneal and epidydimal adipose tissues. SNS activity was increased in F group only in coeliac ganglia (16.8 +/- 1.1 C vs 22.6 +/- 2.2 ng DOPA/ganglia, F group, p<0.05) and not in superior cervical ganglia (8.4 +/- 0.7 C vs 8.6 +/- 0.7 ng DOPA/ganglia, F group, ns). Metformin had no effect on SNS activity in coeliac ganglia of control animals (15.9 +/- 1.7 C+M vs 16.8 +/- 1.1 ng DOPA/coeliac ganglia C, ns) but prevented the increase in SNS activity in fructose fed animals (22.6 +/- 2.2 F vs 16.3 +/- 2.8 ng DOPA/coeliac ganglia F + M). In fructose fed rats, metformin significantly increased sympathetic activity in retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (RPWAT) resulting in a marked decrease in depot mass but had no effect on epidydimal WAT. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that fructose diet caused a selective increase of SNS activity in coeliac ganglia. Metformin increased SNS activity in RPWAT resulting in a significant reduction in RPWAT mass, lowered SNS activity in coeliac ganglia to control values and restore whole body insulin sensitivity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac sprue is a chronic disease, in which there is a characteristic mucosal lesion of the small intestine and impaired nutrient absorption, which improves upon the withdrawal of wheat gliadins and related grain proteins from the diet. Biopsy specimens demonstrate diffuse enteritis with pronounced atrophy or total loss of villi. There is also a long term risk of malignant disease. AIMS: To compare the immunoexpression of DCC (deleted in colon cancer), p53, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin in the duodenal mucosa of children with coeliac disease with that seen in children with no evidence of small intestinal disease. METHODS: To gain more insight into the genetic and immunohistochemical alterations of the duodenal epithelium in coeliac disease, 21 endoscopic biopsies from children with coeliac disease and 10 duodenal biopsies from children without coeliac disease were immunohistochemically evaluated for p53, DCC, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin. RESULTS: DCC expression was not reduced in patients with coeliac disease compared with those without coeliac disease. p53 positive nuclear immunostaining was seen in seven of the 21 patients with coeliac disease. Positive nuclear staining was seen mainly in the deep and the lateral aspects of the crypts. All patients in the control group were negative for p53. In nine and three of the 21 patients with coeliac disease, respectively, the immunohistochemical expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin was reduced. However, both E-cadherin and beta-catenin immunostaining in the control group was not altered. CONCLUSIONS: E-cadherin and beta-catenin were reduced in the duodenal epithelium of children with coeliac disease when compared with normal mucosa. p53 was overexpressed in the duodenal mucosa of patients with coeliac disease. The reduced expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin and p53 overexpression may contribute to the morphological changes seen in the small intestinal mucosa in coeliac disease.},

Immunologic, environmental, infective and genetic factors equally can play role in their development. Antibodies to an oligomannose epitope of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated in 60-70% of the patients with Crohn's disease. The origin and the clinicopathological role are not clarified. It is important that there are no surveys with patients suffering in gluten sensitive enteropathy in the literature. As there are no ASCA survey in Hungary, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the ASCA. The authors examined at their patients the ASCA's occurrence and compared with the clinical picture of the Crohn's disease. The results supported the theory that ASCA positivity correlates with small intestines' Crohn's disease and in these cases both the IgG and IgA type antibodies proved. The antibodies in the sera at the analyzed ASCA positive cases prove a systemic immune response against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the authors suggest the end of the oral tolerance against the yeast's antigens. The diet restriction (elemental diet, total parenteral nutrition, and fecal diversion) may ameliorate the status of the patients with Crohn's disease. It is speculated that the yeast-free diet as a part of the therapy for the ASCA positive patients can be reasonable: moreover the permanent "forbidding" of the yeast can be an acceptable alternative in case of getting well.},

We studied 72 children: the histological diagnosis of CD was made in 38 cases and excluded in the remaining 34 children. In fasting sera we measured AE, AG-IgA and IgG, and AtTG, the latter with four different commercial kits (Eurospital, Medipan, Inova, Arnika). Moreover AtTG was measured in a group of 58 CD children after a gluten-free diet. AE was positive in all but 1 case of CD patients (sensitivity = 97%); false positive results were found in 1/34 controls (specificity = 97%). When a specificity of 95% was fixed, the sensitivities were 97% for AE, 83% for AG-IgA, and 63% for AG-IgG; the sensitivities of anti-tTG were 90, 84, 84, and 75% when measured with Eurospital, Medipan, Inova, and Arnika kits respectively. The new AtTG seems to be accurate enough to be proposed as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for CD diagnosis; the 4 kits analyzed showed similar diagnostic efficacy.},

The aims of the study were to investigate (a) the presence of delayed gastric emptying: (b) the acute effect on gastric emptying of gliadin; and (c) the effect of jejunal recovery on gastric emptying of meals with or without gluten in such patients. METHODS: We measured gastric emptying of two meals in 16 patients with coeliac disease; one meal contained gliadin. Results were compared with those obtained in 24 controls. In 12 patients, both measurements were repeated after mucosal recovery. Statistical analysis was performed using the analysis of variance for repeated measurements and Student's t test. Mean +/- 1 s(mean) (standard error of the mean) are shown. RESULTS: No difference was found in fasting and in maximal antral sections after the two meals. On entry, gastric emptying was significantly (P < 0.001) delayed compared to controls both after the meal containing gluten (326.9 +/- 12.4 min versus controls 213.5 +/- 11.5) and after the gluten-free meal (315.3 +/- 16.7 min). After jejunal recovery, emptying of the meal containing gluten remained unchanged (337 +/- 18.9 min), whereas emptying of the gluten-free meal was significantly shortened (280.6 +/- 10.5 min; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In coeliac disease there is an impairment of gastric emptying which is at least partially reversible. This suggests either an immunological disorder or that unabsorbed meal constituents are responsible for an ileal-brake effect.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) is based on the responsiveness of the enteropathy to a gluten-free diet (GFD). This implies that terms such as 'non-responsive CD' and 'refractory CD' are almost paradoxical. In spite of this, these terms are commonly used in the literature, often with different and confusing meanings. METHODS: On the basis of both a review of the literature and our clinical experience, we propose the following classification. A condition characterized by a refractory enteropathy, not due to lymphoma, ulcerative jejunoileitis or collagenous sprue, but in which gluten sensitivity has been shown previously or could be shown while the patients were on an immunosuppressive therapy should be indicated as refractory CD. Those patients in whom gluten sensitivity can be excluded should be considered to be affected by non-coeliac refractory sprue. Finally, patients in whom the presence of CD cannot be either confirmed or excluded should be considered to be affected by undefined sprue. RESULTS: Twenty-four certain refractory patients are described in the literature. The data suggest a diagnosis of refractory CD in 13 patients, non-coeliac refractory sprue in three patients, and undefined sprue in eight patients. CONCLUSIONS: We define refractory CD as a form of CD that no longer responds to a GFD. Non-coeliac refractory sprue is a condition unrelated to CD. It could be either an independent condition or a common end point of different enteropathies.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an intestinal disease due to an abnormal immuno-mediated response to gluten and other peptides from different cereals in genetically susceptible subjects. Several systemic alterations, including bone alterations, may be present in affected subjects. Once considered rare, it is now known to be quite frequent in both Europe and North America, as the recent availability of specific serological markers has drastically changed our perspective on its prevalence. The diagnosis of celiac disease may be very difficult because the clinical picture is highly variable and the characteristic intestinal signs and symptoms may be completely absent. Among the extra-intestinal alterations, bone mass decrease and bone metabolism derangement are frequently present and can be the only signs of an otherwise silent celiac disease. Clinical and epidemiological data are now plentiful but no conclusive data on the pathogenesis of bone involvement in celiac disease are available yet. Bone alterations were once thought to derive from calcium and vitamin D deficiency secondary to simple intestinal malabsorption, but now a more complex interaction between cytokines and local/systemic factors influencing bone formation and reabsorption is envisaged, Also, there is now substantial evidence supporting a lifelong gluten-free diet as the first-choice therapy for celiac disease, and as far as we know, this is the only effective measure to restore bone metabolism to an apparent normality. In the young, an early-started gluten-free diet can even lead to a satisfactory recovery of bone mass. In adults, however, there is no spontaneous recovery, and there are no conclusive data on the efficacy of standard therapies for osteoporosis in reducing the fracture risk. For these reasons, we feel that a review of the clinical findings on bone problems in celiac disease may be useful for both gastroenterologists and osteoporosis specialists.},

   abstract = {The characterization of target antigens in several autoimmune disorders has made it possible to develop antigen-specific immunoassays that are superior in terms of sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and ease of standardization, compared to immunohistological methods that are highly subjective, rely on skilled technicians and are not applicable to large-scale studies. In the case of celiac disease (CD), tissue transglutaminase (tTGase) has been identified as a major autoantigen, and antibodies against this molecule are present in most CD patients before gluten is removed from diet. In general, anti-tTGase detection assays detect the presence of IgA class antibodies, but these immunoglobulins are absent among patients with IgA deficiency, a frequent condition in which CD is very prevalent. In this report, we have analyzed 64 patients at diagnosis of CD for the presence of antibodies against tTGase of both IgA (TGA) and IgG (TGG) classes, using anti-IgA antibodies or Protein A, respectively, for the immunoprecipitation of 35S labeled, in vitro transcribed and translated human recombinant tTGase. In our hands, the TGG assay matches TGA in terms of sensitivity (97%) and specificity (100%), and besides, the combination of both assays is able to detect antibodies in all patient samples. The method described uses only 6 microl of serum, can be adapted to automated large-scale analysis and, in combination with other antigens, can be used for the simultaneous screening of other autoimmune diseases, like type 1 diabetes mellitus.},

Mice were immunized with gluten i.p. or individual peptides s.c. and spleen or draining lymph node T cells were challenged in vitro. Strong proliferative responses to gluten were seen in the HCD4/DQ8 mice, whereas the HCD4/DQ6 mice responded to gluten poorly. A series of overlapping peptides spanning gliadin were synthesized. The HCD4/DQ8 mice reacted to many of the individual peptides of gliadin, while the HCD4/DQ6 mice were relatively unresponsive. T cells isolated from HCD4/DQ8 mice also responded well to modified (deamidated) versions of the gliadin peptides, whereas HCD4DQ6 mice did not. The T cell response to gluten was CD4 dependent and DQ restricted and led to the production of cytokines IL-6, TGF-beta, and IL-10. Finally, intestinal lymphocytes isolated from gluten-fed HCD4/DQ8 mice displayed an activated phenotype. These data suggest that this HLA class II transgenic murine model of gluten sensitivity may provide insight into the initiation of the MHC class II-restricted gluten sensitivity in celiac disease.},

Catch-up growth is a remarkable phenomenon characterized by a supranormal height velocity. One of the hypothetical mechanisms of catch-up growth is that an increased activity of the somatotrophic axis is involved. In order to provide further insight in the physiology of catch-up growth, auxological and endocrine changes were prospectively studied in 28 children with newly diagnosed celiac disease. The results demonstrate a malnutrition-like state of the somatotrophic axis at the time of diagnosis and a rapid recovery of this axis towards normal functioning after institution of the gluten-free diet. Although several correlations between these endocrine alterations and auxological parameters were detected, it is questionable whether the endocrine changes are the driving force behind catch-up growth.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (nontropical sprue, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, chronic intestinal malabsorption disorder) is caused by gluten intolerance. This hereditary disorder is caused by sensitivity to gliadin. Because the body's own immune system causes the damage, celiac disease is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. However, it is also classified as a disease of malabsorption because nutrients are not absorbed. When people with celiac disease eat foods containing gluten, their immune system responds by damaging the small intestine. Specifically, tiny finger-like protrusions, called villi, on the lining of the small intestine are lost. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of symptoms and signs, enhanced by laboratory and x-ray studies, and confirmed by biopsy revealing flat mucosa and subsequent clinical and histologic improvement on a gluten-free diet. Gluten must be excluded from diet. Supplementary vitamins, minerals and hematinics may be given depending on deficiency. CASE REPORT: This is a case report of a 23-year old female patient with a mineralization defect (osteomalacia) and secondary osteoporosis caused by long-time unrecognized celiac disease. The patient had many symptoms: short stature, steatorrhea, anemia, weight loss and chronic bone pain. Laboratory and x-ray studies and jejunal biopsy revealed a chronic intestinal malabsorption disorder caused by gluten intolerance. Gluten-free diet and supplementary vitamins, minerals and hematinics were included with apparent clinical remission. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Some people with celiac disease may not have symptoms. The undamaged part of their small intestine is able to absorb enough nutrients to prevent symptoms. However, people without symptoms are still at risk for complications of celiac disease. Biopsy of the small intestine is the best way to diagnose celiac disease. Decreased bone density (osteoporosis and osteomalacia) is a serious problem for celiacs. If calcium is not absorbed, due to small intestinal damage caused by untreated celiac disease, bones are not as dense. The only treatment for celiac disease is gluten-free diet, that is, avoiding all foods that contain gluten. For most people, this diet stops symptoms, heals the existing intestinal damage, and prevents further damage.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is one of the most frequent chronic diseases in childhood. The clinical spectrum has changed; in addition to the classical gastrointestinal form, other clinical manifestations have been described, such as hypogonadism and the consequent delay in onset of puberty. Recent studies reported not only a significantly retarded menarche in untreated CD girls as compared with girls following a gluten-free diet, but also in treated CD a negative effect on pregnancy, resulting in lower birth weight and shorter duration of pregnancy. In boys, there is a reduced serum level of dihydrotestosterone and an increased serum level of luteinizing hormone, an abnormality pattern suggesting androgen resistance. The pathogenesis of CD-related reproductive disorders is still unclear. Some hypotheses may be tried; for example, in CD there is a high level of autoantibodies directed against self-antigens, so there could be antibodies directed against hormones or organs critical for pubertal development. Moreover, in CD there could be a selective malabsorption of micronutrients essential for the metabolism of carrier or receptor proteins for sex hormones.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish the most sensitive and specific screening method for celiac disease. We tested three methods based on different principles, which all detect autoantibodies against the same antigen (tissue transglutaminase). METHODS: Sixty-two celiac children at the first biopsy (group 1), 78 celiac children on a gluten-free diet (group 2), 14 celiac children on a gluten-challenge (group 3), and 56 controls with a normal duodenal mucosa (group 4) were studied. The methods used were: 1) radioimmunoprecipitation assay using recombinant tissue transglutaminase (RIA); 2) commercial enzyme immunoassay using guinea pig tissue transglutaminase (ELISA); and 3) indirect immunofluorescence method for detection of antiendomysium antibodies (IF-EMA). RESULTS: RIA antitransglutaminase autoantibodies were detected in 100% of group 1, 43.6% of group 2, 100% of group 3, and none of the control subjects. ELISA antitransglutaminase autoantibodies were detected in 90.3% of group 1, 9% of group 2, 78.6% of group 3, and in none of the control subjects. IF-EMA were detected in 95.2% of group 1, 11.5% of group 2, 92.3% of group 3, and 1.8% of the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a very high sensitivity and specificity of the RIA method to detect antitransglutaminase autoantibodies in comparison to ELISA and IF-EMA assays. We can explain this finding with the use of human recombinant antigen and the increased capacity of the RIA method to detect low titers of autoantibodies. If our data are confirmed by studies on larger series, tissue transglutaminase RIA could be proposed as the best screening method for celiac patients.},

A recently developed ELISA, using human recombinant tissue transglutaminase (tTG) as antigen, was evaluated for its significance in the diagnosis of CD. The patient's compliance to a gluten-free diet and the serological reaction during gluten challenge were also monitored. The results were compared with IgA-endomysium antibody (EMA) results. METHODS: Sera previously collected from 365 patients (0.4-76 years) with jejunal biopsy on a gluten-containing diet and from 41 patients on a gluten-free diet or challenge were tested for IgA anti-human tTG antibodies (IgA tTG ab) with Celikey (Pharmacia Diagnostics). The study population comprised 208 CD patients and 157 controls. The diagnostic performance and cut-off for the assay were estimated with ROC analysis. EMA was analysed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on cryostat sections of monkey oesophagus. RESULTS: 200/208 patients with CD had positive IgA tTG ab (median >100 U/ml), while only 1/157 of the control patients were positive (median 1.67 U/ml). The area under the ROC curve was 98.3% and the sensitivity and specificity of the test were 96% and 99% for the study population. Only 4/365 patients (1%) presented discordant IgA tTG ab and EMA results, 2 of them had only IgA tTG ab and 2 only EMA. The IgA tTG ab levels and the EMA titres were closely correlated to the duration of gluten-free diet and gluten challenge, respectively. CONCLUSION: IgA tTG ab can be used as an accurate observer-independent alternative to EMA in diagnosing or monitoring CD.},

Besides chronic pain, about 80% of the patients develop acute pancreatitis, pseudocysts, compression of the main bile duct, serous effusion or digestive bleeding during the first five years of the disease course. Painful episodes are more frequent after 5 to 10 years, with a risk of jaundice and persistent pseudocyst formation. CHRONIC COURSE: Beyond 10 years, calcified stones and fibrosis progressively replace the pancreas parenchyma. Painful events become more parse and after 15 years, diabetes and exocrine insufficiency predominate. TREATMENT: Abstention from alcoholic beverages, analgesics administration and balanced diet are essential therapeutic elements. Insulin is required for the diabetes and pancreas extracts in gastroprotected microcapsules are needed to compensate for the chronic exocrine insufficiency. This medical treatment may be able to control pain but interventional radiology (pseudocyst drainage, antalgesic infiltration of the celiac plexus), interventional endoscopy (pseudocyst drainage, biliary stent, pancreatic endoprosthesis), or surgery (deviation of the bile ducts, wirsungojejunal derivation, exceptionally resection) may also be required.},

Here, we investigated the prevalence of abnormally high serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG anti-gliadin antibody titers and typical human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes in 50 patients presenting with cerebellar ataxia who were tested for molecularly characterized hereditary ataxias. A high prevalence of gluten sensitivity was found in patients with sporadic (7/26; 27%) and autosomal dominant (9/24; 37%) ataxias, including patients with known ataxia genotypes indicating a hitherto unrecognized association between hereditary ataxias and gluten sensitivity. Further studies are needed to determine whether gluten sensitivity contributes to cerebellar degeneration in patients with hereditary cerebellar ataxia. Patients with hereditary ataxia (including asymptomatic patients with known ataxia genotype) should be considered for screening for gluten sensitivity and gluten-free diet trials.},

Before the onset of clinical symptoms, the patient had received a series of hepatitis B vaccinations but had not developed a measurable antibody response or any allergic reaction. Radioallergosorbent test results were positive to several foods, and the total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) level was elevated. Adherence to a gluten-free diet caused a normalization in the endomysial antibody titer; however, the total serum IgE level continued to increase, and the total eosinophil count remained elevated. Symptoms of recurrent vomiting and abdominal pain necessitated prednisone burst therapy. The simultaneous occurrence of eosinophilic gastroenteritis and gluten-sensitive enteropathy is rare; therapy should be directed to each disorder individually.},

There were no gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical examination showed evidence of bilateral, proximal muscle atrophy and weakness in the lower limbs. Low serum calcium and raised serum alkaline phosphatase, coupled with radiological findings, led to the diagnosis of osteomalacia. Subsequent gastroscopy and duodenal biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of coeliac disease. With adherence to a gluten-free diet, the patient's condition remarkably improved within 3 months and she could walk pain-free using a stick. Osteomalacia and myopathy may rarely be the initial and primary presentations of coeliac disease. There are very few reports of osteomalacia as the only presentation of coeliac disease and no reports that describe such a dramatic recovery 3 months after commencing a gluten-free diet. A review of the literature regarding osteomalacia and myopathy in coeliac disease is presented.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: A 15-year-old boy with epilepsy and cerebral calcifications, treated with valproic acid, ethyl phenylbarbiturate and ethosuximide, was referred for drug induced systemic lupus erythematosus. Anti-gliadin (AGA) and anti-endomysium (EMA) antibody tests were both positive (EMA titre 1:50). Endoscopic duodenal biopsy showed intense chronic inflammation without villous atrophy or crypt hyperplasia. The child was discharged with a gluten-containing diet. The follow-up showed an increase in EMA titre (1:200) and the persistence of AGA. After 15 months, a second endoscopic intestinal biopsy showed flat mucosa and villous atrophy. Three serum folic acid determinations showed 1.8, 2.4, 2.0 ng/ml (reference range 2.5-16.9 ng/ml) prior to the two intestinal biopsies, but returned to normal levels (11.8 ng/ml) after a gluten-free diet and oral supplementation together. Two years later, the frequency of epileptic seizures was unchanged despite ongoing anti-epileptic treatment and a gluten-free diet. As cerebral calcification and epilepsy are reminiscent of the findings in congenital folate malabsorption, oral loading tests with 5 mg folic acid were carried out and showed impaired intestinal absorption and a defect in the transport across the blood-brain barrier. Low CSF folate levels (13.9 and 12.6 ng/ml, reference range 15-40 ng/ml) and an alteration in the CSF/serum folate ratio (1.43 and 1.16, normal ratio 3:1) were also found as well as increased levels of cystathionine both in CSF (40 micromol/l, reference range 18-28 micromol/l) and in serum (32 micromol/l, reference value <0.10 micromol/l). CONCLUSION: Impairment of intestinal folic acid absorption with a defect in folic acid transport across the blood-brain barrier has been demonstrated in a case of epilepsy and cerebral calcifications associated with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac sprue, celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is a malabsorption disorder of the small intestine that occurs after ingestion of wheat gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. This disease is characterized by intestinal malabsorption associated with villous atrophy of the small intestinal mucosa, clinical and histological improvement after adherence to strict gluten free diet, and relapse when gluten is reintroduced. Celiac sprue has a high prevalence in Western Europe and North America where it is estimated to affect 1:120 to 1:300 individuals. The pathogenesis of celiac sprue is related to inappropriate intestinal T-cell activation in HLA-DQ2 positive individuals triggered by antigenic peptides from wheat gluten or prolamins from barley and rye. Although previously thought to be mainly a disease of childhood onset, the diagnosis is increasingly being made in adults. There are a wide variety of presentations, which range from asymptomatic forms to severe diarrhea, weight loss and nutritional deficiencies. Extraintestinal manifestations including anemia, osteopenia or neurological disorders and associated conditions such as diabetes or hypothyroidism are commonly present. The availability of highly sensitive and specific serologic markers has dramatically facilitated the diagnosis of celiac sprue. However, the demonstration of characteristic histological abnormalities in a biopsy specimen of the small intestine remains the mainstay of diagnosis. Treatment consists of life-long avoidance of dietary gluten to control symptoms and to prevent both immediate and long-term complications.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to investigate the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) among 2.5-year-old children in a Swedish urban population with a high incidence of CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six hundred ninety apparently healthy children, born in the 12-month period of July 1992 through June 1993, were screened for immunoglobulin A (IgA) antigliadin antibodies and IgA antiendomysium antibodies, and those antibody-positive at repeated testing were further investigated with intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: Of the 690 children, 6 were both IgA antigliadin antibody- and IgA antiendomysium antibody-positive, and 7 were antiendomysium antibody-positive but antigliadin antibody-negative. Jejunal biopsy, performed in 12 cases, manifested partial or total villous atrophy in 8 cases. Thus, together with an additional child whose parents declined the offered biopsy, but whose response to a gluten-free diet confirmed the presence of CD, the prevalence of CD in the study series was 1.3% (9/690; 95% confidence interval:.4-2.2). However, independent of the study, an additional 22 cases of symptomatic, biopsy-verified CD have already been detected in the birth cohort of 3004 children. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CD in our study series was high, at least 1.0%, but may be as high as 2.0% if the frequency of silent CD is as high as we have found in the remaining unscreened cohort. These findings confirm that CD is one of the most common chronic disorders.},

We describe a young child with diarrhoea, intestinal mucosa atrophy and positive serum anti-endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies during intestinal giardiasis infection. He showed normal intestinal mucosa architecture and negative anti-endomysial and anti-tTG antibodies after his giardiasis was cured, although he continued to assume a normal diet. Re-evaluations on a 6-monthly basis showed that he was symptom free, and all haemato-chemical parameters were within normal limits. Three years after the initial diagnosis, a third intestinal biopsy showed: normal mucosa architecture; an increase in the intra-epithelial CD3+ and gamma/delta+ lymphocyte counts; and immunoglobulin-A anti-endomysial antibody detection in the supernatant of the intestinal mucosa culture incubated with gliadin. An active coeliac disease status, with intestinal mucosa atrophy, may regress to a latent coeliac disease status with normal intestinal mucosa histology after removal of the environmental factors that have presumably precipitated mucosa damage. Serum anti-endomysial and anti-tTG antibody behaviour is not a permanent, life-long feature and this must recommend the repetition of anti-endomysial or anti-tTG antibody assays in the same patient whenever coeliac disease diagnosis is again suspected, irrespective of previous negativity.},

To report the case of an elderly woman hospitalized for extreme thrombocytosis associated with severe anaemia, who was found to be suffering from coeliac disease. The patient, aged 83 years, was hospitalized presenting with fatigue. Laboratory tests showed microcytic hypochromic anaemia (haemoglobin 4 g/dl) and extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count 1,400,000/mm3). Physical examination was normal, with the exception of marked thinness. There was no evidence of macroscopic bleeding from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts. She had never suffered from gastrointestinal problems and had no family history of gastroenterological diseases. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and histology of the gastric and duodenal mucosa evidenced atrophic gastritis and an adenomatous polyp. The duodenal mucosa showed total villous atrophy, suggesting the diagnosis of coeliac disease. Antiendomysial IgA and anti-transglutaminase IgA antibodies were also positive. Colonoscopy was negative. An ultrasound examination of the abdomen was normal, and the spleen was within the normal range. A peripheral blood smear showed no alterations in erythrocyte morphology typical of hyposplenism due to coeliac disease. The platelet count decreased rapidly after blood transfusions, when both serum iron and ferritin levels were still below normal limits. Furthermore, we observed a significant inverse correlation between the platelet count and haemoglobin concentration (r = -0.94, P < 0.003). Platelet count and red blood cell count normalized after 2 months of a gluten-free diet; the haemoglobin concentration was also normal at this time. After 1 year of following a gluten-free diet, the patient remained well and had no complaints. There were no gastrointestinal disturbances. All haematological parameters were within normal limits. Intestinal biopsies showed normal villi and crypts without inflammatory infiltration of the lamina propria. This case shows that the association of haematological signs--extreme thrombocytosis and severe anaemia--considered in an elderly patient to be typical of myeloproliferative disorders or neoplastic conditions can be due to coeliac disease; thus, coeliac disease must also be considered among the possible diagnoses.},

AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of open-label oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation therapy in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients with fat malabsorption. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and fat malabsorption were recruited (11 males, 13 females; median age, 9.1 years). Faecal fat loss was evaluated by steatocrit assay at entry to the study (T-0), after 2 weeks (T-1) without pancreatic enzyme treatment and after a further 2 weeks (T-2) of treatment with pancreatic extracts (Creon 10 000 at a dose of 1000 units of lipase per gram of ingested dietary fat). Faecal elastase-1 and chymotrypsin were assayed at entry. RESULTS: Six patients (25%) had abnormally low elastase-1 and/or chymotrypsin faecal concentration. In all patients, steatocrit values were elevated at both T-0 and T-1. Five patients proved intolerant to pancreatic enzyme treatment because of the onset of abdominal pain, and therapy was discontinued. In the 19 patients who concluded the study, steatocrit values during pancreatic enzyme treatment (T-2) were significantly lower than at entry (P < 0.0001). At T-2, in eight of 19 patients, steatocrit values were within the normal limit and the frequency of cases cured or improved on pancreatic enzyme therapy (at T-2) was significantly higher than that observed during the previous study period without enzyme treatment (T-1) (P < 0.01). A positive significant correlation was found between steatocrit values at entry and the Centers for Disease Control class (P < 0.0005); also, the decrease in steatocrit values during pancreatic enzyme therapy (difference between steatocrit value at T-2 and steatocrit value at T-0) positively correlated with the Centers for Disease Control class (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot, open-label study showed that pancreatic enzyme supplementation therapy is highly effective in reducing faecal fat loss in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with nutrient malabsorption. Further double-blind studies must be undertaken to verify these results and, if they are confirmed, pancreatic enzymes can be added to our weapons in the fight against human immunodeficiency virus-associated nutrient malabsorption.},

Our aims were to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the in vitro production of EmA in CD diagnosis in consecutive patients with suspected CD, and to evaluate the reliability of the in vitro challenge in CD patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: For the former aim, consecutive patients who were due to undergo intestinal biopsy for suspected diagnosis of CD were enrolled: according to the final diagnosis, these patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 comprised 91 newly diagnosed CD patients (40 males; age range 7 months to 84 years), Group 2 included 100 subjects with diseases other than CD (44 males; age range 9 months to 76 years). For the latter aim, we also studied 21 CD patients on a gluten-free diet after 16-123 months (8 males; age range 3-51 years), with normal intestinal architecture (Group 3) and 22 patients who served as controls (12 males; age range 4-60 years) with gastroesophageal reflux disease-like symptoms (Group 4). All patients underwent determination of serum anti-gliadin (AGA) and EmA antibodies, histology evaluation of the intestinal biopsies and EmA assay in the supernatants of in vitro gliadin-challenged duodenal mucosa. RESULTS: EmA assay in the supernatants showed a sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 100%, respectively; these were not significantly different from those observed for serum EmA (88% and 99%, respectively). However, EmA assay in the supernatants was useful in CD patients with mild intestinal histology lesions (infiltrative/hyperplastic type): in this subgroup it was positive in 9/12 of cases, but serum EmA was positive in only 2/12. As regards the reliability of the in vitro gliadin challenge, EmA production in supernatants was recorded only in 10/21 CD patients on a gluten-free diet. The patients with a positive in vitro challenge had a higher number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes than patients with a negative challenge. CONCLUSIONS: 1) EmA assay in the medium of cultured intestinal biopsy can detect gluten-sensitive enteropathy, characterized by an infiltrative/hyperplastic histological pattern, which is often associated with negative serum EmA. 2) The in vitro challenge in CD patients on a gluten-free diet detects EmA production in the culture medium only in half of the cases and other studies must be performed to evaluate whether EmA production after in vitro challenge can be considered a reliable test for confirming CD diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Several reports have indicated that fecal elastase-1 (EL-1) determination is a new, sensitive, and specific noninvasive pancreatic function test; however, very few patients with malabsorption due to small intestine diseases have been included in the previous studies. The aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of fecal EL-1 and fecal chymotrypsin (FCT) in distinguishing between pancreatic maldigestion and intestinal malabsorption. Three groups of subjects were studied: group A included 49 patients with known cystic fibrosis (25 males, median age 5 years); group B included 43 subjects with various small intestine diseases (17 males, median age 6 years); and group C included 45 children without any history of gastrointestinal disease (22 males, median age 5 years). In all patients, stools were collected for 72 h on a standard diet and fecal EL-1, FCT, and steatocrit tests were performed. Both EL-1 and FCT were below normal limits in all CF patients with pancreatic maldigestion not treated with pancreatic enzyme (100% sensitivity for both assays); El-1, but not FCT, was also below normal in all the CF patients with pancreatic maldigestion treated with pancreatic extracts. Both EL-1 and FCT values in the CF group were significantly lower than in subjects with various small intestinal diseases and in children without any history of gastrointestinal disease (P < 0.0001). FCT, but not EL-1, values showed an inverse statistically significant correlation with steatocrit values in the whole CF group (P < 0.001); FCT was below normal in three of four CF patients with steatorrhea on pancreatic enzyme therapy. Both EL-1 and FCT had 100% specificity when calculated in children without any history of gastrointestinal disease; in contrast, specificity was 86% for EL-1 and 76% for FCT if we considered the control group with small intestinal diseases: low EL-1 was observed in two cases of intestinal giardiasis, two cases of short bowel syndrome, one case of celiac disease, and one case of intestinal pseudobstruction; FCT was abnormal in four cases of intestinal giardiasis, three cases of celiac disease, one case of short bowel syndrome, one case of Crohn's disease, and one case of intestinal pseudobstruction. Diagnostic accuracy was 92% for fecal EL-1 and 82% for FCT. Steatocrit values were over the normal limit in 11 patients with small intestine diseases; in 7/11 of these patients at least one of the pancreatic test results was below the normal limit. In conclusions, in patients with CF, fecal EL-1 determination is not more sensitive than FCT in identifying pancreatic maldigestion; however, fecal EL-1 assay is more specific than FCT determination in distinguishing pancreatic maldigestion from intestinal malabsorption.},

   abstract = {Recent data suggest that celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is a common disorder not only in populations of European ancestry, but also in developing areas, such as North Africa, Middle East and India. The world distribution of celiac disease apparently relates to the consumption of gluten-containing cereals. In the Arab people of Saharawi, the prevalence of celiac disease in children is so high (more than 5%) that this condition represents a primary health problem. In developing countries the clinical picture of celiac disease is often typical, characterized by chronic diarrhea, malnutrition, stunting and increased mortality, especially in younger children. The high prevalence of celiac disease in areas showing a poor sanitary condition could be explained by a protective role of the celiac enteropathy (against intestinal infections) in the context of a low gluten consumption. The problem of celiac disease in developing countries should by approached by a multifaceted strategy, based on (1) increasing disease awareness and diagnostic facilities and (2) a "flexible" dietary intervention that takes into account the nutritional habits and local food availability.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial disorder of the small intestine caused by a permanent dietary intolerance to gluten. The combined presence of the HLA class II DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201 alleles represents the major genetic component for disease predisposition. It has been shown that the Saharawi refugees living in northern Africa have a very high frequency of CD. In the present study we analysed this population to evaluate the degree of association with CD of the haplotypes and genotypes at the main HLA-DQB1 and DQA1 disease loci. We found a strong association of the DR3, DQB1*0201-DQA1*0501-positive haplotypes and genotypes. A very high frequency of DR3, DQB1*0201-DQA1*0501 was also observed in the general Saharawi population. These results indicate that there is a good correlation between disease prevalence and frequency of the main predisposing haplotype in the background population. However, the correlation is incomplete because similar frequencies of DR3 are also observed in populations such as the Sardinians showing a much lower prevalence of CD. We can conclude that the distribution of DQ genes in the Saharawi population only provides a partial explanation for the high prevalence of CD. Other factors, such as rapidly changing dietary habits and/or non-DQ genes, may also play some role.},

Fewer of half of patients report diarrhoea as a presenting symptom. In adults, the diagnosis should be considered, in case of isolated iron deficiency anaemia, neurological symptoms (ataxia, epilepsy), osteoporosis and arthralgia, infertility, dermatitis herpetiformis and abnormalities in liver tests. Characteristic histological features are total or subtotal villous atrophy associated with an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes. The most sensitive and specific circulating antibodies for the diagnosis are endomysial and transglutaminase IgA antibodies. The treatment of celiac disease requires a strict gluten free diet, but the observance to this diet is often difficult. In patients refractory to a strict gluten free diet, serious complications such as intestinal lymphoma or refractory sprue should be considered.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease is the most common severe food intolerance in the Western world and is due to gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible children and adults. Intestinal biopsy is the golden standard for evaluation of mucosal damage associated with celiac disease. Gluten-free diet is the key treatment for celiac disease. Data on the long-term control of celiac disease are few and limited to small series of patients. The study reports data on the control of celiac disease and on its correlates in a large cohort of celiac adults during long-term treatment with gluten-free diet. METHODS: The study cohort comprises 91 men and 299 women having undergone treatment with a gluten-free diet for at least 2 years and with complete records for visits at the time of diagnosis of celiac disease (baseline). Data collection included gender, age, education, weight, bowel habit, blood hemoglobin, plasma albumin and cholesterol, serum antiendomysium antibodies (EMA), dietary compliance to gluten-free diet (coded as good, low, or very low), and intestinal damage at biopsy (coded as absent, mild, or severe). RESULTS: The duration of follow-up was 6.9 +/- 7.5 years (mean +/- SD, range 2-22 years). At follow-up visit, intestinal damage was absent in 170 patients (43.6%), mild in 127 (32.6%), and severe in 93 (23.8%). At follow-up, intestinal damage was significantly associated with dietary compliance, EMA, and plasma albumin (follow-up value and change value from baseline to follow-up). Baseline education significantly predicted dietary compliance and intestinal damage at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is often poorly controlled in the majority of patients on long-term treatment with a gluten-free diet as demonstrated by intestinal biopsy. Lack of adherence to strict gluten-free diet is the main reason of poorly controlled disease in adults. Laboratory and clinical information have a high positive predictive value and low negative predictive value for intestinal damage on long-term treatment. Dietary compliance as assessed by interview is the best marker of celiac disease control due to low cost, noninvasivity, and strong correlation with intestinal damage.},

   abstract = {The trefoil factor family (TFF) encompasses small peptides of which intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) is expressed specifically in goblet cells of the small and large intestine. Previous studies have shown that ITF plays an important role in mucosal protection and repair. Coeliac disease represents a model of immune-mediated small intestinal inflammation and damage, with recovery on gluten-free diet. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of ITF in the distal duodenal mucosa of subjects with coeliac disease, before and after treatment with a gluten-free diet. Expression of ITF and mucin in the distal duodenal biopsies from treated (n = 11) and untreated (n = 9) coeliac subjects and controls (n = 8) was investigated by immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative PCR. In untreated coeliac disease, there was reduction of ITF immunoreactivity in goblet cells but mucin expression was preserved. Mucosal recovery on gluten-free diet was associated with increased ITF immunoreactivity in goblet cells. There was also reduction in the expression of ITF transcripts, relative to MUC2 mRNA, in untreated coeliac duodenal samples, with recovery on gluten-free diet. Our study suggests that there is a selective reduction in the expression of the ITF gene in untreated coeliac disease. Recovery of ITF expression on a gluten-free diet suggests that the mucosal immune system regulates goblet cell differentiation and ITF expression in the human intestinal mucosa.},

   abstract = {Psychic alterations have been reported in celiac disease. Our aim was to evaluate the emotional impact of celiac disease diagnosis in adulthood, the patient/doctor relationship, and the patients' cooperation with disease treatment and diet. The patients were 114 adult celiac patients on a gluten-free diet, there were 25 untreated celiac patients. Self-administered questionnaires aimed to evaluate the patients' level of knowledge of disease, the emotional impact at diagnosis, and feelings during follow-up. Celiac patients showed good knowledge of the disease, directly correlated to their socioeconomic level (P = 0.011). At diagnosis, relief was most intense feeling (Mean +/- SD, 10.82 +/- 7.63), demographics, time latency of diagnosis, and the duration of the disease had no effect on the intensity of all feelings. The scores of the self-rated emotions were entered into a principal component analysis that generated three factors: 1 (fear, anger, anxiety and sadness), 2 (reassurance and resignation), and 3 (relief); patients judged the clinicians presenting the disease "in the right way" (F = 33.279; P < 0.0001). The right way correlated with relief and reassurance (P = 0.0009; P = 0.0008 respectively). At follow-up, anger was the predominant emotion that induced patients to transgress. A positive correlation was observed between feeling different and the sadness, anger, fear (P < 0.0001 for all). Anger was inversely correlated with actual compliance to diet (P = 0.0005). In conclusion, in adult patients, adaptive and psychological aspects must be taken into account to understand the celiac patient and for better clinical management.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a permanent intolerance to dietary gluten. Its well known features are abdominal symptoms, malabsorption of nutrients, and small-bowel mucosal inflammation with villous atrophy, which recover on a gluten-free diet. Diagnosis is challenging in that patients often suffer from subtle, if any, symptoms. The risk of clinically silent celiac disease is increased in various autoimmune conditions. The endocrinologist, especially, should maintain high suspicion and alertness to celiac disease, which is to be found in 2-5% of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or autoimmune thyroid disease. Patients with multiple endocrine disorders, Addison's disease, alopecia, or hypophysitis may also have concomitant celiac disease. Similar heredity and proneness to autoimmune conditions are considered to be explanations for these associations. A gluten-free diet is essential to prevent celiac complications such as anemia, osteoporosis, and infertility. The diet may also be beneficial in the treatment of the underlying endocrinological disease; prolonged gluten exposure may even contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases. The diagnosis of celiac disease requires endoscopic biopsy, but serological screening with antiendomysial and antitissue transglutaminase antibody assays is an easy method for preliminary case finding. Celiac disease will be increasingly detected provided the close association with autoimmune endocrinological diseases is recognized.},

Celiac disease is strongly associated with the HLA DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes, which might explain the potential risk of patients to contract various autoimmune conditions. In this study, we sought to establish how common celiac disease is in patients with IgA nephropathy, and whether the possible association can be explained by similar HLA DQ status. METHODS: A total of 223 consecutive adult patients with IgA nephropathy were studied; 95 cadaver organ transplant donors served as controls for HLA DQ analysis. The diagnosis of celiac disease was based on small bowel mucosal biopsy. All known celiac cases were recorded, and eligible patients (n = 168) underwent serological screening for celiac disease as well as HLA DQ2 and DQ8 analysis. Screening methods were serum endomysium and tissue transglutaminase antibodies; patients who tested positive underwent mucosal biopsy. RESULTS: Eight patients (3.6%, 95% CI = 1.6-7.0%) with IgA nephropathy were found to have celiac disease; three of them were identified by serological screening. All celiac cases had the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 haplotype, but these were not more common in patients with IgA nephropathy than in controls. As many as 14% of HLA DQ2 positive patients with IgA nephropathy had celiac disease. Gluten-free diet had no apparent influence on the course of nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is no increase in celiac-type HLA DQ, patients with IgA nephropathy carry a risk of contracting celiac disease. It can be hypothesized that the increased intestinal permeability in IgA nephropathy may predispose genetically susceptible patients to celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although previous studies have shown increased mortality in patients with coeliac disease and their relatives, no data are available in relation to different patterns of clinical presentation. We assessed mortality in patients with coeliac disease and their first-degree relatives. METHODS: We enrolled, in a prospective cohort study, 1072 adult patients with coeliac disease consecutively diagnosed in 11 gastroenterology units between 1962 and 1994, and their 3384 first-degree relatives. We compared the number of deaths up to 1998 with expected deaths and expressed the comparison as standardised mortality ratio (SMR) and relative survival ratio. FINDINGS: 53 coeliac patients died compared with 25.9 expected deaths (SMR 2.0 [95% CI 1.5-2.7]). A significant excess of mortality was evident during the first 3 years after diagnosis of coeliac disease and in patients who presented with malabsorption symptoms (2.5 [1.8-3.4]), but not in those diagnosed because of minor symptoms (1.1 [0.5-2.2]) or because of antibody screening (1.2 [0.1-7.0]). SMR increased with increasing delay in diagnosis and for patients with poor compliance with gluten-free diet. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma was the main cause of death. No excess of deaths was recorded in relatives with coeliac disease. INTERPRETATION: Prompt and strict dietary treatment decreases mortality in coeliac patients. Prospective studies are needed to clarify the progression of mild or symptomless coeliac disease and its relation to intestinal lymphoma.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (gluten sensitive enteropathy) is a condition affecting the small bowel, characterized by permanent intolerance to dietary gluten, and giving rise to varying degrees of malabsorption and diarrhea. With the advent of sensitive screening tests, the condition is being increasingly diagnosed. Celiac disease is more common in the Irish and in those of Irish descent. Simoons (1978, 1981) hypothesized that the present-day prevalence of celiac disease across Europe is related to the interaction between genetic gradients, largely determined by the advance of agriculture, and historical patterns of cereal ingestion. This essay examines Simoons' hypothesis as it relates to Ireland, reviews the ethnic and genetic mix of those living on the island of Ireland and aspects of Irish dietary history, and considers how these factors may have combined to result in a high frequency of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {It is often difficult to assess small bowel recovery in adults with coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet (GFD). This prospective study compares changes in intestinal permeability with changes in intestinal biopsy at various intervals after commencing a GFD. Intestinal permeability was measured by lactulose/rhamnose absorption from 1 week to 24 months after commencing a GFD. Intestinal morphometry was measured by villus area, crypt length and mitotic count per crypt at diagnosis and after commencing a GFD. Median intestinal permeability values decreased from 0.47 (n = 35) at diagnosis to 0.25 (n = 17) after 1 week and to 0.16 (n = 18) after 2 months of a GFD. Rhamnose absorption improved significantly at an early stage, from 6.6% (untreated) to 15.4% at 3 months of a GFD, whereas the decrease in lactulose permeation took longer: from 3.4% (untreated) to 0.8% after 12 months of a GFD. Mean villus area (n = 29) was reduced to 16% of control values at diagnosis, and improved to a maximum of 48% after 6 months on a GFD, but did not change thereafter. Mean crypt length and mitotic count per crypt were increased by 222% and 356% respectively at diagnosis, and these parameters remained elevated at 172% and 216% above control values after 6 months of a GFD. We conclude that intestinal permeability improves within 2 months after starting a GFD, but that measurable intestinal biopsy improvement requires ingestion of a GFD for at least 3-6 months, and even then remains incomplete.},

This report deals with three patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and coeliac disease who underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation to establish the effect of a gluten-free diet on cardiac performance. Two patients observed the gluten-free diet regimen very strictly, and, after a 28-month follow-up period, showed an improvement in echocardiographic parameters as well as in cardiological features and quality of life, as evaluated by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire. The third patient did not observe the gluten-free diet and presented a worsening in the echocardiographic parameters and cardiological symptoms which required supplementary drug therapy. These preliminary data appear to suggest that the gluten-free diet may have a beneficial effect on cardiac performance in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.},

Vitamin B12 deficiency is thought to be uncommon, as the terminal ileum is relatively spared. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of vitamin B12, deficiency in patients with untreated celiac disease. METHODS: Prospective study of 39 consecutive biopsy-proven celiac disease patients (32 women, seven men; median age 48 yr, range 22-77 yr) between September 1997 and February 1999. The full blood count, serum vitamin B12, red blood cell folate, and celiac autoantibodies (IgA antigliadin and IgA antiendomysium antibodies) were measured before and after a median of 4 months (range 2-13 months) of treatment with a gluten-free diet. In vitamin B12-deficient patients, intrinsic factor antibodies and a Schilling test, part 1, were performed. RESULTS: A total of 16 (41%) patients were vitamin B12 deficient (<220 ng/L) and 16 (41%) patients (11 women and live men) were anemic. Concomitant folate deficiency was present in only 5/16 (31%) of the vitamin B12 patients. The Schilling test, performed in 10 of the vitamin B12-deficient patients, showed five low and five normal results. Although only five patients received parenteral vitamin B12, at follow-up the vitamin B12 results had normalized in all patients. Acral paraesthesia at presentation in three vitamin B12-deficient patients resolved after vitamin B12 replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in untreated celiac disease, and concentrations should be measured routinely before hematinic replacement. Vitamin B12 concentrations normalize on a gluten-free diet alone, but symptomatic patients may require supplementation.},

   abstract = {Hereditary hemochromatosis is an inherited autosomal recessive disease, associated to a mutation in the recently described HFE gene, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 6. The product of this gene combines with the beta-2-microglobulin and the ferritin receptor, and regulates the iron absorption in the small intestine crypt cells. It is possible that the mutation may cause the increased iron uptake by the intestinal cells. The disease is very much common in men after the forties, and its expression is influenced by concomitant alcoholism, iron rich diet, oral and parenteral iron administration, menstrual blood loss or abnormal hemorrhages, blood donations, pregnancy, lactation, and iron malabsorption clinical conditions, like celiac disease. Many patients are asymptomatic, and the diagnosis may be suspected by hepatomegaly of unknown cause, abnormal iron metabolism tests, increased serum aminotransferase levels, diabetes mellitus, and anonymous arthropathy. Less commonly hereditary hemochromatosis presented by symptoms and signs of chronic liver disease, or by the classic triad described by Trousseau skin pigmentation, hepatomegaly and diabetes mellitus. The diagnosis is confirmed by the increased serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation, and the stainable iron in hepatocytes, measured by scale devised by Scheuer et al, or the measurement of the hepatic iron. The C282Y mutation was found in 64 to 100% of patients; eventually, subjects with hepatic iron overload identical to hereditary hemochromatosis has no mutation, and homozygous for the C282Y mutation do not express iron overload. Iron is best and quickly removed by weekly or twice-weekly phlebotomy of 500 ml, containing approximately 250 mg iron. One to 3 years of weekly phlebotomy may be required to reduce stores to normal. As a guide to long-term maintenance therapy, is recommended phlebotomy every 3 months and the serum ferritin level should be maintained by less than 50 ng/ml.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Dietary interventions are sometimes necessary, even in young children; however, adhering to a diet can cause medical and psychosocial problems. Therefore, insight into frequency, reasons, and effectiveness is important. To establish the prevalence of dieting in children referred to a general paediatric outpatient clinic, parents of newly referred patients were given a structured questionnaire. Excluded were children whose parents did not speak Dutch, those younger than 3 months and emergency cases. Of 1826 patients, 907 (511 boys, 56%; median age 5 years, range 0-18 years) were included; 124 (13.7%, 95% CI 11.5%-15.9%) were or had been on a diet, more boys than girls (82/511 versus 42/396, P=0.02). In 60% of patients, the diet was started before the age of 2 years, 50% had been dieting longer than a year. Diets most used were: cow's milk free (62%), egg-free (20%), lactose-free (14%), no sugar (20%) and no colouring additives (20%). Reasons for dieting were gastrointestinal (51%), dermal (51%) and behavioural (27%) symptoms or complaints. Dieting was considered effective by the parents in 65% of cases and 61% reported no problems. CONCLUSION: One in eight children, referred to a general paediatric outpatient clinic is or has been dieting. Most parents reported positive effects with no problems. Some children were on a difficult-to-keep diet with serious medical and psychosocial implications, without being tested. Scientific evidence for dieting should be sought and the results discussed with the parents.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is associated with impaired cholecystokinin (CCK) release. The mechanism by which CCK release is impaired is poorly understood and seems to be related to the mucosal atrophy or to decreased stimulation due to reduced intraduodenal nutrient hydrolysis. The aims of our study were to evaluate basal and postprandial CCK in celiac patients presenting with distinctive types of mucosal lesions (normal, infiltrative and atrophic), and to study the role of protein hydrolysis on CCK release. Plasma CCK was measured in 20 celiac patients (normal mucosa: n=6; infiltrative type: n=6; atrophic type=8) and 9 controls, before and after ingestion of a polymeric or a semi-elemental meal. Significant decreases in basal CCK plasma (B 0.6 [95% CI, 0.3-1.3] pmol/l; p<0.003) and postprandial CCK area under curve (AUC 34 [19-61] pmol/l x 120 min, p<0.0001) were observed in patients with an atrophic mucosa compared with treated patients (B 1.6 [1.0-2.4] pmol/l, AUC 267 [172-414] pmol/l x 120 min) or healthy volunteers (B 1.0 [0.7-1.4] pmol/l, AUC 186 [131-264] pmol/l x 120 min). A significant defective CCK release was also observed in patients with an infiltrative type: B 0.4 [0.2-0.7] pmol/l and AUC 56 [31-101] pmol/l x 120 min; p<0.0001. Administration of a semi-elemental diet did not correct the defective CCK release. In conclusion, the decreased CCK levels observed in celiac patients are not strictly related to the mucosal atrophy but rather to the lymphocytic infiltrate. Administration of a predigested meal did not correct the impaired CCK release. Some inhibitory mechanism could be involved in the CCK cell dysfunction observed in celiac patients presenting with lesser degrees of disease activity.},

   abstract = {Available, non invasive, serological tests such as the anti-endomysium antibodies (EmA) and anti-transglutaminase antibodies (Anti-tTg) has allowed better outlining of the clinical presentation as well as the pathogenesis of Coeliac Disease (CD). The aim of the study was to evaluate the reliability and concordance of EmA and anti-tTg at the diagnosis (T0) of CD and after 12 months (T12) of Gluten-Free Diet (GFD). Serum EmA and Anti-tTg were evaluated in 78 patients aged 6.3 +/- 4.7 SD yrs at diagnosis, in 56 of them at T0 and T12, as well as in a control group of 88 children aged 6.9 +/- 3.8 yrs. EmA were evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence and Anti-tTg by ELISA. All subjects had normal circulating IgA levels. In the control group, EmA and Anti-tTg resulted negative in all cases. At T0, 77/78 pts had both EmA and Anti-tTg positive, one pt (1.3%) had only EmA positive, demonstrating an overall positive concordance of 98.7%. At T12, 16 pts (28.6%) had both tests positive, 8 (14.3%) had only Anti-tTg positive (all of them were no fully compliant to GFD) and 32 (57.1%) had both tests negative. The overall concordance at T12 was 85.7%. The concordance between EmA and Anti-tTg at T0 is nearly absolute (98.7%). The higher prevalence of elevated anti-tTg than of positive EmA at T12 suggests a higher sensitivity of anti-tTg following intake of even small amounts of gluten.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lamina propria (LPLs) and intraepithelial (IELs) lymphocytes are markedly increased in coeliac mucosa, and are thought to play a crucial role in the generation of villous atrophy in coeliac disease (CD). However, the mechanisms by which they mediate the killing of enterocytes in this condition are still poorly characterised. AIM: We investigated Fas mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis of both LPLs and IELs, isolated from 10 untreated coeliac patients, 10 coeliac patients on a gluten free diet, and 10 biopsied controls. METHODS: Fas and Fas ligand expression were assessed by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. Lymphocyte cytotoxicity against Fas expressing Jurkat cells was determined by the Jam test. The effect of the antagonist ZB4 anti-Fas antibody on apoptotic activity exerted by coeliac lymphocytes against enterocytes was analysed. Lymphocyte apoptosis was assessed by oligonucleosome ELISA. RESULTS: LPLs and IELs showed increased apoptotic activity and higher levels of Fas ligand expression in untreated CD compared with treated CD patients and controls. Enterocyte apoptosis observed after coculturing coeliac lymphocytes and enterocytes in the presence of ZB4 antibody was reduced. In active CD, LPLs manifested increased apoptosis whereas IELs showed decreased apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the involvement of the Fas/Fas ligand system in CD associated enterocyte apoptosis. Increased LPL apoptosis is likely to downregulate mucosal inflammation whereas decreased IEL apoptosis could be responsible for autoimmune and malignant complications of CD.},

   abstract = {In coeliac disease (CD) immunological abnormalities are not confined to the small bowel and it has been suggested that changes in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), such as lymphopenia and increased T-cell activation, may predispose to malignant or autoimmune complications of this condition. In the light of the recent findings about the Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) system in regulating lymphocyte homeostasis, the aim of the present study was to investigate peripheral lymphocyte Fas-mediated apoptosis in CD to establish whether the homeostatic role of apoptosis in peripheral T-cell selection is maintained. Moreover, because a soluble form of Fas has been described to be functionally implicated in the Fas signalling system, suggesting a relationship between some disorders and soluble Fas function, we measured levels of soluble Fas in sera of coeliac patients and analysed the relationship between these levels and the proportions of apoptotic and Fas(+) PBL to further explore the function of the Fas-FasL pathway in this condition. Finally, we evaluated whether the increased prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies, recently described in CD, could be related to PBL apoptosis in this condition. We demonstrated an increased apoptosis and higher levels of Fas and FasL expression in PBL isolated from untreated coeliac patients when compared to treated coeliac patients and controls. In addition, low levels of soluble Fas and a significant positive correlation between anticardiolipin antibodies and PBL apoptosis were found in untreated CD. Then, our results showed an increased susceptibility of PBL to undergo Fas-mediated apoptosis in active CD. This increased apoptosis could be responsible for both lymphopenia and immunogenic exposure of phospholipids with subsequent production of autoantibodies.},

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of B12 deficiency in a large series of coeliac patients, and to exclude the possibility that it is due to associated autoimmune gastritis. DESIGN: Prospective routine measurement of serum B12 in coeliac patients, with investigations for pernicious anaemia/autoimmune gastritis in B12-deficient patients. SETTING: Gastroenterology department of a large district general hospital. INTERVENTIONS: If they were not taking vitamin B12 supplements already, patients had serum B12 measured before starting dietary gluten exclusion. Those with low levels also had gastric biopsies taken and plasma gastrin and serum gastric parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies measured. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of low serum B12, and presence or absence of indicators of pernicious anaemia/autoimmune gastritis in patients with low serum B12. RESULTS: Of 159 patients, 13 had low serum B12 at diagnosis. A further six had been receiving B12 replacement therapy for 3-37 years before diagnosis, giving an overall prevalence of 12% (19 patients). Only 2/19 patients had gastric corpus atrophy, one with intrinsic factor antibodies and the other with hypergastrinaemia. There was no relationship between low B12 and clinical characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Low B12 is common in coeliac disease without concurrent pernicious anaemia, and may be a presenting manifestation. B12 status should be known before folic acid replacement is started.},

   abstract = {The mucosal epithelium of the alimentary tract represents a crucial barrier to a broad spectrum of noxious and immunogenic substances within the intestinal lumen. An impairment of the integrity of the mucosal epithelial barrier is observed in the course of various intestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), celiac disease, intestinal infections, and various other diseases. Furthermore, even under physiologic conditions temporary damage of the epithelial surface mucosa may be caused by proteases, residential flora, dietary compounds, or other factors. Generally, the integrity of the intestinal mucosal surface barrier is rapidly reestablished even after extensive destruction because of an enormous regenerative capability of the mucosal surface epithelium. Rapid resealing of the surface epithelium is accomplished by epithelial cell migration, also termed epithelial restitution, epithelial cell proliferation, and differentiation. Healing of the intestinal surface epithelium is regulated by a complex network of highly divergent factors, among them a broad spectrum of structurally distinct regulatory peptides that have been identified within the mucosa of the intestinal tract. These regulatory peptides, conventionally designated as growth factors and cytokines, play an essential role in regulating differential epithelial cell functions to preserve normal homeostasis and integrity of the intestinal mucosa. In addition, a number of other peptide molecules such as extracellular matrix factors and blood clotting factors, and also nonpeptide molecules including phospholipids, shortchain fatty acids, adenine nucleotides, trace elements, and pharmacological agents, have been demonstrated to modulate intestinal epithelial repair mechanisms. Some of these molecules may be released by platelets, adjacent stromal cells, inflammatory cells, or injured epithelial and nonepithelial cells and may play an important role in the modulation of intestinal injury. Repeated damage and injury of the intestinal surface are key features of various intestinal disorders including IBD and require constant repair of the epithelium. Enhancement of intestinal repair mechanisms by regulatory peptides or other modulatory factors may provide future approaches for the treatment of diseases that are characterized by injuries of the epithelial surface.},

   abstract = {The role of histopathology for diagnosing celiac disease (CD) has been recently challenged. However, based in our experience with roughly 4,600 distal duodenal and jejunal biopsies in children it is apparent that appropriate biopsy site, handling, processing, and microscopic evaluation result in a consistent pattern of microscopic changes which allows strong clinical-pathologic correlation. A simple way for establishing the villous/crypt (V/C) ratio is proposed. Normal mucosa displays a V/C ratio of 2.5 or more. Villous atrophy is then graded according to the V/C ratio as follows: Grade 1: 2.5-2; Grade 2: 1-2; Grade 3: 1-0.5, and Grade 4: less than 0.5. The grading should be done in areas of the biopsy where at least 2 to 3 crypts are present in almost its full length. CD disease was consistently associated with villous atrophy grades 3 and 4, which fully recovered or maintained Grade 1 after gluten-free diet. Grade 2 biopsies were rare and related to incomplete gluten-free diet. Patchy lesions were never seen as were patients with normal biopsies later developing mucosal atrophy. Histopathologic evaluation of mucosal biopsies to rule out CD requires adequate biopsy site (distal duodenum or proximal jejunum), and proper handling (oriented material), processing (cutting on edge) and interpretation. The proposed villous atrophy grading may help to adequately compare experiences from different centers as well as to reconcile apparent different findings in separate biopsies. In children histopathology keeps on having a central role for CD diagnosis.},

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis has a much lower prevalence of histological small bowel abnormalities, and lesions are not known to respond to gluten restriction. We report a patient with linear IgA bullous dermatosis and gluten-sensitive enteropathy. This report addresses the issue of whether linear IgA bullous dermatosis can be associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. We evaluated the response to gluten restriction and normal diet by following the status of the patient's jejunal biopsies and skin lesions. The patient responded to gluten restriction, as shown by resolution of jejunal abnormalities and skin lesions and subsequently by recurrence of jejunal abnormalities and skin lesions with reinstitution of a gluten-containing diet. This report demonstrates that linear IgA bullous dermatosis can respond to gluten restriction if an underlying gluten-sensitive enteropathy is present.},

The disease can usually be controlled by excluding gluten from the diet. CD is immunologically-mediated, with a strong linkage to certain HLA alleles and a permanently altered intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) pattern. The development of a flow cytometric technique for the evaluation of IEL subsets has increased our understanding of these alterations and has prepared the ground for its clinical application. Our experience shows that this procedure has excellent sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of CD and that it is particularly useful in the evaluation of atypical presentations of the disease. The present article reviews our experience in the diagnosis of CD and discusses some of the hypotheses that have been put forward on the possible role of IEL in its pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) may manifest clinically with an array of nongastrointestinal symptoms among which are: dermatitis herpetiformis; dementia; depression; various neurological symptoms; osteoporosis; osteomalacia; dental enamel defects, and anemia of various types. Important data have accumulated in recent years regarding the association between celiac disease, fertility and pregnancy. Many primary care obstetricians and gynecologists and perinatologists are not aware of these important relationships. The aim of this review, utilizing a MEDLINE search from 1966 through March 2000 of the English language, is to describe the possible effects of celiac disease and its treatment upon the reproductive cycle, fertility, pregnancy, and menopause. Review of the literature reveals that patients with untreated celiac disease sustain a significantly delayed menarche, earlier menopause, and an increased prevalence of secondary amenorrhea. Patients with untreated celiac disease incur higher miscarriage rates, increased fetal growth restriction, and lower birth weights. It appears that improvement of celiac disease, as reflected by restoration of small bowel mucosa associated with implementation of a gluten-free diet, may decrease miscarriage rates, improve fetal nutritional support and overall perinatal outcome.},

   abstract = {In vivo gluten challenge has been used since the early 1950s to study the role of cereal fractions in celiac disease. While early studies relied on crude indicators of celiac toxicity, the advent of jejunal biopsy and sophisticated immunohistochemical techniques has allowed accurate studies to be performed. Studies to determine the nature of the cereal component that is toxic to patients with celiac disease have concentrated on wheat because of its nutritional importance. A number of in vitro studies indicated the presence of one or more celiac-activating epitopes with the N-terminus of the A-gliadin molecule. In vivo challenge with three synthetic peptides subsequently indicated the toxicity of a peptide corresponding to amino acids 31 to 49 of A-gliadin. In vivo gluten challenge is the gold standard for the assessment of celiac toxicity; however, jejunal biopsy is a relatively invasive procedure, thus, other methods have been investigated. Direct infusion of the rectum with gluten has been shown to result in an increase in mucosal intraepithelial lymphocytes, occurring only in celiac patients. This method has been used to study the celiac toxicity of gliadin subfractions. The in vitro technique of small intestinal biopsy organ culture is also a useful tool and appears to give the same results as in vivo challenge. The importance of tiny amounts of gliadin in the diet, such as that which occurs in wheat starch, has been studied by in vivo challenge; this technique has clarified the position of oats in the gluten-free diet. Several studies suggest that this cereal may be included in the diet of most adult celiac patients. Studies of the transport of gliadin across the enterocyte following ingestion or challenge suggest that gliadin may be metabolized by a different pathway in celiac disease. This could result in an abnormal presentation to the immune system, triggering a pathogenic rather than a tolerogenic response.},

This becomes evident in gastrointestinal disorders such as diabetes gastroenteropathy, inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease, systemic sclerosis and post-intestinal resection state. On the other hand, changes in PYY in chronic idiopathic slow transit constipation appear to be primary and could be one of the etiologic factors of the disease. PYY does not seem to be involved in colorectal carcinoma. Although gastrointestinal dysmotility in neuro-muscular diseases is evident, PYY is not affected. The changes in PYY in gastrointestinal disorders could be beneficial in clinical practice. Thus, in cases where an increase or decrease in PYY is desirable, a diet that increases or decreases PYY synthesis and release can be followed, or a receptor agonist or antagonist can be utilized.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: So far the reliability of the anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) test for the diagnosis of coeliac disease has mostly been evaluated using slightly different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in selected and usually small groups of patients. The aims of this study were: (1) to evaluate the reliability of the IgA anti-tTG antibodies for the diagnosis of coeliac disease; and (2) to define the sensitivity and specificity of a commercially available kit for the anti-tTG antibodies' quantitative determination. DESIGN: Each centre in this international multi-centre study collected sera from three groups of subjects: coeliac disease patients at the onset of (1) or on a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months (2); disease and healthy controls (3). METHODS: The anti-tTG antibodies were determined in duplicate using an ELISA-based commercially available kit (Eu-tTG Eurospital, Trieste, Italy). RESULTS: The following overall cases and controls have been enrolled: (1) 399 subjects with active coeliac disease; (2) 351 treated coeliac disease cases; (3) 432 controls. The centralized re-testing was performed on: (1) group a: 176 patients with active coeliac disease (mean anti-tTG, 21 arbitrary units [AU]); (2) group b: 172 treated coeliac disease cases (mean anti-tTG, 5 AU); (3) group c: 206 controls (mean anti-tTG, 3 AU). In active coeliacs, the anti-tTG antibodies showed a significant progressive decrease with age, while in controls an opposite trend was found. In active coeliac disease patients, the anti-tTG antibodies were significantly higher in coeliacs with a grade III enteropathy than in those showing a grade II lesion. In treated coeliacs, the mean anti-tTG values were significantly lower in patients strictly adhering to a gluten-free diet than in those reporting dietary transgressions. The sensitivity and the specificity of the Eu-tTG assay were 90% and 96%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that the commercially available test for the anti-tTG antibodies' determination is a reproducible and valuable tool for the diagnosis and follow up of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to evaluate the following: 1) the prevalence of hypertransaminasemia (HT) in a pediatric celiac disease (CD) and its relation with clinical parameters; 2) the frequency of HT as the only manifestation of pediatric CD; and 3) the evolution of HT after a gluten free diet. METHODS: A total of 114 consecutive pediatric CD patients were studied (60% with classical and 40% with atypical forms). Antiendomisyum antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were determined in patients with a clinical suspicion of CD (including unexplained chronic HT), in patients at risk, and in patients with preoperative increased ALT activity for minor surgery. CD was confirmed by duodenal biopsy. At baseline, the relationship between clinical factors and aminotransferase status was univariately and multivariately assessed. After starting a gluten free diet, patients were followed up, until serological markers cleared and serum aminotransferase normalized. RESULTS: HT occurred in 32% of patients (37 of 114) at diagnosis. HT was the only manifestation of CD in five patients (4.3%). Patients with HT were younger (2.9 +/- 0.4 yr) than patients with normal aminotransferases (5.1 +/- 0.5 yr) (p = 0.007). A higher percentage of patients with classical CD tend to have abnormal aminotransferases (73%; 95% CI = 65-81%) than do patients with atypical CD (27%; 95% CI = 19-35%) (p = 0.068). Logistic regression analysis showed that only younger age was significantly associated with HT (p = 0.039; OR = 0.8; 95% CI = 0.71-0.99). Aminotransferases normalized with a gluten free diet in all 35 patients who were followed-up, either before (n = 18) or at the same time (n = 17) as serological markers cleared. CONCLUSIONS: HT is a frequent finding in pediatric CD patients and, in a substantial proportion, may be the only manifestation of CD. Thus, serological markers of CD should be introduced in the first step of the diagnostic workup of liver diseases in pediatric patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac sprue is a common lifelong disorder affecting 0.3-1% of the Western world and causing considerable ill health and increased mortality, particularly from lymphoma and other malignancies. Although high prevalence rates have been reported in Western Europe, celiac sprue remains a rare diagnosis in North America. Whether celiac sprue is truly rare among North Americans or is simply underdiagnosed is unclear, although serological screening of healthy American blood donors suggests that a large number of American celiacs go undiagnosed. Celiac sprue is an elusive diagnosis, and often its only clue is the presence of iron or folate deficiency anemia or extraintestinal manifestations, such as osteoporosis, infertility, and neurological disturbances. The challenge for gastroenterologists and other physicians is to identify the large population of undiagnosed patients that probably exists in the community and offer them treatment with a gluten-free diet that will restore the great majority to full health and prevent the development of complications. The advent of highly sensitive and specific antiendomysium and tissue transglutaminase serological tests has modified our current approach to diagnosis and made fecal fat and D-xylose absorption testing obsolete. A single small bowel biopsy that demonstrates histological findings compatible with celiac sprue followed by a favorable clinical and serological response to gluten-free diet is now considered sufficient to definitely confirm the diagnosis. We review the wide spectrum of celiac sprue, its variable clinical manifestations, and the current approach to diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Refractory sprue is defined as primary or secondary failure to respond to a gluten free diet in patients with coeliac disease-like enteropathy and may signify cryptic or overt enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma. AIMS: To study in detail jejunal morphology and immunophenotypes in patients with refractory sprue in the search for features that might be useful to predict prognosis. PATIENTS: Seven patients are described, representing all such cases identified in our hospital over a 13 year period. METHODS: Biopsy and/or surgical resection specimens were examined by morphology, immunohistochemistry, including enzymatic and immunofluorescent detection, and molecular biology. RESULTS: All patients had phenotypically abnormal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) that lacked CD8, T cell receptor alpha beta (or gamma delta), and/or expressed CD30 in addition to variable expression of the natural killer cell receptor CD94. A monoclonal T cell population was present in six cases, data from the seventh being inconclusive. Three patients had overt lymphoma with CD30+ tumour tissue intervening between intact mucosa that contained neoplastic IELs. Intriguingly, CD30+ IELs were observed both a long way away from, and in direct continuity with, the tumours in these patients. Such CD30+ cells were hardly detected in patients without tumours, two of which are in good health several years after the initial diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that abnormal IELs in patients with refractory sprue are phenotypically heterogeneous. CD30 expression by these cells may indicate a worse prognosis, including the occurrence of overt lymphoma.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a syndrome characterized by damage of the small intestinal mucosa caused by the gliadin fraction of wheat gluten and similar alcohol-soluble proteins (prolamines) of barley and rye in genetically susceptible subjects. The presence of gluten in these subjects leads to self-perpetuating mucosal damage, whereas elimination of gluten results in full mucosal recovery. The clinical manifestations of CD are protean in nature and vary markedly with the age of the patient, the duration and extent of disease, and the presence of extraintestinal pathologic conditions. In addition to the classical gastrointestinal form, a variety of other clinical manifestations of the disease have been described, including atypical and asymptomatic forms. Therefore, diagnosis of CD is extremely challenging and relies on a sensitive and specific algorithm that allows the identification of different manifestations of the disease. Serologic tests developed in the last decade provide a noninvasive tool to screen both individuals at risk for the disease and the general population. However, the current gold standard for the diagnosis of CD remains histologic confirmation of the intestinal damage in serologically positive individuals. The keystone treatment of CD patients is a lifelong elimination diet in which food products containing gluten are avoided.},

Results were expressed as a T score (the number of standard deviations by which patient's bone density differed from the sex matched young adult mean). Three patients had no skeletal symptoms and normal routine calcium biochemistry but severely reduced axial bone mineral density on DEXA. Eleven patients had symptomatic skeletal fractures, including fractures of proximal femur (3), vertebrae (4), and radius (6). Three patients had osteomalacia confirmed on bone biopsy, two of whom had characteristic biochemistry. Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism were seen. Seventy five further patients (60 female) with coeliac disease (mean age 52.0 years, median duration of gluten-free diet 3.4 years) and 75 paired healthy age and sex matched controls were questioned on past fracture history. Patients with coeliac disease underwent detailed studies of calcium biochemistry, dietary intake, and bone mineral density. Sixteen had a past history of fractures (chi(2) = 10.7, p = 0.0004, v controls), which were of typical osteoporotic type. Ten patients had fracture before diagnosis of coeliac disease and six after diagnosis. Patients who had a fracture were older (56.3 v 50.3 years, p < 0.02, Wilcoxon rank sum test) than those with no fracture. There was no significant difference in bone mineral density (z score -0.31 v -0. 77), serum calcium (2.30 v 2.26 mmol/l), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (19.7 v 23.7 nmol/l), parathyroid hormone (2.6 v 3.1 pmol/l), or dietary calcium intake (1021.0 v 1033.0 mg/day) in patients with fracture compared with those without fracture. Metabolic bone disease is common in coeliac disease and is associated with premature osteoporotic fractures.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac sprue is being diagnosed with increasing frequency by screening individuals with epidemiologically associated autoimmune syndromes. We sought to test our hypothesis that hepatitis C also may predispose to celiac sprue because it can trigger autoimmune reactions. METHODS: Two hundred fifty-nine consecutively evaluated patients with chronic hepatitis C infection, 59 with autoimmune liver disease, 137 with other hepatic diseases, 356 with various GI syndromes, and 221 normal volunteers underwent serologic screening for celiac sprue. Patients with antigliadin, antiendomysial, and antitissue transglutaminase antibodies in serum underwent duodenoscopy and biopsy. RESULTS: There was a statistically significantly higher prevalence of antigliadin antibody in all groups of patients with liver disease compared with GI controls and normal controls. However, only patients with hepatitis C (n = 3; 1.2%) or autoimmune liver disease (n = 2; 3.4%) had antiendomysial/antitissue transglutaminase antibody in serum. One of 221 normal volunteers (0.4%) was antigliadin, antiendomysial, and antitissue transglutaminase positive; this individual also was found to have hepatitis C (previously undiagnosed). Each of these six individuals had mild intestinal symptoms, duodenal histopathology consistent with celiac sprue, and the celiac-associated HLA-DQ2 allele. Five of the six followed a prescribed gluten-free diet and experienced symptomatic improvement. CONCLUSION: Celiac sprue is epidemiologically associated with chronic hepatitis C infection and with autoimmune liver disease. Because hepatitis C is much more frequently encountered than autoimmune liver disease, hepatitis C appears to be the most common hepatic disease associated with the development of celiac sprue.},

   abstract = {Biopsy is onerous and, for this reason, immunodiagnostics in sera of celiac disease patients are an "additional diagnostic standard." The objective of the study was to investigate the variability in diagnostic specificity of ELISAs for the detection of IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies in serum of celiac disease patients who underwent biopsy. All patients were included in the study on the basis that they had a small intestinal biopsy. We studied 18 patients with histological proven celiac disease (7 male, 11 female, mean age +/- SD: 35+/-19 years) from Graz, Austria. Healthy control subjects were also entered into the study. The determinations of the anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were simultaneously performed together with the endomysium and gliadin antibody markers. We analysed the 216 serum values according to Cochran's non-parametric Q-test. The complexity to the analysis reflects the complexity of the diagnostic situation with the patients. No real differences were found in the reactions of the anti-human IgA-type anti-tissue transglutaminase ELISAs. Based on these results, an association was established between the outcomes of anti-human IgA-type ELISAs for the specific antigen and patients with histologically proven celiac disease, treated for celiac disease after histology was carried out and the diagnosis was made, and healthy controls. The detection of IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies in serum is a promising alternative to the indirect immunofluorescence determination of IgA-type endomysium antibodies. One ELISA for the specific antigen showed some advantage with respect to its extended scale of detection. Immunopathology of celiac disease can be based on the results of the appropriate IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase ELISAs under uncomplicated gastrointestinal conditions.},

   abstract = {Increased awareness of non-classical presentations and more reliable screening tests have led to higher detection rates for coeliac disease in elderly adults. Clinical presentations are influenced largely by the long-standing course of the subclinical disease before diagnosis. In the majority of elderly patients, weight loss, diarrhoea and iron deficiency anaemia are present. With a delay in diagnosis, there are increased risks of associated autoimmune diseases, of neoplasms (mostly small bowel lymphoma) and of metabolic bone diseases. Thyroid disease is the most common autoimmune disease. Lymphoma may be the initial presentation or may complicate the clinical course of well established coeliac disease. Osteopenia is very common at presentation, can be clinically severe and require specific therapy in addition to the gluten-free diet. The high risk of complications in elderly patients with coeliac disease warrants a systematic approach in their investigation and management.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We screened the serum of 187 consecutive patients with myocarditis (118 males and 69 females, mean age 41.7+/-14.3 years) for the presence of cardiac autoantibodies, anti-tissue transglutaminase (IgA-tTG), and anti-endomysial antibodies (AEAs). IgA-tTG-positive and AEA-positive patients underwent duodenal endoscopy and biopsy and HLA analysis. Thirteen of the 187 patients were positive for IgA-tTG, and 9 (4.4%) of them were positive for AEA. These 9 patients had iron-deficient anemia and exhibited duodenal endoscopic and histological evidence of CD. CD was observed in 1 (0.3%) of 306 normal controls (P<0.003). In CD patients, myocarditis was associated with heart failure in 5 patients and with ventricular arrhythmias (Lown class III-IVa) in 4 patients. From histological examination, a lymphocytic infiltrate was determined to be present in 8 patients, and giant cell myocarditis was found in 1 patient; circulating cardiac autoantibodies were positive and myocardial viral genomes were negative in all patients. HLA of the patients with CD and myocarditis was DQ2-DR3 in 8 patients and DQ2-DR5(11)/DR7 in 1 patient. The 5 patients with myocarditis and heart failure received immunosuppression and a gluten-free diet, which elicited recovery of cardiac volumes and function. The 4 patients with arrhythmia, after being put on a gluten-free diet alone, showed improvement in the arrhythmia (Lown class I). CONCLUSIONS: A common autoimmune process toward antigenic components of the myocardium and small bowel can be found in >4% of the patients with myocarditis. In these patients, immunosuppression and a gluten-free diet can be effective therapeutic options.},

   abstract = {Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an IgA mediated blistering skin disease characterized by the presence of granular deposits of IgA in papillary dermis. The major significant advances in our understanding of DH have been the demonstration that DH patients also have coeliac diseases (CD) and that the rash is also gluten dependent. As a result, it is now possible to cure patients by gluten withdrawal from the diet. The other major significant finding has been the presence of IgA in the uninvolved, now used as the diagnostic criterion for the disease. Despite the fact that it has been known for over fifty years that gluten causes the enteropathy of CD, and for over thirty years the rash of DH, it is still not known how gluten produces these effects. Future immunological studies may look at ways of inducing tolerance to gluten peptides once the toxic ones have been identified. Vaccination against gluten peptides may also be possible in those affected with gluten sensitive disorders.},

Under halothane anesthesia, the celiac artery or superior mesenteric artery in the rat was occluded for 60 min followed by reperfusion. Occlusion of the celiac artery reduced blood flow in the stomach and occlusion of the mesenteric artery reduced blood flow in the small intestine. Additional rats were fasted for 48 hr to evaluate the effect of fasting on mucosal apoptosis. The ratios of fragmented DNA to total DNA, electrophoresis, and immunohistochemical staining were examined after ischemia-reperfusion or fasting. Apoptosis was not induced significantly in the gastric mucosa after ischemia-reperfusion, although it increased dramatically in the intestinal mucosa after ischemia-reperfusion. Further, after 48 fasting, apoptosis was induced in the small intestine, but not in the stomach. These results indicate that rat gastric mucosa is not as sensitive as small intestinal mucosa to ischemia-reperfusion or fasting-induced apoptosis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a T cell-mediated enteropathy induced by gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. The majority of patients responds to a gluten-free diet but a small number do not. After the exclusion of gluten in the diet, ulcerative jejunititis, and an enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, another treatment modalities, such as systemic steroids and immunosuppressives, may be necessary. This article reports the case of a 47-year-old white woman with immunoglobulin A deficiency. She was diagnosed with celiac disease with subtotal villous atrophy on jejunal biopsy together with positive antiendomysium and antigliadin immunoglobulin G antibodies. Despite close adherence to a gluten-free diet, her weight continued to decrease, she had diarrhea, and her distal duodenal histology showed no improvement. Some improvement in her symptoms was observed with cyclosporine and systemic steroids, but this was not sustained. Recent evidence has suggested that anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha antibodies have a role in the amelioration of an animal model of villous atrophy, and after careful consideration, she was treated with infliximab. There was a dramatic improvement in her weight, symptoms, and distal duodenal histology. The response has been maintained for 18 months while on azathioprine therapy. It is concluded that infliximab is an effective treatment that may be considered in a small number of patients with refractory celiac disease, resistant to other therapy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in children with type 1 diabetes in British Columbia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred thirty-three children with type 1 diabetes were prospectively screened for CD using blind testing with the current 'gold standard', immunoglobulin A endomysium antibody (EmA), and the novel immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody. Those children with positive results were offered small bowel biopsy; a gluten-free diet was recommended if CD was confirmed. RESULTS: Nineteen children were positive for EmA and had an elevated tTG level. One patient from this group was already known to have CD, and the other 18 patients consented to biopsy. One biopsy was normal, three biopsies demonstrated elevated intraepithelial lymphocyte counts with normal morphology and 14 biopsies had morphological changes consistent with CD. Growth parameters were normal in all patients, and nine of 19 children who were positive for EmA were asymptomatic. Seven patients had mild elevation of tTG levels alone. Two children from this latter group had normal biopsies, and five declined biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: At least 14 new cases of CD were detected in addition to four known cases, yielding an overall biopsy-confirmed prevalence of CD of 7.7% (18 of 233). The present study confirms that CD is as prevalent in the pediatric type 1 diabetic population in British Columbia as it is in Europe. Serological screening of these children is important because many children have no symptoms or signs suggestive of CD. This study suggests that tTG serology may also be useful in monitoring response and compliance with a gluten-free diet.},

These patients complied well with their diet as evidenced by their parents' reports, increase in weight standard deviation scores in all but one child, and reversion to seronegativity for antigliadin and antiendomysial antibodies in all four. However, typical catch-up for linear growth did not occur. In our view, the poor response of linear growth is evidence that the original stunting was not due to CD. Since the advent of sensitive tests for antiendomysial antibodies, many asymptomatic children have been diagnosed as having CD. Some of these children are short and despite a history of familial short stature their growth stunting may be wrongly attributed to CD. This report highlights this new problem and emphasizes the need for caution when predicting growth response to a gluten-free diet.},

We sought this information by distributing a survey. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed by way of a celiac newsletter, directly to celiac support groups, and through the Internet. RESULTS: Respondents (1,612) were from all United States except one. Seventy-five percent (1,138) were biopsy proven. Women predominated (2.9:1). The majority of respondents were diagnosed in their fourth to sixth decades. Symptoms were present a mean of 11 yr before diagnosis. Diarrhea was present in 85%. Diagnosis was considered prompt by only 52% and 31% had consulted two or more gastroenterologists. Improved quality of life after diagnosis was reported by 77%. Those diagnosed at age > or = 60 yr also reported improved quality of life. Five respondents had small intestinal malignancies (carcinoma 2, lymphoma 3) accounting for a relative risk of 300 (60-876) for the development of lymphoma and 67 (7-240) for adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with celiac disease in the United States have a long duration of symptoms and consider their diagnosis delayed. Improved quality of life after diagnosis is common. An increased risk of developing small intestine malignancies is present.},

The predictive value (PV) of immunoglobulin A antigliadin antibodies (IgA-AGA) in the serum as assayed with two new commercial automated immunoassays--the Pharmacia CAP System Gliadin IgA FEIA (CAP) and the UNICAP-100 (UNICAP)--and with three "in-house" methods was evaluated using assessment of the small intestinal mucosa morphology as the "gold standard." All serum samples were analyzed for total serum IgA. At presentation the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of the different tests varied from 0.72 to 0.88 and 0.67 to 0.87, respectively. All methods showed a higher sensitivity for CD in younger children. The area under each assay's receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated and varied between 0.82 and 0.89. The positive and negative PVs for the CAP and UNICAP, which were assays with a high sensitivity and a high specificity, respectively, were estimated. In the clinically selected population (prevalence of CD, 1 in 3) the positive PV was about 55%, and in the general population (prevalence, 1 in 250) it was about 1%. The negative PVs for both CAP and UNICAP were close to 100%; thus, when the AGA test was negative, the risk for CD was small. Interestingly, five children had serum IgA levels below the detection limit (<0.07 g/liter) when on a gluten-free diet, whereas they had normal levels at the time of the first biopsy. In conclusion, the automated immunoassays--based on ImmunoCAP technology--for analysis of IgA-AGA had a reliability comparable to that of the in-house methods.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common and permanent condition caused by an abnormal immune response to ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Its proper diagnosis is very important even in patients presenting with mild symptoms because severe and debilitating complications may occur in celiac patients not following a strict gluten-free diet. In the past several years, important progress has been made not only in our understanding of the pathogenesis of this condition but also in the availability of tools to screen it. Antigliadin antibodies, once largely used for this purpose, have been basically replaced by the more costly but far more accurate antiendomysium antibodies. More recently, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which measures the antibodies directed against the autoantigen responsible for the disease (tissue transglutaminase), has also been developed and tested as a screening tool. Currently, however, the poor positive predictive value of this test does not allow practitioners to diagnose celiac disease without the duodenal biopsy showing the typical morphologic changes.},

For this reason we carried out an investigation to see whether simple haematochemical anomalies (as revealed in what are now routine examinations carried out during hospitalisation) might make diagnosis quicker or at least trigger the suspicion of coeliac disease. METHODS: Retrospectively, of 21 adult patients admitted to our hospital for the first time and who were diagnosed with coeliac disease, we considered haemoglobin, iron, calcium, potassium, albumin and RDW (part of the normal blood count). RESULTS: We found that elevated RDW was the most frequent anomaly (67% of patients) of the six haematochemical parameters observed. In addition, it became normal in most patients after a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated RDW was more frequent than sideropenic anaemia in patients with coeliac disease. In addition, RDW indicates a response to diet therapy because it became normal after a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac patients improve vastly when started on a gluten-free diet. After 10 years. however, women show a lower level of subjective health than men do. We investigated whether this could be explained by differences in the perceived disease burden. METHODS: We studied 68 coeliac patients (34 women) (mean age 57 years, range 32-75) and matched type-2 diabetes controls treated for a mean of 10 years. They were examined by a 9-item Burden of Illness (BI) protocol comprising perceived worries, restrictions and subjective outcome. The subjective health was assessed with the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. RESULTS: The importance of complying with the diet was ranked similarly high by male and female coeliac patients. However, women were less satisfied with the outcome at 10 years than men were, and expressed more concern about the impact on socializing with friends and having to abstain from important things in life. None of these aspects distinguished male and female diabetic patients. Coeliac women showed a higher BI sum score than men did, and this was inversely related to their SF-36 General health, Vitality and Mental Health scores. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac women adhering to the treatment regimen for several years perceive the disease burden to be worse than men do. In the light of similar differences in their quality of life, inquiry is warranted into the way coeliac men and women are coping with the disorder.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with coeliac disease are advised to keep to a lifelong gluten-free diet to remain well. Uncertainty still exists as to whether this gives a nutritionally balanced diet. AIM: To assess the vitamin nutrition status of a series of coeliac patients living on a gluten-free diet for 10 years. METHODS: Thirty adults with coeliac disease (mean age, 55 years; range, 45-64 years; 60% women), in biopsy-proven remission following 8-12 years of dietary treatment, were studied. We measured the total plasma homocysteine level, a metabolic marker of folate, vitamin B-6 and vitamin B-12 deficiency, and related plasma vitamin levels. The daily vitamin intake level was assessed using a 4-day food record. Normative data were obtained from the general population of the same age. RESULTS: Coeliac patients showed a higher total plasma homocysteine level than the general population, indicative of a poor vitamin status. In accordance, the plasma levels of folate and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (active form of vitamin B-6) were low in 37% and 20%, respectively, and accounted for 33% of the variation of the total plasma homocysteine level (P < 0.008). The mean daily intakes of folate and vitamin B-12, but not of vitamin B-6, were significantly lower in coeliac patients than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Half of the adult coeliac patients carefully treated with a gluten-free diet for several years showed signs of a poor vitamin status. This may have clinical implications considering the linkage between vitamin deficiency, elevated total plasma homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease. The results may suggest that, when following up adults with coeliac disease, the vitamin status should be reviewed.},

Serum samples were analysed for immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG gliadin antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for IgA endomysium antibodies (EMA) by immunofluorescence and for IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) by ELISA. None of the controls had EMA or tTGA. Two diabetics previously diagnosed with CD were antibody negative on a gluten-free diet. Ten diabetics had both EMA and tTGA. Intestinal biopsy was performed in nine of them. All biopsies showed a histological picture of partial or total villous atrophy confirming the diagnosis of CD. Diabetics with CD were significantly younger (p = 0.026). had an earlier onset of diabetes (p = 0.005), had a lower height standard deviation score (p = 0.019) and more often had thyroid antibodies (p = 0.040) compared with diabetics without CD. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of CD of 10.4% (95% confidence interval 4.6-16.2%) was found in young Danish diabetics. Early onset of diabetes may predispose to CD. Routine serological screening for CD may be valuable in patients with type I diabetes mellitus.},

   abstract = {Serological testing is an important tool in the diagnostic work-up of suspected celiac disease. Our aim was to apply a decision analysis model to compare the costs of serological testing versus small bowel biopsy in the diagnostic work-up of celiac disease. A cost-minimization approach was employed. A decision analysis model with three diagnostic arms was designed using Data Version 3.5: anti-gliadin antibody versus endomysial antibody versus small bowel biopsy. Response to gluten-free diet was considered diagnostic of celiac disease; lack of response prompted a small bowel biopsy to definitively exclude celiac disease. Baseline probabilities were varied using sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the endomysial antibody strategy was least costly, provided the prevalence of celiac disease was less than 42%; above this anti-gliadin antibody became the most economical option. In conclusion, initial screening with endomysial antibody is the least costly strategy for diagnosing celiac disease in a low risk population. Antigliadin antibody becomes the cheaper strategy for higher risk populations.},

The proteolytic kinetics of peptides containing these epitopes were analyzed in vitro using soluble proteases from bovine and porcine pancreas and brush-border membrane vesicles from adult rat intestine. We showed that these proline-glutamine-rich epitopes are exceptionally resistant to enzymatic processing. Moreover, as estimated from the residual peptide structure and confirmed by exogenous peptidase supplementation, dipeptidyl peptidase IV and dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase I were identified as the rate-limiting enzymes in the digestive breakdown of these peptides. A similar conclusion also emerged from analogous studies with brush-border membrane from a human intestinal biopsy. Supplementation of rat brush-border membrane with trace quantities of a bacterial prolyl endopeptidase led to the rapid destruction of the immunodominant epitopes in these peptides. These results suggest a possible enzyme therapy strategy for celiac sprue, for which the only current therapeutic option is strict exclusion of gluten-containing food.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease (CD) can be present without any, only a few, or many symptoms. Since asymptomatic CD can have the same complications and also carries the same risk for malignant disease as clinically typical CD inadequately treated by diet, early diagnosis is essential. The prevalence of asymptomatic CD in the Dresden region was determined by antibody screening. At the same time the sensitivity and specificity of the different antibodies were calculated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Anti-gliadin and endomysium antibodies and total IgA content were measured in the serum of 3004 children (group A), aged 5-12 years, and of 4313 blood donors (group B), aged 17-64 years. Small-intestine biopsies were recommended if either (1) endomysium antibodies (EmA) or (2) anti-gliadin antibodies (ACA) and clinical symptoms or (3) AGA-IgG in the presence of total IgA deficiency and clinical symptoms had been demonstrated. RESULTS: EmA were demonstrated in 0.17% of group A and in 0.28% of group B. But AGA were found much more frequently (group A: 3.89%, group B: 3.76%). The number of cases of CD confirmed by biopsy indicated a prevalence of asymptomatic CD of 1 in 500 children and 1 in 540 adults. Sensitivity and specificity of EmA were significantly higher than those of AGA. CONCLUSION: Compared with a previous study on the prevalence of clinically typical CD in the same region, the present investigation indicates a four-fold higher prevalence of asymptomatic CD. Coeliac-specific antibodies should, therefore, be measured much more widely in the presence of certain symptoms and risk factors. While in adults the measurement of EmA is sufficient to provide the indication for a small-intestine biopsy, both EmA and AGA should be determined before a biopsy is undertaken in children.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease, also called permanent gluten sensitive enteropathy, has recently been recognised as constituting a widespread health problem. Effective treatment involves the strict exclusion of wheat, rye, barley and possibly also oats from the diet. Genetic susceptibility and the presence of gluten in the diet are prerequisites for developing the disease. Sweden has recently experienced an epidemic of coeliac disease in children below 2 years of age. Previously, considerable changes in incidence over time have also been reported from England, Scotland and Ireland. Such obvious changes in incidence over rather short time periods, in genetically stable populations, emphasise the importance of environmental factors in the aetiology. Thus, most likely, the aetiology of coeliac disease is multifactorial. However, further conclusive evidence is required to settle if environmental factors, beyond presence of gluten in the diet, really influence the immunological process resulting in the coeliac small intestinal lesion, or merely influence the clinical expression of the disease. The search for contributing exposures has thus far focused on early feeding, suggesting that breast-feeding duration and the amount of gluten consumed are of importance, and possibly also the age for introducing gluten into the diet of infants. The pattern of causation may vary over time and between countries, however, which may obscure the search for risk factors. Nevertheless, a challenging possibility that needs to be explored is if coeliac disease can be delayed, or possibly even prevented for an entire life span, by favourable dietary habits.},

   abstract = {The intestinal epithelium is a selective barrier where incompletely-digested food antigens are transmitted to the immune system. Food antigens are often the starting point of intestinal diseases such as food allergy or coeliac disease. The intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) take up and process food antigens mainly by fluid-phase transcytosis involving two functional pathways, one minor direct pathway without degradation and another major lysosomal degradative pathway. Among the peptidic metabolites generated during transepithelial transport of luminal antigens, some have a molecular mass compatible with a binding to restriction (major histocompatibility complex; MHC) molecules; the latter can be up regulated on enterocytes, especially in inflammatory conditions. Indeed, interferon-gamma not only increases the paracellular absorption of antigens, but also their transcytosis across epithelial cells. It has been reported that enterocytes may even directly present peptidic epitopes to underlying T-cells. As a new potential way of transmitting peptidic information to the local or systemic immune system, the secretion by IEC of antigen-presenting vesicles called exosomes and bearing MHC-peptide complexes has recently been proposed. Many other factors such as nutritional or environmental factors can also influence the properties of the epithelial barrier and the outcome of the immune response to lumen antigens.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To further establish its role in the ileal brake mechanism, we determined the effect of the distal gut hormone peptide YY (PYY) on gallbladder motility and plasma gut hormones during the cephalic phase of meal stimulation. METHODS: Eight healthy volunteers were studied in a randomized crossover design, with or without intravenous infusion of a physiological dose of PYY. On each occasion, subjects underwent modified sham feeding followed by real feeding. RESULTS: PYY reduced gallbladder emptying in response to modified sham feeding from 23 +/- 5% to 5 +/- 7% (P < 0.01) and integrated plasma pancreatic polypeptide from 2337 +/- 397 pmol/L x 90 min to 903 +/- 232 pmol/L x 90 min (P < 0.01). PYY enhanced plasma cholecystokinin in response to real feeding from 53 +/- 9 pmol/L x 90 min to 82 +/- 17 pmol/L x 90 min (P < 0.05), but did not significantly affect maximum gallbladder emptying and tended to decrease plasma pancreatic polypeptide. CONCLUSION: Circulating PYY suppresses the cephalic phase of postprandial gallbladder emptying, but not meal stimulated maximum emptying. The results support the hypothesis that the effect of PYY on gallbladder emptying is mediated by vagal-dependent rather than cholecystokinin-dependent pathways.},

One year before referral the patient developed an ischemic stroke followed by a subdural hematoma three months later. In our outpatient clinic the patient presented with a malabsorption syndrome including diminished vitamin-K-dependent clotting factors. Serologic testing was positive for IgA antigliadin antibodies and IgA antiendomysial antibodies. Celiac disease was confirmed by an upper endoscopy examination and biopsies obtained from the distal duodenum. Histological examination showed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and an increase in intraepithelial lymphocyte count consistent with celiac disease. After initiation of a gluten-free diet the malabsorption syndrome as well as liver dysfunction improved. Serum aminotransferase levels normalized within 6 months. The clinical course demonstrates involvement of the liver in patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: To review the relationship between coeliac disease and Type 1 diabetes mellitus with emphasis on prevalence of coeliac disease, presentation and implications for screening. METHODS: Papers collected over many years by the author have been included in the review and a literature search employing Medline was undertaken to August 2000. Search words used were coeliac disease and diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Twenty papers exploring the prevalence of coeliac disease by serological screening of Type 1 diabetes in children, eight in adults and two including both groups were found. An additional 48 papers are included and relate to serological screening tests for coeliac disease, expressions and complications of coeliac disease, the value of GFD and the genetics of the two conditions. Unless formal screening studies are undertaken coeliac disease will not be diagnosed because patients are asymptomatic, have atypical symptoms or even in those with symptoms the diagnosis is overlooked. Based on small bowel biopsy, diagnosis the prevalence of coeliac disease in Type 1 diabetes in children is 1:6 to 1:103 and in adults 1:16 to 1:76. Patients may improve following the start of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in terms of symptoms, growth in children, serum antibody levels, haematological and biochemical indices, morphology of the small intestinal mucosa and control of diabetes. CONCLUSION: Coeliac disease commonly occurs in Type 1 diabetes. It is recommended that screening for coeliac disease should be part of the routine investigation and offered to all patients because of the high prevalence and the potential benefits of treatment with a GFD. This includes control of symptoms, stabilization of diabetes and prevention of complications associated with coeliac disease. The cost per patient diagnosed with coeliac disease from the existing population with Type 1 diabetes would be pound860 and for those newly arising pound950.},

This case provides an opportunity to consider potential and latent forms of coeliac disease and how these impact on clinical practice and the wider understanding of the disorder.},

   abstract = {The development of malignancy, particularly lymphoma, is the most serious complication to affect patients with coeliac disease. Although the association has been known for about 40 years, there are still gaps in our understanding. The prevalence of lymphoma and why only some coeliac patients develop this are not clear but environmental and genetic factors must be at work. Based on data from a large coeliac clinic in Derby, about 55 lymphomas per year would arise in the coeliac population of the United Kingdom, of which half would affect the small bowel. Whether patients with coeliac disease who have atypical or no symptoms at diagnosis, are at the same risk as those who are diagnosed as a result of classical symptoms as was more the case in the past, is not known. Some patients, however do have coeliac disease and lymphoma diagnosed at the same presentation. This consideration has implications for initiating screening programmes to detect coeliac disease and thus offer patients a gluten-free diet early that would help to reduce the risk of lymphoma from developing. In this context, case-finding rather than blanket population screening is to be recommended on present evidence. Research into the role of intraepithelial lymphocytes in the genesis of lymphoma has indicated that non-responsive coeliac disease (refractory sprue) and ulcerative jejunoileitis (ulcerative jejunitis) are part of the lymphoma spectrum. The diagnosis of lymphoma can be difficult and the prognosis, in general, is poor, although with modern chemotherapeutic regimes and surgery in selected cases, long-term survival is possible. The best option is to try and prevent lymphoma from arising by advising all patients to adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. Malignant complications of coeliac disease are uncommon but will continue to challenge clinicians and clinical scientists. Unravelling the mechanisms that contribute to the development of lymphoma and other tumours in coeliac disease may well contribute to a wider understanding of oncogenesis.},

Malabsorption, unstable diabetes, and growth failure, indicate that coeliac disease may be present. Even those who are apparently asymptomatic may have subtle complaints indicative of coeliac disease if a careful history is taken. Ill health may only be recognised in retrospect following the benefits conferred by a gluten free diet. For these reasons it is recommended that a screening programme should be instituted to detect coeliac disease in these children. Parents and where possible children themselves, should be fully involved at all stages of the screening, diagnostic, and treatment process.},

   abstract = {Genes whose products play a critical role in regulation of the immune response include the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and cytokine families of genes. The HLA genes are the most polymorphic found in the human genome, and the bulk of this polymorphism results in functional differences in expressed HLA molecules, resulting in inter-individual differences in presentation of peptide antigens to T-cells. In addition, a considerable number of cytokine-associated gene polymorphisms have been identified, the bulk of which occur in the upstream promoter sequences of these genes, which in many cases results in differential in vitro expression of the respective pro- or anti-inflammatory gene product. Particular HLA polymorphisms result in well-defined associations with a large number of immunologically-mediated diseases, including some diseases with known dietary risk factors. For example, individuals of HLA-DQA1*0501, DQB1*0201 genotype have a greater than 200-fold increased risk of developing intolerance to dietary wheat gluten (coeliac disease), and additional HLA-related factors may influence the development of malignant lymphoma within pre-existing coeliac disease. Similarly, HLA-DRB1 alleles sharing a common sequence motif constitute the primary known genetic risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis. The influence of polymorphisms associated with differential cytokine expression on disease susceptibility is currently of much interest. Most attention has been focused on associations with susceptibility to benign immunologically-mediated diseases, including a number of gut diseases. However, recent work from our laboratory indicates that cytokine polymorphisms may influence susceptibility to and prognosis in a number of different cancers, including malignant melanoma skin cancer and solid tumours which may be influenced by diet, such as prostate cancer (collaboration with the CRC/BPG UK Familial Prostate Cancer study). In addition, preliminary work suggests that dietary modulation of expression levels of certain cytokines in healthy human subjects may be genotype dependent.},

Folic acid deficiency is present in the majority of patients with untreated disease and it might be a maternal risk factor for neural tube defects and orofacial clefts. Coeliac men may have reversible infertility, and as in women, if gastrointestinal symptoms are mild or absent the diagnosis may be missed. It is important to make diagnosis because the giving of gluten free diet may result in conception and favourable outcome of pregnancy.},

The overall mortality in CD is approximately twice that of the general population. The excess deaths are due mainly to intestinal lymphoma. In Europe, only 26 cases of CD and cancer in children have been published. There is evidence that cancer and CD in children are underreported. We report a case of Wilms tumour in a child who developed CD. As a neonate the boy had been successfully operated for congenital mesoblastic nephroma. Gluten was introduced in his diet at age of 12 months. He developed vomiting, abdominal distention ad hypertransaminosaemia. Up to the age of 16 months he had lost 1500 g and coeliac crisis was diagnosed (IgAEMA titre 1:50 and in the duodenal biopsy specimen there was crypt hyperplastic total villous atrophy). Symptoms improved rapidly when gluten-free diet was initiated, and 4 years later, clinical and serological findings were normal. Wilms tumour accounts for 6% to 7% of all childhood malignancies. There are no reports in MEDLINE about coeliac disease in patients who have been operated for the tumour. This seemed intriguing because prevalence of gluten-sensitive enteropathy calculated for Europe varies between 1/100 and 1/300.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seven autoantibody-positive, first-degree relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes were placed on a gluten-free diet for 12 months followed by gluten reexposure for 12 months. Gliadin antibodies as well as the diabetes-related antibodies insulin autoantibody (IAA), GAD antibody (GADA), and tyrosin phosphatase IA2 antibody (IA-2A) were measured every 3 months; oral glucose tolerance tests were performed every 6 months. Changes in autoantibody titers were compared with those observed in a matched historical cohort. RESULTS: A reduction in IgG gliadin antibody titers was observed during the gluten-free period, but titers of diabetes-associated autoantibodies changed independently of gluten exposure. Type 1 diabetes-associated islet autoantibody levels at the end of the gluten-free diet period were not significantly different from those before commencement of the diet (P = 0.2) or at the end of the gluten reexposure period (P = 0.4). Changes in individual subjects were identified, but no differences were noted between the gluten-free and the gluten re-exposure periods, and the changes were similar to those observed in the historical control cohort (P = 1.0). Major titer reductions (>50%) in the gluten-free period were observed in only one subject for all antibodies. Type 1 diabetes developed in this subject and in a second subject during the gluten reexposure period. CONCLUSIONS: The findings do not support the hypothesis that gluten is a driving antigen in type 1 diabetes.},

In Crohn disease, the provision of adequate protein and calories may not only improve symptoms but may be associated with acceleration of growth. In celiac disease, the dietary restriction of gluten is curative of the intestinal inflammation. In chronic nonspecific diarrhea and functional constipation, the provision of appropriate amounts of fiber and fluids may ameliorate symptoms. A thorough understanding of the role of diet is essential to the management of these disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease, or permanent gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an immunologic disease strictly dependent on exposure to wheat gluten or related proteins in rye and barley. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore whether breast-feeding and the mode of introducing dietary gluten influence the risk of celiac disease in childhood. DESIGN: A population-based incident case-referent study of Swedish children, 627 cases with celiac disease and 1254 referents, was conducted; 78% of the matched sets were included in the final analyses. A questionnaire was used to assess patterns of food introduction to infants. Models were built, based on current epidemiologic and immunologic knowledge of celiac disease, to study the potential influence of dietary patterns on disease risk and were evaluated by conditional logistic regression in multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The risk of celiac disease was reduced in children aged <2 y if they were still being breast-fed when dietary gluten was introduced [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 0.59; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.83]. This effect was even more pronounced in infants who continued to be breast-fed after dietary gluten was introduced (OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.51). The risk was greater when gluten was introduced in the diet in large amounts (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.1) than when introduced in small or medium amounts. In older children, these risk factors were of no or only minor importance. CONCLUSIONS: The gradual introduction of gluten-containing foods into the diet of infants while they are still being breast-fed reduces the risk of celiac disease in early childhood and probably also during the subsequent childhood period.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Six to 12 months of ingestion of moderate amounts of oats does not have a harmful effect in adult patients with coeliac disease. As the safety of long term intake of oats in coeliac patients is not known, we continued our previous 6-12 month study for five years. AIM: To assess the safety of long term ingestion of oats in the diet of coeliac patients. PATIENTS: In our previous study, the effects of a gluten free diet and a gluten free diet including oats were compared in a randomised trial involving 92 adult patients with coeliac disease (45 in the oats group, 47 in the control group). After the initial phase of 6-12 months, patients in the oats group were allowed to eat oats freely in conjunction with an otherwise gluten free diet. After five years, 35 patients in the original oats group (23 still on an oats diet) and 28 in the control group on a conventional gluten free diet were examined. METHODS: Clinical and nutritional assessment, duodenal biopsies for conventional histopathology and histomorphometry, and measurement of antiendomysial, antireticulin, and antigliadin antibodies. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between controls and those patients consuming oats with respect to duodenal villous architecture, inflammatory cell infiltration of the duodenal mucosa, or antibody titres after five years of follow up. In both groups histological and histomorphometric indexes improved equally with time. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the long term safety of oats as part of a coeliac diet in adult patients with coeliac disease. It also appears that the majority of coeliac patients prefer oats in their diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coeliac disease is characterised by atrophy of the villi and hyperplasia of the crypts in the mucosa of the small intestine. It is caused by an environmental trigger, cereal gluten, which induces infiltration of the mucosa by inflammatory cells. We hypothesised that these inflammatory cells express cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), an enzyme that contributes to the synthesis of pro and anti-inflammatory prostaglandins and is known to be expressed at sites of inflammation in the stomach and colon. We have investigated expression of COX-2 in the coeliac disease affected small intestinal mucosa where it may be an indicator of either disease induction or mucosal restoration processes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Small intestinal biopsy samples from 15 coeliac patients and 15 non-coeliac individuals were stained immunohistochemically for COX-2. Samples from 10 of the patients were also stained after these patients had been on a gluten free diet for 6-24 months. Various cell type marker antigens were used for immunohistochemical identification of the type of cell that expressed COX-2. To further verify colocalisation of the cell type marker and COX-2, double immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence methods were employed. Immunoelectron microscopy was used to investigate the subcellular location of COX-2. RESULTS: In all samples taken from coeliac patients, clusters of cells with strong immunoreactivity for COX-2 were found in those areas of the lamina propria where the epithelium seemed to blister or was totally detached from the basement membrane. These clusters were reduced in number or totally absent in samples taken after a gluten free diet. No such clusters were seen in any control samples. The density of COX-2 positive cells lining the differentiated epithelium decreased significantly from 13.5 (5.1) cells/10(5) microm(2) (mean (SD)) in the untreated patient samples to 6.5 (2.0) cells/10(5) microm(2) after a gluten free diet (p<0.001), and was 3.3 (1.9) cells/10(5) microm(2) in control samples (p<0.001 compared with untreated or diet treated coeliac samples). Staining for COX-2 was localised to CD3+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages in the mucosal lesions but not all of these cells were positive for COX-2. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the ultrastructure of the COX-2 positive cells resembled that of lymphocytes, and the immunoreaction was localised to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that in coeliac disease, blistering of small intestinal epithelial cells is associated with accumulation of COX-2 positive T cells, and the number of these cells decreases after a gluten free diet. These observations suggest that COX-2 mediated prostanoid synthesis contributes to healing of the coeliac mucosa and may be involved in maintenance of intestinal integrity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD), a common cause of malabsorption, is known to be associated with disorders of the skeleton, but there are conflicting data about the effect of diet on bone metabolism. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of osteopenia; to identify the relationship between bone mineral density (BMD), serum calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels; and to determine the effect of gluten-free diet on BMD in children with celiac disease. DESIGN: The study included 32 patients with CD (group 1) and 82 healthy controls (group 2). The patients with CD were evaluated under 2 subgroups, ie, 16 patients with recent diagnosis (group 1a) and 16 patients who follow their diet strictly (group 1b). BMD values and concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and intact parathyroid hormone were determined on entry to the study and at 12 months in celiac patients. These values were compared with those of healthy control participants. RESULTS: BMD and bone mineral content values in patients with recent diagnosis were found to be significantly lower than the control group. The BMD values in patients with recent diagnosis were significantly increased after a gluten-free diet for 1 year. Osteopenia was found more commonly in patients with recent diagnosis than patients in whom a gluten-free diet had been instituted. At 1-year follow-up, osteopenia was not resolved with the gluten-free diet, and this was especially true in patients without gastrointestinal manifestation. In patients with recent diagnosis (group 1a), the mean calcium level was found to be lower than the patients who follow their diet strictly (group 1b). There was a positive correlation between calcium level and BMD and bone mineral content. CONCLUSIONS: BMD is almost invariably low in newly diagnosed celiac patients in childhood. We therefore recommend that BMD should be evaluated in patients with CD. Strict gluten avoidance promoted a significant increase in BMD. However, values still remained markedly low after 1 year of follow-up in some patients. These patients should be followed for longer periods of time with yearly BMD evaluation, as 1 year of diet therapy was found to be insufficient for osteopenia to be resolved.},

Celiac disease was diagnosed according to ESPGHAN criteria. Obtained results indicate that in celiac disease low plasma selenium levels are especially marked at preliminary stage of diagnosis and following low compliance to the gluten free diet.

   abstract = {MMDM patients are typically young at onset with low body mass index, require insulin treatment for glycemic control, have insulin resistance, and do not develop ketosis on withdrawal of insulin. WHO's revised classification in 1999, based on the etiopathogenesis of the disease, identifies only two categories: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. MMDM could be considered as type 1b diabetes. Genetic and immunological studies were done on MDDM patients (n = 72) from Cuttack and healthy controls to understand and to justify its inclusion in the category of type 1b diabetes. Antibodies (Abs) to tyrosine pyrophosphatase (IA2-Abs), glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65-Abs), and other minor markers like ICA12 Abs and tissue transglutaminase Abs (TTG-Abs) were studied. HLA-DR and DQ were studied for the genetic markers. Of the MMDM patients 30% were positive for either GAD65 or IA-2 antibodies, and 14% were positive for ICA12 antibodies. All three antibody markers together accounted for 39% of PDDM patients, as some patients were positive for more than one autoantibody. TTG antibodies (specific for Celiac disease) were present in 14/71 (20%) of MMDM patients compared to 3/122 (2%) controls. All four autoantibodies accounted for 53% of PDDM patients, leaving 47% of patients free of known autoantibodies. The autoantibody-negative PDDM patients were analyzed for HLA and MICA markers, showing that DR7-DQ9 and MICA allele 9 are increased in this group compared to healthy controls, which suggests an autoimmune response to an unknown dietary autoantigen. We conclude from our data that an autoimmune mechanism is involved in the etiology of MMDM. In addition, the presence of silent celiac disease seen with MMDM patients, which has not yet been reported, is significant. It is important to note that subclinical celiac disease exists with diabetes mellitus and must be considered in the diagnosis of MMDM.},

A 49-year-old man was admitted with a 1-year history of epigastric pain, which was not relieved by regular analgesic intake, and nausea. The results of physical examination, routine laboratory tests, and upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy were normal. Ultrasonography showed a 10-cm mass in the left hepatic lobe. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 90-mm hemangioma at left hepatic lobe. Selective celiac arteriogram was performed, and polyvinyl alcohol particles were used as an embolizing agent. After the embolization, the patient underwent laparoscopic enucleation of the liver hemangioma. No blood transfusion was needed during the operation. The operative time was 75 min. The patient was allowed to take a clear liquid diet on the postoperative day 1. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful, and he was discharged on the postoperative day 2. Enucleation is the best surgical technique for the management of symptomatic giant hemangiomas. It can be performed with no mortality or morbidity, with preservation of all normal liver parenchyma. Enucleation also has been associated with significantly fewer intraabdominal complications than anatomic resection. The laparoscopic approach for enucleation requires patience and careful dissection to prevent bleeding. In conclusion, laparoscopic enucleation of hemangiomas is safe and easy to perform in selected cases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Mild liver abnormalities are common in patients with celiac disease and usually resolve with a gluten-free diet. We investigated the occurrence of celiac disease in patients with severe liver failure. METHODS: Four patients with untreated celiac disease and severe liver disease are described. Further, the occurrence of celiac disease was studied in 185 adults with previous liver transplantation using serum immunoglobulin A endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies in screening. RESULTS: Of the 4 patients with severe liver disease and celiac disease, 1 had congenital liver fibrosis, 1 had massive hepatic steatosis, and 2 had progressive hepatitis without apparent origin. Three were even remitted for consideration of liver transplantation. Hepatic dysfunction reversed in all cases when a gluten-free diet was adopted. In the transplantation group, 8 patients (4.3%) had celiac disease. Six cases were detected before the operation: 3 had primary biliary cirrhosis, 1 had autoimmune hepatitis, 1 had primary sclerosing cholangitis, and 1 had congenital liver fibrosis. Only 1 patient had maintained a long-term strict gluten-free diet. Screening found 2 cases of celiac disease, 1 with autoimmune hepatitis and 1 with secondary sclerosing cholangitis. CONCLUSIONS: The possible presence of celiac disease should be investigated in patients with severe liver disease. Dietary treatment may prevent progression to hepatic failure, even in cases in which liver transplantation is considered.},

We therefore searched for evidence of disease in 10 adults suspected to have celiac disease, but evincing only minor mucosal inflammation and increase in gammadelta+ cells without villous atrophy. Twenty untreated celiac and 27 nonceliac patients served as biopsy controls. CD3+, alphabeta+, and gammadelta+ cells were increased in patients with only minor mucosal lesions, but less than in celiac patients. The inflammation resolved on gluten-free diet, and abdominal symptoms were alleviated. Eight of 10 had positive endomysial, seven gliadin, and nine tissue transglutaminase antibodies; all normalized on diet. Eight patients had osteopenia; HLA DQ2 was found in all. Minor mucosal lesions with an increase in gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes were suggestive of celiac disease. Our patients showed a clinical, histological, and serological recovery on diet; risk of osteopenia speaks in favor of dietary treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: More than 95% of celiac patients share the major histocompatibility complex II class human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 or DQ8 haplotype; patients negative for both types are unlikely to suffer from celiac disease. Our aim was to investigate whether HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 typing is helpful when diagnosis is uncertain because of the absence of unequivocal small bowel villous atrophy. METHODS: HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 typing was carried out in 59 patients evincing nondiagnostic small bowel mucosal lesion or positive celiac serology, and in 17 patients maintaining a gluten-free diet without biopsy-proven celiac disease. HLA findings were compared to small bowel mucosal morphology; intraepithelial lymphocytes; and serum endomysial (EmA), reticulin, tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) and gliadin antibodies. RESULTS: Of the 59 patients evincing only minor small bowel mucosal changes or positive celiac disease serology, 22 (37%) were negative for DQ2 and DQ8. All EmA-positive patients had celiac-type HLA, but antireticulin antibody, anti-tTg, and antigliadin antibody were also present in HLA-DQ2- and -DQ8-negative individuals. Eleven of 17 patients (65%) observing a gluten-free diet before small bowel biopsy did not share celiac-type HLA. None of the 17 had apparent villous atrophy. Serum EmA and anti-tTG were negative in all. HLA-DQ typing is less expensive than follow-up biopsy in the exclusion of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 determination is useful in exclusion, probably lifelong, of celiac disease in individuals with an equivocal small bowel histological finding. The low specificity of this test must, however, be borne in mind.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Serum IgA-class tissue transglutaminase antibody has proved effective in screening for coeliac disease. The response to a gluten-free diet has been assessed on the basis of small-intestinal morphology. We investigated whether the tissue transglutaminase antibody test could substitute biopsy in this respect, and whether the test is better than the endomysial antibody test in follow-up. DESIGN: Controlled cross sectional, and follow-up study. METHODS: Serum IgA-class tissue transglutaminase antibodies and endomysial antibodies were determined in 87 coeliac adults on a gluten-free diet. All underwent small bowel biopsy, and the mucosal morphology was interpreted along with Marsh's grading 0-3. In 30 patients histological and serological data could be analysed before and after adopting the diet; Marsh 3 was considered inadequate mucosal recovery during the diet. RESULTS: Of the 87 coeliac patients 27 showed Marsh 3 villous atrophy on gluten-free diet; of these 27, tissue transglutaminase antibody was within normal limits in 16 (59%) and endomysial antibody in 20 (74%). Two (7%) out of 29 with normal mucosa (Marsh 0) had positive tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Six (55%) out of 11 admitting regular dietary lapses remained tissue transglutaminase antibody negative. In the follow-up, serum IgA-class tissue transglutaminase antibody was initially positive in 28 (93%) out of 30 untreated patients; even a significant decrease in tissue transglutaminase antibody did not guarantee mucosal recovery. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of coeliac patients with negative tissue transglutaminase or endomysial antibodies may still have manifest mucosal villous atrophy. Small bowel biopsy is therefore still necessary to ensure that the gluten-free diet is adequate.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD), or gluten sensitivity, is considered to be a state of heightened immunologic responsiveness to ingested gluten proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. The gastrointestinal manifestation suggests a severe enteropathy of the small intestine with malabsorption, steatorrhea, and weight loss because of a deranged mucosal immune response. Neurologic complications occur, especially epilepsy, possibly associated with occipital calcifications or folate deficiency and cerebellar ataxia. There have been reports of brain white-matter lesions as an extraintestinal manifestation in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis but not in CD. METHODS: In this study, 75 diet-treated mainly pediatric patients with biopsy-proven CD underwent prospectively clinical neurologic examinations, laboratory investigations, electroencephalography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The age range was 2.8 to 24.2 years with a mean of 11.6 years. The mean period of gluten exposure was 2.4 years. RESULTS: Ten patients had neurologic findings such as febrile seizures, single generalized seizures, mild ataxia, and muscular hypotonia with retarded motor development. No folate deficiency was found. The hippocampal regions showed no abnormalities. Computed tomography did not reveal any cerebral calcifications, but magnetic resonance imaging detected unilateral and bilateral T2-hyperintensive white-matter lesions in 15 patients (20%). There was no correlation between these lesions and dietary compliance or neurologic or electroencephalographic abnormalities. The mean gluten exposure time of these patients was slightly increased (not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Focal white-matter lesions in the brain may represent an extraintestinal manifestation of CD. They may be ischemic in origin as a result of a vasculitis or caused by inflammatory demyelination. They seem to be more typical of pediatric CD than cerebral calcifications. Their prognostic value is unclear and needs to be elucidated in additional studies. CD should be suggested as a differential diagnosis in children with unclear white-matter lesions even without intestinal symptoms.},

The aim of study was to measure gut permeability in patients with untreated celiac disease and during treatment with a gluten free diet. METHODS: 30 patients with celiac disease before and during treatment with gluten-free diet were investigated, 30 patients without organic damage of the gastrointestinal tract served as control. Small bowel permeability was measured using lactulose/mannitol and lactulose/D-xylose ratios. The saccharides were examined in the 5 hours collected urine using capillary gas chromatography. RESULTS: Small bowel permeability (indices lactulose/mannitol and/or lactulose/xylose) increased significantly in patients with untreated celiac disease. 23 patients were followed up before and during treatment with a gluten-free diet 2-6 months after beginning of this treatment and small bowel permeability (measured as indices lactulose/mannitol and/or lactulose/xylose) significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: Small bowel permeability test is a non-invasive test suitable for the diagnosis of celiac disease and monitoring of compliance to a gluten-free diet in these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Literature data have shown high specificity of antiendomysial antibodies (EmA IgA) in celiac disease. The scarcity of Brazilian reports concerning this subject motivated the present study. OBJECTIVES: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of antiendomysial IgA antibodies in Brazilian celiac patients at diagnosis and after treatment, to confirm patient adherence to a gluten-free diet and to screen first-degree relatives. METHODS: An extensive clinical and serological study was performed by investigating the presence of these antibodies in 392 individuals from Southern Brazil. Indirect immunofluorescence using human umbilical cord as substrate was employed and the total levels of IgA were determined by turbidimetry in all groups. The study was conducted on 57 celiac patients (18 at diagnosis, 24 who adhered to a gluten-free diet and 15 with marked or slight transgression of the diet), 115 relatives of celiac patients (39 families), 94 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases, and 126 healthy individuals from the general population. RESULTS: The results demonstrated 100% positivity for the recently diagnosed patients and for those consuming gluten, in contrast to the patients who complied with the diet (0%). In the control group one individual was positive, but refused to undergo a biopsy. In the group of other gastrointestinal diseases, one positive patient presented ulcerative colitis, Down's syndrome and epilepsy, and the intestinal biopsy was diagnostic for celiac disease. These data showed 99.3% specificity for the test. Eighteen relatives were positive for antiendomysial antibodies IgA (15.65%), and comparison with the healthy population revealed a significant difference. An intestinal biopsy was obtained from seven subjects (one with total villous atrophy and six without alterations in the mucosal architecture, but all with a high number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes). CONCLUSIONS: The method revealed 100% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity. Because it is not an invasive method it can be used for the screening of atypical and latent forms of celiac disease to avoid serial biopsies and to control adherence to a gluten-free diet with implications in the prevention of malignancy in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Discovery of a number of novel and known human genes whose protein products bear striking similarity to two or more wheat gliadin domains raised the possibility that human intestinal non-HLA peptides homologous to celiac T-cell epitopes could play a role in non-HLA gene specification in celiac disease. Database searching of the entire human genome identified only 11 gut-expressed proteins with high T-cell epitope homology, particularly to the DQ2-gamma-I-gliadin epitope (i.e. TFIIA, FOXJ2 and IgD; mean BestFit quality score=40 versus random value of 24). Others were similar to DQ2-alpha-I-gliadin (i.e. PAX9; BestFit quality 46 versus 20 for random), or DQ2-alpha-II-gliadin (PHLDA1, known in mice as the T-cell death-associated gene; BestFit quality 43 versus 30 for random) epitopes. Among proteins previously screened for gliadin homology, noteworthy was achaete scute homologous protein (DQ2-alpha-I-gliadin; BestFit quality 41 versus 22 for random). With the exception of IgD, all are nuclear factors. Paying particular attention to the position of potential major histocompatibility complex (MHC) anchor residues, several were selected for testing in a DQ2-gamma-I-gliadin-restricted T-cell system. All native 10-mer peptides were inactive, even when deamidated, but V96F substitution of deamidated TFIIA amino acid residues 91-100 stimulated IL-2 release at levels exceeding the wheat gliadin positive control. Also active, but only slightly, was L1009F substitution of AIB3 amino acid residues 1004-1013. PlotSimilarity alignment of TFIIAs from eight species revealed subthreshold similarity score in the peptide region, in contrast to the highly conserved amino and carboxy termini. Molecular modeling of TFIIA[V96F] peptide points to an important juxtaposition of an upwardly projecting phenylalanine residue at peptide position 6 that likely contacts a receptor complementarity-determining region, and a downwardly projecting glutamic acid residue that fits into the shallow MHC P7 pocket. These observations tentatively point to a new multi-gene hypothesis for the initiation of celiac disease in which deamidated free human peptides with T-cell epitope homology (particularly those made more homologous by mutation) escape negative selection, as per deamidation of the HEL(48-62) peptide in the hen egg lysozyme model of autoimmunity. Deamidation following peptide release due to injury triggers inflammation, thereafter repeatedly provoked by dietary gliadin immunodominant peptides concentrated in the proximal small intestine.},

Serological tests have become the preferred methods of diagnosing CD in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However, commercially available serological methods are limited in that they detect only the IgA isotype of antibodies (with the exception of IgG gliadin assays); hence, IgA-deficient patients with CD may yield false-negative serology. Fifteen pediatric patients with CD and 10 IgA-deficient pediatric patients without CD were examined for IgA and IgG antibodies to endomysium, gliadin, and tissue transglutaminase. Twenty-five specimens from patients with IgA deficiency were examined. Fifteen were from patients with CD, and 10 were patients without CD. All 15 IgA-deficient patients with CD were positive for endomysium antibodies of the IgG isotype and for IgG gliadin antibodies. All but one of the IgA-deficient patients with CD were also positive for IgG tissue transglutaminase antibodies. None of the IgA-deficient patients without CD were positive for any of the antibody markers. All the specimens examined were also negative for IgA-specific antibodies to endomysium, gliadin, and tissue transglutaminase. IgG-specific antibody tests for endomysium, gliadin, and tissue transglutaminase are useful for the identification of IgA-deficient patients with CD. IgG antibody tests along with tests routinely being used in clinical laboratories can reliably detect all active patients with CD. In addition, the levels of these CD-specific IgG antibodies could be used to monitor patient dietary compliance.},

   abstract = {The association of Durhing's disease, commonly referred to as dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), with gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) is supported by the presence of villous atrophy and endomysial antibodies (EMA). EMA are found to be a marker of GSE both in celiac disease (CD) and in DH. Since tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is believed to be the major autoantigen in GSE, the aim of our study was to determine the specificity and sensitivity of anti-tTG antibody ELISA compared to the EMA indirect immunofluorescence test. We studied 44 cases of DH, confirmed by the presence of IgA immune deposits in the dermal papillae, and 58 cases of CD conforming to the International Criteria of Diagnosing CD. The control group comprised 161 sera from patients with vesiculobullous disorders other than DH and 106 sera from normal healthy blood donors. Anti-tTG antibodies were detected in 36 of 44 DH (79%) and in 32 of 58 CD (55%) patients. EMA were positive in 33 of 44 DH (74%) and in 36 of 58 CD (62%) patients. Both the EMA and the antibodies to tTG were present in the majority of patients with DH and CD when they were on a normal gluten-containing diet and were absent when on a gluten-free diet for an extended period of time. There were, however, small discrepancies in positivity and negativity in tTG antibody-positive and EMA-negative patients and vice versa. There seems to be a correlation between the EMA titers and the anti-tTG antibody levels. This study confirms the high specificity and sensitivity of anti-tTG antibody ELISA for GSE and its strong correlation with EMA both in CD and in DH. The results of anti-tTG antibody and EMA assays were comparable; however, in DH, tTG was somewhat more sensitive than the EMA test. For screening of DH, it is advisable to perform both EMA and anti-tTG antibody tests.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder induced by gluten intake in genetically susceptible individuals. It is characterized by the presence of serum antibodies to endomysium, reticulin, gliadin, and tissue transglutaminase. The incidence of CD in various autoimmune disorders is increased 10- to 30-fold in comparison to the general population, although in many cases CD is clinically asymptomatic or silent. The identification of such cases with CD is important since it may help in the control of type I diabetes or endocrine functions in general, as well as in the prevention of long-term complications of CD, such as lymphoma. It is believed that CD may predispose an individual to other autoimmune disorders such as type I diabetes, autoimmune thyroid, and other endocrine diseases and that gluten may be a possible trigger. The onset of type I diabetes at an early age in patients with CD, compared to non-CD, and the prevention or delay in onset of diabetes by gluten-free diet in genetically predisposed individuals substantiates this antigen trigger hypothesis. Early identification of CD patients in highly susceptible population may result in the treatment of subclinical CD and improved control of associated disorders.},

With the advent of new noninvasive and more sensitive screening tools, it has become increasingly apparent that this disease presents in a heterogeneous fashion, with symptomatic disease only occurring in a small number of patients. Furthermore, great insights have been made into the disease's genetic and immunological components, thus increasing the medical community's understanding of the disease. The current gold standard for diagnosis is histological confirmation, and the cornerstone of therapy is lifelong elimination of gluten. Further advances in immunobiological techniques will most likely aid in earlier detection and commencement of the appropriate diet, thus preventing the development of associated complications.},

   abstract = {The only known treatment for celiac disease is lifelong avoidance of dietary gluten. For many sufferers from celiac disease, this may be difficult to achieve. The purpose of this study was to analyse dietary habits and related problems of adults afflicted with celiac disease. A questionnaire was mailed to 617 current and former members of the Quebec Celiac Foundation to document health, dietary habits, sources of celiac disease treatment information, daily concerns, and level of difficulty in complying with a gluten-free diet. The final sample size was 234 (75% female). Results indicated that over 35% of participants experienced intestinal discomfort at least twice a week. In addition, 66% felt that their consumption of grain products was insufficient. Only 44% said they had received from dietitians a large quantity of information about celiac disease treatment, and only 57% had a high level of confidence in the information received from dietitians. Thirty-six percent reported difficulty in complying with the gluten-free diet. According to a probit analysis, larger region of residence (p<0.02) and concern about preparing meals (p<0.005) were directly related to difficulty in complying, while older age (p<0.05), satisfaction with gluten-free products (p<0.01), and a high level of confidence in treatment information from gastroenterologists and dietitians (p<0.005) were inversely associated with compliance difficulty. Awareness of these results should encourage dietitians to improve their skills in treating celiac disease.},

CASE REPORT: A nine-month-old girl was admitted for a bowel intussusception diagnosed by ultrasonography, yet not confirmed by barium enema. The girl underwent a thorough check up, due to a loss of weight and denutrition symptoms which evidenced immunoglobulin A anti-gliadin, immunoglobulin G anti-gliadin, immunoglobulin A anti-endomysium and antireticulin positive antibodies. Celiac disease was confirmed by bowel biopsy, which revealed a subtotal villous atrophy. Evolution was favourable under a gluten free diet. COMMENTS: The description of a bowel intussusception associated with celiac disease is common. This observation appears to be the earliest case ever described: the patient was only nine months old. The initial procedure is routine: diagnosis by ultrasonography, therapeutic enema and surgery only in case of failure of medical treatment. Intussusception associated with celiac disease often presents in an atypical way: elementary forms, spontaneously resolvent and recidivious. The knowledge of this clinical set of symptoms leads to an early diagnosis of celiac disease. The gluten free diet prevents the recurrence of intussusception.},

As a result, lipid maldigestion occurs (on a clinical standpoint it is more serious than proteic maldigestion) responsible for greasy diarrhoea with steatorrhoea and abdominal discomfort. Stearorrhoea is diagnosed thanks to a direct measurement of the total lipid content in the stool rather than indirect test. The pancreatic origin of the steatorrhoea is demonstrated in view of the clinical history of the disease, the normal duodenal biopsy specimen or by imaging or biological testing. Steatorrhoea is treated by pancreatic extract given as a form of enteric coated microcapsules (which are protected from proteolitic and acidic digestion) together with some dietary advises.},

   abstract = {Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) has been reported in patients with celiac disease in association with secondary hyperparathyroidism. The present study investigated whether basal parathyroid hormone (PTH) remained elevated and whether abnormalities of parathyroid function were still present in celiac disease patients treated with a gluten-free diet. Basal seric measurements of calcium and phosphate homeostasis and BMD were obtained in 17 biopsy-proven patients under treatment for a mean period of 5.7+/-3.7 years (range 1.1 to 15.9). In addition, parathyroid function was studied with calcium chloride and sodium citrate infusions in seven patients. Basal measurements of patients were compared with those of 26 normal individuals, while parathyroid function results were compared with those of seven sex- and age-matched controls. Basal results were similar in patients and controls except for intact PTH (I-PTH) (3.77+/-0.88 pmol/L versus 2.28+/-0.63 pmol/L, P<0.001), which was higher in the former group but still within normal limits. Mean 25-hydroxy vitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D values were normal in patients. Parathyroid function results were also found to be similar in both groups. Compared with a reference population of the same age (Z score), patients had significantly lower BMDs of the hip (-0.60+/-0.96 SDs, P<0.05) and lumbar spine (-0.76+/-1.15 SDs, P<0.05). T scores were also decreased for the hip (-1.3+/-0.9 SDs, P<0.0001) and lumbar spine (-1.4+/-1.35 SDs, P<0.0001), with two to three patients being osteoporotic (T score less than -2.5 SDs) and seven to eight osteopenic (T score less than -1 SDs but greater than or equal to -2.5 SDs) in at least one site. Height and weight were the only important determinants of BMD values by multivariate or logistical regression analysis in these patients. The results show higher basal I-PTH values with normal parathyroid function in treated celiac disease. Height and weight values are, but I-PTH values are not, an important determinant of the actual bone mass of patients. Normal parathyroid function in treated patients suggests a lack of previous severe secondary hyperparathyroidism and/or complete adaptation to prior changes in parathyroid function.},

Peripheral T lymphocytes with the phenotype of helper cells or cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) were decreased. Circulating activated T cells (CD3/HLA-DR-positive cells) and large granular lymphocytes (CD16/CD56 positive cells) were increased. Plasma levels of interleukin-6 were higher in DS children than in controls. Serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone were increased in DS. Coeliac disease was over-represented in the group of DS children and many of these children also showed increased serum levels of immunoglobulin-G (IgG) specific for gliadin antigen. The increment of serum interleukin-6 was age-related and correlated with anti-gliadin IgG levels in DS. Plasma zinc levels were lower in DS children with coeliac disease and in those with anti-gliadin IgG than in DS without detectable anti-gliadin IgG. Dietary antigens may represent a continuous stimulus for the immune system in this syndrome and interfere with normal immune responses. Altered intestinal absorption of nutrients may in turn affect endocrine functions, brain development, and cognitive performances.},

   abstract = {The vascular endothelium maintains a relatively vasodilated state via the release of nitric oxide (NO), a process that could be disrupted by hyperhomocysteinaemia. Since endothelial dysfunction is associated with increased systemic vascular resistance that is the hallmark of sustained arterial hypertension, we hypothesised that in patients with both hypertension and coeliac disease with hyperhomocysteinaemia (via malabsorption of essential cofactors), treatment of the latter disease could improve blood pressure (BP) control. A single patient with proven sustained hypertension and newly-diagnosed coeliac disease had baseline and post-treatment BP and endothelial function assessed by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and brachial artery forearm occlusion plethysmography respectively. This 49 year-old woman had uncomplicated sustained hypertension proven on repeated ABPM carried out 6 weeks apart (daytime mean 151/92 mm Hg and 155/95 mm Hg), and sub-clinical coeliac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy). Initial assessments revealed raised homocysteine levels with low normal vitamin B(12) level. It was likely that she had impaired absorption of essential cofactors for normal homocysteine metabolism. She adhered to a gluten-free diet and was give oral iron, folate and B(6) supplementations as well as B(12) injections for 3 months. Her BP had improved by 6 months and normalised by 15 months (daytime ABPM mean 128/80 mm Hg). There was parallel restoration of normal endothelial function with normalisation of her homocysteine levels. These observations suggest that sub-clinical coeliac disease related hyperhomocysteinaemia might cause endothelial dysfunction, potentially giving rise to a reversible form of hypertension. In addition, this case study supports the notion that irrespective of aetiology, endothelial dysfunction may be the precursor of hypertension. This highlights the need to resolve co-existing vascular risk factors in patients with hypertension.},

The etiology of CFS remains unclear; however, a number of recent studies have shown oxidative stress may be involved in its pathogenesis. The role of oxidative stress in CFS is an important area for current and future research as it suggests the use of antioxidants in the management of CFS. Specifically, the dietary supplements glutathione, N-acetylcysteine, alpha-lipoic acid, oligomeric proanthocyanidins, Ginkgo biloba, and Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry) may be beneficial. In addition, research on food intolerance is discussed, since food intolerance may be involved in CFS symptom presentation and in oxidation via cytokine induction. Finally, recent evidence suggests celiac disease can present with neurological symptoms in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms; therefore, celiac disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of CFS.},

Both HLA and non-HLA genes contribute to CD susceptibility. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) regulates gamma-interferon production. The IL12B gene is located in a region (5q31.1-33.1) where there is evidence for linkage with CD. Allele 1 of an IL12B 3'UTR single-nucleotide polymorphism leads to increased expression of IL-12, and was recently implicated in susceptibility for type 1 diabetes (T1D). We found no evidence for association of allele 1 to CD by the transmission/disequilibrium test or case-control approach.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth retardation resulting from celiac disease diagnosed in infancy or in early childhood is remediable after introduction of a gluten-free diet. The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term growth, catch-up growth and final height in a group of treated patients with celiac disease. METHODS: The study population consisted of 35 patients (13 M, 22 F) with typical celiac disease. Age at diagnosis was 1.17 (+/- 0.69) years. For each patient, the standard deviation score (SDS) and centile of height at diagnosis, target height and final height were elaborated, and linear regression and correlations between SDS of final height and age at diagnosis, SDS of height at diagnosis and SDS of target height, respectively, were calculated. RESULTS: At diagnosis patients had a general tendency to short stature: mean height was 81.8 cm +/- 22.9 cm (SDS -0.75 +/- 1.61), while target height was 164.3 cm +/- 13.5 cm (SDS -0.14 +/- 1.04) and final height 169.2 cm +/- 7.7 cm (SDS 0.41 +/- 1.04). Linear regression and correlations between SDS of final height and age at diagnosis, SDS of height at diagnosis and SDS of target height, respectively, proved nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of age and height at diagnosis, catch-up growth was complete in this group of patients, with satisfactory achievement of final height. Only one patient (age at diagnosis 13 years) failed to reach the target height.},

   abstract = {Immunocytochemistry showed expression of aquaporin-1 (AQP1) water channels at sites involved in dietary fat processing, including intrahepatic cholangiocytes, gallbladder, pancreatic microvascular endothelium, and intestinal lacteals. To determine whether AQP1 has a role in dietary fat digestion and/or absorption, mice were placed on a diet that contained 50% fat. Whereas wild-type mice (3-3.5 wk of age, 10-12 g) gained 49 +/- 5% (SE, n = 50) body weight in 8 days, and heterozygous mice gained 46 +/- 4%, AQP1 null mice gained only 4 +/- 3%; weights became similar after return to a 6% fat diet after 6 days. The null mice on a high-fat diet acquired an oily appearance, developed steatorrhea with increased stool triglyceride content, and manifested serum hypotriglyceridemia. Supplementation of the high-fat diet with pancreatic enzymes partially corrected the decreased weight gain in null mice. Absorption of [(14)C]oleic acid from small intestine was not affected by AQP1 deletion, as determined by blood radioactivity after duodenal infusion. Lipase activity in feces and small intestine was remarkably greater in AQP1 null than wild-type mice on low- and high-fat diets. Fluid collections done in older mice (that are less sensitive to a high-fat diet) by ductal cannulation showed threefold increased pancreatic fluid flow in response to secretin/cholecystokinin, but volumes, pH, and amylase activities were affected little by AQP1 deletion, nor were bile flow rates and bile salt concentrations. Together, these results establish a dietary fat misprocessing defect in AQP1 null mice.},

Coeliac disease (classic and atypical form), Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis are considered as chronic autoimmune bowel diseases. The auto-antibodies can be detected with indirect immunofluorescence, ELISA and immunoblotting methods. In coeliac disease the autoantibodies against endomysium (tissue transglutaminase) and antibodies against gliadin are found in patient's sera. The auto-antibody detecting is helpful in establishing diagnosis, controlling gluten-free diet effectiveness and during gluten challenge. In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis immunological laboratory tests are helpful to confirm the clinical diagnosis. The following auto-antibodies are tested: against cytoplasm of exocrinal pancreatic cells, and products of these cells, against the neutrophile cytoplasm and against goblet cells. The antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae are also investigated. The clinical relevance of above autoantibodies is not clear, but it is suggested that their presence correlates with exacerbations and severe clinical outcome. In the present study the pictures of autoantibodies from fluorescent microscope were shown.},

   abstract = {Small intestinal biopsy is the most important diagnostic method in the routine evaluation of children with chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption. At present morphological alterations are considered essential in the diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) and the presence of a normal small bowel biopsy specimen, observed in patients eating a diet containing gluten, rules out the diagnosis of CD. The small intestinal biopsy can be carried out either by blind suction capsule or by endoscopic forceps. In everyday clinical practice endoscopic duodenal biopsies, if taken and handled suitably, are accepted as equivalent to capsule biopsies from the proximal jejunum. In the study we reported some patients in whom has been possible to demonstrate the presence of total villous atrophy in one biopsy, while other duodenal samples taken in different duodenal portions were normal or showed mild lymphocytes and plasmacells infiltrations of the lamina propria. In patients with this type of biopsy pathology, wherein flat mucosa has been found even close to normal mucosa, the possible explanation is mucosal patchiness. The occurrence of patchly distributed intestinal atrophy in children suffering of CD raises the question of the validity of using the peroral capsule, widely believed to be the best standard for the diagnosis of CD. In our opinion, small intestinal biopsies obtained via endoscopy are more reliable than the peroral capsule biopsies in order to identify patchy mucosal atrophy and could be very useful for a correct diagnosis in CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A raised intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) count with normal villous architecture is a recognised finding in latent coeliac disease. Little information is available in cases without gluten sensitive enteropathy in adults. AIMS: To assess the frequency of such a finding in routine practice and to determine whether it is clinically relevant. METHODS: Patients with subjectively increased IELs as the only abnormality were identified prospectively from a routine duodenal biopsy series over a 12 month period. The biopsy specimens in these index cases were re-examined together with two controls with normal histology for each case, and three counts of IEL/100 epithelial cells were made in all samples. The index cases were then contacted and interviewed to obtain clinical information, approximately 12 months from the initial biopsy. Further data were obtained from their clinical records. RESULTS: Fourteen of 626 (2.2%) patients who had duodenal biopsies over the 12 month period had a subjective increase in IELs with normal villous architecture. Fifteen patients with newly diagnosed gluten sensitive enteropathy were also identified during the study period. Formal counting of the index cases and controls revealed a significant difference in IELs/100 epithelial cell counts between the two (mean, 38 (SD, 6.2) v 12.4 (4.6); p < 0.0001). Three of the 14 index cases tested had a positive coeliac antibody test compared with 12 of 15 newly diagnosed patients with coeliac disease and 10 of 93 patients with normal histology. The major clinical diagnostic categories in raised IEL cases were those with positive coeliac serology (n = 3), unexplained anaemia (n = 3), and chronic liver disease (n = 3). Six of 10 patients who were interviewed had ongoing gastrointestinal symptoms one year later. Three patients had had follow up duodenal biopsies, at the discretion of their responsible clinicians, with no change in IEL counts despite the commencement of a gluten free diet in two patients. CONCLUSION: A raised IEL count with normal villous architecture is not uncommon. Six of the 14 patients may have had latent coeliac disease. The cause in at least half of cases is not obvious at present. The finding of a raised IEL count with normal villous architecture is of sufficient clinical importance to be highlighted in routine duodenal biopsy reports.},

Moreover, the monitoring of patients with concomitant celiac and autoimmune thyroid diseases, after a gluten-free diet or a gluten-containing diet, can give important insights into the effect of dietary habits in thyroid autoantibodies modulation. In our study, the prevalence of celiac disease in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease was 2%. In these two celiac patients, the serologic markers became undetectable 6 months after beginning a gluten-free diet.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is an under-diagnosed but extremely frequent disease, triggered by the ingestion of gliadin. The pathogenic mechanisms of CD are still poorly understood, but intraepithelial lymphocytes are considered to have a key role. We intended to define the subsets of T lymphocytes migrating upon gliadin challenge in organ cultures of treated celiac patients and establish the type of factor(s) driving such an infiltration. METHODS: Duodenum biopsies from 10 treated celiacs and 7 controls were cultured in vitro with/without gliadin digest (1 mg/ml) or interleukin (IL)-15 (10 ng/ml). In 7 treated celiacs IL-7, IL-4, and IL-2 were similarly tested. Intraepithelial CD3, CD8, TCR-gammadelta, and CD94 were detected by immunohistochemistry and numbered per mm epithelium. RESULTS: IL-15 but not IL-7, IL-4, or IL-2 induced intraepithelial increase of CD3+ and CD8+ cells in celiac and control intestine (p < 0.001 vs cultures with medium). IL-15 induced increases in the number of intraepithelial TCR- gammadelta+ and CD94+ cells only in celiacs (p < 0.001). IL-7 was also effective in increasing intraepithelial TCR-gammadelta+ (but not CD94+) cells in celiac biopsies (p < 0.001). Gliadin induced intraepithelial migration of CD3+, CD8+ (p < 0.001), and CD94+ (p < 0.05) cells in celiacs, but not in controls. CONCLUSIONS: The results we describe in this report indicate that IL-15 might have a key role in modulating and driving intraepithelial infiltration and ultimately in the pathogenesis of CD.},

Our observation raises the question of an association between DM and celiac disease as part of a continuum, suggesting that celiac disease may be included within the spectrum of the gastrointestinal manifestations of DM and polymyositis (PM). From a practical point of view, our data indicate that the diagnosis of celiac disease should be suspected in PM/DM patients exhibiting malabsorption syndrome. Based on our findings, we further emphasize that an evaluation for celiac disease, including anti-gliadin antibodies, anti-endomysium antibody and tissue trans-glutaminase antibodies should be considered in PM/DM patients presenting with unusual and unexplained gastrointestinal features. This could lead to the early management of such patients, resulting in decreased morbidity (i.e., malnutrition and malignancy) related to misdiagnosed celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease is a gastrointestinal disorder caused by intolerance to cereals due to an immunological mechanism. The intestinal mucosa is damaged, causing a severe malabsorption syndrome. The diagnosis is based on classical clinical features such as diarrhoea and weight loss. However, there is a broad spectrum of this disorder which includes disorders of other organs and systems. In this paper we review the main studies of involvement of the nervous system in coeliac disease. DEVELOPMENT: Studies published to date report a high prevalence of ataxia, headaches and epilepsy, especially associated with bilateral occipital calcifications together with psychological features and psychiatric disorders including behavior change, depression, schizophrenia, autism, and disorders of personality, emotion and family relationships. Problems of learning and cognition are less common. CONCLUSIONS: Many of these processes have only relatively recently been recognized. The pathogenic mechanism of these disorders is not completely clear although biochemical factors such as a low plasma serotonin level may be a cause. Treatment is based on the early recognition of the disorder which is difficult to suspect when there are no gastrointestinal symptoms present and the use of various types of treatment, including a cereal free diet, which is the most effective.},

   abstract = {In the last few decades, the comprehension of epidemiological, pathogenic and clinical aspects of coeliac disease has increasingly improved. Serological screening studies on the general population have shown that the true coeliac disease prevalence in Europe is higher than previously reported. It has become clear that tissue transglutaminase has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease pathogenesis, and there is evidence that substitution of deamidated amino acidic residues at a critical position along the gliadin sequence dramatically increases immunological activation. The toxicity of many gluten epitopes has been investigated, so far, but recent studies have indicated the region 57-75 of alpha gliadin as a possible candidate epitope in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease. However, the wide heterogeneity of gliadin and glutenin molecules complicate any attempts to identify the toxic epitope, and the fascinating idea to produce detoxified grains will represent a great challenge in the near future. From a clinical point of view, there is now evidence of a broad spectrum of gluten conditions. Extra-intestinal signs, i.e., alopecia, unexplained neurological disorders, cryptic hypertransaminasaemia, increased red cell width, frequently constitute the only clinical manifestation at the diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an intestinal malabsorption characterized by intolerance to cereal proteins accompanied by immunological responses to dietary gliadins and tissue transglutaminase, an autoantigen located in the endomysium. Tissue transglutaminase belongs to the family of enzymes that catalyze protein cross-linking reactions and is constitutively expressed in many tissues as well as being activated during apoptosis. The role of gliadins in eliciting the immune response in CD and how transglutaminase is linked to the primary reaction are still unclear. In this work, we report the production and analysis of six phage Ab libraries from the peripheral and intestinal lymphocytes of three CD patients. We were able to isolate Abs to transglutaminase from all intestinal lymphocytes libraries but not from those obtained from peripheral lymphocytes. This is in contrast to Abs against gliadin, which could be obtained from all libraries, indicating that the humoral response against transglutaminase occurs at the local level, whereas that against gliadin occurs both peripherally and centrally. Abs from all three patients recognized the same transglutaminase epitopes with a bias toward the use of the V(H)5 Ab variable region family. The possible role of these anti-transglutaminase Abs in the onset of CD and associated autoimmune pathologies is discussed.},

   abstract = {The mucosal lesion present in coeliac disease is an immune-mediated injury triggered by gliadin and restricted by a particular assortment of major histocompatibility complex genes. In view of this, an immunomodulatory approach that induces tolerance to this antigen appears to be a possible alternative to a strict gluten-free diet in treating coeliac disease. We have shown that intranasal administration of multiple doses of whole gliadin is required to specifically inhibit T helper 1-like T-cell reactivity in BALB/c mice immunized parenterally with whole gliadin. However, T-cell activation to multiple antigens, as a consequence of the chemical complexity shown by the antigen gliadin, could hamper efforts to identify single component(s) useful for tolerance induction. In this study, gliadin fractions were purified and administered intranasally to study their ability to induce tolerance to whole gliadin in our animal model. We found that the alpha fraction was particularly effective in downregulating both the in vitro gliadin-specific T-cell proliferation and interferon-gamma production to whole gliadin. In particular, a purified alpha-gliadin was able to suppress the immune response to the entire gliadin mixture. These results demonstrate how an immune response to a complex antigen may be controlled by treatment with a purified component and specifically indicate alpha-gliadin to be a good candidate for further identification of short peptides to be used as tolerogens in this model.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Refractory sprue is a rare and severe malabsorptive disorder that mimics celiac disease but is refractory to a gluten-free diet and is without initial evidence of overt lymphoma. Treatment is largely empiric and often ineffective, with steroids and immunosuppression being the mainstream therapeutic options. The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the effect of azathioprine on a group of patients diagnosed with refractory sprue. METHODS: We studied seven consecutive patients (five women and two men) with a well-defined diagnosis of refractory sprue and a lack of response to oral or parenteral steroids. At diagnosis, five patients had endoscopic evidence of ulcerative jejunitis, and five underwent exploratory laparotomy for exclusion of malignancies. The characteristic monoclonal TCRgamma gene rearrangement was shown in five of six patients studied. Patients were treated for a mean of 11 months (range 8-12 months), and clinical, biochemical, molecular, and histological parameters were reassessed at the end of the trial. The study was a prospective, open-label, non-placebo-controlled study using azathioprine (2 mg/kg/ day) plus oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). A gluten-free diet (n = 7) as well as enteral (n = 6) and parenteral nutrition (n = 5) were administered during the trial. RESULTS: After treatment, five patients had a complete clinical remission, and biochemical and nutritional parameters were significantly improved. Steroids were tapered after the onset of azathioprine, and no patient was on steroids at the end of the trial. Intestinal histology improved significantly in all cases (normal histology in three cases and minor infiltration in the lamina propria in two). Two patients did not respond to treatment at any time and died in months 10 and 9, of an irreversible ventricular fibrillation and sepsis, respectively. No overt lymphoma was demonstrated during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms earlier anecdotal reports on the efficacy of azathioprine in refractory sprue, with clear clinical and histological improvement shown in most patients. However, monoclonality persisted after treatment. We consider that a larger number of patients should be evaluated before a definitive recommendation is adopted for use of this drug in refractory sprue.},

   abstract = {Oxidants have been shown to be involved in alcohol-induced liver injury. This study was designed to determine whether cocoa flavonoid extract, composed mostly of epicatechin and epicatechin oligomers, protects against early alcohol-induced liver injury in rats. Male Wistar rats were fed high-fat liquid diets with or without ethanol (10-14 g/kg per day) and cocoa extract (400 mg/kg per day) continuously for 4 weeks using an enteral feeding protocol. Mean body weight gains ( approximately 4 g/day) were not significantly different between treatment groups. Cocoa extract did not affect average daily urine ethanol concentrations ( approximately 200mg/dL). After 4 weeks, serum alanine amino transferase levels of the ethanol group were increased nearly fourfold (110+/-16 IU/L) compared to control values (35+/-3 IU/L); this effect of ethanol was blocked by cocoa extract (60+/-6 IU/L). Additionally, enteral ethanol caused severe fat accumulation, mild inflammation, and necrosis in the liver; cocoa extract significantly blunted these changes. Increases in liver TNFalpha protein levels caused by ethanol were completely blocked by cocoa extract. Further, ethanol significantly increased the accumulation of protein adducts of 4-hydroxynonenal, a product of lipid peroxidation serving as an index of oxidative stress; again this was counteracted by the addition of cocoa extract. These results indicate that dietary flavanols such as those found in cocoa can prevent early alcohol-induced liver injury.},

METHODS: Concentrations of transthyretin, retinol binding protein, soluble transferrin receptor, IgA anti-gliadin, and IgA anti-transglutaminase, and titres of IgA anti-endomysial antibody were measured in 36 newly diagnosed adult patients with coeliac disease and duodenal villous atrophy before (T0) and after one year (T1) on a gluten free diet. Duodenal biopsies taken at T0 and T1 were compared and graded as no improvement (no change in initial grade of villous atrophy) or improvement. RESULTS: Twenty two patients showed histological improvement and 14 showed no improvement. Transthyretin values increased in all patients with mucosal improvement and decreased in all patients showing no improvement. However, transthyretin values did not correlate with the degree of villous atrophy at T0 and T1 when assessed separately. Changes in retinol binding protein and soluble transferrin receptor values did not correlate with mucosal improvement. Coeliac disease associated antibodies (to gliadin, endomysium, and transglutaminase) decreased in most patients between T0 and T1, irrespective of mucosal recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Serial but not single measurements of transthyretin may be used as a non-invasive test to monitor mucosal recovery and therefore reduce the need for, or frequency of, follow up biopsies in treated patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Anti-endomysial autoantibodies are very useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) due to their high sensitivity and specificity for that disorder. The recent discovery that the autoantigen responsible for the endomysial pattern is tissue transglutaminase (tTG) has led to the commercial development of automated enzyme immunoassays for quantitation of that autoantibody. These assays are standardized to provide highly accurate and comparable testing between laboratories for anti-tTG autoantibodies. Celiac disease is a common genetic disease in populations of Europe and the United States. It has a spectrum of expression ranging from silent or mild to severe, with resulting malabsorption that produces multiple-organ system effects due to malnutrition. Many cases miss the diagnosis because the symptoms are not classic or the clinical syndrome is not severe. Because the treatment of celiac disease (avoidance of wheat products) is so effective and inexpensive and because celiac disease is so common in selective populations, a highly reliable test for its detection such as anti-tTG should find wide application in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Osteoporosis, common in European and South American adults with celiac disease, has not been reported in those patients with celiac disease residing in North America. We therefore evaluated bone density in a group of patients from the United States. METHODS: Patients (105 women and 23 men) with celiac disease, who had completed a questionnaire and had bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, were evaluated. The patients were an average age of 56 yr old (range 21-83 yr) and had been on a gluten-free diet from 0 months to 46 yr (mean 7.5 yr). RESULTS: Osteoporosis (T score < -2.5) was present in 34% of the patients at the lumbar spine, 27% at the femoral neck, and 36% at the radius. Low bone mass (T score between -1.0 and -2.5) was present in 38% at the lumbar spine, 44% at the femoral neck, and 32% at the radius. When compared to age-matched controls, men were more severely affected than women. BMD did not differ between those on a gluten-free diet and those who had not begun therapy. BMD was remeasured 16 +/- 2 months after beginning a gluten-free diet in 5 patients; it increased by 7.5% at the femoral neck (p < 0.02). In 16 patients who had followed a gluten-free diet for an average of 12 yr, BMD remained stable over an additional 2 yr of observation. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis and low bone mass often affect North American adults with celiac disease, whether or not they are on dietary therapy. Routine screening for osteoporosis is indicated in patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Several attempts have been made to identify accurate screening tests for celiac disease (CD) with the aim to reduce the need for biopsy or obtaining appropriate selection criteria prior to intestinal biopsy. In this context we evaluated the usefulness of screening for endomysial antibodies (EMA) in the diagnosis of CD in children in comparison with CD-related changes detected by ultrasound (US) or biopsy. PATIENTS: We studied 35 children (1-15 years, 22 girls and 13 boys, mean age 8 years) with untreated CD (N = 15), treated CD (N = 10) and controls (N = 10), undergoing small bowel biopsy as a diagnostic procedure. METHODS: US of the small bowel was performed prior to mucosa biopsy using a 4- or 7-MHz transducer of a computed sonography device. The thickness of the intestinal wall and small bowel motility were recorded. Simultaneously, all children had serum routinely sampled for IgA EMA. RESULTS: All controls had histologically normal small bowel mucosa, US showed a small bowel wall thickness of 1 mm with normal motility in 9 children and non-specific wall changes in 1 child. EMA was weakly positive in 1 of these, and negative in all other controls. Of 15 children with untreated CD, severe enteropathy and strongly positive EMA were found in 10 cases; in 5 children moderate enteropathy and positive EMA were detected. Severe US changes were found in all of these children (1.6 mm thickness of the intestinal wall, hyperperistalsis and abundant fluid in the bowel). Mild enteropathy was found in 10 children with treated CD (3 months of a gluten-free diet). EMA was positive in 2 children and weakly positive in 8. Non-specific US changes were found in 6 children. In conclusion, our results indicate that US provides valuable information on small-bowel wall structure and can help in decision making on the necessity of small bowel biopsy. The present study confirms a stronger correlation between EMA and CD than between US and CD.},

Such deficiencies are common in coeliac disease and it may therefore be possible indirectly to assess response to a gluten-free diet by monitoring the RDW. We measured RDW, iron, B12, folate and endomysial antibodies (EMA) in 46 newly diagnosed coeliac patients at diagnosis and after a gluten-free diet. RDW was elevated in 76% of patients at diagnosis. There was a significant decrease in RDW (17.3% vs 13.8%) after 12 months of diet, corresponding to sero-conversion of EMA and normalisation of serum iron, B12 and folate levels. We conclude that monitoring RDW is a simple indirect means of assessing response to a gluten-free diet in coeliac disease.},

Celiac disease is associated with malabsorption and may therefore represent an important risk factor. METHODS: The frequency of symptomatic hypoglycemia in patients with type I diabetes and celiac disease (cases) was compared with those of patients who had diabetes without celiac disease (controls). For this purpose, each case was matched for age, sex, and duration of disease with one to two control patients. Indices of metabolic control (hemoglobin [Hb]A1c, frequency of hypoglycemia, and total insulin requirement) were retrieved for the 18 months before and after diagnosis of celiac disease. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (6 males and 12 females) had diagnosed celiac disease and were matched with 26 control patients (10 males and 16 females). There was no difference in age (11.0 years; range, 1.8-21.9 vs. 13.1 years; range, 2.3-22; P = 0.3) and duration of disease (8.4 years; range, 1.2-19.3 vs. 8.3 years; range, 1.1-18.7; P = 0.3) between the two groups. During the 6 months before and after diagnosis of celiac disease the cases had significantly more hypoglycemic episodes than the controls (means +/- SD; 4.5+/-4 vs. 2.0+/-2.2 episodes/months, P = 0.01). This was reflected by a progressive reduction in insulin requirement over the 12 months before diagnosis reaching a nadir at time 0 (0.6+/-0.2 vs. 0.9+/-0.3, P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that underlying celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of symptomatic hypoglycemia and that the introduction of a gluten-free diet with normalization of the intestinal mucosa may reduce its frequency.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: ZO-1 is a good marker for tight junction integrity which may be damaged in many intestinal diseases. ZO-1 can also accumulate in the cellular nucleus in addition to sites of cell-cell contact, suggesting a potential role in cellular proliferation and differentiation. We evaluated the expression and distribution of ZO-1 in patients with celiac disease before and after a gluten-free diet. METHODS: The ZO-1 expression was evaluated semiquantitatively by means of immunohistochemical analysis in duodenal bioptic specimens of 10 consecutive patients with celiac disease before and after a gluten-free diet and in 10 controls. Furthermore, the nuclear staining was analyzed quantitatively, evaluating 3,000 cells for each count, and it was expressed as a percentage of labeled nuclei over the total of analyzed cells. RESULTS: The intestinal mucosa of untreated celiac disease patients shows a globally lower ZO-1 labeling than that of controls. The expression of ZO-1 in the treated celiac mucosa did not differ significantly from normal intestinal mucosa of healthy subjects. At the crypt level of untreated celiac mucosa, a low intensity of nuclear labeling (1.75 +/- 0.32%) was found, while in both treated celiac disease patients and in normal subjects we observed a statistically significant higher percentage of strongly labeled nuclei (53.72 +/- 6.30% and 56.79 +/- 5.45%, respectively; p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a global underexpression of ZO-1 in the duodenal mucosa of active celiac disease patients. Gluten withdrawal allows a normalization of the ZO-1 expression in treated celiac disease patients. Furthermore, the particular pattern of ZO-1 resembles the cellular distribution in undifferentiated cells and may be the result of immaturity of the enterocytes in untreated celiac sprue.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is caused by a CD4 T helper cell type 1 (Th1) response in the small intestinal mucosa to dietary gluten. As the major Th1 inducing cytokine, interleukin 12, is undetectable in CD gut mucosa, the mechanism by which Th1 effector cells are generated remains unknown. Interferon (IFN) alpha, a cytokine capable of promoting IFN-gamma synthesis, has been implicated in the development of Th1 mediated immune diseases. Here we report a case of CD-like enteropathy in a patient receiving IFN-alpha for chronic myeloid leukaemia. Morphological assessment of duodenal biopsies taken from the patient showed total villous atrophy, crypt cell hyperplasia, and a high number of CD3+ intraepithelial lymphocytes. Both antigliadin antibodies and antiendomysial antibodies were positive. RNA analysis revealed pronounced expression of IFN-gamma. Withdrawal of gluten from the diet resulted in a patchy improvement in intestinal morphology, normalisation of laboratory parameters, and resolution of clinical symptoms. By western blot analysis, IFN-alpha protein was seen in the duodenal mucosa from untreated CD patients but not in controls. This was associated with marked expression of IFN-gamma protein in CD mucosa. Collectively, these results suggest a role for IFN-alpha in promoting Th1 responses to gluten.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common disorder associated with a substantially increased standardized mortality ratio if it is left untreated or if the diagnosis is delayed. Diagnostic sensitivity of serologic testing is improved by the addition of IgG-based testing to standard IgA-based serologic testing for endomysial or transglutaminase autoantibodies. The role of intestinal permeability testing as an additional tool for screening and for monitoring the response to a gluten-free diet is discussed. The importance of diagnosing celiac disease in two clinical situations is considered: first, before immune-stimulating therapy with interferon for viral hepatitis is begun and second, in pregnancy when not only maternal but also paternal celiac disease may affect fetal outcome. The strong genetic component of the etiology of celiac disease is illustrated by a monozygotic twin concordance of nearly 90%, with susceptibility conveyed by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes DQ2 or DQ8 and one or more non-HLA genes. Progress toward identifying these genes from large linkage and association studies is reviewed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Because osteopenia is a frequent complication of celiac disease, we evaluated the impact of a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD), initiated during childhood, on bone density. study design: Patients with celiac disease (n = 19; mean age, 14.2 +/- 2.6 years) were studied after 4.3 +/- 0.6 years of GFD. Bone density had been measured at diagnosis and after 1 year of GFD. We also studied 211 healthy children as a control group. Bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) levels were measured in serum, and N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) was measured in urine. RESULTS: Although at diagnosis bone mineral content, bone area, and bone mineral density were significantly lower than in control subjects, the 3 measurements were normal after GFD. None of the patients on a GFD showed elevated values of PTH. Patients on a GFD had BALP (110.2 +/- 67.2 U/L) and NTx levels (261.9 +/- 187.8 nmol bone collagen equivalents/mmol creatinine) that were significantly higher than those of control subjects. The levels of BALP and NTx were significantly higher in patients with good compliance with the GFD, compared with patients with poorer compliance. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that bone mineral content, bone area, and bone mineral density improve significantly with a GFD.},

These elements regress completely in a sequential way under a prolonged strict gluten-free diet. The progress registered in the understanding of this affection depends on the individualization of the atypical forms (delayed isolated stature, constipation...) of asymptomatic forms thanks to the study of specific antibodies (anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium, and more recently anti-transglutaminase). The auto-immune nature of coeliac disease is well established. The diagnostic criteria are simplified allowing the commencement of a gluten-free diet which must be perfectly detailed. Finally, allergy to wheat flour merits individualization in the framework of coeliac disease (cf. article).},

   abstract = {Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is a rare diagnosis made after the exclusion of any disorder mimicking CD and after initial or subsequent failure of a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) to restore normal intestinal architecture. In the past, treatments such as steroids, cyclosporin and azathioprine have been tried, but literature on this subject consists mainly of case reports. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) may be beneficial in RCD because of its inhibitory effect on T-lymphocyte- and monocyte-driven immune responses. We performed a pilot, non-randomized, open label study to evaluate recombinant human IL-10 in RCD. IL-10 (8 mcg/kg) was administered subcutaneously, three times a week for 3 months in 10 RCD patients. Small bowel biopsies were taken at T = 0, T = 3 months and T = 9 months. The mucosal histopathology at 3 months was the primary end point for evaluation of efficacy. Evaluations of clinical features, malabsorption parameters and safety were made prior to, during and after treatment. Before treatment, all RCD patients had partial to total villous atrophy (Marsh III ABC). Two patients dropped out of the study: one because of headaches, the other because of thrombocytopenia. In the remaining eight patients, after 3 months of IL-10 treatment histology was unchanged in five patients, improved in two patients and deteriorated in one patient. Disappearance of villous atrophy was seen in only one patient. Three patients reported a clinical response, i.e. relief of fatigue, abdominal complaints and diarrhoea. After stopping IL-10 treatment the symptoms recurred. The laboratory parameters remained the same during treatment and in follow-up. In conclusion, in our study group of 10 RCD patients, IL-10 in the given dosage was not overall effective in our study group of RCD patients. Two dropped out because of side effects and in only one patient did we see a normalization of villous architecture.},

   abstract = {Lymphocytic gastritis, first described by Haot et al. in 1986, is a very rare form of gastritis (0.8-1.6% of cases) with unclear pathogenesis. On endoscopy, lymphocytic gastritis may present either a normal appearance, such as gastritis varioliformis with multiple elevated chronic erosions in the corpus and fundus, or as a giant fold gastritis in the corpus and fundus. This type of gastritis is diagnosed histologically based on an accumulation of intraepithelial lymphocytes (more than 25/100 epithelial cells) in the surface cells of the gastric mucosa. Its etiopathogenesis is currently thought to be a sprue-associated reaction or an atypical reaction to Helicobacter pylori infection. Some studies report the lymphocytic gastritis in almost 45% of cases of sprue, with the gastritis regressing in response to a gluten-free diet, while others report a correlation of lymphocytic gastritis with serologically and/or histologically confirmed H. pylori infection, with the lymphocytic gastritis being cured by H. pylori eradication treatment in a high percentage of the cases. It is possible that a similar abnormal immune reaction to an inflammatory agent underlies both pathological entities, sprue and lymphocytic gastritis--in the one case gluten and in the other H. pylori--which would mean that sprue-induced and H. pylori-induced forms of lymphocytic gastritis exist side by side.},

The lactose H2 breath test is a non-invasive technique for detecting lactose malabsorption, and this may occur in untreated coeliac disease. The utility of this test was investigated in objectively confirming a response to gluten exclusion. The study included 44 children from 0.9 to 14.75 y of age (median 3.2) with coeliac disease. Five children were asymptomatic, being identified through coeliac antibody screening. Breath tests were performed prior to dietary treatment. If positive, they were repeated at 4-wk intervals following gluten exclusion. Overall, 21/44 (48%) children had positive breath tests at presentation. In 18/21 children on a gluten-free diet, this became negative after 4 wk (86%) and in all the children by 8 wk. In two children with positive tests at 4 wk, problems with dietary adherence were identified. A positive test before treatment was not associated with significant differences in individual symptoms, height, weight and body mass index standard deviation scores, serum haemoglobin or albumin. However, no positive results were found in the asymptomatic patients (p = 0.05). Lactose malabsorption was associated with earlier age of presentation (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: The lactose H2 breath test objectively confirms a response to gluten exclusion. In selected cases it can help confirm a diagnosis of coeliac disease. However, the test tends to be less informative in asymptomatic patients, and in older children.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Since the advent of serologic testing for celiac disease, most persons who receive a diagnosis of celiac disease have few or no symptoms. Although pathologic changes of celiac disease resolve on a gluten-free diet, how a gluten-free diet affects the quality of life for patients with screen-detected celiac disease is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a gluten-free diet on the quality of life of patients with screen-detected celiac disease. DESIGN: Prospective study of patients before and 1 year after initiating a gluten-free diet. PARTICIPANTS: 19 patients with screen-detected celiac disease (found by serologically testing first-degree relatives of celiac patients) and 21 consecutive patients with symptom-detected disease. In all cases, celiac diagnosis was confirmed by finding villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia on small-bowel biopsy. INTERVENTION: Gluten-free diet (explained during a single physician visit). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS), in which scores range from 0 to 6 (higher scores represent worse symptoms); and quality of life measured with the Psychological General Well-Being Questionnaire (PGWB). Scores range from 22 to 132 (higher scores mean greater well-being). RESULTS: At baseline, patients with symptom-detected celiac disease had poorer quality of life and more gastrointestinal symptoms than those with screen-detected celiac disease. Reported compliance with the gluten-free diet was good. All mucosal lesions of the small bowel had resolved at the follow-up biopsy. After 1 year of following the diet, quality of life for patients with screen-detected disease significantly improved (mean PGWB score increased from 108 to 114; P <0.01). A similar increase was noted in patients with symptom-detected disease (mean PGWB score increased from 92 to 103; P <0.01). Gastrointestinal symptoms also improved in patients with screen-detected disease and in patients with symptom-detected disease (mean GSRS scores decreased from 1.8 to 1.4 and from 2.6 to 1.9, respectively; P <0.01 for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-free diet was associated with improved quality of life for patients with symptom-detected celiac disease and patients with screen-detected celiac disease. Concerns about the burden of a gluten-free diet, at least over the short term, may be unfounded.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease patients display IgA antibody reactivity to wheat as well as to human proteins. We used serum IgA from celiac patients and, for control purposes, from patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and from healthy individuals to identify celiac disease-specific IgA autoantigens in nitrocellulose-blotted extracts from various human cell types (epithelial, endothelial, intestinal cells, fibroblasts). The pattern, recognition intensity and time course of IgA autoreactivity was monitored using serial serum samples obtained from celiac children before and under gluten-free diet. By immunoblot inhibition and subcellular (cytosolic, nuclear) cell fractionation we identified a 55 kDa nuclear autoantigen expressed in intestinal, endothelial cells and in fibroblasts which was recognized by IgA antibodies of approximately half of the celiac disease patients and cross-reacted with wheat proteins. IgA reactivity to the 55 kDa autoantigen disappeared during gluten-free diet and was inhibited after pre-absorption of sera with wheat proteins but not with tissue transglutaminase, previously reported as the unique celiac disease-specific autoantigen. In conclusion, we defined a novel 55 kDa celiac disease-specific nuclear IgA autoantigen which shares epitopes with wheat proteins and which is different from tissue transglutaminase and calreticulin. Although the newly defined autoantigen was recognized much less frequently than tissue transglutaminase, our data suggest molecular mimicry between wheat and human proteins as a possible pathomechanism for the induction and/or maintenance of mucosal tissue damage in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Gluten-sensitive enteropathy or, as it is more commonly called, celiac disease, is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the small intestine that is precipitated by the ingestion of gluten, a component of wheat protein, in genetically susceptible persons. Exclusion of dietary gluten results in healing of the mucosa, resolution of the malabsorptive state, and reversal of most, if not all, effects of celiac disease. Recent studies in the United States suggest that the prevalence of celiac disease is approximately one case per 250 persons. Gluten-sensitive enteropathy commonly manifests as "silent" celiac disease (i.e., minimal or no symptoms). Serologic tests for antibodies against endomysium, transglutaminase, and gliadin identify most patients with the disease. Serologic testing should be considered in patients who are at increased genetic risk for gluten-sensitive enteropathy (i.e., family history of celiac disease or personal history of type I diabetes) and in patients who have chronic diarrhea, unexplained anemia, chronic fatigue, or unexplained weight loss. Early diagnosis and management are important to forestall serious consequences of malabsorption, such as osteoporosis and anemia.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease caused by sensitivity to the dietary protein gluten. It has a prevalence of 1 in 250 in the United States. Multiple-case families are common with a risk to siblings from 10-12%. Previous linkage studies have found no significant evidence for linkage other than to HLA. In this study, we performed a genome-wide search on 62 families with at least two cases of CD to identify non-HLA loci for CD. Two-point and multipoint parametric and nonparametric analyses were performed on the entire set of families and on sets stratified by the HLA genotype. Accounting for multiple testing, we found genome-wide intermediate linkage evidence at 18q (heterogeneity LOD (HLOD) = 3.6) and at 3p (HLOD = 3.2) and suggestive evidence at 5p (HLOD = 2.7). Good consensus between two-point and multipoint evidence was not found, and after genotyping with new markers in these regions, our results were inconclusive. The 18q region had intermediate two-point evidence, but weak multipoint evidence. At 3p and 5p, the addition of follow-up markers added flanking support, yet multipoint evidence was still lacking. Our results indicate that multipoint analyses may be hindered by the complexity of CD. Multipoint analyses are not robust to model misspecification, and further development of models is needed. Additional study of these and other families is necessary to validate or rule out the regions implicated in this study.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In active coeliac disease, mucosal atrophy is associated with a marked decrease in intestinal disaccharidase enzyme activities. We investigated the value of duodenal mucosal disaccharidases to predict the severity of mucosal villous atrophy and its recovery in 50 patients with coeliac disease. METHODS: Duodenal mucosal histology and disaccharidase activities were studied at least twice with a mean interval of 9 months. Histology of specimens from all patients was examined by the same pathologist blinded to the data on disaccharidase activities. Mucosal damage was scored into four groups as follows: Grade 0 = normal mucosa; grade I = slight villous atrophy, that is, cryptic component 30%-50%; grade 2 = moderate villous atrophy, that is, cryptic component 50%-90%; grade 3 = severe villous atrophy, that is, cryptic component >90%. The enzyme activities of the disaccharidases were determined as U/g protein. RESULTS: Duodenal mucosal disaccharidase activities were good predictors of the grade of mucosal villous atrophy. Positive predictive values for moderate or severe villous atrophy were 90% for maltase (maltase activity <150 U/g protein), 86% for sucrase (<40 U/g protein) and 71% for lactase (<20 U/g protein). Accordingly, negative predictive values, that is, none or only minimal villous atrophy (grades 0 or 1) with normal disaccharidase activities, were 71% for maltase, 70% for sucrase and 63% for lactase. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in duodenal disaccharidase activities correlated with recovery of the mucosa based on histology. Besides the histological examination, measurement of disaccharidase activities offers an additional tool to evaluate response to a gluten-free diet in patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We tested the hypothesis that silent coeliac disease is more frequent than expected in both patients with Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and their first-degree relatives. We evaluated how the presence of other autoimmune disorders in diabetic patients and their first-degree relatives is related to silent, unrecognized coeliac disease. METHODS: Sera from 491 subjects with Type I diabetes, 824 relatives and 4,000 healthy control subjects were screened for anti-endomysial antibodies and all those subjects who tested positive for anti-endomysial antibodies underwent intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: We found that the prevalence of coeliac disease was 5.7 % among the diabetic patients and 1.9 % among the relatives, values significantly higher than those found among the control subjects (p < 0.0001; p < 0.001). The prevalence of autoimmune disorders in diabetic patients with coeliac disease was significantly higher than in subjects with Type I diabetes alone (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of autoimmune disorders in the relatives with coeliac disease was significantly higher than in those who tested negative for anti-endomysial antibodies (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: This report provides further confirmation of the high prevalence of undiagnosed coeliac disease among diabetic patients and their relatives. This interesting new finding is the increased presence of other autoimmune diseases in these patients, as well as in their relatives with a delayed diagnosis for coeliac disease. Patients newly diagnosed with coeliac disease showed excellent compliance with the gluten-free diet. This should encourage policymakers to consider introducing an easy-to-use screening programme for diabetic patients and their relatives into everyday clinical practice, in order to prevent coeliac-associated symptoms and the onset of additional, more serious auto-immune disorders.},

In genetically predisposed individuals, the infiltrating cells are activated by gluten, gliadin and their proteolytic fragments and produce chemokines, cytokines and reactive radicals. The sequence of one of the macrophage-stimulatory gliadin peptic fragment was determined by mass spectrometry (MS) as VSFQQPQQQYPSSQ. The role of tissue transglutaminase (tTG) in innate immunity stimulation was studied by mass spectrometric monitoring of sequence changes in this active peptide. Two sites of glutamine deamidation in this peptide were localized by high-resolution scanning in MS/MS mode in an ion trap. A single deamidation in the parent peptide led to the complete loss of its stimulatory effect on macrophages.},

   abstract = {There is increasing evidence that proinflammatory cytokines contribute to many of the small intestinal features in coeliac disease. The aim of the study was to investigate the expression of two proinflammatory cytokines, migration inhibition factor (MIF) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in duodenal biopsy specimens from patients with coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet and normal control subjects. A flow cytometric system was used to analyse intracellular protein levels of MIF and TNF-alpha in freshly isolated cells from duodenal biopsies taken from 12 patients with treated coeliac disease and 10 healthy control subjects. From the biopsy specimens, single cell suspensions of the epithelium and lamina propria were prepared using EDTA/DTT and enzymes. Intracellular cytokine expression was studied in intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), lamina propria T cells (LP T) and intestinal epithelial cells using different surface labelling antibodies. MIF protein was constitutively expressed in IELs, LP T cells and epithelial cells from normal intestinal mucosa. In contrast, although TNF-alpha was found in LP T cells, this cytokine was virtually undetectable in either IELs or epithelial cells. In coeliac disease, intracellular levels of MIF were significantly higher in epithelial cells compared with control subjects (P = 0.005). Raised levels of TNF-alpha were found in epithelial cells (P = 0.03) as well as IELs (P = 0.045) from coeliac patients compared with controls. The findings from this study show up-regulated expression of MIF and TNF-alpha in IELs and epithelial cells of histologically normal mucosa in patients with coeliac disease. Increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines in cells occupying the epithelial layer could help explain the rapidity with which the coeliac mucosa may respond to gluten challenge.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Previous reports have linked irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) etiologically with various forms of mucosal inflammation, including infectious enterocolitides and inflammatory bowel disease. The mechanism is uncertain but may involve sensitization by inflammatory mediators. The enteropathy of celiac disease has theoretical advantages as a study model because it can be controlled with dietary gluten exclusion; however, whether it also predisposes to functional bowel disorders is unclear. Therefore, we assessed the prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in adult celiac patients and correlated this with dietary compliance with gluten exclusion. METHODS: Adult patients (n = 150; 106 women and 44 men) with confirmed celiac disease were randomly selected from a computerized database of >350 patients, and were asked to complete a bowel questionnaire and the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). The control group (n = 162; 133 women and 29 men) had no history of celiac disease and had similar mean age and sex profile. RESULTS: Of 150 celiac patients reviewed, 30 of 150 (20%) fulfilled the Rome criteria compared with eight of 162 (5%) ontrols. Of the celiac patients 10 of 46 (22%) had partial or no compliance with a gluten-free diet, whereas 20 of 104 patients (19%) adhered to the diet; this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Celiac patients with IBS-type symptoms had a markedly lower quality of life than those without, all eight domains being impaired to a clinically significant extent. Dietary gluten exclusion improved QOL in four of eight scales measured. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that mucosal inflammation in celiac disease may have a sensitizing effect or may predispose to IBS-type symptoms is supported by these results. Failure to attain optimal subjective well-being is common in celiac patients, particularly in those with coexisting IBS. Compliance with a gluten-free diet confers some benefit.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Antibodies that detect coeliac-toxic prolamins from wheat, barley and rye are important tools for controlling the diet of coeliac disease patients. Recently, a monoclonal antibody R5 that recognizes wheat gliadin, barley hordein and rye secalin equally was described. In this study, the epitope recognized by R5 was investigated. METHODS: Both a phage-displayed heptapeptide library and overlapping peptides spanning the sequence of alpha- and gamma-type gliadins (pepscan) were screened for binding of R5. RESULTS: Both techniques yielded comparable pentapeptide consensus sequences (phage display QXPW/FP; pepscan QQPFP). According to recent observations, this peptide stretch may be of key importance in the pathogenicity of coeliac disease. This sequence occurs repetitively in prolamins (in gamma- and omega-type prolamins more frequently than in alpha-type prolamins) together with several homologous peptide stretches, which are recognized less strongly. CONCLUSIONS: R5 seems to be a good candidate for the specific detection of putative coeliac disease-active sequences in prolamins and thus represents a valuable tool for the quality control of gluten-free food.},

   abstract = {Celiac Sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an inheritable human disease of the small intestine that is triggered by the dietary intake of gluten. Recently, several Pro- and Gln-rich peptide sequences (most notably PQPQLPY and analogs) have been identified from gluten with potent immunogenic activity toward CD4(+) T cells from small intestinal biopsies of Celiac Sprue patients. These peptides have three unusual properties. First, they are relatively stable toward further proteolysis by gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal enzymes. Second, they are recognized and deamidated by human tissue transglutaminase (tTGase) with high selectivity. Third, tTGase-catalyzed deamidation enhances their affinity for HLA-DQ2, the disease-specific class II major histocompatibility complex heterodimer. In an attempt to seek a mechanistic explanation for these properties, we undertook secondary structural studies on PQPQLPY and its analogs. Circular dichroism studies on a series of monomeric and dimeric analogs revealed a strong polyproline II helical propensity in a subset of them. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis confirmed a polyproline II conformation of PQPQLPY, and was also used to elucidate the secondary structure of the most helical variant, (D-P)QPQLPY. Remarkably, a strong correlation was observed between polyproline II content of naturally occurring gluten peptides and the specificity of human tTGase toward these substrates. Analogs with up to two D-amino acid residues retained both polyproline II helical content and transglutaminase affinity. Since the Michaelis constant (K(m)) is the principal determinant of tTGase specificity for naturally occurring gluten peptides and their analogs, our results suggest that the tTGase binding site may have a preference for polyproline II helical substrates. If so, these insights could be exploited for the design of selective small molecule inhibitors of this pharmacologically important enzyme.},

The diagnosis of villous atrophy relies on an intestinal biopsy which necessitates a perfect histological technique to assert the villous atrophy and its degree. The most frequent etiology is coeliac disease. Villous atrophy regresses with gluten free diet. The failure of a strict gluten free diet implies to exclude a refractory sprue thought to be the earliest form of enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma. The other etiologies of villous atrophy are unusual and could be observed in alpha chain disease, inflammatory and infectious diseases, immune disorders, and primitive ileal villous atrophy. Other etiologies characterize villous atrophy in children as cow milk allergy and epithelial abnormalities.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To determine bone mass using quantitative phalangeal bone ultrasound in young coeliac patients after a long-term gluten-free diet. SUBJECTS: A total of 99 patients with coeliac disease (CD) (52 girls, mean age 15.5 +/- 9.7 years; 47 boys, mean age 14.4 +/- 8.4 years) and 44 healthy subjects matched for age, weight and height (26 girls, mean age 18.4 +/- 9.9 years; 18 boys, mean age 16.3 +/- 11.2 years) were included in the study. METHODS: Bone status was assessed using an ultrasound device that measures amplitude-dependent speed of sound (Ad-SoS) in metres per second. Measurements were made on the phalanges (II-V) of the non-dominant hand, and an average value was computed. Nutrient intake was assessed using a 7-day record. RESULTS: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the unpaired t-test showed that the intake of phosphates (P < 0.05), proteins, fat and carbohydrates (P < 0.005 in all) was higher in patients than in controls. No significant difference in Ad-SoS was found between patients and controls (95% CI -10.9 to 60.6) in the overall group, in girls or boys, or in patients following a gluten-free diet strictly or partially. In the patients, only age (beta 4.01, 95% CI 1.84-6.16, P < 0.0005) and weight (beta 2.62, 95% CI 1.53-3.70, P < 0.0001) showed a significant positive relation with Ad-SoS. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CD, gluten-free diet and increased nutritional intake were accompanied by normal bone mass values as determined by ultrasound on phalanges.},

   abstract = {A variety of neurological disorders have been reported in association with coeliac disease including epilepsy, ataxia, neuropathy, and myelopathy. The nature of this association is unclear and whether a specific neurological complication occurs in coeliac disease remains unproved. Malabsorption may lead to vitamin and trace element deficiencies. Therefore, patients who develop neurological dysfunction should be carefully screened for these. However, malabsorption does not satisfactorily explain the pathophysiology and clinical course of many of the associated neurological disorders. Other mechanisms proposed include altered autoimmunity, heredity, and gluten toxicity. This review attempts to summarise the literature and suggests directions for future research.},

The pathogenic mechanism of coeliac disease, and the role that alpha-gliadin specific T cells play in mucosal lesions and their involvement in peripheral blood is not yet explained at all. Previous studies have reported proliferative response to alpha-gliadin measured with the classic assay of 3HTdR incorporation. We analysed the activation antigen CD69 on T cells from CD patients and normal individuals following stimulation with alpha-gliadin and different antigens (tetanus toxoid, peptides unrelated to gliadin and PHA). CD69 coexpression with T cell CD3+ and proliferation marker Ki67 was evaluated with time. CD69 coexpression with T cell CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ was also evaluated. It was found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of coeliac patients increased their percentage of CD69 positive T cells when stimulated with alpha-gliadin, in comparison with cells from controls. Significant T cell activation was found only in subjects not treated with the gluten free diet; a positive response was found also in two coeliac patients with selective IgA deficiency, anti-endomisium negative, without circulating IgA anti alpha-gliadin or anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. The CD69 expression after stimulation was compared with the standard method of 3HTdR incorporation. Our data show that CD69 expression is useful to asses a specific T cell response to alpha-gliadin in coeliac disease. in a very short time. Moreover, the method allows to investigate T cell response at the lymphocyte subsets level, which represents a useful tool in the diagnosis of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the duration of breast-feeding and the age at the first gluten introduction into the infant diet and the incidence and age at onset of celiac disease. METHODS: In a case-control study, 143 children with celiac disease and 137 randomly recruited gender- and age-matched control children were administered a standardized questionnaire. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (OR) as estimates of the relative risk and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: The risk of developing celiac disease decreased significantly by 63% for children breast-fed for more than 2 months (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.64) as compared with children breast-fed for 2 months or less. The age at first gluten introduction had no significant influence on the incidence of celiac disease (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.29-1.79 comparing first gluten introduction into infant diet >3 months vs. < or =3 months). CONCLUSIONS: A significant protective effect on the incidence of celiac disease was suggested by the duration of breast-feeding (partial breast-feeding as well as exclusive breast-feeding). The data did not support an influence of the age at first dietary gluten exposure on the incidence of celiac disease. However, the age at first gluten exposure appeared to affect the age at onset of symptoms.},

Patients present with abdominal pain, weight loss, pancreatic calcifications, and glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus. Etiologies include a protein-calorie malnourished state, a variety of exogenous food toxins, pancreatic duct anomalies, and a possible genetic predisposition. Chronic cyanide exposure from the diet may contribute to this disease, seen often in India, Asia, and Africa. The pancreatic duct of these patients often is markedly dilated, and may contain stones, with or without strictures. The risk of ductal carcinoma with this disease is accentuated. Treatment may be frustrating, and may include pancreatic enzymes, duct manipulations at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, octreotide, celiac axis blocks for pain control, or surgery via drainage and/or resection.},

Thus, for example, diet is of decisive importance in celiac disease and lactose intolerance. In contrast, dietary measures are ineffective in the treatment of gallstones, and uncertain as a prophylactic measure against biliary colic. While dietetic measures are an important temporary measure in acute pancreatitis, in chronic pancreatitis such an approach is often not complied with, since it includes abstinence from alcohol. In chronic inflammatory bowel disease, diet can ameliorate a number of complications, although it leaves the pathological process itself unaffected. High-fiber diet is, for the most part, ineffective in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The present article discusses the benefits of dietary measures in a number of gastroenterological disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It was recently shown that antiendomysial antibodies (EMAs), which are highly sensitive and specific for celiac disease, are produced by intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, EMAs were detected previously in supernatant fluid from cultured duodenal mucosa specimens collected from untreated celiac disease patients and in culture media of biopsy specimens collected from treated celiac disease patients after an in vitro challenge with gliadin. Moreover, it was recently shown in vivo that oats are not toxic to celiac disease patients, suggesting the safety of oats in a gluten free-diet. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to better define the controversial role of oats in celiac disease to determine whether oats can be safely included in a gluten-free diet. DESIGN: We used an in vitro model to test whether oats induce EMA production in supernatant fluid from cultured duodenal mucosa specimens collected from 13 treated celiac disease patients. The biopsy specimens were cultured with and without peptic-tryptic digest (PT) of gliadin and avenin (from oats) and in medium alone. Samples from 5 of the 13 patients were cultured with the C fraction of PT-avenin. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to detect EMAs. RESULTS: EMAs were detected in specimens from all 13 patients after the challenge with gliadin but not after culture in medium alone. By contrast, no EMAs were detected in any of the specimens cultured with PT-avenin and its C fraction. CONCLUSIONS: Because the in vitro challenge with PT-avenin and its C fraction did not induce EMA production in treated celiac disease patients, it appears that oats have no harmful effect on celiac disease. Therefore, oats can be safely included in a gluten-free diet.},

This finding can be considered an in vitro evidence that intestinal mucosa is a site of EMA production. To confirm this finding, we investigated the presence of EMAs and of anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG), recently identified as the autoantigen of the EMA, in fecal supernatants of CD patients. METHODS: Twenty-one newly diagnosed CD patients, 10 treated CD patients on a gluten-free diet, and 14 control disease patients on a gluten-containing diet were enrolled. Twenty-four-hour stool collections and fecal supernatants were obtained from all patients in the study. Biopsy cultures were also performed. IgA EMAs were detected in sera, culture media, and fecal supernatants. IgA, IgG, IgM, and IgE anti-gliadin antibodies (AGAs) and IgA anti-tTG antibodies were measured in fecal supernatants. The weights, water content, and pHs of the 24-h stool collections were also measured. RESULTS: In all untreated CD patients EMAs were detectable in sera, culture media, and fecal supernatants. In treated CD patients, EMAs were detected only in culture media after in vitro gliadin challenge. No EMAs were detected in controls. Anti-tTG levels were higher in untreated CD patients than in treated CD patients and controls. IgA AGA levels were higher in untreated CD patients than in treated CD and control patients, whereas IgM AGAs were higher in both untreated and treated CD patients than in controls. No statistically significant differences were observed for IgG and IgE AGAs among the above-mentioned populations. Fecal weights, water content, and pHs were higher in untreated CD than in control patients. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of EMAs in fecal supernatants represents the in vivo proof that intestinal mucosa is a site of EMA production. Furthermore, EMA detection in the stools could be a simple and useful additional tool to clarify diagnosis in the patchy conditions of CD.},

Attention was initially directed to antigliadin antibodies, then to IgA antiendomysial antibodies (IgA-EMA). IgG1-EMA have been found in patients with CD with IgA-EMA-negative results. The presence of IgA- and IgG1-EMA was investigated in 36 patients with IgA nephropathy, 15 patients with other primary glomerulonephritis, and 15 patients with lupus nephritis. IgA-EMA and IgG1-EMA were detected by indirect immunofluorescence analysis. At the time of renal biopsy, the following factors were evaluated: history of macroscopic hematuria, serum creatinine level, urinalysis, 24-hour proteinuria, blood pressure, and histological classification of IgA nephropathy. Sixteen of 36 patients with IgA nephropathy (44.4%) showed EMA positivity. Among patients with positive EMA, 12 patients (75%) were IgG1-EMA positive, 2 patients (12.5%) were IgA-EMA positive, and 2 patients (12.5%) were positive for both isotypes. No significant differences were observed between the two groups (EMA positive versus EMA negative) concerning age, serum creatinine level, macroscopic hematuria, blood pressure, 24-hour proteinuria, or degree of renal histological involvement. IgA- and IgG1-EMA were not detected in patients with other primary nephropathies or lupus nephritis. These results, based on the finding of IgG1-EMA, suggest a common pathogenetic pathway for CD and IgA nephropathy. On this basis, the presence of IgG1-EMA and/or IgA-EMA should be investigated in patients with IgA nephropathy. Furthermore, the role of a gluten-free diet in the natural history of IgA nephropathy, at least in EMA-positive patients, needs to be ascertained.},

   abstract = {Celiac Sprue is an HLA DQ2 (or DQ8)-associated autoimmune disorder of the human small intestine that is induced by dietary exposure to wheat gliadin and related proteins from barley, rye, and possibly other food grains. Recently, tissue transglutaminase (tTGase)-catalyzed deamidation of gliadin peptides has been shown to increase their potency for activating patient-derived, gliadin-specific T cells, suggesting that tTGase plays a causative role in the onset of an inflammatory response to toxic food grains. To dissect the molecular recognition features of tTGase for gluten derived peptides, the regioselectivity and steady-state kinetics of tTGase-catalyzed deamidation of known immunogenic peptides were investigated. The specificity of recombinant human tTGase for all immunogenic peptides tested was comparable to and, in some cases, appreciably higher than the specificity for its natural substrate. Although each peptide was glutamine-rich, tTGase exhibited a high degree of regioselectivity for a particular glutamine residue in each peptide. This selectivity correlated well with Q --> E substitutions that have earlier been shown to enhance the immunogenicity of the corresponding gliadin peptides. The specificity of tTGase toward homologues of PQPQLPY, a sequence motif found in immunodominant gliadin peptides, was analyzed in detail. Remarkably, the primary amino acid sequences of wheat-, rye-, and barley-derived proteins included many single-residue variants of this sequence that were high-affinity substrates of tTGase, whereas the closest homologues of this sequence found in rice, corn, or oat proteins were much poorer substrates of tTGase. (Rice, corn, and oats are nontoxic ingredients of the Celiac diet.) No consensus sequence for a high-affinity substrate of tTGase could be derived from our data, suggesting that the secondary structures of these food-grain peptides were important in their recognition by tTGase. Finally, under steady-state turnover conditions, a significant fraction of the tTGase active site was covalently bound to a representative high-affinity immunogenic gliadin peptide, suggesting a common mechanism by which cells responsible for immune surveillance of the intestinal tract recognize and generate an antibody response against both gliadin and tTGase. In addition to providing a quantitative framework for understanding the role of tTGase in Celiac Sprue, our results lay the groundwork for the design of small molecule mimetics of gliadin peptides as selective inhibitors of tTGase.},

INVESTIGATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS: The work-up yielded iron deficiency anemia, monoclonal gammopathy (IgG kappa) and elevated polyclonal IgA due to Gliadin- and endomysium-antibodies. Duodenal mucosa biopsies showed villous atrophy and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. Celiac disease was diagnosed. Unexpectedly, mediastinal lymphomas were found and the concomitant diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease was made. TREATMENT AND COURSE: On gluten free diet all symptoms of malabsorption resolved. Therapy for the Hodgkin lymphoma with chemotherapy was initiated. As Bleomycin associated lung disease occurred during therapy, radiotherapy was not administered. A complete remission could be achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The association of celiac disease and malignancy is well known. The pathogenesis is not fully understood, but a correlation between the duration of gluten exposure and the rate of malignancy was found. Thus, the chronic immunologic stimulation might also have contributed to the development of Hodgkin's disease in our patient, which to date has been reported only anecdotally.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a developing country, many conditions other then celiac disease (CD) can give rise to villous atrophy. We therefore assessed the role of immunoglobulin A (IgA)-antigliadin antibody (AGA) in addition to the ESPGHAN criteria in the diagnosis of CD in 104 Indian children. METHODS: Consecutive children with suspected CD were evaluated over 3 years with an intention to diagnose CD. Complete hemogram, d-xylose absorption test, endoscopic duodenal biopsy, and IgA-AGA titers were performed in all. CD was diagnosed on the basis of modified ESPGHAN criteria irrespective of IgA-AGA positivity (>5 U/mL), and those diagnosed were put on gluten-free diet and were monitored regularly. Children with suspected CD who had a normal duodenal biopsy result were taken as controls. RESULTS: The mean age of 50 children with CD was 6.3 +/- 2.6 years, with a male to female ratio of 3:2. The mean duration of symptoms was 3.4 +/- 2.2 years. Predominant symptoms were pallor in 96%, failure to thrive in 92%, and diarrhea in 80%. On follow-up (19.6 +/- 8 months), symptoms subsided within 16 +/- 9.8 days, and patients showed significant weight gain (mean weight at diagnoses and at last follow-up visit were 66% and 86% of expected, respectively; P < 0.001) and height gain (mean height at diagnoses and at last follow-up visit were 88% and 94% of expected, respectively; P = nonsignificant). The control group comprised 47 children with a mean age of 6.9 +/- 3 years. On comparing CD with controls, diarrhea, anemia, low weight, and stunting were significantly (P < 0.001) more frequent in patients with CD. Sensitivity and specificity of AGA at a cutoff value of 5 U/mL were 94% and 91.5% and at 10 U/mL 88% and 100%, respectively. Follow-up AGA test was performed in 42 of 47 positive cases. All showed significant decrease in AGA titer, and 29 (70%) had a negative test result. CONCLUSIONS: Indian children with CD are true cases of CD. They present late, diarrhea is absent in 20% of cases, and AGA test results show 88% of children without false-positive results at a cutoff value of 10 U/mL. However, AGA test with 94% sensitivity at a cutoff value of 5 U/mL can be used as screening test to select suspected cases for further workup.},

CASE: A 43-year-old woman complaining of chronic abdominal and pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, diarrhea, and a 5-kg weight loss during the last 6 months was referred to our institution. Laboratory and clinical examinations were negative. At laparoscopy, numerous small leiomyomata were seen. A few filmy adhesions between the small bowel and the abdominal wall were lysed. With the exception of deep dyspareunia, all symptoms remitted after surgery, only to recur at 6 months of follow-up. A diagnostic work-up for celiac disease revealed the presence of antigliadin and antiendomysial antibodies. The diagnosis was confirmed at gastroduodenoscopy including biopsy. A gluten-free diet was prescribed, and the patient is now free of symptoms. CONCLUSION: Celiac disease should be considered in women presenting with unexplained chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and deep dyspareunia.},

There are several case reports of coexistence of coeliac sprue and depression, schizophrenia and anxiety. Views on association between coeliac disease and psychiatric disturbances and results of the most important studies are discussed. Biological background is referred. Malabsorption and deficiency of aminoacids and vitamins implicate reduction of synthesis of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Psychiatric symptoms could also be linked to immunological disregulation in coeliac patients. Psychological pathologies do appear in treated and untreated coeliacs, the need of psychological support is stressed. Coeliac disease should be taken into consideration in patients with psychiatric disorders, particularly if they are not responsive to psychopharmacological therapy, because withdrawal of gluten from the diet usually results in disappearance of symptoms. In recent years, an increased incidence of subclinical/silent coeliac disease has been reported. Psychiatric symptoms and psychological behavioral pathologies could be the only clinical manifestation of coeliac disease, but the epidemiological aspects need further investigation.},

METHODS: A retrospective study of adult patients who were diagnosed with celiac disease based on findings of small intestinal biopsy, response to gluten free diet and exclusion of other causes of malabsorption or vitamin deficiency over a period of 5 years from 1998-2002. The study was carried out at the King Abdul-Aziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were diagnosed with celiac disease. Osteomalacia and iron deficiency anemia were common clinical presentations. Diarrhea, malabsorption associated with growth failure was observed in 3 patients with a mean age of 14.5 years. Celiac disease associated with other autoimmune diseases was reported in 6 patients. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in 3 patients, Hashimoto's hypothyroidism in 2 patients and dermatitis herpetiformis in one patient. No malignancy was observed during the follow-up of our patients. There was a good clinical and biochemical response to gluten free diet in 12 cases. CONCLUSION: Osteomalacia and iron deficiency anemia were common clinical presentations of celiac disease. Hence, the presence of either one of them in a female patient should raise the possibility of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Macroamylasemia is considered to be rarely associated with celiac disease (CD). We have evaluated patients in whom macroamylasemia or elevated total amylase (TA) led to the diagnosis of CD. These cases served as a catalyst for examining the prevalence of elevated TA and macroamylase (MA) in patients with active CD. METHOD: Total amylase and MA measurements were performed in the sera of 124 celiac patients with positive antiendomysium and tissue transglutaminase tests, in 100 patients on gluten-free diet (GFD) with negative serology test results, and in the sera of 89 healthy controls. Macroamylasemia was measured by using the PEG precipitation method. RESULTS: Twenty-three newly diagnosed celiac patients had elevated serum amylase levels (>2 SD above the controls). The average TA and MA levels were significantly elevated in both celiac groups. The nonprecipitated amylase levels (pancreatic and salivary amylase fractions) were not different from those of the controls. Three controls (3.4%), 21 newly diagnosed celiac (16.8%), and seven patients on GFD (7%) had significantly elevated MA activity in their sera. CONCLUSIONS: A significant percentage of the newly diagnosed patients with CD have macroamylasemia. Serum MA remained elevated in some patients on strict GFD. In addition, in the presence of an elevated amylase or MA the possibility of CD should be considered.},

Responses of hepatic vagal afferents were highly variable across individual rats, whereas those of celiac vagal afferents were remarkably consistent across individual rats.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical and nutritional impact of coeliac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) among Saharawi children living as refugees in Algeria. METHODS: A total of 65 Saharawi children with coeliac disease were compared with 71 age-matched non-coeliac controls. For each participant, the clinical history was taken and a clinical examination, non-quantitative 24-hour dietary recall, anthropometric and skinfold measurements, bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) of body composition, and venous blood sampling for haemoglobin determination were performed. RESULTS: Gluten-containing food, especially bread, was the staple diet of Saharawi children. Abdominal pain and distension were significantly commoner among children with coeliac disease than in controls (P < 0.05). The mean height-for-age was significantly lower in such children than in controls (-2.5 +/- 1.4 units vs -1.8 +/- 1.3 units, respectively, P < 0.01). No significant differences were found for either skinfold or BIA measurements. Haemoglobin values tended to be lower in children with coeliac disease than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease has a negative effect on the health status of Saharawi refugee children. Because of the high prevalence of the condition in the Saharawi, a specific programme for treating all affected individuals should be established. Further studies are required to quantify the impact of coeliac disease in other areas of the developing world.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: The anti-atherosclerotic properties of F 12511, a novel acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor, were studied in rabbits that were fed a cholesterol-free casein-rich diet and developed endogenous hypercholesterolemia and fibrofatty preatheroma lesions. After 6 weeks of casein feeding, an endothelial abrasion was performed in the abdominal aorta; at week 8, a control group was maintained on this diet while F 12511 (8 mg/kg/d) was administered as a diet admixture for the subsequent 24 weeks. Total plasma cholesterol level rose to 250-300 mg/dl in both groups before starting the treatment; F 12511 time-dependently reduced total plasma cholesterol by 50%, and also decreased by 50% the incidence of lesions and macrophage accumulation in uninjured aorta (thoracic arch, celiac bifurcation). Residual lesions in the treated group were characterized by few macrophages, essentially under the endothelium, and by a larger content of smooth muscle cells. Quantitative image analysis of serial sections of mechanically injured abdominal aorta revealed a 20% surface covered by preatheroma lesions in the placebo group; F 12511 significantly reduced this surface. These data suggest that the combination of endogenous hypercholesterolemia with endothelial injury in the rabbit may offer a useful model to study atherosclerosis; lipid lowering by F 12511 reduces the incidence of vascular lesions and macrophage infiltration and may reinforce the fibrous skeleton of the atheroma.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Headache is the commonest clinical symptom during childhood and adolescence, from a neurologist s point of view. The pathophysiology of migraine and tension headache involve personality and biochemical factors, such as serotonin, which are also common in coeliac disease. OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of headache in children and adolescents with coeliac disease, and any possible relation between these conditions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We made a randomized selection of 86 patients with coeliac disease. All were on gluten-free diets and had no current gastroenterological symptoms. They had direct interviews and full physical and neurological examinations. The diagnosis of headache was based on criteria of the International Headache Society in 1988. RESULTS: The average age was 12.71 +/- 4.5 years (range 5-24). Headache occurred in 34 (39.5%) of the 86 patients studied. In 18 cases (20.9%) headache was of tension type and in 16 (18.6%) of migraine type. Of the latter, 10 cases had auras and 6 did not. There was no significant sex difference. CONCLUSIONS: An increased prevalence of both migraine and tension headaches was observed in the coeliac patients studied as compared with data published in the literature. In the former patients there was also a lower frequency in histories of migraine in first degree family members. This data is probably related to the personality of the patient or to his family or social circumstances in the case of tension headaches. In the case of migraine it may be due to biochemical factors such as a lowered plasma serotonin, seen both in coeliac disease and in migraine.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Follow-up of celiac patients in Chile is often interrupted when adolescents are referred to adult gastroenterologists. AIM: To study the evolution of patients with celiac disease when they reach adolescence or young adulthood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Current adherence to gluten-free diet and its relation to symptoms and circulating antiendomysial antibodies were evaluated in the 58 confirmed celiac patients older than 12 years of age controlled at 3 hospitals in Santiago. RESULTS: Mean age at the moment of this assessment was 17.8 +/- 5 years, 65.5% were women, 12.5% were at nutritional risk (-IDS) while 20% were overweight/obese. Although all patients declared themselves asymptomatic, a focused questionnaire revealed that 26% suffered some symptoms. Only 24.1% followed a strict gluten-free diet. Eight of 20 patients who ate gluten-containing diets had negative antiendomysial antibodies (EMA), three of whom turned positive within 6 to 9 months. In three of four (asymptomatic) cases that accepted a new jejunal biopsy, histology was abnormal. One patient who followed a strict diet had EMA (+) and normal histology. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that after childhood, symptoms abate significantly in celiac patients. The observed sensitivity and specificity of EMA makes necessary to maintain small intestinal biopsies as the gold standard for diagnosis and confirmation of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: T-cell mediated immune response to dietary gluten and cytokines release are important for the enteropathy seen in celiac disease. We investigated the serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in celiac children before and after gluten exclusion. METHODS: Cytokine levels were determined using enzyme immunoassay in serum from 12 untreated celiac patients, 16 treated celiac patients on a gluten-free diet for at least two years, and from 26 control children. Eight of 12 untreated patients were also investigated at 6 and 12 months after gluten exclusion. Serum IgA antiendomysium antibodies were also assayed by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Soluble interleukin-2 receptor and interleukin-6 levels were significantly increased in untreated celiac patients compared with treated and control children. There was no difference in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels between the groups. Soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels were the only ones significantly decreased at 12 months after gluten exclusion. However, soluble interleukin-2 receptor and interleukin-6 levels at 12 months were significantly higher compared with controls. Antiendomysium antibodies had a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% and the titers decreased significantly after 12 months of gluten exclusion. A significant positive correlation was found between antiendomysium antibody titers with both soluble interleukin-2 receptor and interleukin-6 values. CONCLUSIONS: The serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor and interleukin-6 levels may be used as a noninvasive measure of celiac disease activity and response to treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that some organ-specific and generalized autoimmune diseases in humans might be related to a breakdown of oral tolerance. We explored this hypothesis in human primary glomerulonephritides. We prospectively counted intraepithelial T lymphocytes in the duodenal mucosa (as a marker of rupture of oral tolerance), together with IgA1 and IgA2 mucosal plasma cells, in patients with primary glomerulonephritides. METHODS: We investigated eight adults with immune-complex glomerulopathy (membranous nephropathy+membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis), 16 adults with an idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, and 25 adults with IgA nephropathy. Patients with glomerulonephritides were compared to two control groups: group 1 consisted of nine healthy adults; group 2 comprised five adults with coeliac disease before dietary gluten withdrawal or during a clinical relapse related to gluten ingestion. (The latter disease is associated with increased numbers of intraepithelial T lymphocytes, and a breakdown of oral tolerance to gliadins is involved in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease). Duodenal fibroscopy was performed under neuroleptanalgesia. Four to six endoscopic biopsy specimens were taken from the second duodenum. Intraepithelial T lymphocytes were blindly counted on paraffin sections stained with haematein-eosin-saffron (HES), within the epithelium of a villus in a zone with at least 100 cells. Mucosal IgA1 and IgA2 plasma cells were blindly counted in a mucosal tissue unit by using specific mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against IgA1 and IgA2, with alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) revelation. As values were not normally distributed, we used non-parametric analysis of variance with the Kruskal-Wallis test, and compared median values by using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Intraepithelial T lymphocytes were significantly more abundant in patients with primary glomerulonephritides and coeliac disease than in healthy controls (P < 0.0001 in the Kruskal-Wallis test): healthy controls, median 11 (range 4.65-16); immune complex glomerulopathy, 27.45*** (15-93); idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, 16.5** (9-26.5); IgA nephropathy, 26.10*** (11.3-47.5); coeliac disease, 55*** (20-80) (*P <0.05; **P <0.01; ***P < 0.005, Mann-Whitney test). No difference was found in the number of duodenal IgA1 and IgA2 plasma cells between controls and patients with primary glomerulonephritides. IgA1 and IgA2 plasma cells were increased in patients with coeliac disease. CONCLUSION: The significant increase in intestinal intraepithelial T lymphocytes in primary glomerulonephritides suggests a pathophysiological role of oral tolerance breakdown.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize the energy and nutrient intake, and the degree of fat malabsorption in children with Alagille syndrome (AGS) and to examine their cross-sectional associations with growth and nutritional status. METHODS: Prepubertal children with AGS were evaluated for dietary intake, growth, bone age, and body composition. Children and their families collected a three-day, weighed diet record at home. Stools were collected for 72 hours and the coefficient of fat absorption (COA) was determined. RESULTS: Children (mean age 6.7 +/- 3.6 years) with AGS (n = 26) had low height-for-age z-scores (HAZ), weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) (-1.9 +/- 1.3 and -1.7 +/- 1.1, respectively), and delayed skeletal maturation (-1.4 +/- 1.8 years). Fifty-eight percent of the subjects were less than the 5th percentile for height and 54% were less than the 5th percentile for weight. At least 20% of children with AGS had low dietary intake for several nutrients including: calories, fat, calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin E. Children who consumed <2/3 Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for calcium (n = 6) had a statistically significantly lower HAZ (-3.2 +/- 1.3) than those who consumed >2/3 DRI (-1.5 +/- 1.0), (P < 0.003). Ninety-six percent of the subjects had steatorrhea with a mean COA of 75 +/- 16%. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that prepubertal children with AGS are at-risk for poor nutrient intake which, compounded with steatorrhea, may have a negative effect on growth and nutritional status. Intervention studies to increase energy and nutrient intake are needed to determine the effect of improved dietary intake on growth and nutritional status of children with AGS.},

Classical coeliac disease has been recently very rare, but the frequency of the silent or latent form has increased. The aim of the study was to evaluate the magnesium status in patients with coeliac disease diagnosed according to ESPGAN criteria. 41 GFD(+) patients aged 6-18 years, who were on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for 2.8 to 17.3 years (mean 11 years); with normal villous structure and IgAEmA(-), and 32 GFD(-) patients aged 5-17 years, with villous atrophy and IgAEmA(+): 8--after 7/12-13/12 of gluten challenge, 4--with late onset of coeliac disease, 20--with silent coeliac disease. All of the children did not have any other disorders. Magnesium status was examined by using: an i.v. Mg-loading test (30 mmol/1.73 m2); Mg urinary excretion and Mg concentration in serum, erythrocytes, and in hair. Abnormal values in GFD(+) and GFD(-) patients were found in: Mg i.v. loading test (retention > 40%) in 20 vs 34%, serum Mg (< 0.7 mmol/l) in 7 vs 3%, erythrocytes Mg (< 1.8 mmol/l) in 20 vs 25%. The reversed statistically significant correlation was found between Mg retention and Mg urinary excretion (R = -0.293, p = 0.009). No other statistically significant correlations were found. CONCLUSION: The magnesium deficiency was present in all patients with classical coeliac disease, but only in 1/5 of patients with coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet and in 1/5 of patients with silent coeliac disease.},

The aim of the study was the analysis of the reasons of this deficiency in children with CD, diagnosed according to ESPGAN criteria. MATERIAL: The study was performed on 41 patients aged 6-18 years adhering to strict gluten-free diet GFD(+) for mean 11 years, with normal small intestine mucosa, and IgAEmA(-), and on 32 patients aged 5-17 years on gluten containing diet, with classical CD, silent CD or after gluten challenge--GFD(-). In this group the villous atrophy of the small intestine and IgAEmA(+) were observed. In 18 of these patients Mg deficiency was found using Mg-loading test (30 mmol/1.73 m2). METHODS: The following parameters were analysed: type of the disease, observance of gluten-free diet, sex, and living place. Mg, Ca, Na, protein, fat, and dietary fiber intake was assessed using food frequency questionnaire method, and steatorrhea using faecal fat excretion (g/24 h). RESULTS: The frequency of Mg deficiency was similar in both sexes, occasionally in children from small towns (4.5%), and more often in children from big cities (31.5%), and village (34.4%). Dietary Mg intake below RDA was observed in 23% of children from GFD(+) group, in 19% from GFD(-) one, and in 17.6% in children with Mg deficiency. Insufficient Mg intake was found in 18.2% of children from small towns, in 17.6% from big cities, and in 12.5% from villages; Ca in 36.6%, 58.8%, and 59.3%, and protein in 18.2%, 35.3%, and in 34.4% respectively. In all groups of children high intake of fat and Na was observed. Dietary fiber intake was within the recommended values. All children with classical CD had increased fat excretion (mean 25.9 g/24 h), in other patients it was within normal values [GFD(+) mean 1.95 g/24 h, in GFD(-) without diarrhoea 1.7 g/24 h. CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium deficiency in children with CD depends on the form of the disease, adhering to GFD, diarrhoea with steatorrhea, and/or low Mg intake with the diet.},

As in other countries, oligo- and asymptomatic CD is being diagnosed with increasing frequency in all age groups. AIM: To assess the prevalence of asymptomatic CD in adolescents in eastern Switzerland. METHOD: Between September 1999 and July 2000 total serum IgA titres, anti-endomysium IgA (EMA) titres and anti-human tissue transglutaminase IgA (hTTG) titres were measured in the serum of healthy 11- to 18-year-old Swiss lower and upper secondary school students. RESULTS: Of the 1,450 students (871 f = 60.1%, CI 95%) tested, 11 (10 f) had elevated levels of both EMA and TTG. The diagnosis of CD was confirmed in eight of these students by mucosal jejunal morphology (Marsh III); one exhibited normal histology. Two of the 11 students refused to undergo mucosal biopsy. None of the students, however, had symptoms suggestive of CD, nor were they stunted or underweight, and none of them had family members with known CD. All of the eight students with enteropathy went on a glutenfree diet and felt subjectively better than on a normal diet. Of the remaining students, 38 (2.6%) had family members with known CD. None of those with the relevant family history had elevated EMA or TTG levels. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic CD is common. It occurs in 1 in 132 (0.75%) Swiss adolescents. The absence of subjectively recognisable symptoms suggestive of family history or other risk factors makes it difficult to diagnose this type of CD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Informations on celiac disease among Indian adults is scarce. With the availability of improved and more accessible diagnostic tools for celiac disease, the disease is being more frequently recognized among the adults. Therefore, a retrospective analysis of duodenal biopsies were performed to identify adult celiac disease among Indian patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the patients, who had villous atrophy on duodenal biopsy between February, 1997 to June 2001, was performed. The clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, treatment and follow up details of patients diagnosed as adult onset celiac disease were analysed. Diagnosis of celiac disease was established in these patients as per ESPGAN criteria. RESULTS: There were 68 duodenal biopsies during the study period. Thirteen (10 were under 15 years of age and 3 had followup biopsy) biopsies were excluded. Eleven (20%) out of 55 patients with villous atrophy in their duodenal biopsy satisfied the ESPGAN criteria for the diagnosis of celiac disease. The age at the time of diagnosis ranged from 15-56 years (mean 36.8 years). Male to female ratio was 5:6. Chronic diarrhea (99%) was the most common presentation followed by weight loss (88%) and anemia (66%). Only one patient had refractory iron deficiency anemia (11%). Histopathological examination showed, subtotal villous atrophy in 6 patients and partial villous atrophy in 5. Nine out of 11 patients had raised concentration of IgA antigliadin antibody. Two patients also had raised concentration of antiendomysial antibody. All of them showed favorable clinical response to Gluten free diet. CONCLUSION: Coeliac disease is considered rare in the tropics. Our study shows that this disease may not be as infrequent as is thought.},

The aim of the study was to assess an ELISA method for t-TG antibodies (t-TGA) with respect to EMA IF assay in pediatric and adult patients. METHODS: t-TGA were analyzed by ELISA in 220 sera samples: 82 patients with biopsy-proven untreated CD (23 adults and 59 children), 14 CD children on gluten-free diet, 18 asymptomatic relatives of CD patients, and 106 age-matched control patients with gluten-unrelated gastrointestinal diseases (58 adults and 48 children). Serum IgA EMA were tested on umbilical cord sections in all patients. RESULTS: The great majority (92.7%) of untreated CD patients (both adults and children) were t-TGA positive (values ranging from 20.1 to > 300 AU). None of the child control patients and only two out of 58 (3.4%) of the adults with unrelated gastrointestinal diseases had serum t-TGA positivity; two out of 18 first-degree relatives with biopsy-proved silent CD were t-TGA (as well as EMA) positive. Finally, two out of 14 CD children, assuming a gluten-free diet, had serum t-TGA (as well as EMA). A highly significant correlation (P < 0.001) was observed between t-TGA concentrations and EMA. t-TGA showed a sensitivity of 87% and 95%, a specificity of 97% and 100% for adults and children, respectively. CONCLUSION: The method is highly sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of CD and is promising as a tool for routine diagnostic use and population screening, especially in children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is caused by a T helper cell type 1 (Th1) response in the small intestinal mucosa to dietary gluten. Paradoxically, interleukin (IL)-12, the major Th1 inducing factor, is undetectable in the mucosa of active CD. IL-18 is a recently described cytokine capable of promoting T cell interferon (IFN)-gamma production and facilitating Th1 cell polarisation. AIM: To examine expression of IL-18 and IL-18-associated Th1 proteins in CD. METHODS: IL-18 and IFN-gamma RNA transcripts were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). IL-18 and caspase-1 protein expression were assessed by western blotting. Caspase-1 activity was determined using a commercially available assay. RNA transcripts for the IL-18 receptor subunits, IL-1 receptor related protein (IL-1 Rrp) and accessory protein-like subunit (AcPL), and IL-18 induced Th1 specific T box transcription factor (T-bet) were measured by RT-PCR and Southern blotting. RESULTS: IL-18 RNA transcripts were found in all mucosal samples analysed, with no difference between CD patients and controls. By western blot analysis, a large protein of approximately 24 kDa, corresponding to the immature IL-18, was detected in all mucosal samples from CD patients and controls. In contrast, mature IL-18 was only seen in CD patients. Immunoreactivity corresponding to both immature and mature caspase-1 was present in both CD and control samples. Tissue homogenates from CD patients and controls expressed similar levels of caspase-1 activity. IL-1Rrp and AcPL were seen in all samples but were expressed at greater levels in the mucosa of CD patients. T-bet was also upregulated in CD. CONCLUSIONS: Active IL-18 is expressed in CD as well as other markers of Th1 polarisation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and presenting features of adult coeliac disease in a single university hospital in South Yorkshire. DESIGN: A retrospective case finding study. Data were obtained from pathology and immunology databases, clinical notes, dietetic records, and patient questionnaires. SETTING: Royal Hallamshire Hospital in South Yorkshire, England. PARTICIPANTS: All recorded cases of coeliac disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Crude annual incidence rates for coeliac disease was obtained. The numbers of coeliac antibody profiles requested per year from the Royal Hallamshire Hospital were ascertained. Age at diagnosis, sex, year of diagnosis, presenting symptoms, associated conditions, and delay in diagnosis was documented. In addition the specialty of the clinician who made the diagnosis was noted. RESULTS: There were 264 cases in total (male n=86, ratio 1:2). Mean age at diagnosis was 44.9 years (range 1-82, median 44.5). A trend was observed from 1990 to 2000 inclusive, of an annual increase in the incidence of coeliac disease. There has been a coincidental increase in the measurement of associated antibodies. Although 28.4% of patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, 20.1% had iron deficiency anaemia. The ratio of typical to atypical symptoms was 1:2.5. (single sample test of proportions p<0.001). The diagnosis was made by a gastroenterologist in only 52.7% of cases. The median duration of symptoms before the diagnosis of coeliac disease was 4.9 years (range 0.25-16 years). CONCLUSION: Coeliac disease is now presenting more commonly without gastrointestinal symptoms and often to specialties other than gastroenterology. Although more cases are diagnosed, this may be a reflection of increasing recognition rather than a true increase in incidence.},

In a retrospective cohort study, we assessed the relationship between autoimmune disorders and actual gluten exposure in patients in whom coeliac disease was diagnosed in adult life (> or = 16 years). METHODS: We screened for the presence of autoimmunity in 605 controls (16-84 years) and 422 patients (16-84 years), all of whom had been on gluten withdrawal for at least one year (median follow up 9.5 years). A logistic regression analysis, setting the prevalence of autoimmunity as the dependent variable, was employed to control for independent covariates as predictors of the risk of autoimmunity. RESULTS: The prevalence of autoimmunity was threefold higher (p < 0.00001) in patients than in controls. Mean duration of gluten exposure was 31.2 and 32.6 years for patients with or without autoimmunity. Logistic regression showed that increased age at diagnosis of coeliac disease was related to the prevalence of autoimmune disease while "actual gluten exposure" which takes into account diet compliance, follow up, and age at diagnosis of autoimmune disorders were not predictive for the risk of developing autoimmune diseases (odds ratio 0.82 per year). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of autoimmune diseases in patients with a late coeliac disease diagnosis does not correlate with duration of gluten intake. Early exposure to gluten may modify the immunological response. Gluten withdrawal does not protect patients with a late diagnosis from autoimmune diseases.},

The aim of this study was to establish, by means of a multicenter prospective study, the prevalence of thyroid impairment among adult patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease and to evaluate the effect of a 1-yr gluten withdrawal on thyroid function. METHODS: A total of 241 consecutive untreated patients and 212 controls were enrolled. In 128 subjects a thorough assessment, including intestinal biopsy, was repeated within 1 yr of dietary treatment. Thyroid function was assayed by measuring the levels of TSH, free T3, free T4, thyroperoxidase, and thyroid microsome antibodies. RESULTS: Thyroid disease was 3-fold higher in patients than in controls (p < 0.0005). Hypothyroidism, diagnosed in 31 patients (12.9%) and nine controls (4.2%), was subclinical in 29 patients and of nonautoimmune origin in 21. There was no difference regarding hyperthyroidism, whereas autoimmune thyroid disease with euthyroidism was present in 39 patients (16.2%) and eight controls (3.8%). In most patients who strictly followed a 1-yr gluten withdrawal (as confirmed by intestinal mucosa recovery), there was a normalization of subclinical hypothyroidism. Twenty-five percent of patients with euthyroid autoimmune disease shifted toward either a subclinical hyperthyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism; in these subjects, dietary compliance was poor. In addition, 5.5% of patients whose thyroid function was normal while untreated developed some degree of thyroid dysfunction 1 yr later. CONCLUSIONS: The greater frequency of thyroid disease among celiac disease patients justifies a thyroid functional assessment. In distinct cases, gluten withdrawal may single-handedly reverse the abnormality.},

Our aim was to find out if coeliac disease is more common among siblings of children with Type I diabetes than in the normal population. METHODS: IgA endomysium antibodies were measured by indirect immunofluorescence in 550 subjects (mean age 11.8 years, range 3.1-26.9 years) with a sibling with Type I diabetes. We performed jejunal biopsy on as many subjects with positive antibodies as agreed. HLA-DQB1 genotyping was done in 427 subjects. RESULTS: Endomysium antibodies were positive in nine subjects (1.6 %). Jejunal biopsy was diagnostic for coeliac disease in five out of seven patients. An additional patient with coeliac disease, one already on a gluten-free diet, was identified by questionnaire. The prevalence of coeliac disease was 1.1 %. Five of six patients with coeliac disease had HLA-DQB1*02 allele, compared with 118 of 421 of those without coeliac disease (p = 0.009). The sixth patient was positive for HLA-DQB1*0302 allele, which was also found in 241 of 421 of those without coeliac disease (p = 0.4). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: We found the prevalence of coeliac disease among siblings of children with Type I diabetes to be similar to figures reported from recent population-based studies and to be correlated with the prevalence of coeliac disease associated HLA-DQB1 alleles. We propose that routine screening for coeliac disease among all first-degree relatives of patients with Type I diabetes is not warranted.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether coeliac disease affects growth, glycaemic control, and general well-being of children and adolescents with type I diabetes. Eighteen subjects were found to have coeliac disease by a screening program. Gastrointestinal symptoms, changes in growth and the levels of glycated haemoglobin (GHbA1) were analysed, as well as subjective well-being before and after diagnosis of coeliac disease. Overt gastrointestinal symptoms and deterioration of growth prior to disclosure of coeliac disease were seen only in one patient who had both of these conditions. Retrospectively, most subjects reported mild gastrointestinal complaints, which resolved on a gluten-free diet. Introduction of a gluten-free diet did not have any positive effect on glycaemic control, but was associated with an increase in weight-for-height (from 4.3+/-18.1 to 8.2+/-15.4% deviation from population median, p = 0.02). This increase in weight-for-height was inversely correlated with changes in GHbA1 (r = -0.574, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Coeliac disease is rarely associated with signs of malabsorption in children and adolescents with type I diabetes. Introduction of a gluten-free diet may be associated with excess weight gain. We recommend intensified follow-up for these subjects.},

The latter has been identified as the enzyme tissue transglutaminase which belongs to a family of enzymes that catalyze protein cross-linking reactions and is constitutively expressed in many tissues as well as being activated during apoptosis. In a recent paper, we described the selection and characterization of anti-transglutaminase Igs from phage antibody libraries created from intestinal lymphocytes from celiac disease patients. In this work, using transglutaminase gene fragments, we identify a region of tissue transglutaminase recognized by these antibodies as being conformational and located in the core domain of the enzyme. This is identical to the region recognized by anti-transglutaminase Igs found in the serum of celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a disorder characterised by malabsorption related to abnormal small bowel structure and intolerance to gluten. There are several reports of an increased risk for malignancy in coeliac disease and its relation to gluten-free, reduced gluten, or normal diet. While a normal diet is associated with an excess of cancer of the mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, and also of lymphoma, treatment with a gluten-free diet restores the cancer risk back to normal. PATIENT: In the present study, we report on a 63-year-old female patient with a history of coeliac disease for twenty years who presented with persistent diarrhoea, weight loss, and an abdominal mass. RESULTS: The gastroenterological work-up revealed small bowel mucosal atrophy, absence of functional splenic tissue, and evidence for an involution of a mesenteric lymph node, termed cavitation. DISCUSSION: This triad has been previously described to represent a rare disease entity related to coeliac disease. We report a two-year follow-up and a review of the literature on the pathogenesis, prognosis, and therapeutical implications of this disease entity.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a small intestinal disorder with overt malabsorption in the minority and with subclinical or atypical symptoms in the majority of patients. It is triggered by gluten and related cereal proteins in a unique genetic background (HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 and other unmapped genes). CD is characterized by a highly specific mucosal autoantibody response to tissue transglutaminase. In the intestine this enzyme creates antigenic neoepitopes in gluten peptides which are more efficiently presented to the immune system in the context of HLA-DQ2 or DQ8. Between 3% and 6% of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) have (atypical) CD, and the prevalence of a variety of autoimmune diseases in patients with CD correlates with the time of gluten exposure, reaching 35% after 20 years. It is still unknown whether oligosymptomatic CD favors the development of type 1 DM and whether a gluten-free diet modifies the progression of DM in general. Apart from shared or adjacent HLA loci in both diseases, post-translational modification of potential autoantigens by enzymes such as tissue transglutaminase could play a role in the autoimmunity of type 1 DM.},

AIM: To evaluate compliance to a gluten-free diet and knowledge of the disease in celiac patients registered at the Brazilian Celiac Association (BCA). METHODS: A structured questionnaire was designed to assess compliance to a gluten-free diet as well as knowledge of the celiac disease. It was mailed to 584 members of BCA. RESULTS: Five hundred and twenty nine (90.6%) of a total of 534 (91.4%) answered questionnaires were analyzed; 69.4% were classified as compliant patients whereas 29.5% were classified as noncompliant. The proportion of patients age 21 or older who consume gluten frequently or without any restriction is larger (17.7%) than those who were younger than 21 years (9.9%). Frequency of dietary compliance was higher when the diagnosis had taken less than 5 years to be established; 82% of the patients replied that the small intestine was the part of the body affected by the disease. The most common symptoms of the disease according to the answers were diarrhea (96.6%), weight loss (93.4%), protuberant abdomen (90.4%), anemia (68.1%) and vomiting (59.6%). Only 59.0% agreed with the existence of genetic predisposition; 90.4% answered that the disease is permanent and 96.2% stated that the diet should exclude gluten absolutely; 67.1% answered that the gluten is a protein and according to 92.1% questionnaires this protein is present in wheat, rye, barley and oat. Greater compliance was observed when there was an understanding of the disease and diet. The small intestine biopsy was considered necessary for just 67.5% of the patients, and greater compliance was observed in patients who had undergone at least one small intestine biopsy. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the more the patients know and understand about the disease, the better able they are to comply with the diet.},

METHODS: One hundred ninety samples were analyzed: 108 homemade foods prepared in homes of patients with celiac disease, 81 processed products, and 1 positive control of homemade food. All samples were analyzed by EIA based on monoclonal antibodies to heat stable omega-gliadins and related prolamins from wheat, rye, and barley. Samples were also analyzed using the WB technique. RESULTS: Only one (0.9%) of 108 homemade foods contained detectable amounts of gliadin, as determined by EIA. Twelve of 81 processed products contained gliadin by EIA, as follows: 5 of 61 without gluten listed in the ingredients, 2 of 11 malt extracts, 1 of 2 wheat starches, 1 of 2 types of beer, and all 3 positive control products. Gliadin content of these products was between 4 and 10 mg of gliadin/100 g of product, except for the wheat starch sample (28 mg of gliadin/100 g) and all 3 samples with gluten (>4000 mg of gliadin/100 g). The positive control of homemade food contained 152 mg of gliadin/100 g. One hundred three of 190 samples were analyzed by WB, and 21 of these were gliadin positive. A comparison of results obtained by EIA and WB showed no statistical differences between the methods. CONCLUSIONS: The greater part of the foods prepared in homes of patients with celiac disease and most processed products supposed to be gluten-free did not contain gliadin. Therefore, celiac patients adequately prepare gluten-free homemade food and have the expertise to purchase processed gluten-free food in Sao Paulo, Brazil.},

We describe a case of a 60-yr-old woman with chronic serum liver biochemistry elevations, recent onset of pruritus, and unexplained iron deficiency anemia. Liver biopsy was suggestive of stage 1 primary biliary cirrhosis, but serum antimitochondrial antibody testing was negative. Subsequent evaluation revealed CD based on markedly elevated antiendomysial antibody titers and characteristic histological features on mucosal biopsies. Initiation of a gluten-free diet led to resolution of iron deficiency anemia, pruritus, and elevated serum liver biochemistries. This suggests that CD may play a direct role in the development of autoimmune cholangitis. Additionally, normalization of hepatic biochemistries may be achieved without the use of immunosuppressive agents in some patients. CD should be considered in all patients diagnosed with autoimmune cholangitis as a gluten-free diet may avoid the need for immunosuppressive therapy in affected patients.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary care HIV subspecialty practice. PARTICIPANTS: Children with perinatally acquired HIV infection. Exclusion criteria included being younger than 1 year and receiving mineral oil as a medication. METHODS: Weight, height, and upper arm anthropometric variables were measured. Spot stool samples were analyzed for steatorrhea using the Sudan III qualitative test and for EPI using fecal elastase-1 enzyme assay. Hormone-stimulated pancreatic function testing and 72-hour stool and dietary fat sample collection were performed when fecal elastase-1 enzyme was in the range of EPI, defined as less than 200 microgram/g. HIV RNA viral load, CD4 status, type of antiretroviral therapy, and biochemical evidence of hepatobiliary disease were measured within 3 months of stool sample collection. z Scores were computed for height, weight, triceps skinfold, and upper arm muscle area. RESULTS: We enrolled 44 patients (23 girls [52%]) with a mean +/- SD age of 7.4 +/- 3.1 years. None had hepatobiliary disease. The prevalence of steatorrhea was 39% (95% confidence interval, 23%-56%). The prevalence of EPI was 0% (95% confidence interval, 0%-9%). There were no associations between steatorrhea and EPI, growth, HIV RNA viral load, CD4 status, or type of antiretroviral therapy. Older children had decreased z scores for height (r = -0.42; P =.006). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical significance of steatorrhea in children with HIV infection is unclear. Furthermore, its evaluation should focus on nonpancreas-based conditions. Continual close monitoring of growth is essential in children with HIV infection.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Down's syndrome is characterized by an abnormal frequency of coeliac disease and by the frequent occurrence of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer-type dementia of early onset. However, psychosis is rare in Down's syndrome. OBSERVATION: We report the case of a 41-year-old woman, who presented with Down's syndrome. She was living with her parents and had a normal social life. She suddenly experienced some esthesic hallucinations, depression, anorexia, affective flattening and autistic behavior. Biological evaluation revealed macrocytosis, polyclonal IgA and IgG hypergammaglobulinemia and strong positivity for anti-gliadin antibodies of IgG and IgA isotypes. Brain CTscan was normal. Since digestive specimen biopsies did not evidence villous atrophy, we concluded in a silent coeliac disease. After 12 months of gluten-free diet a spectacular and lasting improvement of both psychotic and depressive symptoms was obtained. DISCUSSION: The effects of abnormal interaction between the immune system and gluten can be expressed not only in the gut (coeliac disease) but also in the brain (psychosis) in genetically predisposed patients, such as those suffering from Down's syndrome. There was evidence for brain disorder related to coeliac disease in our patient. CONCLUSION: Our case report shows that, before concluding in Alzheimer-type dementia in Down's syndrome, a biological search for coeliac disease is useful since a gluten-free diet may improve the psychiatric symptoms.},

   abstract = {Celiac Sprue, a widely prevalent autoimmune disease of the small intestine, is induced in genetically susceptible individuals by exposure to dietary gluten. A 33-mer peptide was identified that has several characteristics suggesting it is the primary initiator of the inflammatory response to gluten in Celiac Sprue patients. In vitro and in vivo studies in rats and humans demonstrated that it is stable toward breakdown by all gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal brush-border membrane proteases. The peptide reacted with tissue transglutaminase, the major autoantigen in Celiac Sprue, with substantially greater selectivity than known natural substrates of this extracellular enzyme. It was a potent inducer of gut-derived human T cell lines from 14 of 14 Celiac Sprue patients. Homologs of this peptide were found in all food grains that are toxic to Celiac Sprue patients but are absent from all nontoxic food grains. The peptide could be detoxified in in vitro and in vivo assays by exposure to a bacterial prolyl endopeptidase, suggesting a strategy for oral peptidase supplement therapy for Celiac Sprue.},

   abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to increase the familiarity of physicians with conditions or complications associated with CD, a disease that is more common than had been thought in the past. The differentiation between atypical manifestations, associated disease, and complications of CD is not always clear. With careful adherence to the necessary dietary restrictions, patients with CD can remain relatively free of troublesome symptoms, their long-term prognosis is excellent, and most complications can be prevented. (24) Indeed, 5-year survival rates of patients with CD did not differ from those in the general population. (6) This review emphasizes the importance of a screening policy for silent CD, justified on the basis of later developing complications such as malignancy, development of low bone mineral density, risk of neurologic abnormalities, and associated diseases, which may be preventable by GFD.},

   abstract = {Patients with chronic cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia are at high risk of developing celiac disease (CD). In fact, among the various serological disorders, CD patients at onset frequently present hypertransaminasemia. In this study, we evaluated usefulness and reliability of the new test for antitissue transglutaminase (tTG) in screening for CD as well as in estimating the prevalence of CD in a population of blood donors presenting unexplained hypertransaminasemia at donation. Controls were 180 consecutive healthy donors without hypertransaminasemia and 20 CD patients with known antiendomysial antibody (EmA) positivity. Out of 22,204 blood donors over a period of 2 years, we found 258 subjects (1.2%) with cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia. Four of these subjects (1.5%) were positive for anti-tTG, but only 3 of them were positive for EmA. EmA were negative in all the remaining hypertransaminasemia subjects. In the control groups, anti-tTG antibodies were negative in all the 180 healthy donors without hypertransaminasemia, but positive in all the CD patients known to be EmA positive. 3 of the 4 subjects positive for anti-tTG, including 2 who were also EmA positive, underwent biopsy of the distal duodenal mucosa which showed a picture compatible with CD only in the 2 patients with concomitant EmA positivity. After 3 months of gluten-free diet, the serum transaminase values normalized in these 2 patients. In conclusion, the prevalence of CD in our blood bank population was lower than that reported in other similar studies, but the new test for anti-tTG showed a good sensitivity and reliability, and, therefore, it can be proposed as a first-level test in screening for CD in selected populations such as subjects with hypertransaminasemia.},

The introduction of the gluten with the diet leads to a damage of the intestinal mucosa losing the ability of absorption. Together with the "classic forms", in wich the intestinal symptomatology is prevalent, there are atypical forms, with unusual clinical presentation and silent forms with no clinical symptoms. The neurologic symptoms are not frequent and regard seizures, headache, ataxia and psychiatric problems. We report on a patient with headache since 3 years of age in which the headache the only manifestation of CD. The diagnosis of CD was made at 11 years, when he came at our observation for episodes of headache. Also the older sister is found affected by CD. After three months of gluten free diet, it was obtained the complete resolution of the headache. Also if the pathogenesis of the headache in patient with CD is unknown we think that a autoimmune, vascular or blood flow mechanism could be ipotizeable.},

The duodenal mucosa showed severe villous atrophy but no subepithelial collagen deposition. No evidence of lymphocytic or collagenous colitis was found in the colon. The patient became symptom-free on a gluten exclusion diet and showed partial improvement of histopathologic findings after 3 months. Collagenous gastritis is a rare disease, but a wider recognition of its histopathologic features and clinical associations may bring more cases to light and provide additional clues in determining its etiology and pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {This paper underlines the need of developing animal models to study the diverse complications of celiac disease (CD). CD is a multifactorial condition requiring both an exogenous element (gluten) and complex genetic factors; moreover, CD is associated to several endocrine, immune and reproductive diseases, whose onset may be influenced by other environmental factors as well. In particular, the intestinal absorption of exogenous factors may be important for the outcome of CD as well as of the associated diabetes and/or thyroiditis. Presently, there are no adequate animal models for the systemic complications of CD; in particular, there are no gene knock-out models. However, models are available as regards either gluten enteropathy, such as Irish Setter and Balb/c e BDF1 mouse strains, and endocrine-immune diseases associated with CD, such as BB rats and NOD mice. A deeper exploitation of the available models could provide important information on the factors modulating intestinal permeability, the pathogenesis of extraintestinal alterations and the interactions between gluten and other metabolic, nutritional and environmental factors. The elaboration of in vivo models requires a sound basis of knowledge at molecular level, as well as the modulation of the metabolic alteration through relevant exogenous factors, first of all the dietary assumption of gluten. Therefore, the availability of experimental models may provide significant advances on the prevention and treatment, allowing a complete analysis of affected organisms as well as the use of pharmacological and/or immune stimuli; more information may be also derived on the possible long-term effects of gluten traces in CD-affected subjects, thus reducing the need for lengthy clinical studies.},

   abstract = {The prolamin working group coordinates research on laboratory gluten analysis in food and on clinical evaluation of patient sensitivity to prolamins. As an observer organization to the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the group summarizes current data on analysis and effects of gluten in coeliac disease. All types of gliadin, the ethanol-soluble fraction of gluten, contain the coeliac-active factor. However, coeliac toxicity and immunogenicity (humoral and cellular) of various prolamins are not identical in coeliac patients. There are no conclusive data on the threshold of gluten sensitivity of coeliac patients. Information as to the long-term risk to coeliac patients exposed to small doses of gliadin is lacking. Therefore, every effort should be made to keep the diet of coeliac patients as gluten-free as possible. The prolamin group is currently evaluating a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol for gluten analysis that could serve as a basis for further Codex regulations. The group recommends adherence to a single Codex limit for gluten-free foods. The current limit of 200 ppm gluten is questionable and requires reconsideration based on new information that will be available soon.},

IgAtTG-ELISA were positive in 23 patients (32.4%), equivocal--in 8 patients (11.3%) and negative--in 40 patients (53.6%). The serological tests were compatible in 58 patients (81.7%). If we consider equivocal results of IgAtTG test to be negative, IgAEmA and IgAtTG tests will be compatible in 64 cases (90.1%).

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Osteoporosis is a complication of coeliac disease. A gluten-free diet improves but does not normalize bone mineral density in adult patients. Only limited data are available regarding the influence of the disease and diet on bone mineralization in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the radial bone mineral content and density in children and adolescents who are asymptomatic on a gluten-free diet. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD) values of the non-dominant radius midshaft in 91 children (53 girls, 38 boys, mean age 11.7 years, mean duration of disease 8.7 years) were determined by single-photon absorptiometry. At the diagnosis and at least three years after commencement of a gluten-free diet, serum calcium, phosphorus, albumin concentrations and alkaline phosphatase activities were measured in all patients, and intact parathormone concentrations in 16 patients. RESULTS: The mean BMC Z-score value in the female adolescent group only was significantly lower than normal (mean Z-score -1.04, P < 0.01). In contrast, the mean BMD Z-score was significantly higher compared to a healthy population both in girls (mean Z-score +1.36, P < 0.001) and in boys (mean Z-score +0.53, P < 0.02), as well as in the total patient group (mean Z-score +1.01, P < 0.001). The radial diameter was significantly smaller than normal in both pre-pubertal and adolescent groups. Serum laboratory parameters of asymptomatic patients were in the normal range. The parathormone mean value was significantly lower after at least three years of gluten-free diet than at diagnosis (mean +/- SD 3.77 +/- 1.07 versus 7.89 +/- 2.54 pmol/l, P < 0.01), but significantly higher compared to controls (2.89 +/- 0.90 pmol/l, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that treated, asymptomatic coeliac children and adolescents have normal or even higher radius mineral density values than controls, but the bone size remains reduced. Although there is no direct evidence of calcium malabsorption in this cohort of coeliac patients, the slightly higher parathormone levels, together with some other factors, particularly delayed puberty, may result in reduced bone size.},

Collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis are distinguished by the presence of a thickened subepithelial collagen table. It is likely that they are a spectrum of one disease, but this is yet to be proven. The majority of cases tend to undergo spontaneous remission within a few years of onset, and their clinical course is benign, with no increase in risk of colorectal cancer. Sufficient evidence exists to suggest that microscopic colitis occurs as a response to one or more luminal antigens. A variety of medications have been reported in the treatment of this condition, but only colloidal bismuth and budesonide have thus far been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials.},

   abstract = {Although the gold standard for diagnosis of coeliac disease remains the small bowel biopsy, the broad spectrum and the non-specific nature of many of the clinical manifestations makes biopsy as the initial investigation impossible. So, much effort has been put into the identification of serological screening tests with adequate sensitivity and specificity. The aim of this study was to identify antiendomysial and antitissue-transglutaminase antibodies as serum markers of coeliac disease in a group of patients admitted in the 3rd Medical Clinic, 4th Medical Clinic and 1st Pediatric Clinic as well as in the general population. The study was made on serum samples collected from 64 persons, adults and children with or without documented coeliac disease. Antitissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies were determined by the sandwich ELISA technique, using a commercial kit. Antiendomysium (EMA) antibodies were dosed by indirect immunofluorescence. Twenty-four subjects were positive for IgA anti-tTG and 23 for EMA. We found that IgA anti-tTG were 100% positive in patients with clinical suspicion of coeliac disease, the diagnosis being confirmed by biopsy. All, but two patients on a gluten-free diet had small or zero EMA levels. We also found that serum EMA levels correlated perfectly with the degree of histological alterations. A very good correlation was found between the serum concentrations of the two antibodies studied},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In addition to IgA anti-endomysial antibodies, IgA anti-smooth muscle antibodies have been observed in a number of patients with coeliac disease (CoD), but only limited data exist on the frequency and antigen specificity of IgA against cytoskeletal proteins in CoD. METHODS: We evaluated the sera of 42 untreated CoD patients, follow-up sera of 26 CoD patients after treatment, and 116 control sera for IgA reactivity to cytoskeletal proteins from the human umbilical cord (HUC) by immunoblotting, and compared the results with anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (anti-tTG IgA) ELISA and immunofluorescence results. RESULTS: Serum IgA from CoD patients most frequently recognized a 57-kD antigen in HUC cytoskeletal extract, identified as desmin using mass spectrometry and internal peptide sequencing. Increased IgA reactivity to the human desmin band was detected in 22 children with untreated CoD (52.4%), in 4 treated CoD patients (15.4%), and in 12 control subjects (10.3%) (p < 0.01); similar results were obtained with anti-chicken desmin IgA ELISA. Anti-tTG IgA levels (increased in 71.4% of untreated CoD patients) correlated significantly with anti-desmin IgA levels in untreated CoD, and both autoantibody reactivities decreased in response to a gluten-free diet. Pre-adsorption experiments and affinity purification of anti-desmin IgA antibodies further confirmed that desmin is an IgA autoantigen in CoD and is recognized by antibodies which are not cross-reactive with tTG. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-desmin IgA antibodies are frequently occurring if not the predominant cytoskeletal antibodies in children with untreated CoD and could be related to the disease process in the small intestine.},

   abstract = {Individuals with celiac disease generally are advised to follow a lifelong gluten-free diet and avoid consumption of the prolamins gliadin (wheat), secalin (rye), and hordein (barley). Although the designation of the diet as glutenfree may imply that the diet contains zero gluten, this is not necessarily true. In some countries (eg, United States, Canada), the gluten-free diet is completely devoid of gluten and is based on foods such as rice and corn that are naturally gluten free. In others (eg, Scandinavia, United Kingdom), the gluten-free diet may include foods such as wheat starch that have been rendered gluten free but nonetheless contain small amounts of toxic prolamins. The discrepancy in the use of foods rendered gluten free exists because the amount of toxic prolamins that individuals with celiac disease may consume without damaging the mucosa of the small intestine is unknown. Minimal research has been conducted on the toxicity of foods rendered gluten free, and there are no definitive data about whether the small amount of prolamin found in these products is safe to consume. Nonetheless, the Codex Alimentarius Standard for gluten-free foods allows a certain amount of prolamin in foods designated gluten free, and these products have been used in many countries for several decades. Well-designed, scientifically sound studies are needed to help determine the amount of toxic prolamins, if any, that may be safely consumed by individuals with celiac disease. Until this research is conducted, dietitians in the United States should continue to advise their patients against the use of wheat starch and other foods rendered gluten free.},

   abstract = {Some inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal system are associated with neurological symptoms which, in rare cases, may precede the onset of the gastrointestinal manifestation of the disease. Celiac sprue is characterized by an intolerance to the wheat protein gluten. The typical neurological manifestation of celiac sprue is cerebellar ataxia. The ataxia as well as the gastrointestinal symptoms can be treated with a strictly gluten-free diet. The neurological symptoms of Whipple's disease, a disorder caused by gram-positive bacilli, are variable. Typical symptoms of cerebral Whipple's disease include dementia, ophthalmoplegia, movement disorders, and signs of hypothalamic dysfunction. Nowadays, the diagnosis of cerebral Whipple's disease is made by PCR detection of the bacilli in the CSF. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are associated with neurological symptoms to a similar proportion. Various forms of polyneuropathies have been observed. The CNS manifestations of inflammatory bowel diseases include thromboembolic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and cerebral vasculitis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease, induced by dietary gluten, is characterized by mucosal atrophy and local inflammation associated with cell infiltration and activation. Unlike other food proteins, gluten and its proteolytic fragments, besides inducing a specific immune response, were shown to activate components of innate immunity and cause, e.g., direct stimulation of TNF-alpha and IL-10 and a significant rise in NO production by peritoneal macrophages. The identity of the active fragments was established by separating the peptic digest of gliadin by RP-HPLC chromatography. The purest fraction with the highest activity was analyzed by mass spectrometry, and the gliadin peptide sequence was identified as VSFQQPQQQYPSSQ. This peptide (T) and its N- and C-terminally shortened forms (A, B, C and D, E, F) were synthesized. Peptide B (FQQPQQQYPSSQ) elicited the highest TNF-alpha, IL-10, and RANTES secretion and increase in IFN-gamma-primed NO production by mouse macrophages. In contrast, C-terminally shortened peptides had a lower ability to stimulate macrophages than the native form.},

AIMS: To compare sorbitol H2-Breath Test with antiendomysial antibodies in the follow-up of coeliac disease to detect histological recovery METHODS: A total of 38 consecutive patients with coeliac disease were studied. All underwent Sorbitol H2-Breath Test, antiendomysial and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with multiple bioptic samples before diet and then 6, 12 and 18 months after gluten-free diet. Expiratory samples were collected before patients drank the test solution (5 g sorbitol in 150 ml tap water) and thereafter every 30 min for 4 hours. An increase in H2 concentration of > or = 20 ppm above fasting baseline was considered positive for sorbitol malabsorption. Antiendomysial antibodies were evaluated by the indirect immunofluorescent method. RESULTS: Antiendomysial antibodies were positive in 32/38 patients before gluten-free diet (84.21%), while they were positive in 20/34 (54.82%), 2/16 (12.5%) and 0/2 (0%) cases after 6, 12 and 18 months of gluten-free diet, respectively, no correlation being found with improvement of histological lesions (p = ns). As far as concerns sorbitol H2-Breath Test, maximal cut-off value (in ppm) decreased progressively and parallel to histological recovery during follow-up. Indeed, it decreased from a mean 63 ppm before diet to 35, 19 and 12 ppm, after 6, 12 and 18 months of gluten-free diet, with a stetistical difference being found before and after (p < 0.001). Likewise, the peak value (in minutes) appeared progressively later during follow-up, parallel to histological recovery. In fact, it appeared at a mean of 119 minutes before gluten-free diet, while it appears at a mean of 164, 195 and 219 minutes after 6, 12 and 18 months on gluten-free diet. A statistical difference before and after start of gluten-free diet was found also in this case (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Sorbitol H2-Breath Test is better than antiendomysial antibodies in revealing histological recovery in the follow-up of coeliac patients after the start of gluten-free diet due to its good correlation with histological damage. Moreover, it also appears to be able to detect dietary mistakes of the patients on gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To evaluate whether health-related quality of life in adult coeliac disease is related to: 1) adhesion to gluten-free diet; 2) manifestation of clinical features; and 3) associated diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 68 coeliac patients (54 female and 14 male) aged between 18 and 74 years, on gluten-free diet for at least two years were studied. The subjective health status was measured by means of the Short Form 36 Health Survey. A series of 136 subjects, matched according to sex, age and ethnic group, were evaluated as control group. RESULTS: Patients obtained worse scores with respect to healthy controls at all domains of Short Form 36 Health Survey (p<0.05); compliers showed better results than non-compliers. The lowest scores were obtained in patients with more than six symptoms, mostly in non-compliers, the highest in compliers with less than six symptoms. Patients with two or more associated diseases presented significantly worse scores than patients with only one associated disease. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of gluten-free diet in clinical management of coeliac disease is confirmed by results of the present study; moreover, the results seem to indicate that a complex interplay of factors should be taken into account in evaluating health-related quality of life in adult coeliac disease. Accordingly, our data show that health-related quality of life of coeliac patients is impaired not only by poor compliance but also by different negative factors such as severity of illness (in terms of number of symptoms) at diagnosis and comorbidity.},

METHODS: We investigated patients with refractory iron-deficiency anemia attending the hematology clinic of a tertiary-care hospital for celiac disease. The diagnosis of celiac disease was based on histology, serology and response to treatment. RESULTS: Of 19 patients with refractory iron-deficiency anemia seen from April 1998 to March 2000, 11 were diagnosed to have celiac disease. Four of these had abnormal D-xylose test and 3 had fat malabsorption. All 11 patients responded to gluten-free diet with improvement in hematological parameters. CONCLUSION: Patients with refractory iron-deficiency anemia of unknown cause should be investigated for subclinical celiac disease.},

Cigarette smoking was reported to exert a protective effect against the development of symptomatic celiac disease; however, this relationship was not confirmed. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cigarette smoking on celiac disease. METHODS: A cohort of 87 consecutive celiac disease patients attending the clinic of Malabsorption and 174 age- and sex-matched individuals diagnosed with functional GI disorder were included in the study. Clinical information was obtained both at the time of diagnosis and at follow-up by reviewing the clinical history. Smoking information was obtained through an in-person interview using a questionnaire. RESULTS: Although 33% of controls were current smokers at the time of the study, only 16% of celiac patients were smokers at diagnosis (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.79; p < 0.006). The proportion of nonsmokers among patients (84%) was significantly greater than that among controls (67%; odds ratio, 2.54; 95% confidence interval 1.27-5.16; p < 0.007). Current smoker patients had a lower baseline BMI (p < 0.05) and body weight (p < 0.05) compared to former smokers. Compared with nonsmokers, control individuals who were active smokers at entry in the study were younger (p < 0.02) and had lower body weight (p < 0.03) and BMI (p < 0.03). Interestingly, positive lineal correlation was observed between age at diagnosis and daily cigarette consumption (r = 0.72; p < 0.004) in active smokers. We did not detect any relationship either between causes for cessation of smoking and clinical symptoms or between differences in the proportions of smoking habits when patients were stratified according to their clinical status at diagnosis (symptomatic vs subclinical/asymptomatic cases). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that, compared with control subjects, a significantly lower proportion of patients with celiac disease were current smokers at the time of diagnosis, and that cigarette smoking delayed diagnosis of celiac disease. Our study suggests that the nutritional compromise of patients with celiac disease who smoked resulted from the summation of the effect of celiac disease per se and that produced by the smoking habit. Further studies are necessary to identify whether the relationship between smoking and celiac disease is causal or incidental.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Gluten ingestion in coeliac disease is associated with alterations of the intestinal mucosa, especially the expansion of the lamina propria. Antiendomysium and antireticulin antibodies may result from interactions between gliadin and extracellular matrix components. By behaving as autoantigens, connective tissue proteins could initiate mucosal damage. This study evaluates changes in the distribution of laminin, type IV collagen, and fibronectin in the mucosa of patients with coeliac disease in an attempt to explain the alterations of mucosal morphology. METHODS: Intestinal biopsies were obtained from patients with coeliac disease on admission and while on a gluten free diet. The distribution of type IV collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin was evaluated by immunofluorescence and by immunogold labelling and electron microscopy. RESULTS: In patients with coeliac disease, the intensity of type IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin immunofluorescent staining was decreased and less well defined than in controls, with frequent breaches in the basement membrane; fibronectin staining was weak in the distal third of the elongated crypts and absent under the flat surface. The distribution of smooth muscle fibre in the distal lamina propria of flat mucosae was altered. The distribution of these proteins was normal as assessed by immunoelectron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The intensity of staining of some components of the basement membrane is decreased in coeliac disease and the distribution of smooth muscle fibres is altered. These changes may result from interactions between gliadin and components of the extracellular matrix and may play a role in the genesis of mucosal lesions and in the damage to the epithelium.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Duodenal or jejunal biopsies are needed to establish the diagnosis of celiac disease. It is widely advocated that these biopsies be taken from the distal duodenum. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After finding two index cases with diagnostic biopsies taken from the duodenal bulb, we retrospectively analyzed biopsies from the descending duodenum and the duodenal bulb of 51 patients with suspected or diagnosed celiac disease. The diagnosis of celiac disease and classification of the histological changes were performed by one pathologist. RESULTS: In the two index cases the diagnosis of celiac disease could only be established by taking the biopsies from the duodenal bulb, and not from the descending duodenum. In the retrospective analysis the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes was on average higher, but not significantly, in the descending part of the duodenum. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with celiac disease show similar mucosal changes in biopsies taken from the descending part of the duodenum and from the duodenal bulb. But in patients who have already been on a gluten-free diet in childhood and later abandoned their diet, an additional duodenal bulb biopsy should be done.},

   abstract = {The incidence of celiac disease has increased considerably during the last two decades. Celiac Disease is now diagnosed in adults at least as frequently as in children. A prevalence of about 1:200 seems reasonable in central Europe. Besides the typical symptomatic presentation, silent, latent and potential celiac disease are found. Oligo- to asymptomatic courses (silent celiac disease) are increasingly found in all age groups. Endomysial antibodies and tissue-transglutaminase antibodies are sensitive and specific for about 95% of celiac patients. However, the final diagnosis is only done by a - mostly endoscopical - biopsy from the distal part of the duodenum, demonstrating hyperplastic villous atrophy of the mucosa with increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes. The biopsies should be classified histologically according to the modified Marsh criteria. Increased prevalence in family members (10 to 15%) and in associated diseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus) lead to the recommendation of active screening in populations at risk. Although the clinical symptoms are rather variable and different, the response to a lifelong strict gluten free diet is nearly 100%. So-called refractory celiac disease is very rare. There are numerous associated diseases as dermatitis herpetiformis, diabetes mellitus type I, thyroid and neurologic diseases. The most frequent complications are retardation of growth in childhood, early onset osteoporosis, and an increased risk of abortions. The most severe complication is intestinal lymphoma. Especially patients with late diagnosis and bad dietary adherence are at risk. A regular follow-up of patients, rather with antibody tests than with duodenal biopsies is recommended to test and secure dietary compliance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about the clinical and immunological features of coeliac disease patients with neurological disorders. In a large series of adult coeliac disease patients, we investigated the prevalence of neurological disorders and anti-neuronal antibodies, along with the clinical course. METHODS: Neurological symptoms were investigated in 160 consecutive patients (120 F, 40 M) with biopsy-proven coeliac disease. Anti-neuronal antibodies to central/enteric nervous systems were investigated in all neurological patients, 20 unaffected ones and 20 controls. RESULTS: Thirteen (8%) patients had neurological disorders, including epilepsy (n = 3), attention/memory impairment (n = 3), cerebellar ataxia (n = 2), peripheral neuropathy (n = 2), multiple sclerosis (n = 1), Moyamoya disease (n = 1) and Steinert's disease (n = 1). No significant demographic or clinical differences (gastrointestinal or other gluten-related signs) were found between patients with and without neurological involvement. In all but 2 of the 13 cases, the neurological disorder preceded diagnosis ofcoeliac disease. Neurological symptoms improved or disappeared in 7 patients who started a gluten-free diet within 6 months after neurological onset, and in none of 4 patients who began later. Prevalence of central nervous system anti-neuronal antibodies was significantly higher in neurological (61%) than in other patients (5%) (P = 0.0007) or controls (0%) (P = 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease can sometimes present in the guise of a neurological disorder, which may greatly improve when a gluten-free diet is started promptly. Therefore, the possible presence of coeliac disease needs to be carefully considered in patients with cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, attention/memory impairment or peripheral neuropathy.},

METHODS: Immunoglobulin A endomysial, human and guinea pig tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and immunoglobulin A and G gliadin antibodies were sought in 255 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. RESULTS: Immunoglobulin A endomysial and human tissue transglutaminase antibodies were positive in nine patients (seven primary biliary cirrhosis, one autoimmune cholangitis, and one primary sclerosing cholangitis), whose duodenal biopsy results showed villous atrophy consistent with CD. Two of these patients had a malabsorption syndrome, and one had iron-deficiency anemia. Clinical and biochemical signs of cholestasis did not improve after gluten withdrawal in the three patients with severe liver disease. A longer follow-up of the six celiac patients with mild liver damage is needed to clarify whether gluten restriction can contribute to slow down the progression of liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of CD (3.5%) in autoimmune cholestasis suggests that serological screening for CD should be routinely performed in such patients by immunoglobulin A endomysial or human tissue transglutaminase antibodies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is a common problem in persons with cystic fibrosis causing malabsorption and poor growth. The 72-hour fecal fat study is the best qualitative measure of fat malabsorption used in clinical practice. This test has several drawbacks, which include cost and logistics. The steatocrit has been proposed as a rapid method to assess fat malabsorption. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine whether the steatocrit is an accurate estimation of fat malabsorption in persons with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: Forty-nine stool samples for steatocrit processing were obtained from 72-hour fecal fat collections performed on twenty-seven persons with cystic fibrosis. Stools were weighed and homogenized with sand and water. The emulsified specimen was pipetted into heparinized capillary tubes and centrifuged for 15 minutes. The length of the fatty layer was compared to the length of the solid layer plus the fatty layer in each tube to determine the steatocrit value. Four steatocrit mixtures were evaluated: (1) standard steatocrit, (2) dilute steatocrit, (3) acid steatocrit, (4) dilute acid steatocrit. Steatocrit values were compared with the coefficient of fat absorption determined from the 72-hour fecal fat collection. RESULTS: The correlation coefficient of the steatocrit and the coefficient of fat absorption ranged from -.045 to -.491. Only the coefficient of fat absorption and the acid steatocrit had a significant correlation ( = 0.033). CONCLUSION: The steatocrit is an imprecise measure of fat absorption and not clinically useful in estimating steatorrhea.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In patients with signs and symptoms of malabsorption, suggestive of gluten-sensitive enteropathy, small intestinal biopsies sometimes only reveal infiltration of lymphocytes into the mucosal epithelium. This infiltrative lesion (Marsh I) is not a definite proof for gluten-sensitive enteropathy. However, in the present study, we aimed to show that a subgroup of these patients could ultimately be identified as being gluten sensitive. METHODS: A total of 38 patients with a Marsh I lesion were subjected to a gluten challenge comprising 30 g of gluten added daily to a normal gluten-containing diet for 8 wk. Before and after the challenge, small intestinal biopsies were taken, and symptoms and signs of malabsorption were scored. RESULTS: In 12 patients we demonstrated a significant change in mucosal histopathology, i.e., subtotal villous atrophy (Marsh IIIB, n = 1), partial villous atrophy (Marsh 3A, n = 6) or infiltrative-crypthyperplastic lesions (Marsh II, n = 5). In the other 26 patients, the small intestinal mucosa remained unchanged. After initiation of a gluten-free diet, follow-up small intestinal biopsies in 12 patients who initially had progressive mucosal pathology after gluten challenge showed normalization of mucosal pathology in seven cases, regression to a Marsh I lesion in four, and to a Marsh II lesion in one. Symptom relief was seen in all 12 patients. Ten of 26 patients without histological response to the gluten challenge were motivated to adhere to a gluten-free diet. Follow-up biopsies revealed unchanged Marsh I lesions in eight patients and normalization (Marsh 0) in two patients. Three patients had follow-up biopsies while on a normal diet. All had unchanged Marsh I lesions. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study we demonstrated that a gluten challenge might be useful in identifying patients as being sensitive to gluten if initial small intestinal biopsies reveal only minor abnormalities.},

To investigate the influence of maldigestion on PYY, we determined plasma PYY levels in patients with celiac disease under basal conditions and in response to intraduodenal fat. Basal PYY was increased in untreated celiac patients (N = 13) compared to patients on a gluten free diet (N = 9) [15.6 (11.8-27.0) pM vs 12.2 (10.1-13.1) pM; P < 0.05] and compared to control subjects (N = 15) [9.5 (8.3-10.4) pM; P < 0.001]. Integrated PYY in response to intraduodenally infused predigested fat (1071+/-293 pM 80 min) was significantly (P < 0.05) greater than in response to undigested fat (322+/-223 pM 80 min) in six untreated celiacs. Plasma concentrations of PYY and cholecystokinin were strongly correlated (r = 0.79; P < 0.001). We conclude that basal PYY levels in untreated celiac disease are elevated, that predigestion of fat enhances PYY release in these patients, and that PYY secretion is correlated with CCK release.},

Of patients with Marsh IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC lesions, histologic remission was seen in 65.0% within 2 years, 85.3% within 5 years, and 89.9% in long-term follow-up. Eleven patients (7.0%) with persisting (partial) villous atrophy had symptoms and signs of malabsorption and were considered to have refractory celiac disease; 5 of them developed an enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Children recovered up to 95% within 2 years and 100% in the long-term. Histologic recovery in celiac disease after starting a gluten-free diet takes time and is incomplete or absent in a substantial subgroup of patients (10.1% villous atrophy after 5 years). Systematic follow-up of patients with celiac disease and the malabsorption syndrome and secondary complications is needed.},

   abstract = {Patients with villous atrophy due to coeliac disease have an increased risk of developing small intestinal malignancies. Intestinal glutathione (GSH) and glutathione S-transferases (GST) are involved in the protection against carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate GSH content and GST enzyme activity in small intestinal mucosa of untreated coeliacs compared to controls. We evaluated GSH content and GST enzyme activity, including the levels of GST classes alpha, mu, pi and theta, in small intestinal biopsies of untreated coeliacs (flat mucosa, Marsh IIIC, n = 12) compared to normal subjects (n = 23). Next, we evaluated GSH and GST's in coeliacs in remission (Marsh 0 - I, n = 11), coeliacs with persisting villous atrophy while on a gluten-free diet (partial villous atrophy, Marsh IIIA (n = 5); subtotal villous atrophy, Marsh IIIB (n = 6)) and patients with infiltrative / crypt-hyperplastic Marsh II lesions (n = 4). Total GST enzyme activity and content of GSTalpha are markedly suppressed in Marsh IIIC lesions compared to controls (resp. 220 +/- 79 vs. 464 +/- 189 nmol / mg protein*min (P < 0.001) and 2.79 +/- 2.46 vs. 6.47 +/- 2.29 mg / mg protein (P < 0.001)). In coeliacs in remission these levels normalized. Total GST enzyme activity and GSTalpha levels are proportionately lowered according to the degree of mucosal pathology in Marsh II, IIIA and IIIB. (Spearman's sigma correlation coefficient for total GST, -0.596, P < 0.001; GSTalpha, -0.620, P < 0.001). GSTmu, pi and theta and GSH levels are not significantly different in the selected study groups of mucosal pathology compared to controls. Total GST enzyme activity and content of GSTalpha in small intestinal mucosa are significantly lower in untreated coeliac disease compared to controls. In Marsh II, IIIA and IIIB, GST enzyme activity and GSTalpha content are proportionally lower according to the degree of mucosal pathology. Normal values are seen in coeliacs in remission. This correlation between coeliac disease and a suppressed GSH / GST detoxification system may explain in part the carcinogenic risk in untreated coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Abdominal symptoms in the absence of mucosal abnormalities are features of both the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and latent/potential celiac disease (cd). To identify a possible subgroup of IBS patients with latent/potential cd, surrogate markers of cd were investigated in IBS patients. METHODS: IBS patients suffering from diarrhea (n = 102), and patients with active cd (n = 10), treated cd (n = 26), and latent cd (n = 5) were included in the study. We measured serum immunoglobulin (Ig) A against gliadin and tissue-transglutaminase, and IgA and IgM against gliadin, tissue-transglutaminase (intestinal cd-associated antibodies), and the dietary proteins beta-lactoglobulin and ovalbumin in duodenal aspirate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were counted in histology sections, and the expression of HLA-DQ2 (A1*0501/B1*0201) was investigated by polymerase chain reaction. In 26 IBS patients, the effect of 6 months of gluten withdrawal was examined. RESULTS: Most cd patients expressed HLA-DQ2 and had increased intestinal cd-associated antibodies, whereas cd-associated serum IgA and IEL counts were increased in active cd in contrast to treated or latent cd. In IBS patients, 35% were HLA-DQ2-positive, 23% had increased IEL counts, and 0% and 30% had increased cd-associated antibodies in serum and duodenal aspirate, respectively. Furthermore, stool frequency and intestinal IgA decreased significantly under a gluten-free diet in the subgroups of HLA-DQ2-positive and intestinal antibody-positive IBS patients when compared with IBS patients without these markers. CONCLUSIONS: HLA-DQ2 expression and increased intestinal cd-associated antibodies are markers that can identify latent/potential cd in a subgroup of IBS patients who consequently appear to profit from a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {There is growing awareness that primary gastrointestinal pathology may play an important role in the inception and clinical expression of some childhood developmental disorders, including autism. In addition to frequent gastrointestinal symptoms, children with autism often manifest complex biochemical and immunological abnormalities. The gut-brain axis is central to certain encephalopathies of extra-cranial origin, hepatic encephalopathy being the best characterized. Commonalities in the clinical characteristics of hepatic encephalopathy and a form of autism associated with developmental regression in an apparently previously normal child, accompanied by immune-mediated gastrointestinal pathology, have led to the proposal that there may be analogous mechanisms of toxic encephalopathy in patients with liver failure and some children with autism. Aberrations in opioid biochemistry are common to these two conditions, and there is evidence that opioid peptides may mediate certain aspects of the respective syndromes. The generation of plausible and testable hypotheses in this area may help to identify new treatment options in encephalopathies of extra-cranial origin. Therapeutic targets for this autistic phenotype may include: modification of diet and entero-colonic microbial milieu in order to reduce toxin substrates, improve nutritional status and modify mucosal immunity; anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory therapy; and specific treatment of dysmotility, focusing, for example, on the pharmacology of local opioid activity in the gut.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fecal elastase-1 (E1) is a sensitive and reliable test in the assessment of exocrine pancreatic function in cystic fibrosis (CF). In patients with celiac disease (CD), different E1 values have been reported. E1 levels in other malabsorption conditions are unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate E1 concentrations in various malabsorption syndromes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out in 54 patients, selected from patients referred with suspicion of CF, who had been diagnosed as celiac disease (CD; n = 16), secondary malabsorption syndrome (SMS, giardiasis- or cow milk-related enteropathy; n = 18) and food allergy (FA; n = 20). 70 age-matched healthy children (HC) and 131 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients served as control groups. In CD and SMS patients, a gluten-free diet was introduced. In addition, SMS patients were treated appropriately to underlying disease. In all subjects, E1 concentrations were measured. In CD and SMS patients, E1 concentrations were repeatedly measured after one year of the treatment. RESULTS: With a cut-off level of 200 microg g-1, abnormal E1 concentrations were found in 87.2% of the CF group and in 56.2% and 50.0% of the CD and SMS subgroups, respectively. In none of FA patients, were E1 values below the normal range. After mucosal recovery, E1 concentrations in patients with CD and SMS increased, suggesting that villous atrophy can diminish exocrine pancreatic secretion. In 18 out of 19 CD and SMS patients with abnormal E1 concentrations, monitored for at least 12 months of a gluten-free diet, abnormal E1 concentrations increased above the cut-off value to normal range. Two out of the 54 referred patients were finally diagnosed as having CF, one with stable low E1 levels and the second with finally normal values. CONCLUSIONS: The exocrine pancreatic function is decreased in villous atrophy regardless of underlying disease. The specificity of the fecal elastase-1 test in the differentiation between 'primary' exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and intestinal malabsorption with mucosal atrophy is low. After mucosal regeneration, fecal elastase-1 specificity is high.},

DESIGN: Sera from 196 children suspected to suffer from coeliac disease were analysed for these antibodies. METHODS: A total of 233 serum samples were obtained simultaneously with a biopsy. Coeliac disease was confirmed in 37 (19%) patients. Antibodies against guinea pig transglutaminase were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); endomysial antibodies were determined by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: In 17 samples, immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-transglutaminase levels were increased; 16 of these came from coeliac patients. High levels correlated with high prediagnostic or challenge-related gluten intake. The additional anti-transglutaminase-positive patient was assumed to suffer from sequelae to gastroenteritis. CONCLUSIONS: Raised IgA anti-transglutaminase levels were correlated with presence of coeliac disease. Negative tests were seen in some coeliac patients when on a gluten-containing diet. The IgA anti-transglutaminase test using guinea pig antigen was less sensitive than anti-endomysial antibodies but rather specific for active coeliac disease. In our study, anti-endomysial antibodies were more specific than anti-transglutaminase antibodies for active coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Clinically, celiac disease has always been regarded as a wasting, malabsorptive disorder due to disease of the small intestinal mucosa. It has been difficult for clinicians to recognize that this condition is primarily due to sensitization of mesenteric T lymphocytes to wheat protein (gluten) in genetically predisposed (DQ2+) individuals. On contact with dietary-derived gluten in the upper intestine, these sensitized T lymphocytes are activated leading to inflammation of and morphologically altered mucosal architecture: the latter reverts to normal with a gluten-free diet. The circulation of sensitized T lymphocytes to other parts of the intestinal mucosa explains why identical immunopathological inflammation can be induced in ileal and rectal mucosa. It appears, then, that in predisposed DQ2+ subjects, mesenteric T lymphocytes recognize gluten as foreign (non-self) antigen, thereby inducing mucosal pathology secondary to the initiating lymphocyte-protein interaction, analogously to the mucosal lesions that typify graft-vs-host reactions, or nematode or Giaraia infestations. Today, as this article describes, we recognize that celiac disease often exists in a subclinical, or "compensated-latent," form, or with symptoms that do not immediately suggest an origin in the gastrointestinal tract.},

   abstract = {Dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease are gluten sensitive diseases, which have common immunopathological and genetic mechanisms. Neuropsychiatric complications have been reported in up to 26% of patients with coeliac disease. This is probably an overestimate, because of the chance associations with some common neurological conditions such as epilepsy. The pathogenesis is speculative but it has been postulated that gluten is neurotoxic possibly via immune mechanisms. The frequency of neurological dysfunction in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis has not been characterised. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis might be expected to be particularly susceptible to neuronal damage as some continue to consume gluten when their dermatological symptoms are controlled by dapsone. Thirty five patients were recruited with dermatitis herpetiformis from dermatology clinics at St Mary's Hospital, London and Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham and investigated for evidence of neurological abnormality. All patients underwent a full neurological examination and were asked about their neurological and general medical history by means of a structured questionnaire. Serum samples were taken and screened for the presence of anti-neuronal antibodies (anti-Hu and Yo) as well as anti-gliadin (IgA and G) anti-endomysial (IgA), and anti-tissue transglutaminase (IgA) antibodies. Neurophysiological tests were carried out where appropriate. Only two patients were identified with unexplained neurological abnormalities (one essential tremor, and one chorea). Two other patients had a history of migraine. The patient with chorea also had borderline/equivocally positive anti-Hu antibodies by immunofluorescence assay. All other samples were negative for anti-neuronal antibodies. Fifteen patients were positive for anti-gliadin antibodies (IgA and/or IgG), four for anti-endomysial antibodies (monkey oesophagus or umbilical cord), and six for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. The presence of these antibodies did not correlate with the presence of neurological abnormalities. No cases of "gluten ataxia" were identified. In conclusion, there was no convincing evidence for immune mediated neurological damage in this pilot study of dermatitis herpetiformis.},

An immunopathology is suspected. A number of neurological syndromes may be associated with coeliac disease but it is unclear whether these are directly or indirectly caused by gluten ingestion. It has been proposed that idiopathic ataxias and central nervous system white matter disease are gluten-sensitive syndromes. This is an exciting hypothesis because it offers new therapeutic possibilities including simple exclusion diets. However, interpretation is difficult because occult sub-clinical coeliac disease occurs commonly and background prevalence needs to be accounted for in population-based studies.

METHODS: Thirty hybrid pigs were used as donors and recipients. A renoportal end-to-end anastomosis between the left renal vein and the distal end of the portal vein was performed. Two vascular end-to-side anastomoses between the donor portal vein and recipient inferior vena cava, and between the donor aortic segment including the celiac and superior mesenteric, and left renal arteries and recipient abdominal aorta were carried out. Pancreas exocrine secretion drainage was established with duodenocystostomy. Ureterostomosis of the graft was performed. Urine amylase level, fasting blood glucose and urine volumes of kidney allograft were monitored, and pathological changes of graft were observed. RESULTS: Of 15 recipients, 2 died of disturbance of internal environment and anastomotic bleeding, respectively. Satisfactory results were obtained in the remaining 13 recipients. The changes of urine amylase concentration were prior to those of fasting blood glucose and urine volumes of kidney allograft. The degree of rejection of the kidney allograft was more severe than that of the pancreas and duodenum allograft. CONCLUSIONS: Urine amylase is the early marker of acute rejection in SPKT with bladder drainage of pancreatic exocrine secretion. The pathological change of kidney allograft is most significant in SPKT.},
