   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate state and trait form of anxiety and current depression in patients affected by gastrointestinal diseases. METHODS: We studied 1641 outpatients with gastrointestinal disorders, consecutively referred to our Internal Medicine outpatients from 1997 to 2005. State and trait anxiety were assessed by the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory. Current depression was assessed by the Zung self-rating depression scale. RESULTS: Among patients, 1379 (84.1%) showed state anxiety, 1098 (67%) showed trait anxiety and 442 (27%) showed current depression. The number of gastrointestinal diseases was directly correlated to state anxiety (p < 0.001) and trait anxiety (p = 0.04). Females showed higher levels of anxiety and depression than males (p < 0.001). State anxiety was related to food allergies (p < 0.001), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) (p = 0.001), Hp infection (p = 0.01) and ulcerative colitis in active phase (p = 0.03). Trait anxiety was related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (p < 0.001), Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection (p = 0.001), food allergies (p = 0.001) and SIBO (p = 0.001). Current depression was related to IBS (p < 0.001) and coeliac disease (p = 0.01), SIBO (p = 0.02). A predicted probability of 0.77 +/- 0.16 to have state anxiety, of 0.66 +/- 0.12 to have trait anxiety and of 0.39 +/- 0.14 to have depression was found in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients who seek medical consultation for gastrointestinal problems show an associated affective disorder. These patients should be managed by a team including gastroenterologists, psychologists and/or psychiatrists, or by a gastroenterologist having expertise in the treatment of psychological disorders.},

   abstract = {Introduction and expression of foreign genes in bacteria often results accumulation of the foreign protein(s) in inclusion bodies (IBs). The subsequent processes of refolding are slow, difficult and often fail to yield significant amounts of folded protein. RHG1 encoded by rhg1 was a soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) transmembrane receptor-like kinase (EC 2.7.11.1) with an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain. The LRR of RHG1 was believed to be involved in elicitor recognition and interaction with other plant proteins. The aim, here, was to express the LRR domain in Escherichia coli (RHG1-LRR) and produce refolded protein. Urea titration experiments showed that the IBs formed in E. coli by the extracellular domain of the RHG1 protein could be solubilized at different urea concentrations. The RHG1 proteins were eluted with 1.0-7.0M urea in 0.5M increments. Purified RHG1 protein obtained from the 1.5 and 7.0M elutions was analyzed for secondary structure through circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Considerable secondary structure could be seen in the former, whereas the latter yielded CD curves characteristic of denatured proteins. Both elutions were subjected to refolding by slowly removing urea in the presence of arginine and reduced/oxidized glutathione. Detectable amounts of refolded protein could not be recovered from the 7.0M urea sample, whereas refolding from the 1.5M urea sample yielded 0.2mg/ml protein. The 7.0M treatment resulted in the formation of a homogenous denatured state with no apparent secondary structure. Refolding from this fully denatured state may confer kinetic and/or thermodynamic constraints on the refolding process, whereas the kinetic and/or thermodynamic barriers to attain the folded conformation appeared to be lesser, when refolding from a partially folded state.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A sensation of abdominal swelling (bloating) and actual increase in girth (distension) are troublesome features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is more common in patients with constipation, especially those with delayed transit. AIM: To establish whether a fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 reduces distension in association with acceleration of gastrointestinal transit and improvement of symptoms in IBS with constipation. METHODS: A single centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel group study in which patients consumed the test product or control product for 4 weeks. Distension, orocaecal and colonic transit and IBS symptoms were assessed on an intention-to-treat population of 34 patients. RESULTS: Compared with control product, the test product resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage change in maximal distension [median difference - 39%, 95% CI (-78, -5); P = 0.02] and a trend towards reduced mean distension during the day [-1.52 cm (-3.33, 0.39); P = 0.096]. An acceleration of orocaecal [-1.2 h (-2.3,0); P = 0.049] as well as colonic [-12.2 h (-22.8, -1.6); P = 0.026] transit was observed and overall symptom severity [-0.5 (-1.0, -0.05); P = 0.032] also improved. CONCLUSIONS: This probiotic resulted in improvements in objectively measured abdominal girth and gastrointestinal transit, as well as reduced symptomatology. These data support the concept that accelerating transit is a useful strategy for treating distension.},

METHODS: Patients were randomized to a prebiotic (n=135), or a symbiotic formulation containing Lactobacillus paracasei B21060 (Flortec, n=132). Primary efficacy was the responder rate for pain and global relief of symptoms in the overall population and in patients with predominant diarrhea (n=47). Post hoc time-trend analyses for changes within each treatment were carried out. RESULTS: Patients with absent/mild pain amounted to 54.7% in the symbiotic group and to 57.4% in the prebiotic group at treatment week 4, and to 53.9% and 53.4% at the end of treatment. Patients with amelioration of well-being were, respectively, 60.7% versus 61.7% at treatment week 4, and 63.3% versus 60.9% at the end of treatment. Within each treatment group, patients with absent/mild pain increased in the Flortec and the prebiotic group, but time trend analyses were significant only for Flortec (P=0.019). In IBS-predominant diarrhea, Flortec significantly reduced bowel movements, pain, and IBS scores. CONCLUSIONS: To improve pain and well-being, Flortec is encouraging in patients with diarrhea predominant IBS. To establish its efficacy for the majority of IBS patients, Flortec has to be compared with an inert placebo in future work.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as defined by Rome III diagnostic criteria, affects 10-20% of the general population, with women 20-40 years old accounting for the majority of patients. Although variable and intermittent, IBS symptoms may persist for many years. Repeated referrals for medical consultation and diagnostic studies generate huge healthcare costs. Since there is no evidence that IBS leads to more severe gastrointestinal disorders, in absence of alarm symptoms or signs, an invasive diagnostic algorithm is not indicated. Optimal treatment for IBS still needs to be defined. The clinical approach is based on treatment of the prevalent symptom. When pain predominates, antispasmodics are the first choice. In case of diarrhea, loperamide is useful for reducing bowel frequency. Soluble fiber represents the first option in subjects with IBS and constipation or mixed IBS. Dietary integrators composed of probiotics and serotonin precursors are a promising therapeutic option.},

   abstract = {Growing evidence suggests a potential role of intestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) pathophysiology and symptom generation. Earlier studies based on classic microbiologic techniques hypothesized the presence of qualitative changes in intestinal microbiota in IBS patients. Recently, studies with molecular techniques have provided evidence of significant changes in microbial profiles in IBS and that the composition may be correlated with certain symptoms reported by patients. Although these studies are far from being exhaustive and conclusive they provide promising results that deserve further investigation. In addition, initial evidence indicated the presence of increased amounts of bacteria in the upper small intestine of IBS patients, a condition know as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. However, the results of these studies have provided contradictory results suggesting that this area requires further work. These qualitative and quantitative changes in intestinal microbiota may induce different effects on the intestinal mucosa including mucosal barrier defects and immune activation which may contribute to symptom generation. Studies in IBS patients have attempted to target changes in intestinal microflora with different therapeutic approaches, such as the use of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and nonabsorbable and systemic antibiotics. Overall, the results obtained in probiotic clinical trials suggest some beneficial effect over placebo in the relief of IBS symptoms. However, these results, although encouraging, should be confirmed in larger well-designed, placebo-controlled studies. A number of open questions remain to be addressed, including the dose, type, and time of administration of probiotics.},

METHODS: 18 patients with IBS (Rome II criteria), who showed an early rise in breath hydrogen with lactulose (ERBHAL), consumed 65 mL of Yakult daily for 6 wk. Lactulose breath test was repeated at the end of the treatment period. Symptoms were recorded daily using a 10 cm visual analogue scale. RESULTS: 14 patients completed the study, 9 (64%) had reversal of ERBHAL, with the median time of first rise in breath hydrogen increasing from 45 to 75 min (P = 0.03). There was no significant improvement in the symptom score with probiotic therapy, except for wind (P = 0.04). Patients commencing with at least moderate symptoms and who no longer had ERBHAL at the end of treatment, showed improvement in the overall symptoms scores [median final score 5.3 (IQR 3.9-5.9), 55% reduction; n = 6] to a greater extent than those who had had persisting ERBHAL [final score 6.9 (5.0-7.0), 12% reduction; n = 5; P = 0.18]. CONCLUSION: Yakult is effective in altering fermentation patterns in the small bowel, consistent with reducing SIBO. The loss of ERBHAL was associated with reduced symptoms. The true interpretation of these findings awaits a randomised, controlled trial.},

While the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome remains unknown, knowledge regarding the normal and abnormal functions of the gut and its complex interactions with the body's nervous systems continue to shed light on the multifactiorial origins of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This article provides an overview of the current knowledge on the therapeutic approaches to irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: A search of the online bibliographic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed in order to identify all relevant articles published between 1980 and 2008. The search was enhanced with the use of a medical librarian. Bibliographies from potentially relevant articles were manually searched. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic options for irritable bowel syndrome are rapidly evolving beyond traditional symptom-based therapies, such as fiber, antispasmodics, antidiarrheals and laxatives and are moving towards agents with organ-specific receptor selectivity directed, in many cases, at specific gastrointestinal functions.},

This risk is particularly high in case disease and patient characteristics demonstrate a wide variation, such as in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We compared IBS patients who were selected, approached, and randomized to participate in a clinical trial assessing the efficacy of dietary fiber therapy in IBS. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective survey in primary care patients diagnosed with IBS by their general practitioner in the past 2 years selected and invited for participation in a trial. Characteristics were compared between randomized patients (n=193) nonrandomized eligible patients (n=371), and patients not eligible for participating in the trial (n=724). RESULTS: Of the 2,100 IBS patients, 1,288 (61%) returned the questionnaire. Randomized patients had a higher intensity of IBS abdominal pain as compared to the other groups, a higher consultation rate and a longer IBS disease history. Noneligible patients had less active IBS symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Patients randomized do differ from those nonrandomized in IBS disease characteristics. These observations may have implications for the applicability of our research outcome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to extend a previous 2-week assessment of a probiotic-prebiotic complex in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: In this open-label, partially controlled, 1-year (14 [2] months) extension study, data were collected from patients with IBS who continued treatment following a 2-week study of the efficacy of the probiotic-prebiotic complex. Data were collected at 2 and approximately 60 weeks after the end of the original study. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients entered the 2-week extension and 22 completed the approximately 60-week follow-up study (20 women, 2 men; age range, 20-70 years; all white). Results in the control group 2 weeks after crossover to treatment were similar to those from the original study, with reductions in IBS subsyndromes, as follows: general ill feelings/nausea (P < 0.001), indigestion/flatulence (P < 0.001), and marginally colitis (P < 0.03 [1-tailed]). Treatment was associated with a continued reduction in general ill feelings/nausea at 4 weeks (P < 0.007). At >or=52-week follow-up, the rate of remissions was 81.5% to 100% (P < 0.003). CONCLUSION: Based on the results from the present 1-year extension study, treatment with this probiotic-prebiotic complex may be an option for short-term (2-4 weeks) and long-term ( approximately 60-week) reductions in IBS symptoms.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects a significant proportion of the North American population; however, the etiology and pathophysiology of this disease remain poorly understood, and treatment is focused on symptom management. Over the years, research has revealed that the bacterial flora in the human gut interact with the bowel in a complex and dynamic relationship and may be responsible for the induction and progression of some of the pathophysiologic aspects of IBS. Probiotics are nonpathogenic bacteria that benefit the host, and the roles they can play in the bacterio-gut relationship provide hope of a safe treatment that would allow for modulation of IBS disease states. Probiotic treatment for IBS has undergone significant exploration, yet the exact therapeutic effects and doses of these beneficial bacteria remain unclear due to the conflicting nature of available evidence. This review discusses the evidence from randomized controlled trials on probiotic treatment of IBS and presents the current understanding of the mechanisms of action of probiotics as they apply to IBS and provides a plausible explanation for the variability in evidence documented by the various trials under review.},

   abstract = {The authors conducted a well-designed, multinational, large study of women younger than 65 yr of age with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with a mixed pattern of diarrhea and constipation (IBS-M) or constipation (IBS-C) and showed that a statistically greater percentage of patients in each group responded to tegaserod compared with patients treated with placebo. Practicality looms large, however, in that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) disallowed the continued marketing of tegaserod because of cardiovascular safety concerns, and it now is only available under a restricted access program. The wisdom of this decision aside, it is disturbing that the FDA revealed a zero-tolerance for any significant risk of disease when a drug (e.g., tegaserod) was used for a nonlife-threatening condition; the FDA chose to neglect any potential benefit of significant improvement in quality of life, while at the same time allowing the continued availability of sildenifil for erectile dysfunction and other medications (e.g., rosiglitazone and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), each with a far greater risk of cardiovascular complications. Whether tegaserod will be re-released and, if so, under what conditions, is yet to be determined, as is the question of whether the FDA will decide to allow a more transparent decision-making process with input from all interested parties affected by their decision.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Release of serotonin from mucosal enterochromaffin cells triggered by luminal substances is the key event in the regulation of gut motility and secretion. We were interested to know whether nasal olfactory receptors are also expressed in the human gut mucosa by enterochromaffin cells and whether their ligands and odorants present in spices, fragrances, detergents, and cosmetics cause serotonin release. METHODS: Receptor expression was studied by the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction method in human mucosal enterochromaffin cells isolated by laser microdissection and in a cell line derived from human enterochromaffin cells. Activation of the cells by odorants was investigated by digital fluorescence imaging using the fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator Fluo-4. Serotonin release was measured in culture supernatants by a serotonin enzyme immunoassay and amperometry using carbon fiber microelectrodes placed on single cells. RESULTS: We found expression of 4 olfactory receptors in microdissected human mucosal enterochromaffin cells and in a cell line derived from human enterochromaffin cells. Ca(2+) imaging studies revealed that odorant ligands of the identified olfactory receptors cause Ca(2+) influx, elevation of intracellular free Ca(2+) levels, and, consequently, serotonin release. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that odorants present in the luminal environment of the gut may stimulate serotonin release via olfactory receptors present in human enterochromaffin cells. Serotonin controls both gut motility and secretion and is implicated in pathologic conditions such as vomiting, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome. Thus, olfactory receptors are potential novel targets for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and motility disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Registrational studies of patients treated with tegaserod for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) suggest an increased risk for cholecystectomy versus treatment with placebo. OBJECTIVE: To study cholecystectomy rates in association with tegaserod within a large administrative medical claims database. METHODS: Patients were drawn from a large population within the US with commercial medical insurance. The primary analysis consisted of a comparison of the observed incidence rate for cholecystectomy claims among a large cohort of new-to-therapy tegaserod users with an incidence rate published for tegaserod-naive patients classified with IBS within the same insured population. RESULTS: An inception cohort of 7475 individuals with up to 103 weeks of claims history following initiation of therapy with tegaserod was identified. After a follow-up of 3 months (and thus similar to the longest registrational trials), the observed cholecystectomy incidence rate was 340 per 10,000 person-years (95% CI 258, 442). The rate of cholecystectomy was highest in the earliest months of observation following initiation of tegaserod. The observed cholecystecomy incidence rate is 2.9 times higher than an IBS-specific rate of 119 per 10,000 person-years as published for patients so classified within the same insured population. CONCLUSION: Based on a large, inception cohort, we report a strong temporal association between the initiation of tegaserod therapy and an increased rate for cholecystectomy. The effect size at 3 months was similar to the relative risk for cholecystectomy reported in registrational studies comparing tegaserod with placebo. As misclassification of initial diagnosis for patients presenting with biliary colic-like symptoms may occur, precise measurements of tegaserod-related relative risk for cholecystectomy from observational studies are problematic and will require prospective studies.},

We investigated whether allergic patients are more prone to constipation or IBS. In a multicenter study, two groups of outpatient children aged 3-13 years were included. In group 1, children with allergic symptoms were enrolled. Group 2 consisted of nonallergic children. In both groups, the assessment of IBS and constipation was carried out using a questionnaire based on the Rome criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders. All children were examined and underwent skin prick tests (SPT) to foods and aeroallergens. The allergic group (n=196) and controls (n=127) were comparable with respect to sex, age, and anthropometric parameters. IBS was found in 6.6% of the allergic children and in 6.3% of the controls (p=0.581). The frequency of constipation was similar in the two groups. In allergic children, positive SPTs to food and self-reported reactions to food were associated with IBS. Our results show that evaluation of constipation comorbidity is not required in allergic children. In allergic children with positive SPT to foods attention may be paid to IBS symptoms.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in our understanding of basic neuroenteric mechanisms and the role of effectors and transmitters in the brain-gut axis have provided opportunities to develop new therapeutic agents for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Furthermore, human pharmacodynamic studies utilizing transit, colonic, or rectal sensitivity and brain imaging have been useful in determining therapeutic efficacy (particularly for drugs that act on motor function). This review provides an overview of medications that have not yet been approved for treatment of patients with IBS yet have shown promise in phase IIB trials. These include drugs that act on the serotonin receptor and transporter system: antidepressants, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, opioids, cholecystokinin antagonists, neurokinin-antagonists, chloride channel activators, guanylate cyclase C agonists, atypical benzodiazepines, probiotics, and antibiotics. The changing landscape in the regulatory approval process has impacted the development of IBS drugs. Guidance documents from regulatory agencies in Europe and the United States have focused on patients' reported outcomes and associated quality of life. After a decade of experience with different end points that have generated some data on psychometric validation and unprecedented information about responsiveness of the binary or global end points to drug therapy, it is necessary to pursue further validation studies before or during pivotal phase IIB or III trials. The hope of providing relief to patients should galvanize all parties to achieve these goals.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that confer a health benefit to the host when administered in adequate amounts. In addition to human health benefits, probiotics can improve various aspects of growth and performance in livestock and poultry, as well as control undesirable microorganisms in food animals. Studies indicate that probiotics can prevent or treat certain conditions, including atopic disease in infants, food allergy, infection after surgery, acute diarrhea, and symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Understanding the complete mechanism, effectiveness, and potential use of probiotics is limited by the availability and sensitivity of current methods (i.e., culturing techniques). In recent years, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarrays have become prominent and promising methods to examine quantitative changes of specific members of the microbial community and the influence of probiotics on the structure and function of human and animal intestinal ecosystems. Culture-independent studies have established that only a fraction of organisms present in feces are cultivable, therefore, results obtained by cultivation are limited. Conversely, in-depth knowledge of microbial genomes has enabled real-time PCR and microarrays to be more sensitive and has resulted in precise methods for comprehensive analysis of the complex gut microbiota. Additionally, these technologies can assess the influence of intestinal microorganisms on host metabolism, nutrient status, and disease. This paper reviews method technologies and applications of real-time PCR and microarray assays as they relate to the effect and use of probiotics on the intestinal microbiota and gastrointestinal disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition associated with no certain organic cause, though diet and stress are widely implicated. The condition is frustrating for both sufferers and doctors, and there are problems in diagnosing and treating the condition. Eliciting explanatory models (EMs) is a useful tool for understanding how individuals relate to their illnesses and their expectations for treatment, particularly for illnesses with uncertain aetiology like IBS. OBJECTIVES: To understand the EMs, experiences and expectations for management of patients with IBS. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 51 primary care patients (31 in the UK, 20 in The Netherlands) meeting the Rome II diagnostic criteria for IBS. RESULTS: Although IBS often had a significant dampening effect on daily life, IBS patients made great efforts not to allow the condition to take over their lives. Triggers of symptoms were more important to patients than understanding the underlying aetiology of IBS. Diet and stress were both recognized as important triggers, but views about which foods were problematic and the extent to which stress was modifiable were inconsistent. Diagnosis and treatment were often a confusing and frustrating process, and patients often expected more diagnostic tests than they were offered before receiving a diagnosis of IBS. However, the often poor outcome of medical interventions does not, in general, appear to have a negative impact on the patient-doctor relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the extensive impact of IBS on sufferers' daily life and the frustration that results from repeatedly trying treatments with little effect. Clearly explaining the guidelines for diagnosing IBS and the range of treatment options may help patients to make sense of the diagnostic and treatment processes. The personal EM should be addressed during the consultation with the IBS patient, ensuring that any successive medical interventions match with the patients' disease perception.},

A logistic regression model that adjusted for age, gender and somatic symptom score (SSC) was used to identify factors associated with chronic constipation. People reporting symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were excluded. Of the 892 eligible subjects, 653 (73%) returned the survey. Among the 523 subjects not reporting IBS symptoms, chronic constipation was reported by 93 (18%) of the respondents. Chronic constipation was significantly associated with use of acetaminophen [>or=7 tablets per week, OR = 2.7 (1.1-6.6)]; aspirin [OR = 1.7 (1.0-2.7)]; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [OR = 1.8 (1.1-3.0)]; and SSC. No association was detected for age, gender, body mass index, marital status, smoking, alcohol, coffee, education level, food allergy, exposure to pets, stress, emotional support, or water supply. Chronic constipation is associated with use of acetaminophen, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The explanation of these associations requires further investigation.},

During assessment of patients with constipation the effects of medications and chronic diseases must be discarded and the ideal is to determine which type of functional disorder it present. An algorithm for the management of chronic idiopathic constipation, that includes a recommendation to increase fiber and liquid intake as an initial approach and an orientation to the use of different laxatives, is presented. The usefulness of biofeedback in patients with pelvic floor dysfunction and without organic cause of constipation, is also discussed.},

All members of the Canadian Celiac Association (n=5240) were surveyed with a questionnaire. Respondents included 2681 adults with biopsy-proven celiac disease. The mean age was 56 years. Most common presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (83%), diarrhea (76%), and weight loss (69%). The mean delay in diagnosis was 11.7 years. Diagnoses made prior to celiac disease included anemia (40%), stress (31%), and irritable bowel syndrome (29%). Osteoporosis was common. Prior to diagnosis, 27% of respondents consulted three or more doctors about their symptoms. Delays in diagnosis of celiac disease remain a problem. Associated medical conditions occur frequently. More accurate food labeling is needed. Improved awareness of celiac disease and greater use of serological screening tests may result in earlier diagnosis and reduced risk of associated conditions.},

This inflammatory infiltrate is mainly represented by increased numbers of T lymphocytes and mast cells lying in the lamina propria. The close apposition of immunocytes to gut nerves supplying the mucosa provides a basis for neuroimmune cross-talk, which may explain gut sensorimotor dysfunction and related symptoms in patients with IBS. A previous gastroenteritis (due to Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia coli, and, likely, viruses) is now an established etiologic factor for IBS (hence, postinfectious IBS). Other putative causes, such as undiagnosed food allergies, genetic abnormalities, stress, or bile acid malabsorption, may also promote and maintain a low-grade mucosal inflammation in IBS. The identification of mucosal inflammation in IBS has pathophysiologic implications and paves the way for novel therapeutic options.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) varies depending on the criteria used to diagnose it, but ranges from about 5% to over 15%. IBS is associated with abnormal gastrointestinal motor function and enhanced visceral perception, as well as psychosocial and genetic factors. People with IBS have an increased likelihood of having a cholecystectomy or hysterectomy compared with people without IBS. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with IBS? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to June 2006 (BMJ Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 23 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: 5HT(3) receptor antagonists other than alosetron, 5HT(4) receptor agonists (tegaserod), alosetron, antidepressants, antispasmodics, cognitive behaviour therapy, hypnotherapy, insoluble fibre supplementation, loperamide.},

   abstract = {Faults in a batch process model of the small intestine create the symptoms of all types of irritable bowel syndrome. The model has three sequential processing sections corresponding to the natural divisions of the intestine. It is governed by a brain controller that is divided into four sub-controllers, each with a unique neurotransmitter. Each section has a sub-controller to manage transport. Sensors in the walls of the intestine provide input and output goes to the muscles lining the walls of the intestine. The output controls the speed of the food soup, moves it in both directions, mixes it, controls absorption, and transfers it to the next section at the correct speed (slow). The fourth sub-controller manages the addition of chemicals. It obtains input from the first section of the process via the signalling hormone Cholecystokinin and sends output to the muscles that empty the gall bladder and pancreas. The correct amounts of bile salts and enzymes are then added to the first section. The sub-controllers produce output only when input is received. When output is missing the enteric nervous system applies a default condition. This default condition normally happens when no food is in the intestine. If food is in the intestine and a transport sub-controller fails to provide output then the default condition moves the food soup to the end of that section. The movement is in one direction only (forward), at a speed dependent on the amount and type of fibre present. Cereal, bean and vegetable fibre causes high speeds. This default high speed transport causes irritable bowel syndrome. A barrier is created when a section moving fast at the default speed, precedes a section controlled by a transport sub-controller. Then the sub-controller constricts the intestine to stop the fast flow. The barrier causes constipation, cramping, and bloating. Diarrhoea results when the section terminating the process moves at the fast default speed. Two problems can occur to prevent output from the sub-controllers. The first is a deficiency of one or more of the four neurotransmitters. The second is the destruction of sensors in the walls of the intestine by a toxic insult. A wide variety of symptoms can occur and their nature depends on which sub-controller (or combination of sub-controllers) is faulty, or which part(s) of the intestine are damaged.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic combination on symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: We investigated the efficiency of a probiotic dietary supplement, containing four strains of lactic acid bacteria, on symptoms of IBS. One hundred and sixteen patients with IBS fulfilling the Rome II criteria were randomized in a parallel group, double-blind study to receive a placebo or a probiotic combination (1 x 10(10) cfu once daily) for four weeks. The symptoms that were monitored weekly included discomfort, abdominal pain, and stool frequency and quality. Quality of life was assessed before and at the end of the treatment using the SF36 and FDD-quality-of-life questionnaires. RESULTS: One hundred subjects completed the study (48 probiotic combination, 52 placebo). The probiotic combination was not superior to the placebo in relieving symptoms of IBS (42.6 versus 42.3% improvement). However, the decrease of abdominal pain between the first and the fourth week of treatment was significantly higher in probiotic treated patients (-41.9 versus -24.2%, P=0.048). Interesting findings from the IBS sub-groups were also observed such as a lower pain score at end point in patients with alternating bowel habits (P=0.023) and an increase of stool frequency in the constipated sub-group from the first week of probiotic treatment (P=0.043). CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic combination was not significantly superior to the placebo in relieving symptoms of IBS. Despite the apparent high placebo response, interesting findings from IBS sub-groups were observed in the field of abdominal pain and stool frequency.},

Antispasmodics, magnesium aluminum silicates, and alverine citrate drugs all remain initial options for treatment, although their prescription is impeded by the fact that an increasing number are no longer approved for reimbursement. Increased dietary fibers often have a harmful effect on symptoms. Some patients are probably intolerant to some foods but there is no satisfactory proof on which to base a restrictive diet. Improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome has made it possible to diversify treatments that act first on one of the key pathophysiologic elements, visceral hypersensitivity. Antidepressants (especially tricyclics) can be used at low doses. Among the serotonergic drugs, serotonin 5-HT4 receptors agonists (tegaserod) may be available soon, but the development of 5-HT3 antagonists (alosetron, cilansetron) has been stopped for safety reasons (ischemic colitis and severe constipation). Non-drug options such as hypnosis, psychotherapy, relaxation, or yoga, may also be proposed to some patients. Probiotics are a possible treatment in the future.},

AIMS: Evaluating the effects of a symbiotic preparation on symptoms and colonic transit in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and significant bloating. METHODS: We carried out an open-label, prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter trial on 129 patients meeting Rome II criteria for irritable bowel syndrome who did not have lactose malabsorption, abdominal surgery, overt psychiatric disorders and ongoing psychotropic drug therapy or ethanol abuse. For three months, the patients were treated with a symbiotic preparation and were investigated trough questionnaires on symptoms. Data on bloating and abdominal pain were obtained using the McNemar-Bowker's test, while data on stool frequency were evaluated using the t-test. RESULTS: The administration of a symbiotic preparation to these patients modified the clinical picture and intestinal function, with a significant increase of stool frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Our data, although the study had an open design, represent a further analysis of positive symbiotic effects on clinical manifestations and intestinal function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.},

Early studies to define these enteropathogens took place at the University of Maryland during the Theodore E. Woodward years. Although a reduction in the rate of diarrhea may be possible through avoidance of foods and beverages likely to be contaminated, a more effective preventive strategy is to administer nonabsorbed (<0.4%) rifaximin each day during trips to areas where the risk of traveler's diarrhea is high (i.e., high-risk areas). For the self-treatment of diarrhea that occurs during travel, all persons planning trips to high-risk areas should take with them medication with expected activity against the prevalent bacterial enteropathogens: rifaximin (for the treatment of common afebrile, nondysenteric diarrhea), a fluoroquinolone, or azithromycin. Further study is needed to determine whether it is possible to avoid important morbidity associated with diarrhea and the development of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome with chemoprophylaxis and/or early effective treatment.},

AIM: To summarize recently published information and make recommendations on travellers' diarrhoea prevention. METHODS: PubMed was reviewed on 2 January 2008 for 255 articles on the topic of 'travellers diarrhoea' published beginning with 2000 along with the author's extensive file on prevention of travellers' diarrhoea. RESULTS: Exercising care in food and beverage selection, while of unproven value, is recommended during travel to high-risk areas of Latin America, Southern Asia or Africa. An algorithm is presented to identify future travellers, for which chemoprophylaxis is appropriate. The preferred drug for prevention of travellers' diarrhoea is rifaximin, with bismuth subsalicylate or a fluoroquinolone also being effective. Vaccines against the principal cause of travellers' diarrhoea, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, are being developed. CONCLUSIONS: Research is needed to determine the relative effectiveness of exercising care on food and beverage selection and chemoprophylaxis in preventing travellers' diarrhoea and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome during high-risk travel. Enterotoxigenic E. coli vaccines appear to be a promising addition to travel medicine.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of the endogenous protein anti-secretory factor (ASF) on the symptoms, especially loose stools, in irritable bowel ayndrome (IBS). DESIGN: A diet with specially processed cereals (SPC) known to induce ASF production was used in patients with IBS, in an eight-week randomized, placebo-controlled study. SUBJECTS: Eighty-two patients with IBS were randomized to a diet with either SPC or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The overall clinical condition and the quality of life were measured by VAS and SF-36 questionnaire, respectively. The plasma levels of ASF were determined in 14 patients with dominating loose stools before and after diet. RESULTS: All patients significantly (p<0.001) improved in IBS-related symptoms irrespective of active or placebo diet. In an active-diet sub-group with diarrhoea (n=11) there was a significant (p<0.05) correlation between the increase of plasma ASF level and the improvement on the VAS. CONCLUSION: Both study groups improved significantly on the VAS but no additive effect was seen for the active treatment. In the sub-group with loose stools, the SPC diet induced ASF plasma levels in IBS patients and was correlated to significant symptom improvement in the individual patient.},

   abstract = {Therapy trials with bacterial compounds in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have produced conflicting results. This study was performed in 1988 and 1989, and was re-analysed according to current IBS standards. Two hundred ninety-seven patients with lower abdominal symptoms diagnosed as IBS were treated for 8 weeks by the compound ProSymbioflor((R)) (Symbiopharm GmbH, Herborn, Germany), an autolysate of cells and cell fragments of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, or placebo in a double-blinded, randomized fashion. Patients were seen weekly by the physician, who assessed the presence of core IBS symptoms. Responders had at least a 50% decrease in global symptom score (GSS) and in abdominal pain score (APS) reports at >/=1 visit during treatment. The responder rate in GSS to the drug was 102/149 (68.5%) in comparison to placebo with 56/148 (37.8%) (P < 0.001), the improvement in APS was 108/149 (72.5%) and 66/148 (44.6%) respectively (P = 0.001). The number-needed-to-treat was 3.27 for GSS and 3.59 for the APS report. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a mean response time of 4-5 weeks for active treatment and more than 8 weeks for placebo (P < 0.0001). Treatment of IBS with the bacterial lysate ProSymbioflor is effective and superior to placebo in reducing typical symptoms of IBS patients seen by general practitioners.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) experience similar symptoms; however, individuals with IBD have alterations in their digestive tract and an increased probability of developing colorectal cancer, whereas individuals with IBS do not. Although not well documented within the literature, individuals with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders may engage in adverse behaviors regarding their intake of food, regardless of the fact that the "offending agents" have been identified. Further study into these negative behaviors is warranted for healthcare professionals to be provided with a better understanding of the behaviors that individuals with GI disorders knowingly engage in, despite the negative consequences. PURPOSE: The overall objective of this research was to explore the lived experience of women diagnosed with the GI disorders IBD and/or IBS, with an emphasis on the dietary patterns of the women before and after diagnosis. Specifically, this article examines the adverse behaviors that women engaged in with respect to the consumption of food, beverages, and medications. METHODS: Eight women diagnosed with IBD or IBS were recruited from a university campus in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Participants completed a background questionnaire, a 14-day food diary, and a semistructured interview consisting of 8 open-ended questions. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: family and friend support, control, and adverse behaviors. The focus of this article, the theme of adverse behaviors, consisted of 2 major subthemes: dietary restrictions and issues with medication. All women engaged in adverse behaviors regarding their food intake and/or consumption of medications as related to food intake. CONCLUSIONS: Semistructured interviews with women diagnosed with IBD and IBS revealed that all women felt governed by their bowels to varying degrees. In addition, all women within this sample knowingly engaged in behaviors concerning food/beverages that had the potential to be detrimental to their conditions. A myriad of reasons were given for consuming foods/beverages. Implications for nursing practitioners are discussed.},

A similar workshop was held in 2007, and the recommendations were updated and extended into other areas. The recommendations are graded into an "A," "B," "C" or no category based on the expert's opinion and review by the workshop participants. An "A" recommendation is made for acute childhood diarrhea, prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, preventing and maintaining remission in pouchitis, and in an immune response for the treatment and prevention of atopic eczema associated with cow's milk allergy. The group maintained several "B" recommendations in other areas of treating inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. Although there are significant studies in the "B" group, most "B" recommendations did not reach an "A" level because of some negative studies or a limited number of studies. Many reports in the "C" recommendations were significant but fell short of receiving stronger ratings because of the size of reported patient studies, and also the factors that limited categories to the "B" rating.},

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane controlled trials register up to April 2008. Review methods Randomised controlled trials comparing fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil with placebo or no treatment in adults with irritable bowel syndrome were eligible for inclusion. The minimum duration of therapy considered was one week, and studies had to report either a global assessment of cure or improvement in symptoms, or cure of or improvement in abdominal pain, after treatment. A random effects model was used to pool data on symptoms, and the effect of therapy compared with placebo or no treatment was reported as the relative risk (95% confidence interval) of symptoms persisting. RESULTS: 12 studies compared fibre with placebo or no treatment in 591 patients (relative risk of persistent symptoms 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.00). This effect was limited to ispaghula (0.78, 0.63 to 0.96). Twenty two trials compared antispasmodics with placebo in 1778 patients (0.68, 0.57 to 0.81). Various antispasmodics were studied, but otilonium (four trials, 435 patients, relative risk of persistent symptoms 0.55, 0.31 to 0.97) and hyoscine (three trials, 426 patients, 0.63, 0.51 to 0.78) showed consistent evidence of efficacy. Four trials compared peppermint oil with placebo in 392 patients (0.43, 0.32 to 0.59). CONCLUSION: Fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil were all more effective than placebo in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a difficult disease to treat because of its ill-defined triggers, variable clinical course, and unpredictable myriad of symptoms of varying severity. Both doctors and patients are frustrated by the insidious nature of IBS--a nonlethal disorder that destroys lives, relationships, and careers. Traditional therapies are sometimes effective in mild disease but are often self-limiting because they focus primarily on individual symptoms. A combination of lifestyle and diet modifications, pharmacologic agents, and therapeutic interventions is usually necessary to address the multiple symptoms characteristic of IBS. One of the major advancements in the treatment of patients with IBS has been the development of US Food and Drug Administration--approved serotonergic therapeutics that specifically target the underlying causes of IBS and provide multisymptom relief by improving gastrointestinal function. Although they are controversial, alternative treatment approaches that target normalization of intestinal bacterial microflora may be helpful for some patients in whom intestinal bacterial overgrowth is present. Patients who have co-existing pelvic floor dysfunction may benefit from physical therapy. Overall, treatment approaches for IBS should address multisymptom relief and improvement of overall patient well-being.},

AIM: To determine the efficacy of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for treating FAPD in children. METHODS: A total of 104 children who fulfilled the Rome II criteria for functional dyspepsia (FD), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or functional abdominal pain (FAP) were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in which they received LGG (n = 52), or placebo (n = 52) for 4 weeks. RESULTS: For the overall study population, those in the LGG group were more likely to have treatment success (no pain) than those in the placebo group (25% vs. 9.6%, relative benefit (RB) 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-6.6, number needed to treat (NNT) 7, 95% CI: 4-123). For children with IBS (n = 37), those in the LGG group were more likely to have treatment success than those in the placebo group (33% vs. 5%, RB 6.3, 95% CI: 1.2-38, NNT 4, 95% CI: 2-36) and reduced frequency of pain (P = 0.02), but not pain severity (P = 0.10). For the FD group (n = 20) and FAP group (n = 47), no differences were found. CONCLUSION: The LGG appears to moderately increase treatment success, particularly among children with IBS.},

However, the effect of chili ingestion on gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients has not been characterized. To study the effect of chili-containing foods on postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms in diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), 20 IBS-D patients underwent gastrointestinal symptoms and postprandial colonic transit evaluations after ingesting three different meals: (i) a standard meal, (ii) a spicy meal (a standard meal mixed with 2 g chili), and (iii) a standard meal with 2 g chili in capsules, in a randomized crossover fashion. Postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms were scored every 15 min for 2 h using visual analogue scales. Thirty-eight healthy volunteers were used as controls. In healthy volunteers, the spicy meals and meals with chili capsules induced only mild abdominal burning relative to the standard meals (P < 0.05), whereas it induced significant levels of abdominal pain and burning in IBS-D patients (P < 0.05). Other gastrointestinal symptoms and postprandial colonic transit after spicy meals and meals with chili capsules did not differ from standard meals in IBS-D and controls (P > 0.05). Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients and controls reported similar oral burning symptoms when eating spicy meals (P > 0.05). Both the spicy meal and the standard meal with chili capsules led to similar severity of gastrointestinal symptoms (P > 0.05). Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients exhibit gut hypersensitivity to chili. Chili ingestion produced more abdominal pain and burning in IBS-D patients than in healthy volunteers, but was associated with similar oral burning symptoms.},

   abstract = {OPINION STATEMENT: Lactose malabsorption is a syndrome producing constellation of symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and sometimes nausea and/or vomiting. Primary causes of lactose malabsorption due to loss of intestinal lactase activity include genetic/racial lactase nonpersistence, congenital lactase deficiency, and developmental lactase deficiency. Secondary lactose malabsorption can be caused by any disorder that injures the small intestinal mucosa, such as viral gastroenteritis, celiac disease, allergic (eosinophilic) gastroenteritis, and radiation enteritis. The diagnosis depends on careful clinical evaluation and is customarily confirmed with a lactose breath hydrogen test. As the symptoms are nonspecific, many adults diagnosed with lactose malabsorption actually have irritable bowel syndrome. Treatment consists of a trial of eliminating lactose-containing dairy foods, with supplementation of alternative calcium and protein sources. Commercial enzyme products containing beta-galactosidases can be prescribed to help patients digest dietary lactose. Long-term lactose restriction usually is not necessary and can lead to reduced bone mineral density.},

METHODS: Jejunal biopsies obtained by Watson's capsule, aspiration of intestinal fluid and one blood sample were obtained in 20 diarrhoea-predominant patients with IBS (D-IBS) and 14 healthy volunteers (H). Psychological stress (Holmes-Rahe Scale) and depression (Beck's Depression Inventory) were evaluated at baseline and food and respiratory allergy excluded. Biopsies were processed for H&E staining and microscopic inflammation assessed by counting intraepithelial lymphocytes. Mast cells in lamina propria were counted by immunohistochemistry with CD117 (c-kit). Tryptase concentration was measured in intestinal fluid and serum. RESULTS: D-IBS patients showed higher psychological stress than healthy volunteers (D-IBS: 203 (SD 114) v H: 112 (SD 99); p = 0.019). Immunohistochemical staining of jejunal mucosa revealed mild increase in intraepithelial CD3+ cells in D-IBS patients (D-IBS: 15.3 (SD 5.5; 95% CI 12.7 to 17.9) v H: 10.3 (SD 3.9; 95% CI 8.0 to 12.5); p = 0.006). Moreover, D-IBS patients showed marked increase in mast cells numbers (D-IBS: 34 (SD 9.3); H: 15.3 (SD 4.4) mast cells/hpf; p<0.001) and higher tryptase concentration in jejunal fluid (D-IBS: 0.45 (SD 0.38); H: 0.09 (SD 0.10) microg/l; p = 0.005). Upper gut symptoms were not associated with gender, mast cell counts, jejunal tryptase or basal stress. CONCLUSION: This jejunal mucosal inflammatory profile may help identify diarrhoea-predominant IBS, a stress-related disorder.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by abdominal pain and alterations in bowel habits. Several pathogenetic factors, such as altered intestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, serotonin system abnormalities and psychic disturbances have been identified. Recently, a pathogenetic role of intestinal microflora has been shown in IBS: viral or bacterial infection can trigger post-infectious IBS; some patients have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth; the composition of patients' enteric flora is altered; and minimal inflammatory changes, consistent with the pro-inflammatory role of bacteria, have been demonstrated. Probiotics may, therefore, offer a rational therapeutic approach to IBS. The data available on the use of probiotics in IBS are still limited and results of controlled clinical trials are contradictory because they have been performed using different species, dosages, treatment durations and end-points for results evaluation. A critical evaluation of the therapeutic role of the various probiotics in IBS is presented in this article.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been rarely evaluated as a primary endpoint in the assessment of the effect of probiotics on the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: To study the effects of fermented milk containing Bifidobacterium animalis DN-173 010 and yoghurt strains on the IBS in a multicentre, double-blind, controlled trial. METHODS: A total of 274 primary care adults with constipation-predominant IBS (Rome II) were randomized to consume for 6 weeks either the test fermented milk or a heat-treated yoghurt (control). HRQoL and digestive symptoms were assessed after 3 and 6 weeks on an intention-to-treat population of 267 subjects. RESULTS: The HRQoL discomfort score, the primary endpoint, improved (P < 0.001) in both groups at weeks 3 and 6. The responder rate for the HRQoL discomfort score was higher (65.2 vs. 47.7%, P < 0.005), as was the decrease in bloating score [0.56 +/- (s.d.)1.01 vs. 0.31 +/- 0.87, P = 0.03], at week 3 in the test vs. the control group. In those subjects with <3 stools/week, stool frequency increased (P < 0.001) over 6 weeks in the test vs. control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a beneficial effect of a probiotic food on discomfort HRQoL score and bloating in constipation-predominant IBS, and on stool frequency in subjects with <3 stools/week.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Patient education improves clinical outcomes in patients with chronic illness, but little is known about the education needs of patients with IBS. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify: (1) patients perceptions about IBS; (2) the content areas where patients feel insufficiently informed, i.e., "knowledge gaps" about diagnosis, treatment options, etiology, triggers, prognosis, and role of stress; and (3) whether there are differences related to items 1 and 2 among clinically significant subgroups. METHODS: The IBS-Patient Education Questionnaire (IBS-PEQ) was developed using patient focus groups and cognitive item reduction of items. The IBS-PEQ was administered to a national sample of IBS patients via mail and online. ANALYSIS: Frequencies of item endorsements were obtained. Clinically relevant groups, (a) health care seekers or nonhealth care seekers and (b) users or nonusers of the Web, were identified and grouped as MD/Web, MD/non-Web, and non-MD/Web. RESULTS: 1,242 patients completed the survey (371 via mail and 871 online), mean age was 39.3 +/- 12.5 yr, educational attainment 15 +/- 2.6 yr, 85% female, IBS duration 6.9 +/- 4.2 yr, 79% have seen an MD for IBS in the last 6 months, and 92.6% have used the Web for health information. The most prevalent IBS misconceptions included (% of subjects agreeing with the statement): IBS is caused by lack of digestive enzymes (52%), is a form of colitis (42.8%), will worsen with age (47.9%), and can develop into colitis (43%) or malnutrition (37.7%) or cancer (21.4%). IBS patients were interested in learning about (% of subjects choosing an item): (1) foods to avoid (63.3%), (2) causes of IBS (62%), (3) coping strategies (59.4%), (4) medications (55.2%), (5) will they have to live with IBS for life (51.6%), and (6) research studies (48.6%). Patients using the Web were better informed about IBS. CONCLUSION: (1) Many patients hold misconceptions about IBS being caused by dietary habits, developing into cancer, colitis, causing malnutrition, or worsening with age; (2) patients most often seek information about dietary changes; and (3) educational needs may be different for persons using the internet for medical information.},

   abstract = {Although practitioner-prescribed 'western' herbal medicine (phytotherapy) is a popular complementary therapy in the UK, no clinical studies have been reported on patient-orientated outcomes. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of phytotherapy on symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee. A previous study of Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, acted as a model in the development of the protocol of this investigation. Twenty adults, previously diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knee, were recruited from two Inner London GP practices into this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study carried out in a primary-care setting. All subjects were seen in consultation three times by a herbal practitioner who was blinded to the randomization coding. Each subject was prescribed treatment and given lifestyle advice according to usual practice: continuation of conventional medication where applicable, healthy-eating advice and nutrient supplementation. Individualized herbal medicine was prescribed for each patient, but only dispensed for those randomized to active treatment-- the remainder were supplied with a placebo. At baseline and outcome (after ten weeks of treatment), subjects completed a food frequency questionnaire and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) knee health and Measure Yourself Outcome Profile (MYMOP) wellbeing questionnaires. Subjects completing the study per protocol (n = 14) reported an increased intake of wholegrain foods (p = 0.045) and oily fish (p = 0.039) compared to baseline, but no increase in fruit and vegetables and dairy products intakes. There was no difference in the primary outcome measure of knee health assessed as the difference in the mean response (baseline-week 10) in WOMAC score between the two treatment groups. However, there was, compared with baseline, improvement in the active group (n = 9) for the mean WOMAC stiffness sub-score at week 5 (p = 0.035) and week 10 (p = 0.060) but not in the placebo group (n = 5). Furthermore, for the active, but not the placebo group, the mean WOMAC total and sub-scores all showed clinically significant improvement (> or = 20%) in knee symptoms at weeks 5 and 10 compared with baseline. Moreover, the mean MYMOP symptom 2 sub-score, mostly relating to osteoarthritis (OA), showed significant improvement at week 5 (p = 0.02) and week 10 (p = 0.008) compared with baseline for the active, but not for the placebo group. This pilot study showed that herbal medicine prescribed for the individual by a herbal practitioner resulted in improvement of symptoms of OA of the knee.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional GI disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated with alterations in defecation or stool frequency and consistency. In Western industrialized countries, women seek health care services for their symptoms more frequently than men. The cause of IBS is likely multifactorial involving altered motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. Many patients note that their symptoms are exacerbated by diet and stress, and women frequently report menstrual cycle fluctuations in symptoms. Current approaches to IBS management include behavioral management therapies such as dietary intake changes and stress reduction cognitive restructuring. Drug therapies are targeted at altering pain sensitivity, motility, and secretion. This review provides an overview of the pathogenesis of IBS, factors that contribute to gender differences, and current therapeutic approaches for symptom management.},

   abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is released after food intake to act as an incretin. GLP-1 also inhibits gastric emptying and increases satiety. In rats, GLP-1 inhibits small bowel motility. Our aim was to study the effects of GLP-1 on gastrointestinal motility in healthy subjects and patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Antro-duodeno-jejunal manometry was carried out during a 4-h control period with saline, followed by a 4-h period with intravenous GLP-1 (healthy: 0.7 and 1.2 pmol kg(-1) min(-1) (n = 16); IBS, 1.2 and 2.5 pmol kg(-1) min(-1) (n = 14). Plasma was analysed for GLP-1 and gut hormones, and gut tissue expression of GLP-1 receptor was studied. In healthy subjects, GLP-1 0.7 pmol kg(-1) min(-1) reduced the migrating motor complexes (MMCs) from a median of 2 (range 2-3) to 0.5 (0-2), and motility index from 4.9 +/- 0.1 to 4.3 +/- 0.3 ln Sigma(mmHg*s min(-1)) in jejunum, while GLP-1 1.2 pmol kg(-1) min(-1) diminished MMCs from 2 (2-3) to 1.5 (1-2.5), and motility index from 5.2 +/- 0.2 to 4.4 +/- 0.2. In IBS patients, GLP-1 1.2 pmol kg(-1) min(-1) reduced the MMCs from 2.5 (2-3.5) to 1 (0-1.5) without affecting motility index. At 2.5 pmol kg(-1) min(-1) GLP-1 decreased MMCs from 2 (1.5-3) to 1 (0.5-1.5), and motility index from 5.2 +/- 0.2 to 4.0 +/- 0.5. Motility responses to GLP-1 were similar in antrum and duodenum. Presence of the GLP-1 receptor in the gut was verified by reverse transcriptase PCR. In conclusion, the gut peptide GLP-1 decreases motility in the antro-duodeno-jejunal region and inhibits the MMC in healthy subjects and IBS patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Between 4% and 25% of school-age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) of sufficient severity to interfere with daily activities. It is unclear whether the diagnosis includes children with different aetiologies for their pain. For the majority no organic cause for their pain can be found on physical examination or investigation. Although most children are likely managed by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of interventions have been recommended. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of dietary interventions for recurrent abdominal pain in school-age children. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2006), EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2006), CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2007), ERIC (1966 to Dec 2006), PsycINFO (1872 to Dec 2006), LILACS (1982 to Dec 2006), SIGLE (1980 to March 2005), and JICST (1985 to 06/2000) were searched . Where appropriate, search filters were employed. In addition, researchers working in this area were asked to identify relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised studies of any dietary treatment versus placebo or no treatment in school-age children with a diagnosis of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorder based on the Rome II criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed quality and extracted data. Where appropriate studies were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Seven trials were included in this review. Two trials, including 83 participants, compared fibre supplements with placebo (Christensen 1982, Feldman 1985), with data from one study reported in two papers (Christensen 1982, Christensen 1986). The pooled odds ratio for improvement in the frequency of abdominal pain was 1.16 (95% CI 0.45-2.87). Two trials, including 90 participants (Lebenthal 1981, Dearlove 1983) compared lactose-containing with lactose-free diets. Neither reported data in a form which could be used in the meta-analysis and the former trial had a loss to follow-up of 45%. We were not able to obtain further data for either trial. Three trials (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007, Young 1997) comparing supplementation with Lactobacillus with placebo met the inclusion criteria but only two (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007), including a total of 168 children, provided analysable data. The pooled odds ratio for improvement of symptoms was 1.17 (95% CI 0.62, 2.21). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of high quality evidence on the effectiveness of dietary interventions. This review provides no evidence that fibre supplements, lactose free diets or lactobacillus supplementation are effective in the management of children with RAP.},

For the majority of such children, no organic cause for their pain can be found on physical examination or investigation. Although most children are managed by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of psychosocial interventions including cognitive and behavioural treatments and family therapy have been recommended. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for recurrent abdominal pain or IBS in school-age children. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2006), EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2006), CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2006), ERIC (1966 to Dec 2006), PsycINFO (1872 to Dec 2006), LILACS (1982 to Dec 2006), SIGLE (1980 to March 2005), and JICST (1985 to 06/2000) were searched with appropriate filters. SELECTION CRITERIA: Any study in which the majority of participants were school-age children fulfilling standard criteria for RAP (Apley or the Rome II criteria for functional gastrointestinal diseases) , randomly allocated to any psychosocial treatment compared to standard care or waiting list, were selected. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: References identified by the searches were independently screened against the inclusion criteria by two reviewers. Data were extracted and analysed using RevMan 4.2.10. MAIN RESULTS: Six randomised trials (including a total of 167 participants) of cognitive behavioural interventions were identified, with data reported in ten papers. Five studies reported statistically significant improvements in pain, measured in a variety of ways, in children randomised to receive interventions based on cognitive behavioural therapy compared to children on wait lists or receiving standard medical care (Duarte 2006; Humphreys 1998; Robins 2005; Sanders 1989; Sanders 1994). The remaining trial (Hicks 2003) included a wider group of children with recurrent pain and too few with only RAP to provide interpretable data. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The included trials were small, with methodological weaknesses and a number failed to give appropriate detail regarding numbers of children assessed. In spite of these methodological weaknesses and the clinical heterogeneity, the consistency and magnitude of the effects reported provides some evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy may be a useful intervention for children with recurrent abdominal pain although most children, particularly in primary care, will improve with reassurance and time.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The overall objective of this investigation was to study the lived experience, in relation to diet, of women who have been diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and/or Irritable Bowel Syndrome. This study specifically explored pre-illness and postdiagnosis dietary patterns of participants with an emphasis on the changes, if any, that participants had made to their diet. METHODS: This study took place on a university campus in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Eight women between the ages of 18 and 23 years were recruited. Participants completed a consent form, background questionnaire, and a 14-day food diary. Participant also engaged in one-on-one semistructured interviews that consisted of 8 open-ended questions aimed at gaining a thorough understanding of the lived experience of these women, with respect to their dietary practices. RESULTS: The 3 major themes identified included: control; family and friend support; and adverse behaviors. The salient theme of control included the subthemes timing and awareness of surroundings, giving into temptations, and determination of diet. Determining one's diet, the subtheme that is addressed in this article, involved several key elements, including (1) the role of the physician(s), (2) experimentation, (3) seeking information, and (4) food modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Diet was the primary behavioral factor manipulated by participants to manage their conditions. The determination of potential trigger foods/beverages, however, entailed an often frustrating process of trial and error, in which few of the women received assistance from primary healthcare professionals. As a result, many of the women sought dietary information from alternate sources, some of which may not provide reliable information. Through experimentation and, for some, the documentation of food intake and symptom production, all participants identified food/beverage items they believed to cause symptom development. Although similar items were identified by many, all participants had individual triggers and sensitivities.},

METHODS: A total of 30 D-IBS patients and 30 control subjects were enrolled in this study, and their peripheral blood samples were collected. The percentage of peripheral CD3, CD4, CD8 T lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the ratio of CD4/CD8 was calculated. Serum Zn, Fe and Cu levels were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry(AAS), and the Se level by atomic fluorometry. RESULT: Compared with control group,the percentage of CD4 T lymphocyte and the ratio of CD4/CD8 in D-IBS group were significantly lower (P<0.01). However, there was no significant difference in serum Zn, Se, Fe, Cu levels between two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The declines of peripheral blood CD4 T lymphocytes and the ratio of CD4/CD8 may suggest a cellular immune abnormality in D-IBS patients. There was no significant difference in trace elements levels between the two groups.},

AIM AND METHOD: To review the available evidence of clinical trials on probiotics in gastrointestinal and liver diseases, with a major focus on irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis and chronic liver diseases. RESULTS: Evidence for the therapeutic or preventive application of particular probiotic strains is available for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, rota-virus-associated diarrhoea and pouchitis. Results are encouraging for irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and for reducing side effects by Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies, but are less clear for Crohn's disease, lactose intolerance and constipation. In general, for most of these patient groups, more placebo-controlled methodologically well-designed studies that pay attention to both clinical outcome and mechanistic aspects are required. The application in liver disease and pancreatitis is promising, but more human trials have to be awaited. Possible mechanisms of probiotics include modulation of the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, but different bacterial may have different effects. CONCLUSION: Further insight into disease entities and the functioning of probiotic strains is required to be able to select disease-specific strains, which have to be tested in well-designed placebo-controlled studies.},

   abstract = {In this study, we utilized a catabolite repressor to improve the enzymatic activity of recombinant beta-galactosidase inclusion bodies (IBs) produced in Escherichia coli under the araBAD promoter system. Specifically, we employed methyl alpha-D: -glucopyranoside (alpha-MG) to lower the transcription rate of the beta-galactosidase structural gene. In deepwell microtiter plate and lab-scale fermentor culture systems, we demonstrated that the addition of alpha-MG after induction improved the specific beta-galactosidase production, even though beta-galactosidase was still produced as an IB. Particularly, the addition of 0.0025% alpha-MG led to the most significant increase in the specific activity of the beta-galactosidase. Interestingly, the beta-galactosidase IBs obtained in the presence of 0.0025% alpha-MG were more loosely packed, as determined by IB solubilization in guanidine hydrochloride solution. We propose that the reduced gene transcription rate was responsible for the increased specific beta-galactosidase activity and the loose packing that characterized the IBs produced in the presence of alpha-MG. This principle could be applied throughout the enzyme bioprocessing industry in order to enhance the activity of aggregate-prone enzymes within IBs.},

In addition, certain other probiotics have demonstrated advantageous effects, but the mechanisms behind this are poorly understood. AIM: To investigate the mode of action of a multispecies probiotic consisting of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lc705, Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS and Bifidobacterium breve Bb99 by monitoring its effects on intestinal microbiota and markers of microbial activity. METHODS: A total of 55 irritable bowel syndrome patients participated in this placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Subjects received either multispecies probiotic or placebo supplementation daily during a 6-month period. The composition of intestinal microbiota was analysed with real-time polymerase chain reaction, short-chain fatty acids with gas chromatography and enzymes with spectrophotometer. RESULTS: Each supplemented probiotic strain was detected in faecal samples. Intestinal microbiota remained stable during the trial, except for Bifidobacterium spp., which increased in the placebo group and decreased in the probiotic group (P = 0.028). No changes in short-chain fatty acids occurred. A decrease in ss-glucuronidase activity was detected in 67% of the subjects in the probiotic group vs. 38% in the placebo group (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Factors other than the microbial groups and metabolites studied herein seem responsible for the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms by the multispecies probiotic.},

AIM: To investigate the effects of multispecies probiotic supplementation (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb12) on abdominal symptoms, quality of life, intestinal microbiota and inflammatory markers in irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: Eighty-six irritable bowel syndrome patients (Rome II criteria) participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled 5-month intervention. Patients were randomized to receive daily either multispecies probiotic supplementation or placebo. Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, quality of life, microarray-based intestinal microbiota stability (n = 20), serum cytokines and sensitive C-reactive protein were monitored. RESULTS: The composite irritable bowel syndrome score had at 5 months decreased 14 points (95% CI: -19 to -9) from baseline with the multispecies probiotic vs. three points (95% CI: -8 to 1) with placebo (P = 0.0083). Especially, distension and abdominal pain were affected. A stabilization of the microbiota was observed, as the microbiota similarity index increased with the probiotic supplementation (1.9 +/- 3.1), while it decreased with placebo (-2.9 +/- 1.7). No differences were seen in C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: This multispecies probiotic seems to be an effective and safe option to alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and to stabilize the intestinal microbiota.},

The drug's stimulation of 5-HT4 receptors on intestinal enterocytes increases peristaltic activity and fluid secretion into the gut lumen, facilitating stool passage. In addition, affinity of tegaserod for 5-HT4 receptors modulates visceral sensitivity, which helps alleviate abdominal pain associated with constipation-predominant IBS. The drug's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters do not differ significantly with age or sex. Tegaserod safely and effectively relieves overall gastrointestinal symptoms and abdominal discomfort and normalizes bowel habits in patients with constipation-predominant IBS. It is associated with few drug interactions. In clinical studies, tegaserod was well tolerated, and its adverse-effect profile was similar to that of placebo. Severe diarrhea, as well as abdominal pain, flatulence, headache, and nausea, were the most commonly reported events. Patients who experience severe diarrhea should discontinue the drug. With the data available, tegaserod remains an option for patients with constipation-predominant IBS.},

   abstract = {Many patients with diabetes mellitus suffer from upper and lower GI symptoms. The reported prevalence of these symptoms varies among different ethnic groups/populations. The natural history of GI symptoms as well as their pathogenesis in patients with diabetes remains poorly understood, although it is known that gastric emptying is influenced by hyperglycemia, euglycemia, and hypoglycemia. Poor glycemic control over a long period of time can lead to neuropathy and damage the vagus nerve, resulting in diabetic gastroparesis whose signs and symptoms vary in the individual patient. Gastroparesis can further worsen glycemic control by adversely altering the pharmacokinetics of orally administered hypoglycemic agents as well as by altering the delivery of diet-derived calories to intestines from which absorption, subsequently, determines incipient blood glucose, and thus effectiveness of various injectable antidiabetics including various insulins and related insulin analogs. As GI symptoms may overlap with other disorders, including functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and depression, it is important to have such patients/patients with diabetes undergo standardized testing for measuring gastric emptying. Certain medications including metformin, amylin analogues (i.e. pramlintide), glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs (i.e. exenatide, liraglutide), anticholinergic agents, antidepressants, calcium-channel blockers, and others may contribute to GI symptoms observed in patients with diabetes. Given the global diabetes pandemic, it is of utmost importance to not only diagnose and treat present patients with diabetes mellitus and its comorbidities, but also to help prevent the development of further disease burden by educating children and adolescents about healthy lifestyle modifications (avoidance of overeating, portion control, healthy food choices, increased physical and reduced sedentary activity), as changing behavior in adulthood has proven to be notoriously difficult.},

It is characterized by a combination of abdominal pain, alterations of bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation) and meteorism. Probably, visceral hypersensitivity, motility disturbances, food intolerance, immunologic and microbiologic alterations and psychosomatic influences contribute to symptoms. In a relevant subgroup of patients the disease is triggered by bacterial infection. These patients usually have diarrhea-predominant disease. Irritable bowel syndrome can be diagnosed if typical symptoms are present and after relevant organic differential diagnoses have been excluded by selective biochemical investigations, abdominal ultrasonography and, if applicable, by colonoscopy. These diagnostic procedures are an important basis for therapeutic interventions and need to be complemented by clear information about the diagnosis and the benign long-term course of the disease. Medical therapy concentrates on treatment of predominant symptoms, i.e. pain, diarrhea, constipation and meteorism.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) are reported to have a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms partly attributed to an overrepresentation of celiac disease. We have observed that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms are frequent complaints in this patient group. Allergic manifestations to various drugs are also common in pSS. A role of food allergy in IBS has been proposed. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at evaluating the mucosal response to rectal challenge with cow's milk protein (CM) in patients with pSS and relates possible CM reactivity to their intestinal symptoms. METHODS: A rectal challenge with CM was performed in 21 patients with pSS and 18 healthy controls. Fifteen hours after challenge the mucosal production of nitric oxide (NO) and the release of myeloperoxidase (MPO) as signs of mucosal inflammatory reaction were measured using the mucosal patch technique. RESULTS: Eight out of 21 patients with pSS had a definite increase of mucosal NO synthesis and the luminal release of MPO after rectal CM challenge. This sign of milk sensitivity was not linked to IgG/IgA antibodies to milk proteins. The symptoms for IBS according to Rome III criteria were fulfilled in 13 patients. All patients who were CM sensitive suffered from IBS. In a small open study, patients reactive to CM reported an improvement of intestinal symptoms on a CM-free diet. CONCLUSION: A rectal mucosal inflammatory response after CM challenge is seen in 38% of patients with pSS as a sign of CM sensitivity. IBS-like symptoms were common in pSS, linked to CM sensitivity.},

   abstract = {Beta2-1 fructans are carbohydrate molecules with prebiotic properties. Through resistance to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract, they reach the colon intact, where they selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial members of the gut microbiota. Through this modification of the intestinal microbiota, and by additional mechanisms, beta2-1 fructans may have beneficial effects upon immune function, ability to combat infection, and inflammatory processes and conditions. In this paper, we have collated, summarised and evaluated studies investigating these areas. Twenty-one studies in laboratory animals suggest that some aspects of innate and adaptive immunity of the gut and the systemic immune systems are modified by beta2-1 fructans. In man, two studies in children and nine studies in adults indicate that the adaptive immune system may be modified by beta2-1 fructans. Thirteen studies in animal models of intestinal infections conclude a beneficial effect of beta2-1 fructans. Ten trials involving infants and children have mostly reported benefits on infectious outcomes; in fifteen adult trials, little effect was generally seen, although in specific situations, certain beta2-1 fructans may be beneficial. Ten studies in animal models show benefit of beta2-1 fructans with regard to intestinal inflammation. Human studies report some benefits regarding inflammatory bowel disease (four positive studies) and atopic dermatitis (one positive study), but findings in irritable bowel syndrome are inconsistent. Therefore, overall the results indicate that beta2-1 fructans are able to modulate some aspects of immune function, to improve the host's ability to respond successfully to certain intestinal infections, and to modify some inflammatory conditions.},

   abstract = {Intestinal microflora can be considered as a ''dynamic system'' that actively interacts with the intestinal epithelium and the local immune system. It synthesizes antimicrobial substances (bacteriocins), vitamins (PP, B1, B6, B12), it produces a major intestinal nutrient (butyric acid) and interacts in a competitive fashion with the pathogens. Lactobacilli concentration (Gram+, Gram variable, facultative anaerobes) is generally decreased in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. This syndrome has, until recently been considered to be ''functional'', whereas, in fact, it may result from previous enteritis (in up to 31% of patients), featuring a persistent low-grade intestinal inflammation and a reduction in interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration. Some Lactobacilli strains (e.g. L. paracasei subsp. paracasei) in vitro lead to normalisation of the hypercontractility of the smooth muscle cells. A growing body of clinical findings indicates that some ''genetically stable'' strains of Lactobacilli may be useful in the treatment, even long term, of IBS, and reduce the postoperative infection rate, especially in critically ill patients (orthotopic liver transplant, severe pancreatitis). However, some Lactobacilli, ''not genetically stable'', used in the treatment of neutropenic patients during chemotherapy and in pediatric patients submitted to gastrojejunostomy, have been reported to lead to bacteremia and endocarditis. These effects may be due to transfer of bacteria and genetic material. Therefore, the confirmed genetic stability and the fact that no antibiotic resistance occurs are fundamental requisites for the use of Lactobacilli in certain disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as, for instance, IBS. In conclusion, ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli (L. paracasei subsp. Paracasei F19) have recently become available, representing an exiting new field in clinical studies and for treatment purposes, offering guarantees of safety also for long-term use. Careful personalized evaluation, as always in medical practice, is necessary in order to gain further insight into, and to validate with additional studies, the role of ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli in the treatment of IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 70% of the world population has hypolactasia, which often remains undiagnosed and has the potential to cause some morbidity. However, not everyone has lactose intolerance, as several nutritional and genetic factors influence tolerance. AIMS: To review current clinical practice and identify published literature on the management of lactose intolerance. METHODS: PubMed was searched using the terms lactose, lactase and diet to find original research and reviews. Relevant articles and clinical experience provided the basis for this review. RESULTS: Lactose is found only in mammalian milk and is hydrolysed by lactase in the small intestine. The lactase gene has recently been identified. 'Wild-type' is characterized by lactase nonpersistence, often leading to lactose intolerance. Two genetic polymorphisms responsible for persistence have been identified, with their distribution concentrated in north Europeans. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea. Diagnosis is most commonly by the lactose hydrogen breath test. However, most people with hypolactasia, if given appropriate advice, can tolerate some lactose-containing foods without symptoms. CONCLUSION: In clinical practice, some people with lactose intolerance can consume milk and dairy foods without developing symptoms, whereas others will need lactose restriction.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the outpatient with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a difficult but important challenge to recognize and treat. It is very helpful to have effective treatment approaches for IBS that are practical and use minimal medications. Because of the underlying chronic inflammation in IBD, IBS symptoms occur with increased frequency and severity, secondary to increased hypersensitivity to foods and beverages that stimulate the gastrointestinal tract. This paper discusses how to treat IBS in the IBD outpatient, with emphasis on using a food and beverage intolerance, avoidance diet. The adverse effects of many foods and beverages are amount dependent and can be delayed, additive, and cumulative. The specific types of foods and beverages that can induce IBS symptoms include milk and milk containing products; caffeine containing products; alcoholic beverages; fruits; fruit juices; spices; seasonings; diet beverages; diet foods; diet candies; diet gum; fast foods; condiments; fried foods; fatty foods; multigrain breads; sourdough breads; bagels; salads; salad dressings; vegetables; beans; red meats; gravies; spaghetti sauce; stews; nuts; popcorn; high fiber; and cookies, crackers, pretzels, cakes, and pies. The types of foods and beverages that are better tolerated include water; rice; plain pasta or noodles; baked or broiled potatoes; white breads; plain fish, chicken, turkey, or ham; eggs; dry cereals; soy or rice based products; peas; applesauce; cantaloupe; watermelon; fruit cocktail; margarine; jams; jellies; and peanut butter. Handouts that were developed based upon what worsens or helps IBS symptoms in patients are included to help patients learn which foods and beverages to avoid and which are better tolerated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: A large outbreak of acute gastroenteritis at the annual meeting of the Canadian Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates (CSGNA) was attributed to food-borne norovirus. A prospective study was undertaken to determine the incidence and natural history of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS). METHODS: Questionnaires addressing demographics, medical history, acute illness, prior bowel function, and current symptoms were mailed to all delegates within 1 month of the outbreak. Follow-up questionnaires were mailed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The prevalence of new Rome I IBS among participants with and without acute enteric illness during the outbreak was calculated for each time point. Risk factors were assessed by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Baseline surveys were returned by 139 of 197 delegates (70.6%; mean age, 48 +/- 6 years; 95.0% female), of whom 135 (97.1%), 133 (95.7%), 128 (92.1%), and 116 (83.4%) returned the 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month surveys, respectively. One hundred seven respondents (76.9%) reported an acute enteric illness during the outbreak. Eighteen subjects reported premorbid IBS. Among the remainder, 21 of 89 who experienced gastroenteritis (23.6%) reported symptoms consistent with PI-IBS at 3 months versus 1 of 29 (3.4%) who remained well (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-48.7; P = .014). At 6, 12, and 24 months, the prevalence of IBS was similar among exposed versus nonexposed individuals. In multiple logistic regression, vomiting during the acute illness independently predicted risk of PI-IBS at 3 months (odds ratio, 10.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-85.5; P = .028). CONCLUSIONS: PI-IBS is common after presumptive viral gastroenteritis but might be more transient than after bacterial dysentery.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic condition affecting 3%-25% of the general population. As no curative treatment is available, therapy is aimed at reducing symptoms, often with little success. Because alteration of the normal intestinal microflora has been observed in IBS, probiotics (beneficial microbes taken to improve health) may be useful in reducing symptoms. This paper systematically reviews randomized, controlled, blinded trials of probiotics for the treatment of IBS and synthesizes data on efficacy across trials of adequate quality. PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, NIH registry of clinical trials, metaRegister, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1982-2007. We also conducted secondary searches of reference lists, reviews, commentaries, relevant articles on associated diseases, books and meeting abstracts. Twenty trials with 23 probiotic treatment arms and a total of 1404 subjects met inclusion criteria. Probiotic use was associated with improvement in global IBS symptoms compared to placebo [pooled relative risk (RR pooled) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.62-0.94]. Probiotics were also associated with less abdominal pain compared to placebo [RR pooled = 0.78 (0.69-0.88)]. Too few studies reported data on other IBS symptoms or on specific probiotic strains to allow estimation of a pooled RR. While our analyses suggest that probiotic use may be associated with improvement in IBS symptoms compared to placebo, these results should be interpreted with caution, given the methodological limitations of contributing studies. Probiotics warrant further study as a potential therapy for IBS.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, the regular consumption of pre- and probiotics is recommended to provide various positive health benefits. The in vitro and in vivo demonstrated actions on the intestinal microflora, the mucosal barrier and the immunological system are very interesting to propose beneficial health effects, but the scientific proof in humans is not demonstrated yet. Pre- and probiotics are very active in the intestinal tract (mainly in the colon) by maintaining a healthy gut microflora and influencing metabolic, trophic and protective mechanism. Prebiotics stimulates the growth of apathogen bacteria and increase the short chain fatty acid concentration by fermentation. Short chain fatty acids are necessary substrates for a healthy gut. Probiotics inhibit the growth of pathogen bacteria, reduce the translocation of bacteria and toxins and modulate the intestinal immune system. For some specific clinical diseases (ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, diarrhoea) a therapeutic and prophylactic effect with pre- and probiotics was shown. In the near future more indications for pre- and probiotics (used as a single strain or as in a combination) will be added. Promising results are already shown in irritable bowel syndrome, prevention of antibiotic induced diarrhoea, in surgical and in intensive care patients. Future studies should focus to determine the characteristics of a healthy gut and the evaluation of specific health benefits by well-designed, controlled human studies of adequate duration.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Probiotics may benefit irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, but randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conflicting; therefore a systematic review was conducted. METHODS: MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008), EMBASE (1988 to May 2008) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2008) electronic databases were searched, as were abstracts from DDW (Digestive Diseases Week) and UEGW (United European Gastroenterology Week), and authors were contacted for extra information. Only parallel group RCTs with at least 1 week of treatment comparing probiotics with placebo or no treatment in adults with IBS according to any acceptable definition were included. Studies had to provide improvement in abdominal pain or global IBS symptoms as an outcome. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. Data were synthesised using relative risk (RR) of symptoms not improving for dichotomous data and standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data using random effects models. RESULTS: 19 RCTs (18 papers) in 1650 patients with IBS were identified. Trial quality was generally good, with nine reporting adequate methods of randomisation and six a method of concealment of allocation. There were 10 RCTs involving 918 patients providing outcomes as a dichotomous variable. Probiotics were statistically significantly better than placebo (RR of IBS not improving=0.71; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88) with a number needed to treat (NNT)=4 (95% CI 3 to 12.5). There was significant heterogeneity (chi(2)=28.3, p=0.001, I(2)=68%) and possible funnel plot asymmetry. Fifteen trials assessing 1351 patients reported on improvement in IBS score as a continuous outcome (SMD=-0.34; 95% CI -0.60 to -0.07). There was statistically significant heterogeneity (chi(2)=67.04, p<0.001, I(2)=79%), but this was explained by one outlying trial. CONCLUSION: Probiotics appear to be efficacious in IBS, but the magnitude of benefit and the most effective species and strain are uncertain.},

   abstract = {Enteroendocrine cells (EEC) form the basis of the largest endocrine system in the body. They secrete multiple regulatory molecules which control physiological and homeostatic functions, particularly postprandial secretion and motility. Their key purpose is to act as sensors of luminal contents, either in a classical endocrine fashion, or by a paracrine effect on proximate cells, notably vagal afferent fibres. They also play a pivotal role in the control of food intake, and emerging data add roles in mucosal immunity and repair. We propose that EEC are fundamental in several gastrointestinal pathologies, notably Post-infectious Irritable Bowel Syndrome, infectious enteritis, and possibly inflammatory bowel disease. Further work is needed to fully illustrate the importance, detailed biology and therapeutic potential of these frequently overlooked cells.},

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies that investigated the efficacy of probiotics in the management of irritable bowel syndrome. Clinical improvement was the key outcome of interest. Data were searched within the time period of 1966 through September 2007. RESULTS: Eight randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials met our criteria and were included in the analysis. Pooling of eight trials for the outcome of clinical improvement yielded a significant relative risk of 1.22 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.07-1.4; P = 0.0042). CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics may improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and can be used as supplement to standard therapy.},

   abstract = {While chronic constipation (CC) has a high prevalence in primary care, there are no existing treatment recommendations to guide health care professionals. To address this, a consensus group of 10 gastroenterologists was formed to develop treatment recommendations. Although constipation may occur as a result of organic disease, the present paper addresses only the management of primary CC or constipation associated with irritable bowel syndrome. The final consensus group was assembled and the recommendations were created following the exact process outlined by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology for the following areas: epidemiology, quality of life and threshold for treatment; definitions and diagnostic criteria; lifestyle changes; bulking agents and stool softeners; osmotic agents; prokinetics; stimulant laxatives; suppositories; enemas; other drugs; biofeedback and behavioural approaches; surgery; and probiotics. A treatment algorithm was developed by the group for CC and constipation associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Where possible, an evidence-based approach and expert opinions were used to develop the statements in areas with insufficient evidence. The nature of the underlying pathophysiology for constipation is often unclear, and it can be tricky for physicians to decide on an appropriate treatment strategy for the individual patient. The myriad of treatment options available to Canadian physicians can be confusing; thus, the main aim of the recommendations and treatment algorithm is to optimize the approach in clinical care based on available evidence.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder characterized by abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, and bloating. It has traditionally been viewed as a disorder of visceral hypersensitivity heavily influenced by stress, and therefore therapeutic strategies to date have largely reflected this. However, more recently, there is good evidence for a role of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in its pathogenesis. Changes in fecal microbiota, the use of probiotics, the phenomenon of postinfectious IBS, and the recognition of an upregulated host immune system response suggest that an interaction between the host and GI microbiota may be important in the pathogenesis of IBS. This article explores the role of the GI microbiota in IBS and how their modification might lead to therapeutic benefit.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate whether a higher prevalence of Giardia lamblia infection is associated with an increase in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) prescriptions at the county level in Michigan. METHODS: The Michigan Disease Surveillance System (MDSS) was used to ascertain both the numbers of Giardia lamblia infections as well as the total number of foodborne illnesses per population by county in Michigan during 2005. This was compared with Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) of Michigan numbers of drug prescriptions for IBS per one thousand members per county in 2005. These data were also analyzed for associations with per capita income by county and the number of refugees entering each county in 2005. RESULTS: There were a total of 786 confirmed cases of Giardia lamblia reported to MDSS in 2005. During the same time period, the number of prescriptions for IBS varied from 0.5 per 1000 members up to 6.0 per 1000 members per month. There was no trend towards higher numbers of IBS prescriptions in the counties with more Giardia lamblia infections. Per capita income was not associated with either IBS prescriptions or Giardiasis. There was a significant linear association between the number of refugees entering each county, and the number of Giardia lamblia cases per 100,000 population. CONCLUSION: In this ecological study, there was no association found between BCBS prescriptions for IBS and Giardia lamblia infections in Michigan counties. Our findings may have been influenced by the disparate number of refugees admitted per county.},

For IBS therapy, probiotic drugs such as Mutaflor (active ingredient: Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 [EcN]) are also being used. A systematic survey on the efficacy and safety of EcN in different IBS subgroups is still missing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a gastroenterologic outpatient practice, results of 150 IBS patients treated with EcN were evaluated retrospectively. Most IBS patients enrolled belonged to the subgroups "diarrhea", "meteorism", and "alternating stool consistency". RESULTS: Regarding the diarrhea subgroup, not only a statistically significant improvement in stool frequency was observed, but also a marked improvement in concomitant symptoms such as abnormal urge, flatulence, and abdominal fullness. These complaints improved under EcN therapy in the other IBS subgroups as well, so that efficacy was assessed as "good to very good" in 73.4% of all cases. Tolerance to treatment was "good to very good" in 97.9% of the cases. CONCLUSION: The results point to the possibility of EcN being a therapeutic option for patients of various IBS subgroups which is almost free of side effects.},

   abstract = {Constipation is a common gastrointestinal disease affecting 2-27% of the population in Western hemisphere. Approximately in half of patients the diagnosis of functional constipation is made after having ruled out secondary causes. Treatment of chronic functional constipation primarily addresses education on toilet habits, dietary advice, and patient reassurance. Further therapies are guided according to functional subtype slow-transit constipation, dyssynergic defecation, and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C). Traditionally, the pharmacologic treatment of constipation uses primarily bulking agents and/or laxatives (osmotic or secretory). However, often these therapies do not provide the desired improvement, have a short-lived efficacy and/or are accompanied by side-effects such as bloating and abdominal cramps. Thus, there is a clinical need for new, more potent drugs particularly for patients who are not satisfactorily treated by conventional therapies. This review discusses recent developments in the pharmacologic treatment of chronic constipation including recently FDA-approved lubiprostone, emerging 5-HT receptors modifiers, investigational substances, and probiotics.},

Nevertheless, short-term therapy with either antibiotics or probiotics does seem to reduce symptoms among IBS patients. It seems most likely that the benefits of antibiotic therapy are mediated through subtle and, perhaps, localized, quantitative and/or qualitative changes in the colonic flora. How probiotics exert their effects remain to be defined but an anti-inflammatory effect seems likely. While this approach to the management of IBS is in its infancy, it is evident that manipulation of the flora, whether through the administration of antibiotics or probiotics, deserves further attention in IBS.},

Other modes of action, including bacterial displacement and alterations in luminal contents, are also plausible. While clinical evidence of efficacy is now beginning to emerge, a review of available trials emphasizes the importance of a clear definition of strain selection, dose and viability. The possible roles of co-therapy or sequential therapy with antibiotics, probiotics, prokinetics, or other agents also deserves further study. The role of the enteric flora is evidently an area of great potential in IBS; we are on the threshold of a new era of research and therapy for this common disorder.},

   abstract = {Probiotics have been used in humans for almost a century and widely recommended for the treatment of a variety of ills assumed to be of colonic origin, including diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and flatulence. More recently, probiotics have been evaluated in the management of specific colonic disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Clostridium difficile colitis. It is evident that no two probiotics are exactly alike; why then should we expect reproducible results from studies that employ different species or strains, variable formulations, and diverse dosing schedules? When probiotics have been studied with the rigor appropriate to a new therapeutic modality, some coherent results have emerged: specific strains are effective in certain diarrheal states, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis, as well as in the prevention of C. difficile-related colitis. Even here, not to mention other colonic disorders, further adequately powered and appropriately designed trials are needed.},

Functional chronic constipation consists of three overlapping subtypes: slow transit constipation, dyssynergic defecation, and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. The Rome criteria may serve as a useful guide for making a clinical diagnosis of functional constipation. Today, an evidence-based approach can be used to treat patients with chronic constipation. The availability of specific drugs for the treatment of chronic constipation, such as tegaserod and lubiprostone, has enhanced the therapeutic armamentarium for managing these patients. Randomized controlled trials have also established the efficacy of biofeedback therapy in the treatment of dyssynergic defecation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common in the population, but not all subjects seek professional health care for their symptoms. The aim of this study was to compare consulters in secondary/tertiary care with those in primary care and non-consulters by using questionnaires to investigate factors of importance for health-care seeking in IBS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 218 subjects with IBS: 70 non-consulters, 53 patients from primary care and 95 from secondary/tertiary care. The subjects completed questionnaires on gastrointestinal (GI) and psychological symptoms, coping resources, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and reasons for not seeking health care. RESULTS: Consulters (primary and secondary/tertiary care combined) had poorer HRQOL, more severe psychological symptoms, higher levels of GI-specific anxiety and poor coping resources compared with non-consulters, but the GI symptom severity was similar. Mental health and poor social, emotional and physical functioning were independently predictive of being a health-care seeker (r (2)=0.41). Independent predictors for being a consulter in secondary/tertiary care were a high degree of anxiety, low scores on physical functioning, physical role and food (IBSQOL) (r (2)=0.65). Several non-consulters reported mild symptoms and ability to control symptoms as reasons for not seeking health care. Having a close relative with similar symptoms reduced the need to seek health care. Thirty-six non-consulters had sought alternative care or advice from friends and/or relatives about their GI symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: GI symptom severity alone cannot explain the illness behavior in IBS. HRQOL and psychological symptoms are important for experience of GI symptoms and the health-care seeking pattern in IBS.},

These symptoms are similar to those of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is a prevalent entity in the community. OBJECTIVE: As there was no data available on the prevalence of LI and the correlated factors, this study aimed to determine these correlations and their relation to IBS symptoms in an apparently healthy population in Shiraz, southern Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey among 1,978 individuals older than 35 years was conducted in Shiraz, southern Iran, using a questionnaire that consisted of items regarding demographic data, life style, subjective gastrointestinal symptoms of LI and IBS symptoms according to ROME II criteria. RESULTS: A total of 562 subjects reported LI (28.41%). The prevalence was significantly higher in females, in subjects taking NSAIDs or acetaminophen and in cases reporting IBS symptoms. Subjects with LI avoided certain foods and drinks; and in order to relieve their symptoms, they used OTC drugs, herbal medicine or visited a physician. On the other hand, no relation was found between LI and age, smoking or the number of meals per day. CONCLUSIONS: Although we found that individuals with IBS had significantly more subjective LI than those without IBS, in the absence of documented lactose malabsorption, it is hard to tell whether the reported symptoms indeed are those of LI or simply those of IBS. So, a period of dairy product avoidance and/ or requesting a test for lactose malabsorption may be beneficial in this area.},

The criteria used by the FDA for assessment of the risks and benefits of drugs used for functional bowel problems seem to be different than those used for the treatment of other conditions and have resulted in drastic limitation of access to these drugs rather than just warnings about risks as they are discovered. Decisions that affect the availability of drugs for patients with functional bowel disease should be discussed with clinicians who take care of those patients before going into effect.

Thirty-two patients diagnosed as having FM according to the ACR 1990 criteria and 32 normal healthy controls (NHC) were included in this study. The demographic data, disease duration, number of tender points and accompanying symptoms (fatigue, sleep disorders, headache, paresthesia, irritable bowel syndrome, sicca symptoms, Raynaud's phenomena) of the patients were noted. Visual analog scale (10 cm) was implemented to estimate daily severity of pain and fatigue. Fibromyalgia impact questionnaire was used for functional assessment. Serum selenium (microg/dL) and serum zinc (microg/dL) levels were measured by atomic absorption spectrometer. Serum magnesium (mmol/L) level was measured by the original kits of Abbott Aeroset auto-analyzer. The mean age of patients in FM group and NHC were calculated as 42.9 (SD = 7.7) years and 41.3 (SD = 9.7) years, respectively. Serum levels of zinc (P = 0.001) and magnesium (P = 0.002) were significantly decreased by FM groups, whereas there was no considerable difference with selenium levels of both groups (P > 0.05). Association between serum zinc level and number of tender points (P = 0.008) and that between fatigue and magnesium level (P = 0.003) was found as meaningful. According to the results of this study, it was asserted that serum magnesium and zinc levels may play an important role in the pathophysiology of FM.},

The aims of this study were first to determine whether the efficacy of this dietary change is due to dietary fructose restriction and second to define whether symptom relief was specific to free fructose or to poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates in general. METHODS: The double-blinded, randomized, quadruple arm, placebo-controlled rechallenge trial took place in the general community. The 25 patients who had responded to dietary change were provided all food, low in free fructose and fructans, for the duration of the study. Patients were randomly challenged by graded dose introduction of fructose, fructans, alone or in combination, or glucose taken as drinks with meals for maximum test period of 2 weeks, with at least 10-day washout period between. For the main outcome measures, symptoms were monitored by daily diary entries and responses to a global symptom question. RESULTS: Seventy percent of patients receiving fructose, 77% receiving fructans, and 79% receiving a mixture reported symptoms were not adequately controlled, compared with 14% receiving glucose (P < or = 0.002, McNemar test). Similarly, the severity of overall and individual symptoms was significantly and markedly less for glucose than other substances. Symptoms were induced in a dose-dependent manner and mimicked previous IBS symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IBS and fructose malabsorption, dietary restriction of fructose and/or fructans is likely to be responsible for symptomatic improvement, suggesting efficacy is due to restriction of poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates in general.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut microflora-mucosal interactions may be involved in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: To investigate the efficacy of a novel prebiotic trans-galactooligosaccharide in changing the colonic microflora and improve the symptoms in IBS sufferers. METHODS: In all, 44 patients with Rome II positive IBS completed a 12-week single centre parallel crossover controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either 3.5 g/d prebiotic, 7 g/d prebiotic or 7 g/d placebo. IBS symptoms were monitored weekly and scored according to a 7-point Likert scale. Changes in faecal microflora, stool frequency and form (Bristol stool scale) subjective global assessment (SGA), anxiety and depression and QOL scores were also monitored. RESULTS: The prebiotic significantly enhanced faecal bifidobacteria (3.5 g/d P < 0.005; 7 g/d P < 0.001). Placebo was without effect on the clinical parameters monitored, while the prebiotic at 3.5 g/d significantly changed stool consistency (P < 0.05), improved flatulence (P < 0.05) bloating (P < 0.05), composite score of symptoms (P < 0.05) and SGA (P < 0.05). The prebiotic at 7 g/d significantly improved SGA (P < 0.05) and anxiety scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The galactooligosaccharide acted as a prebiotic in specifically stimulating gut bifidobacteria in IBS patients and is effective in alleviating symptoms. These findings suggest that the prebiotic has potential as a therapeutic agent in IBS.},

Whether this is affected by bowel habit, psychologic factors, or sex is unknown. METHODS: We included 61 patients with IBS (50 women, 11 men), 25 with diarrhea-predominant IBS, 17 with constipation-predominant IBS, 19 with alternating-type IBS, and 20 healthy controls (15 women, 5 men). A colonic distension trial was performed with a barostat before and after a 1-hour duodenal lipid infusion (3 kcal/min). Colonic thresholds, colonic tone, and the viscerosomatic referral pattern were assessed and compared between groups. Patients also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. RESULTS: The reduction in colonic pressure thresholds after vs before duodenal lipids was greater in patients than in controls for discomfort (P = .006) and pain (P < .0001). An increased viscerosomatic referral area for pain and discomfort during colonic distensions after vs before duodenal lipids was observed in patients but not in controls. The response was similar in IBS subgroups based on the predominant bowel habit, in patients with vs without anxiety and/or depression, and in women and men with IBS. The colonic tone response during lipid infusion was similar in IBS patients and controls, and in the different IBS subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: IBS patients show increased colonic sensitivity and altered viscerosomatic referral pattern after duodenal lipids. This response is largely unaffected by the predominant bowel habit, psychologic factors, or sex, but seems to be related to IBS per se.},

Enhanced colorectal sensitivity after duodenal lipid administration in IBS patients has been demonstrated. However, the effects of a regular meal on colorectal sensitivity in these patients and the importance of the composition of the meal are not known. On two separate days, 10 IBS patients and 11 controls randomly received a liquid meal (800 kcal), containing 60% calories from fat (fatty meal) or carbohydrate (carbohydrate meal). Using a barostat rectal sensitivity was assessed during four separate distension sequences before, immediately after and 30 and 60 min after the meal. In the patients, the discomfort (P = 0.04) and the pain thresholds (P = 0.007) were gradually reduced after the fatty meal, whereas only a tendency in the same direction was seen after the carbohydrate meal. In patients VAS ratings for pain increased after the fatty meal (P = 0.03), but not after carbohydrates. In the controls, sensory thresholds were not affected by the meals. In IBS, a liquid meal enhances rectal sensitivity, and this seems to be partly nutrient dependent as a fatty meal has more pronounced effects than a carbohydrate meal. This might be of relevance for their postprandial symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Based on their chemical extraction, dietary fibers are classified into crude fibers and total dietary fibers (TDF). TDF gives the best estimate of fiber content in the diet. Whereas data on intake of crude fibers are available, there is a lack of data on intake of TDF in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: We assessed the TDF and its source in the diet of patients with IBS and healthy controls (HC). METHODS: Based on their predominant symptoms, 81 patients with IBS (according to Rome II criteria) were categorized into constipation-predominant (IBS-C, n=48), diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D, n=16) and mixed type (IBS-M, n=17). Information was collected on fiber supplementation and preference for high-fiber food. A pretested, open-ended, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to collect dietary information on food groups and TDF. Age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n=89) were recruited as HC. The mean (SD) age of patients and HC was 36.5 (11.4) years (59 men), and 36 (12) years (62 men), respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (48%) were taking medicinal fiber supplements, of which 28 patients were taking supplements daily (2.10 [0.84] teaspoon full). The mean daily TDF intake was 51.7 (23.1) g vs. 52.3 (21.6) g for patients and HC, respectively (p=0.8). The intake of TDF was similar in patients having less (n=41) or more (n=40) preference for fiber-rich foods (55 [23] g vs. 47 [22] g, p=0.16). The daily mean cereal intake in patients was significantly lower than that in HC (322 g vs. 404 g, p=0.001). However, consumption of fruits (150 g vs. 80 g, p=0.001) and vegetables (348 g vs. 219 g, p=0.006) was higher in patients in comparison with HC. There was a positive correlation between TDF with cereals (p=0.001), pulses (p=0.001), vegetables and fruits (p=0.033) in patients with IBS but only with cereals (p=0.001) in HC. CONCLUSION: The intake of TDF in patients with IBS and HC is much higher than the dietary recommendation for healthy Indians. Patients with IBS consumed more fruits and vegetables rather than cereals as compared with HC.},

   abstract = {Although incomplete fructose absorption has been implicated to cause gastrointestinal symptoms, foods containing high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) contain glucose. Glucose increases fructose absorption in healthy subjects. Our hypothesis was that fructose intolerance is less prevalent after HFCS consumption compared to fructose alone in healthy subjects and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Breath hydrogen levels and gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed after 40 g of fructose (12% solution) prepared either in water or as HFCS, administered in double-blind randomized order on 2 days in 20 healthy subjects and 30 patients with IBS. Gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded on 100-mm Visual Analogue Scales. Breath hydrogen excretion was more frequently abnormal (P < 0.01) after fructose (68%) than HFCS (26%) in controls and patients. Fructose intolerance (i.e. abnormal breath test and symptoms) was more prevalent after fructose than HFCS in healthy subjects (25% vs. 0%, P = 0.002) and patients (40% vs. 7%, P = 0.062). Scores for several symptoms (e.g. bloating r = 0.35) were correlated (P < or = 0.01) to peak breath hydrogen excretion after fructose but not HFCS; in the fructose group, this association did not differ between healthy subjects and patients. Symptoms were not significantly different after fructose compared to HFCS. Fructose intolerance is more prevalent with fructose alone than with HFCS in health and in IBS. The prevalence of fructose intolerance is not significantly different between health and IBS. Current methods for identifying fructose intolerance should be modified to more closely reproduce fructose ingestion in daily life.},

The prevalence rate worldwide for IBS ranges from 10 to 20% and is higher for women than for men. IBS imposes a substantial financial burden on both patients and employers because of increased medical costs and decreased work productivity. Recent studies indicate that inflammatory processes involving the gastrointestinal tract are strongly correlated with IBS. Acute bacterial gastroenteritis has been linked with the onset of symptoms in approximately 15% of patients diagnosed with IBS; these cases have been called postinfectious IBS. Organisms commonly associated with postinfectious IBS include the foodborne pathogens Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Shigella. The pathologic changes associated with postinfectious IBS are likely due to inflammatory reactions induced by the infecting organisms. Postinfectious IBS should be recognized as a potential long-term consequence of foodborne gastroenteritis.},

RESULTS: Of the 285 tests (171 for FAs and 114 for IAs) performed in Group I we obtained 45 (26.3%) positive responses for FA and 23 (20.1%) for IA. Of the 153 tests for FA in Group II, we obtained 66 (20.1%) positive responses, and of the 102 tests for IA, we obtained 20 (19.6%) positive responses. Of the 459 tests for FA performed in Group III, we obtained 39 (84%) positive responses, and of the 306 for IA, we obtained 52 (16.9%) positive responses. The numbers of positive responses were not significantly different between the three groups, but in the D-IBS group, the number of SPT FA responses differed significantly from those for the other two groups (P > 0.01). CONCLUSION: Despite the small number of cases studied, the higher reactivity to FAs in Group I compared to Groups II and III adds new information, and suggests the presence of a possible alteration in intestinal epithelial function.},

This intolerance could be related to an increase in colonic bacterial fermentation. The hydrogen breath test (HBT) is a marker of the intestinal micro flora fermentative capacity. AIM: To assess if there is an association between hydrogen (H2) levels and clinical changes between diets with and without bran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 10 women with predominantly constipated irritable bowel syndrome (Rome II criteria) received a lowfiber diet during one week. This phase was followed by a second 7 day period with the same diet but supplemented with 12 g of crude dietary fiber. At the end of both periods, patients completed a symptom scale (Lickert type) and performed a HBT. RESULTS: Comparing both periods with a different diet the median difference in the clinical scale score (-2.5) shows a tendency favorable to the diet without bran, p = 0.048. In the fiber period the median increase of 2 ppm in H2 values was not significant deferent. Neither was possible to establish an association between breath H2 and the clinical response to a fiber diet. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study we could not detect ary association between breath H2 levels and the clinical response to dietary fiber.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human gut harbours a complex community of bacteria whose relationship with their host is normally mutually beneficial. Recent studies suggest a disturbance of this relationship in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the potential to correct this using prebiotics and probiotics. AIM: To review the mechanisms of action of probiotics and prebiotics in IBS and to assess their performance in clinical trials. METHODS: Articles relating to modes of action and randomized control trials of treatment were reviewed by searching PubMed using terms 'probiotic', 'prebiotic' and 'irritable bowel'. Small uncontrolled studies in IBS were excluded. RESULTS: Probiotics can enhance gut barrier function, inhibit pathogen binding and modulate gut inflammatory response. They can also reduce visceral hypersensitivity associated with both inflammation and psychological stress. Probiotics can alter colonic fermentation and stabilize the colonic microbiota. Several large randomized, placebo-controlled trials of adequate design have shown an improvement in flatulence and abdominal distension with a reduction in composite IBS symptoms scores. CONCLUSIONS: Each probiotic has unique features and IBS patients are heterogeneous. Future efforts should be directed to identifying biomarkers of responsiveness to facilitate better targeting of treatment and hence improved efficacy.},

   abstract = {Dientamoeba fragilis is a gastrointestinal protozoan that has a worldwide distribution and is emergeing as a common cause of diarrhea. As D. fragilis has a propensity to cause chronic illness with symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) it is not surprising that some patients with D. fragilis are misdiagnosed as having IBS. In contrast to most other pathogenic protozoa very little is known about its life cycle, epidemiology and mode of transmission. What role animal reservoirs play in the transmission of this parasite is unknown. Consequently we undertook a prospective study to determine the host distribution of D. fragilis. Over a 2-year-period, 608 faecal samples from a wide range of animal and bird species, including pigs and other food species, were screened using permanent stained smears for the presence of D. fragilis. Trophozoites of D. fragilis were only detected in Western lowland gorillas (3/10) (Gorilla g. gorilla) and confirmed by PCR targeting the SSU rRNA gene. The limited host range detected suggests human infection may not involve transmission from other animal species. In addition, we provide an update on the limited knowledge about the life cycle of this parasite and its host distribution.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stress and central corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) are contributing factors to the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It has been shown that restraint stress and central CRF stimulate colonic motility in rats. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced by bacterial fermentation from dietary fibers. It is controversial whether daily intake of dietary fiber is beneficial for patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. We studied whether dietary fiber intake affects colonic transit and motility stimulated by restraint stress and central CRF in rats. METHODS: Corn starch is digested almost completely in the small intestine, while potato starch shows substantial resistance to alpha-amylase and its consumption leads to stimulation of large-bowel fermentation. Four weeks after a corn starch, potato starch, or usual diet (rat chow), colonic transit and motility stimulated by restraint stress and intracisternal (ic) injection of CRF were studied. Fecal concentration of SCFAs in the cecum was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: Four-week treatment with potato starch diet significantly increased cecal concentrations of SCFAs, compared to treatment with corn starch diet. Accelerated colonic transit induced by stress and ic injection of CRF (1 microg) were significantly attenuated in rats receiving potato starch diet compared to rats receiving corn starch diet. The incidence of unformed stool (diarrhea) induced by stress and CRF was also reduced in rats receiving potato starch diet compared to rats receiving corn starch diet and usual diet. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that daily intake of a high-fiber diet may prevent stress- and CRF-induced acceleration of colonic transit and diarrhea. This study may contribute to treatment for the patients of diarrhea-predominant IBS.},

   abstract = {Whilst fruits and vegetables are an essential part of our dietary intake, the role of fiber in the prevention of colorectal diseases remains controversial. The main feature of a high-fiber diet is its poor digestibility. Soluble fiber like pectins, guar and ispaghula produce viscous solutions in the gastrointestinal tract delaying small bowel absorption and transit. Insoluble fiber, on the other hand, pass largely unaltered through the gut. The more fiber is ingested, the more stools will have to be passed. Fermentation in the intestines results in build up of large amounts of gases in the colon. This article reviews the physiology of ingestion of fiber and defecation. It also looks into the impact of dietary fiber on various colorectal diseases. A strong case cannot be made for a protective effect of dietary fiber against colorectal polyp or cancer. Neither has fiber been found to be useful in chronic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome. It is also not useful in the treatment of perianal conditions. The fiber deficit - diverticulosis theory should also be challenged. The authors urge clinicians to keep an open mind about fiber. One must be aware of the truths and myths about fiber before recommending it.},

   abstract = {One fifth of the population report adverse reactions to food. Reasons for these symptoms are heterogeneous, varying from food allergy, food intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome to somatoform or other mental disorders. Literature reveals a large discrepancy between truly diagnosed food allergy and reports of food allergy symptoms by care seekers. In most studies currently available the characterization of patient groups is incomplete, because they did not distinguish between immunologic reactions and other kinds of food reactions. In analysing these adverse reactions, a thorough physical and psychological diagnostic approach is important. In our qualitative review, we present those diagnostic measures that are evidence-based as well as clinically useful, and discuss the various psychological dimensions of adverse reactions to food. It is important to acknowledge the complex interplay between body and mind: Adults and children suffering from food allergy show impaired quality of life and a higher level of stress and anxiety. Pavlovian conditioning of adverse reactions plays an important role in maintaining symptoms. The role of personality, mood, or anxiety in food reactions is debatable. Somatoform disorders ought to be identified early to avoid lengthy and frustrating investigations. A future task will be to improve diagnostic algorithms, to describe psychological aspects in clearly characterised patient subgroups, and to develop strategies for an optimized management of the various types of adverse reactions to food.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract represents the most important extra pineal source of melatonin. Presence of melatonin (M) suggests that this hormone is somehow involved in digestive pathophysiology. Release of GI melatonin from serotonin-rich enterochromaffin EC cells of the GI mucosa suggest close antagonistic relationship with serotonin (S) and seem to be related to periodicity of food intake. Food deprivation resulted in an increase of tissue and plasma concentrations of M. Its also act as an autocrine and paracrine hormone affecting not only epithelium and immune system but also smooth muscle of the digestive tract. Low doses M improve gastrointestinal transit and affect MMC. M reinforce MMCs cyclic pattern but inhibits spiking bowel activity. Pharmacological doses of M delay gastric emptying via mechanisms that involve CCK2 and 5HT3 receptors. M released in response to lipid infusion exerts a modulatory influence that decreases the inhibitory effects of the ileal brake on gastric emptying. On isolated bowel S induces dose dependent increase in tone and reduction in amplitude of contraction which is affected by M. M reduced the tone but not amplitude or frequency of contraction. M is a promising therapeutic agent for IBS with activities independent of its effects on sleep, anxiety or depression. Since of its unique properties M could be considered for prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, gastric ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mast cells have a primary role in atopy. Mast cells may play a unique role in a subgroup of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This observation suggests a link between atopic disorders and IBS. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is an association between atopic disorders and IBS. METHODS: We undertook a prospective study using structured questionnaires. We administered questionnaires to 125 consecutive patients seen in the following clinics from July 1 through October 31, 2001: allergy/immunology (AI) (n = 39), gastroenterology (n = 36), and general medicine (n = 50). The survey included questions detailing gastrointestinal and allergic symptoms. Diagnosis of IBS was based on Rome II criteria. Diagnosis of atopy was based on clinical parameters. RESULTS: The AI clinic reported a significantly (P = .015) higher rate of IBS than the general medicine clinic. The IBS incidence reported in the AI clinic was similar to that reported in the gastroenterology clinic. The likelihood of IBS was significantly higher in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (2.67 times; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-6.49; P = .03), patients with allergic eczema (3.85 times; 95% CI, 1.72-8.60; P = .001), and patients with depression (2.56 times; 95% CI, 1.05-6.14; P = .04). Patients reporting atopic symptoms (seasonal allergic rhinitis, allergic eczema, and asthma) were 3.20 times (95% CI, 1.20-8.50) (P = .02) more likely to fulfill the criteria for IBS. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with atopic symptoms report a high incidence of IBS, suggesting a link between atopy and IBS. We proposed a subgroup of patients with IBS (atopic IBS) who have typical IBS symptoms in association with atopic manifestations. Identifying atopic vs nonatopic IBS may help in identifyingthe underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and therapeutic options.},

These conditions have a significant impact on patients' quality of life, as well as on the US economy, both in terms of healthcare costs and lost productivity. Treatment typically begins with lifestyle changes, increased fiber intake and osmotic and stimulant laxative intake. However, treatments for constipation vary in terms of their efficacy and safety. Furthermore, surveys of physicians and patients have revealed a strong desire for improved therapeutic options. Lubiprostone is a synthetic bicyclic fatty acid that is gut selective and stimulates type 2 chloride channels, resulting in increased chloride, sodium and water secretion into the lumen. The increased fluid secretion causes luminal distension, secondary peristalsis and laxation. Randomized Phase III trials have shown that lubiprostone is efficacious in the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. The US FDA has approved lubiprostone at a dose of 24 microg twice daily for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults, and at a dose of 8 microg twice daily for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in adult women. Nausea, diarrhea and headaches are the most commonly reported side effects. In long-term studies, lubiprostone appears to be safe.},

   abstract = {GOALS: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of food hypersensitivity in Turkish patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). BACKGROUND: The IBS is a chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by abdominal pain, distension, meteorism and either diarrhea or constipation. The role of diet in the pathogenesis of IBS remains controversial. Many investigators have shown that individual foods can trigger symptoms in some patients; nevertheless, the percentage of patients that benefit from dietary manipulation ranges from 15% to 67% in different reports. STUDY: Skin prick test to 11 common allergens, total IgE, eosinophilic cationic protein and eosinophil counts were evaluated in 100 patients satisfying the Rome II criteria and compared with 25 healthy controls. The history and physical examination of the groups were recorded and Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories were performed. RESULTS: One hundred patients were entered into the study with a mean age of 45.63+/-12.91 years. Of the patients 53 had constipation predominant, 19 had diarrhea predominant, and 28 had alternating type IBS. Skin prick tests positivity were more common among the IBS patients in comparison with controls (25% and 1%, respectively, P<0.05). Mean IgE values were higher in patients than controls (70.83+/-66.05 and 15.20+/-14.01 IU/mL, respectively, P<0.000). Eosinophilic cationic protein values were also higher in IBS patients than controls (16.75+/-11.28 and 11.56+/-4.72, respectively, P<0.05) Evaluation of Beck Depression Inventory showed that tendency to depression in patients with IBS was 38% and 4% in controls (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, in patients complaining of IBS it is of importance to search for a food component. Clinical improvements can be observed after the introduction of an adequate exclusion diet.},

   abstract = {The gut contains a diverse bacterial flora that is acquired at birth and has a number of physiological functions. Administration of prebiotics or probiotics may favourably alter this gut microflora. Prebiotics are poorly digested oligosaccharides that promote the growth of desirable bacteria and may have other beneficial gastrointestinal and systemic effects. Probiotics are "helpful" human bacteria that provide a variety of health benefits when administered exogenously. Probiotics produce beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of traveller's diarrhoea, viral diarrhoea, and diarrhoea in day care centres. Moreover, probiotics have been shown to reduce relapses associated with Clostridium difficile, and Lactobacilli are effective in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Probiotics may also be efficacious in the treatment of gastroenteritis. Clinical studies of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease have proved disappointing, but beneficial effects in adults with irritable bowel syndrome have been reported with Bifidobacterium infantis 35624. Lactobacilli GG reduces the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms and gut permeability in patients with atopic dermatitis, and administration of probiotics reduces the frequency and severity of atopic eczema when administered to pregnant women and then to newborn infants. In conclusion, probiotics are effective in the treatment and/or prevention of a number of conditions, including diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome and atopic dermatitis, and the product used should be selected based on the particular indication.},

   abstract = {The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has increased over the last 50 years in countries where a Western-style diet has been prominent or introduced and 20 - 65 % of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) attribute their symptoms to something in food that activates an abnormal response. However, data from dietary elimination and re-challenge studies are inconclusive. Although investigations have shown that bran may be helpful in some patients, a complete review of the literature does not reveal conclusive evidence that a high fibre diet therapy is effective in IBS. From the limited reports on probiotics, there appears to be a trend to decreasing symptoms. Despite numerous reviews on this subject, it is very difficult to give general dietary advice to IBS patients, but dietary experts may have a positive role in managing such patients. It is clear that much more prospective research is needed to study both dietary factors and probiotics in these areas.},

Despite this, there is no consensus as to the pathogenesis of this disorder or a consistently effective therapeutic regimen for many patients. This has encouraged the use of various alternative therapies from behavioral or complementary medicine. This review will address the evidence for alternative therapies, including the following: cognitive behavior therapy, hypnosis, elimination diets based on food antibody testing, nutrition supplements (such as fiber, probiotics, and prebiotics), and, finally, peppermint, l-glutamine, zinc, and cromolyn sodium. The review also explores the evidence for and the therapeutic ramifications of the hypothesis that increased intestinal permeability underlies the symptoms of IBS in many patients, and how a therapeutic plan that addresses nutrition, elimination diets, and nutrition supplements may be useful in restoring the integrity of the gut immune barrier.},

There is evidence that duodenal eosinophils are increased in functional dyspepsia, whereas mast cells are increased in the lower gut in irritable bowel syndrome, directly supporting a role for a hypersensitivity-type reaction in these disorders. The trigger may be a pathogen, food, or other allergen in the gut mucosa. This trigger may evoke eosinophils, mast cells, and other components to cascade to up-regulate serotonin release, with modulation of the enteric and central nervous systems, creating a vicious cycle. If correct, this theory suggests treatment should specifically target the eosinophil-mast cell pathway.},

   abstract = {The enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract secrete 400 times as much melatonin as the pineal gland; therefore, it is not surprising that research is finding that this indole plays an important role in GI functioning. In animal studies, it protects against GI ulcerations, and randomized clinical trials suggest its efficacy in treating functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. Melatonin administration has been shown to protect against esophageal lesions in animals. Moreover, in a randomized, single-blind clinical trial of subjects with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the combination of melatonin with other natural supplements was found to be superior to omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Its administration as a single treatment for GERD has not been previously reported. A 64-year-old Caucasian female who required treatment with a PPI for symptoms of GERD wished to substitute a natural treatment because of the risk of worsening her osteoporosis. She experienced a return of symptoms following each of three 20-day trials of a proprietary blend of D-limonene when attempts were made to discontinue the PPI. She then underwent a trial of a natural formula consisting of melatonin 6 mg, 5-hydroxytryptophan 100 mg, D,L-methionine 500 mg, betaine 100 mg, L-taurine 50 mg, riboflavin 1.7 mg, vitamin B6 0.8 mg, folic acid 400 microg, and calcium 50 mg. After 40 days, the PPI was withdrawn without a return of symptoms. Subsequently, an attempt to reduce melatonin to 3 mg resulted in symptoms, while all other ingredients were withdrawn with minimal symptoms during 10 months of follow-up.},

   abstract = {Recently, the use of tegaserod and alosetron -- drugs approved for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) -- has been restricted because of adverse events. This has resulted in a need for additional modalities for the treatment of IBS. Our objective was to determine the effectiveness of probiotics in the global relief of symptoms associated with IBS and in the improvement of flatulence, abdominal pain, transit time, and bacterial counts. Using the MEDLINE database from 1966-October 2007 and manually searching article references for relevant articles and abstracts, we identified 14 blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials of the effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment of IBS. Of 11 studies in which overall symptom relief was assessed, seven indicated a significant improvement with probiotics versus placebo. Five of eight investigations of abdominal pain and distention revealed a benefit with probiotic use. Four studies demonstrated an improvement in symptomatic flatulence in probiotic treatment groups, whereas one study showed no significant benefit. Four of five studies of the effects of probiotics on colonic transit time revealed a benefit compared with placebo. As probiotics have shown benefit and possess a favorable adverse-effect profile, their use may represent an option for symptom relief in patients with IBS. However, additional data are necessary before probiotics can become a standard of care in the treatment of IBS, a complex and chronic condition.},

AIM: To investigate the effect of LAB4, a multistrain probiotic preparation on symptoms of IBS. This probiotic preparation has not previously been assessed in IBS. METHODS: Fifty-two participants with IBS, as defined by the Rome II criteria, participated in this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Participants were randomized to receive either a probiotic preparation comprising two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 (NCIMB 30157) and CUL21 (NCIMB 30156), Bifidobacterium lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) and Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) at a total of 2.5 x 10(10) cfu/capsule or a placebo for 8 weeks. Participants reported their IBS symptoms using a questionnaire fortnightly during the intervention and at 2 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: A significantly greater improvement in the Symptom Severity Score of IBS and in scores for quality of life, days with pain and satisfaction with bowel habit was observed over the 8-week intervention period in the volunteers receiving the probiotic preparation than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: LAB4 multistrain probiotic supplement may benefit subjects with IBS.},

   abstract = {A unified scenario emerges when it is considered that a major impact of stress on the intestinal tract is reflected by symptoms reminiscent of the diarrhea-predominant form of irritable bowel syndrome. Cramping abdominal pain, fecal urgency, and explosive watery diarrhea are hallmarks not only of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, but also of infectious enteritis, radiation-induced enteritis, and food allergy. The scenario starts with stress-induced compromise of the intestinal mucosal barrier and continues with microorganisms or other sensitizing agents crossing the barrier and being intercepted by enteric mast cells. Mast cells signal the presence of the agent to the enteric nervous system (ie, the brain-in-the-gut), which uses one of the specialized programs from its library of programs to remove the "threat." This is accomplished by stimulating mucosal secretion, which flushes the threatening agent into the lumen and maintains it in suspension. The secretory response then becomes linked to powerful propulsive motility, which propels the secretions together with the offending agent rapidly in the anal direction. Cramping abdominal pain accompanies the strong propulsive contractions. Urgency is experienced when arrival of the large bolus of liquid distends the recto-sigmoid region and reflexly opens the internal anal sphincter, with continence protection now provided only by central reflexes that contract the puborectalis and external anal sphincter muscles. Sensory information arriving in the brain from receptors in the rapidly distending recto-sigmoid accounts for the conscious sensation of urgency and might exacerbate the individual's emotional stress. The symptom of explosive watery diarrhea becomes self-explanatory in this scenario.},

   abstract = {Synthetic cDNA encoding pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) leptin (pfLEP) was prepared according to the published sequence. The pfLEP, transformed into Escherichia coli and expressed upon induction with nalidixic acid, was found almost entirely in the insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs). The proteins were solubilized, refolded and purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography and gel-filtration. The respective yield of dimers and monomers was 50-100mg from 5L of fermentation culture. Circular dichroism analyses revealed similarity of the purified pfLEP secondary structure to that of mammalian leptins. The purified monomers and dimers showed a single band of approximately 15 kDa following SDS-PAGE in the presence of reducing agent, whereas the dimer showed one band of approximately 30 kDa in the absence of reducing agent, indicating its formation by S-S bonds. The purified product also showed a single peak following gel-filtration under nondenaturating conditions and reverse-phase chromatography. Monomeric and dimeric pfLEPs were stable for at least 6 months in sterile solution frozen at -20 degrees C or as lyophilized powder. Both pfLEPs were biologically active in promoting proliferation of BAF/3 cells stably transfected with the long form of human leptin (hLEP) receptor, but their activity was four to five orders of magnitude lower than that of hLEP. The specificity of this activity was further evidenced by its complete inhibition by hLEP antagonist. In contrast to mammalian leptins, neither form of pfLEP bound to or formed 1:1 complex with chicken leptin-binding domain, likely due to low affinity. No specific binding of either ovine or pufferfish leptins to tilapia liver membranes was detected. This work is the first report on the purification of leptin from any fish species.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic effects on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by eliminating the allergic foods according to food-specific IgG antibodies and to clarify the etiopathological role and mechanism of food allergy. METHODS: The food-specific IgG antibodies to a panel of 14 different food antigens in serum were detected with ELISA in fifty five cases with diarrhea-dominant IBS, thirty two with constipation-dominant IBS and eighteen normal controls. The frequency and severity index of symptoms and scores of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) in thirty five cases with positive food-specific IgG were observed before and after elimination of allergic foods for two months. RESULTS: The positive rate of serum food-specific IgG antibodies was 63.6 percent in patients with diarrhea-dominant IBS and 43.8 percent in constipation-dominant IBS. Both were higher than that in normal controls. After eliminating allergic foods for four weeks according to the levels of serum food-specific IgG antibodies, the frequency of symptoms decreased from (3.79 +/- 1.58) to (1.67 +/- 0.70) per week and the severity from 3.18 +/- 1.46 to 1.52 +/- 0.67 with significant differences. After eight weeks, the frequency of symptoms decreased from (3.79 +/- 1.58) to (1.53 +/- 0.69) per week and the severity from 3.18 +/- 1.46 to 1.45 +/- 0.66, also with significant differences. After eliminating allergic foods, the overall health score and the eight dimensionality integrals of QOL except avoiding food in patients with IBS increased significantly than those before treatment. At the end of eight weeks, the symptoms relieved completely in 31.4 percent of the cases and remarkably in 34.3 percent. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal immune reactions mediated by IgG antibodies coexisted in patients with IBS. It is of great significance in treating IBS by eliminating the allergic foods according to the serum level of food-specific IgG antibodies.},

METHODS: The model of IBS rat was established by decoction of Folium Sennae and restraint stress, effects of Changan Granule were studied through observing the influences on rat weight and the content of NO and 5-HT in serum. RESULTS: Compared to those of the model group, Changan Granule could improve diarrhea induced by Folium Sennae and increase body weight obviously (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Compared to the control group, Changan Granule could also increase the content of NO and 5-HT in serum significantly (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Through histological survey, we discovered that the high and middle dose of Changan Granule could change the symptom of inflammation and improve the morphous of epithelium mucosae compared to the model group. And there were no obvious pathological changes on the high and middle dose groups of Changan Granule compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: Changan Granule is effective to cure IBS and has protective effects on the bowel mucosae.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The intestinal permeability is increased in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). AIM: To determine the possible efficacy of lactic acid bacteria on the increased intestinal permeability in D-IBS. METHODS: Treatment was employed for 4 weeks in a randomized single blind placebo controlled study with 30 D-IBS patients. Patients were given either probiotic fermented milk (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium Longum) or milk beverage containing no bacteria. The clinical symptoms were scored and intestinal permeability was measured by a triple sugar test before and after treatment. RESULTS: Small bowel permeability was measured as the ratio of lactulose and mannitol recovery and colonic permeability was measured as the total mass of sucralose excretion (mg). After probiotics treatment, small bowel permeability decreased significantly from 0.038 (0.024) at baseline to 0.023 (0.020) (P = 0.004), the proportion of patients with increased small bowel permeability was lower than baseline (28.6% vs. 64.3%, P = 0.023). However, colonic permeability improved neither in the probiotics group nor in the placebo group at week 4. Treatment with probiotics significantly decreased the mean global IBS scores compared with the baseline scores (9.62 +/- 1.05 vs. 7.64 +/- 1.24, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Short-term active lactic acid bacteria treatment for D-IBS improved mucosal barrier function.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among school adolescents in China. METHOD: A stratified, randomized study by cluster sampling was conducted, which recruited 51,956 students from high and primary schools in Chinese cities. All students were requested to fill in a questionnaire. RESULT: (1) Factors including class (odds ratio 1.12), excessive intake of pepper (odds ratio 1.17), fried (odds ratio 1.08) and starch-based foods (odds ratio 1.06), gastrointestinal tract infection (odds ratio 2.66), abuse of analgesic (odds ratio 1.49), inheritance (odds ratio 1.83), fatigue (odds ratio 1.32) and repression (odds ratio 1.45) were significantly associated with the presence of IBS (P < 0.05). High protein food (odds ratio 0.90) was a protective factor. CONCLUSION: Different food intake, gastrointestinal tract infection, abuse of analgesic, inheritance and psychological factors might be related to development of IBS in the students of the cities involved in this study.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-prandial worsening of symptoms as well as adverse reactions to one or more foods are common in the patients with functional gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD). However, the role played by true food allergy in the pathogenesis of these diseases is still controversial and there are no well-established tests to identify food allergy in this condition. OBJECTIVE: To investigate serum food antigen-specific IgG, IgE antibody and total IgE antibody titres in controls and patients with IBS and FD, and to correlate symptoms with the food antigen-specific IgG titres in IBS and FD patients. METHODS: Thirty-seven IBS patients, 28 FD patients and 20 healthy controls participated in this study. Serum IgG and IgE antibody titres to 14 common foods including beef, chicken, codfish, corn, crab, eggs, mushroom, milk, pork, rice, shrimp, soybean, tomatoes and wheat were analysed by ELISA. Serum total IgE titres were also measured. Last, symptomatology was assessed in the study. Results IBS patients had significantly higher titres of IgG antibody to crab (P=0.000), egg (P=0.000), shrimp (P=0.000), soybean (P=0.017) and wheat (P=0.004) than controls. FD patients had significantly higher titres of IgG antibody to egg (P=0.000) and soybean (P=0.017) than controls. The percentage of individuals with detectable positive food antigen-specific IgE antibodies of the three groups did not show any significant differences (P=0.971). There were no significant differences between IBS patients, FD patients and controls in the serum total IgE antibody titres (P=0.978). Lastly, no significant correlation was seen between symptom severity and serum food antigen-specific IgG antibody titres both in IBS and FD patients. CONCLUSION: Serum IgG antibody titres to some common foods increased in IBS and FD patients compared to controls. But there is no significant correlation between symptom severity and elevated serum food antigen-specific IgG antibodies in these patients.},
