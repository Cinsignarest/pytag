   abstract = {Tegaserod, a selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) 5-HT(4) receptor partial agonist, is indicated in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who identify abdominal pain or discomfort and constipation as their predominant symptoms. Tegaserod at dosages of 1 to 12 mg/day exerts pharmacodynamic actions in the upper and the lower gastrointestinal tract, accelerating small bowel and colonic transit in patients with IBS. Tegaserod is rapidly absorbed following oral administration; peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) are reached after approximately 1 hour. Absolute bioavailability is about 10% under fasted conditions. Food reduces the bioavailability of tegaserod by 40 to 65% and the C(max) by 20 to 40%. Systemic exposure to tegaserod is not significantly altered at neutral gastric pH compared with the fasted state (pH 2). Tegaserod is approximately 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein, and has a volume of distribution at steady-state of 368 +/- 223L. Tegaserod is metabolised mainly via two pathways. The first is a presystemic acid-catalysed hydrolysis in the stomach followed by oxidation and conjugation which produces the main metabolite of tegaserod, 5-methoxyindole-3-carboxylic acid glucuronide (M 29.0). This metabolite has negligible affinity for 5-HT(4) receptors and is devoid of promotile activity. The second is direct glucuronidation which leads to generation of three isomeric N-glucuronides. The plasma clearance of tegaserod is 77 +/- 15 L/h, with an estimated terminal half-life of 11 +/- 5 hours following intravenous administration. Approximately two-thirds of the orally administered dose of tegaserod is excreted unchanged in faeces, with the remainder excreted in urine, primarily as M 29.0. The pharmacokinetics of tegaserod are dose-proportional over the range 2 to 12mg given twice daily for 5 days, with no relevant accumulation. The pharmacokinetics of tegaserod in patients with IBS are comparable to those in healthy individuals, and similar between men and women. No dosage adjustment is required in elderly patients or those with mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment. Tegaserod should not be used in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment. No clinically relevant drug-drug interactions with tegaserod have been identified. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies with theophylline [a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 prototype substrate], dextromethorphan (a CYP2D6 prototype substrate), digoxin, warfarin and oral contraceptives have indicated no clinically relevant interactions and no requirement for dosage adjustment.},

   abstract = {Attention has been directed to the putative role of low grade mucosal inflammation in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) on the basis of evidence showing that some patients with IBS have an increased number of inflammatory cells in the colonic and ileal mucosa. Previous episodes of infectious enteritis, genetic factors, undiagnosed food allergies, and changes in bacterial microflora may all play a role in promoting and perpetuating this low grade inflammatory process. Human and animal studies support the concept that inflammation may perturb gastrointestinal reflexes and activate the visceral sensory system even when the inflammatory response is minimal and confined to the mucosa. Thus abnormal neuroimmune interactions may contribute to the altered gastrointestinal physiology and hypersensitivity that underlies IBS. A brief review of the human and animal studies that have focused on the putative role of intestinal inflammation and infections in the pathogenesis of IBS is given.},

The irritable bowel syndrome is characterised by sudden and unforeseeable changes in the two main symptoms, constipation and diarrhoea, even within a few days. The amount and composition of proximal colon microflora, increasing with regard to the above-mentioned factors, and the time in which this development occurs, are, in our opinion, elements taking part, together with colon dysmotility and alterations of visceral perception, in the onset of the variability in stool frequency, typical of these patients. The present open noncontrolled trial is the first observation showing a clinical improvement related to changes in the composition of the faecal bacterial flora and in faecal biochemistry and, remarkably, in the colonic motility pattern, all of which induced by administration of probiotics, in patients with functional diarrhoea.},

   abstract = {Abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, need to rush to the toilet, straining, feeling of incomplete bowel emptying and alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation is the clinical definition of the irritable bowel syndrome. The internationally used syndrome definition is based on expert opinions and answers to patient questionnaires. When symptoms are registered prospectively, abdominal pain starts or worsens after meals and is not relieved by defecation. As in the general population patients with the syndrome define diarrhea as loose stools and constipation as hard stools regardless of stool frequencies. Variation in defecatory symptoms and discrepancies between these symptoms and stool consistency are the hallmarks of the syndrome, and the degree of variation per fortnight is relatively stable in the individual patient. Fermentation of carbohydrates by colonic bacteria, increased sensitivity to bowel distention by gas, gas-producing food, increased secretion of cholecystokinin after fatty meals and/or increased sympathetic nerve tone at stress can give rise to symptoms. Symptoms can start after a single period of bacterial gastroenteritis. Although patients seeking medical care for the syndrome are more often anxious, the syndrome itself is not psychosomatic. Symptoms are possibly mediated through partial degranulation of mast cells in bowel mucosa, but this does not make it an allergic disease. If bowel dysmotility can be measured, early stage or a mild case of intestinal pseudoobstruction should be considered. Hyperreactivity in the enteric nervous system and/or in the brain is the likely main cause of the symptoms. More widespread activity in the brain after exposure to stimuli originating from bowel nerves or less inhibition of this stimulation in the brain are possible mechanisms.},

   abstract = {DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospectively, the effect of a lactose-restricted diet was evaluated among irritable bowel syndrome patients with lactose malabsorption. Lactose malabsorption was defined by a positive hydrogen breath test and a positive blood-glucose test. An analysis of symptoms was completed before, during, 6 weeks after and 5 years after starting the diet. In addition, the number of visits made by the patients to the outpatient clinic was scored during 6 years. RESULTS: In 17 out of 70 irritable bowel syndrome patients (24.3%), lactose malabsorption was detected. There was no difference in the symptom score between patients with a positive lactose tolerance test and patients with a negative lactose tolerance test. After 6 weeks of the lactose-restricted diet, symptoms were markedly improved in lactose malabsorption-positive patients (P < 0.001). After 5 years, one patient was lost for follow-up, and 14 out of the remaining 16 lactose malabsorption patients (87.5%) still had no complaints during the lactose-restricted diet. Two patients chose not to follow the diet continuously and accepted the discomfort caused by lactose intake. Only two out of 16 patients (12.5%) no longer experienced any benefit from lactose restriction. In the 5 years before their diagnosis of lactose malabsorption, these 16 patients visited the outpatient clinic a total of 192 times (mean 2.4 visits per year per person; range 1-7 visits). In the 5 years after diagnosis, they visited the outpatient clinic a total of 45 times (mean 0.6 visits per year per person; range 0-6 visits; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In a large majority of irritable bowel syndrome patients with lactose malabsorption, which was previously clinically unrecognized, a lactose-restricted diet improved symptoms markedly both in the short term and the long term. Furthermore, visits by all patients to the outpatient clinic were reduced by 75%. We conclude that diet therapy is extremely cost- and time-saving. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that lactose malabsorption, which is easily treatable, is excluded before diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome.},

Moreover, the pathophysiology is not completely understood; however, abnormal gastrointestinal motility, altered sensory activity, central neural dysfunction, psychological disturbances, and luminal factors have been proposed. Treatment requires a multifaceted approach. Education, dietary measures, fiber supplementation, and pharmacological and psychological interventions have been used in the management of this disorder.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a major source of extrapineal melatonin. In some animals, tissue concentrations of melatonin in the GIT surpass blood levels by 10-100 times and the digestive tract contributes significantly to melatonin concentrations in the peripheral blood, particularly during the day. Some melatonin found in the GIT may originate from the pineal gland, as the organs of the digestive system contain binding sites, which in some species exhibit circadian variation. Unlike the production of pineal melatonin, which is under the photoperiodic control, release of GI melatonin seems to be related to periodicity of food intake. Melatonin and melatonin binding sites were localized in all GI tissues of mammalian and avian embryos. Postnatally, melatonin was localized in the GIT of newborn mice and rats. Phylogenetically, melatonin and melatonin binding sites were detected in GIT of numerous mammals, birds and lower vertebrates. Melatonin is probably produced in the serotonin-rich enterochromaffin cells (EC) of the GI mucosa and can be released into the portal vein postprandially. In addition, melatonin can act as an autocrine or a paracrine hormone affecting the function of GI epithelium, lymphatic tissues of the immune system and the smooth muscles of the digestive tube. Finally, melatonin may act as a luminal hormone, synchronizing the sequential digestive processes. Higher peripheral and tissue levels of melatonin were observed not only after food intake but also after a long-term food deprivation. Such melatonin release may have a direct effect on the various GI tissues but may also act indirectly via the CNS; such action might be mediated by sympathetic or parasympathetic nerves. Melatonin can protect GI mucosa from ulceration by its antioxidant action, stimulation of the immune system and by fostering microcirculation and epithelial regeneration. Melatonin may reduce the secretion of pepsin and the hydrochloric acid and influence the activity of the myoelectric complexes of the gut via its action in the CNS. Tissue or blood levels of melatonin may serve as a marker of GI lesions or tumors. Clinically, melatonin has a potential for a prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, children colic and diarrhea.},

The concentration of melatonin in the gastrointestinal tissues surpasses blood levels by 10-100 times and there is at least 400x more melatonin in the gastrointestinal tract than in the pineal gland. The gastrointestinal tract contributes significantly to circulating concentrations of melatonin, especially during the daytime and melatonin may serve as an endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine hormone influencing the regeneration and function of epithelium, enhancing the immune system of the gut, and reducing the tone of gastrointestinal muscles. As binding sites for melatonin exhibit circadian variation in various species, it has been hypothesized that some melatonin found in the gastrointestinal tract might be of pineal origin. Unlike the photoperiodically regulated production of melatonin in the pineal, the release of gastrointestinal melatonin seems to be related to the periodicity of food intake. Phylogenetically, melatonin and its binding sites were detected in the gastrointestinal tract of lower vertebrates, birds, and mammals. Melatonin was found also in large quantities in the embryonic tissue of the mammalian and avian gastrointestinal tract. Food intake and, paradoxically, also longterm food deprivation resulted in an increase of tissue and plasma concentrations of melatonin. Melatonin release may have a direct effect on many gastrointestinal tissues but may also well influence the digestive tract indirectly, via the central nervous system and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Melatonin prevents ulcerations of gastrointestinal mucosa by an antioxidant action, reduction of secretion of hydrochloric acid, stimulation of the immune system, fostering epithelial regeneration, and increasing microcirculation. Because of its unique properties, melatonin could be considered for prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, gastric ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, and childhood colic.},

   abstract = {The aim of this literature review is to produce guidelines for dietetic practice in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by evaluating the research available. In this area randomized control trials (RCT) only account for a small proportion of the literature and have been concentrated in the modification of dietary fibre in patients with IBS. The bulk of the literature is mainly observational trials from which no indisputable conclusions can be extracted. In this review, the evidence available has been interpreted within the context of the current knowledge base. Conclusions are drawn to facilitate the development of guidelines, enabling a starting point for discussion and an evaluation of current practice. The literature available on therapeutic dietary manipulation in IBS patients is centred around non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs), mono and disaccharide sensitivity and food intolerance. The production of these guidelines has focused on research examining the role of dietary components in the therapeutic management of patients with IBS. However, where there is a deficiency in the literature directly relating dietary intake to management of IBS patients, physiological function in relation to dietary components has been relied upon to produce practical guidelines which can be applied realistically in a clinical environment. An interpretation of the evidence has revealed a limited role for exclusion diets, a move away from high-fibre diets towards the manipulation of fibre fractions in the diet, an evaluation of the effects of caffeine on gut function and the necessity for individual dietary assessment to identify dietary issues pertinent to the patient's symptoms. These guidelines outline a positive role for dietitians in the treatment of IBS patients which draws on the unique skills possessed by dietitians regarding the assessment of habitual eating habits and therapeutic dietary manipulation.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common disorder diagnosed by gastroenterologists and one of the more common ones encountered in general practice. The overall prevalence rate is similar (approximately 10%) in most industrialized countries; the illness has a large economic impact on health care use and indirect costs, chiefly through absenteeism. IBS is a biopsychosocial disorder in which 3 major mechanisms interact: psychosocial factors, altered motility, and/or heightened sensory function of the intestine. Subtle inflammatory changes suggest a role for inflammation, especially after infectious enteritis, but this has not yet resulted in changes in the approach to patient treatment. Treatment of patients is based on positive diagnosis of the symptom complex, limited exclusion of underlying organic disease, and institution of a therapeutic trial. If patient symptoms are intractable, further investigations are needed to exclude specific motility or other disorders. Symptoms fluctuate over time; treatment is often restricted to times when patients experience symptoms. Symptomatic treatment includes supplementing fiber to achieve a total intake of up to 30 g in those with constipation, those taking loperamide or other opioids for diarrhea, and those taking low-dose antidepressants or infrequently using antispasmodics for pain. Older conventional therapies do not address pain in IBS. Behavioral psychotherapy and hypnotherapy are also being evaluated. Novel approaches include alosetron; a 5-HT(3) antagonist, tegaserod, a partial 5-HT(4) agonist, kappa-opioid agonists, and neurokinin antagonists to address the remaining challenging symptoms of pain, constipation, and bloating. Understanding the brain-gut axis is key to the eventual development of effective therapies for IBS.},

Management of patients is based on a positive diagnosis of the symptom complex, careful history and physical examination to exclude 'red flags' as risk factors for organic disease, and, if indicated, investigations to exclude other disorders. Therapeutic choices include dietary fibre for constipation, opioid agents for diarrhoea and low-dose antidepressants or infrequent use of antispasmodics for pain, although the evidence basis for efficacy is limited or in some cases absent. Psychotherapy and hypnotherapy are the subject of ongoing study. Treatment should be tailored to patient needs and fears. Novel therapies are emerging, and drugs acting on serotonin receptors have proven efficacy and a scientific rationale and, if approved, should be useful in the overall management of patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Patient and physician education, early identification of psychosocial issues and better therapies are important strategies to reduce the suffering and societal cost of irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Abdominal bloating and distension are common symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The postulated pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these symptoms include increased production, retention, or perception of gas or luminal contents. The aims of this study were to prospectively compare the prevalence of, and clinical factors related to, bloating and distension in an IBS patient population. METHODS: A total of 714 consecutive patients who met Rome I criteria for IBS were prospectively surveyed, and were classified as having bloating alone (B) or bloating and distension (B+D) based on a comprehensive bowel symptom questionnaire. GI, extraintestinal, and psychological symptoms, as well as health-related quality of life measures were also assessed using validated survey instruments. RESULTS: A total of 542 IBS patients (76%) who reported abdominal bloating were studied. Of these, 132 patients fulfilled criteria for the B group, whereas 410 patients fulfilled criteria for the B+D group. There was a significantly different gender distribution in the B and B+D groups (female:male ratios, 1.4:1 and 2.8:1, respectively p < 0.02). There was also a significantly different bowel habit subgroup distribution, with a greater predominance of constipation in B+D group and of diarrhea in the B group (p < 0.03). Both groups were similar in other clinical parameters, including progressive worsening of symptoms during the day, and relief by passing stool or gas. Both bloating and distension worsened when other abdominal symptoms worsened. Abdominal distension was associated with greater symptom severity and less diurnal variation in symptoms, and was less often perceived as associated with food intake. CONCLUSIONS: Bloating and visible abdominal distension may arise from two distinct but interrelated physiological processes. Although the sensation of bloating may be related to enhanced sensitivity to visceral afferent stimulation, abdominal distension in more severely affected patients may be related to triggering of a visceromotor reflex affecting the tone of abdominal wall muscles.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are two of the most frequent syndromes in gastroenterology. However, very few epidemiological studies have been conducted in Peru and none in the Peruvian Jungle. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome in a jungle community of Peru and the recurrence percentage of these syndromes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample was taken from 231 persons randomly selected using the "home by home" method, according to the map provided by Punta del Este Medical Center (city of Tarapoto - Department of San Mart n). The persons, considered to best typify the general population of the city, took two tests (Dyspepsia Test and Manning Test) that were previously validated during the months of January through March 1999. RESULTS: The prevalence of dyspepsia was 37.6%, and that of IBS, 22.0%. From those with dyspepsia, 38% had also IBS. From those with IBS, 65% reported dyspepsia symptoms. Prevalence of IBS was higher in individuals with dyspepsia (37.9%) than in individuals without dyspepsia (12.5% p< 0.01). The prevalence of both dyspepsia and IBS decreases as age increases. A statistically significant difference related to ethnicity was found in individuals with IBS. Dyspepsia and ethnicity were associated in 31.4% to individuals having both pathologies (p< 0.0001 and OR=4.28). The dyspepsia/IBS ratio was 1.7/1. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of IBS and dyspepsia in the study population. The high association found between both syndromes may be due to the common etiopathogenic mechanisms they share such as: a visceral hypersensibility due to peripheral or central mechanisms, bowel motility disturbances or parasitosis. Our study suggests that both dyspepsia and IBS are the manifestations of the same digestive disorder, which has not been fully clarified yet.},

   abstract = {Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare gastrointestinal (GI) disorder of undetermined cause characterized by infiltration of eosinophils in the GI tract. Eosinophils accumulate in tissues and may release highly cytotoxic granular proteins, which cause severe tissue damage characteristic of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Eotaxin may play a role in the recruitment of eosinophils into tissue in combination with chemoattractants and cytokines, including interleukin 3 and 5 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Food allergy, especially in children, can be a triggering factor, and an amino acid-based diet may be helpful. Accumulation of eosinophils in the gut is a common feature in food-induced GI disorders that can be regulated through a complex molecular network involving Th2 cells, various cytokines, and chemokines. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation depending on the site of involvement. It may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome or dyspepsia and, rarely, mimics pancreatitis or appendicitis. Diagnosis is important and is usually made by a pathologist. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a treatable disease; patients generally respond to steroid therapy, although relapse is common. Non-enteric-coated budesonide, a locally acting corticosteroid with little risk of adrenal suppression, may be substituted, although more experience is needed. Promising new drugs for eosinophilic gastroenteritis include montelukast, a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist, and suplaplast tosilate, a selective Th2 cytokine inhibitor with inhibitory effects on allergy-induced eosinophilic infiltration and IgE production. Although it is likely a separate disease, more experience has accumulated, and an elimination or specific amino acid-based diet appears to be helpful in treatment.},

   abstract = {Constipation is a common disorder and many patients fail to respond to the simple constipation remedies of increased fiber and fluid intake. When secondary to other conditions, medications, or disease processes, the focus of constipation management is correction of causative factors. However, primary constipation - ie, constipation with no identifiable causative factor - is very common. Patients generally present with one of three patterns: constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, slow transit constipation, or pelvic floor dysfunction resulting in dyssynergic defecation. Baseline evaluation for patients with chronic constipation includes a careful history, focused physical examination, and limited laboratory studies. Patients with dyssynergic defecation usually respond best to biofeedback therapy and pelvic muscle re-education. Constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome is best managed with dietary monitoring and modifications, fiber therapy, and education regarding self-monitoring and self-care. Patients with slow transit constipation may benefit from fiber therapy and increased activity, but most also will require laxative therapy. Current guidelines for prescribing laxatives suggest bulk agents as first line and osmotic agents as second line therapy. Stimulant laxatives should generally be reserved for PRN use. Current understanding about the etiology, pathology, and classification of different types of constipation are summarized and a stepwise approach to evaluation and management is presented.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is a complex ecosystem host to a diverse and highly evolved microbial community composed of hundreds of different microbial species. The interactions that occur between this complex microbial community and the human host have become the focus of scientific research due to increases in the incidence of illnesses associated with deficient or compromised microflora (e.g., gastrointestinal tract infections, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome, antibiotic-induced diarrhea, constipation, food allergies, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers). Effective multidisciplinary research programs now complement conventional microbiology with molecular ecology techniques to provide culture-independent analysis of the gastrointestinal ecosystem. Furthermore, as we acquire an understanding of gut microflora composition and processes such as intestinal adherence, colonization, translocation, and immunomodulation, we are also elucidating mechanisms by which these can be influenced. This knowledge not only allows scientists to define the activities and interactions of "functional food"-borne beneficial bacteria in the gut, but will also provide the scientific basis for the development of innovative biotechnology-based products tailored to prevent specific diseases and promote overall human gastrointestinal health.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gut disorder the diagnosis of which is based on clinical symptoms as set forth by the Rome criteria. As the population ages, especially with the population of patients >75 years of age expanding greatly over the next 10 years, IBS is becoming one of the most common diseases of the elderly. Thus far, developing treatment strategies for patients with IBS has been difficult because of the lack of pharmacological targets and the wide range of symptomatology. Additionally, demonstration of a therapeutic benefit is difficult in the presence of a high placebo response observed regardless of the therapy employed. Fibre, antidiarrhoeals and antispasmodics all play some role in the symptomatic treatment of IBS. With the evolution of IBS as a disorder of visceral hypersensitivity, new drugs have been developed that target the enteric nervous system. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been found to target the enteric neurons and play a role in pain modulation. Currently, the TCAs are recommended only for severe cases of IBS pain. The newest class of drugs to be approved for use in IBS are the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) antagonists. Specifically, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been shown to decrease symptoms in female patients with IBS. A related class of drugs, the 5-HT4 receptor agonists, is being developed for the treatment of constipation-predominant IBS. Further investigation into the role of spinal afferent neurons in visceral hypersensitivity is at the forefront of IBS research. Several experimental drug therapies for IBS are also discussed in this review including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, octreotide, clonidine and the selective M3 receptor antagonist, zamifenacin.},

It was hypothesized that patients with IBS would show exaggerated autonomic and cortisol responses to the psychological stressor and that the stressor would enhance gastrointestinal symptoms. METHOD: Twenty-four women with IBS and 20 healthy women participated in the two-day study protocol. Both days were identical, with the exception that on one day, a stressful mental task was completed after ingestion of a standard meal. Heart rate variability, cortisol, affective, and symptomatic responses were measured before and after application of the stressor. RESULTS: Patients with IBS demonstrated increased negative affect at baseline and in response to the stressor. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not affected by the stressor. Appraisal of the stressor by patients with IBS was not different from that of controls. There were no group differences in the autonomic response to the stressor. There was no overall cortisol response to the stressor in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBS respond with greater negative affect to postprandial psychological stress as well as to food intake alone, and they can be distinguished from controls on the basis of self-report data. Patients with IBS cannot be differentiated from controls on the basis of the pattern of changes in sympathetic activation after the mental stressor. The stressor used in this study did not elicit a cortisol response in either group.},

The aim of this study was to assess autonomic, endocrine, and symptomatic responses to food intake in diarrhea-predominant and constipation-predominant IBS patients, compared to normals. METHODS: Twelve women with diarrhea-predominant or alternating IBS (IBS-D), 12 women with constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C), and 20 healthy women participated. GI symptoms, saliva cortisol concentration, heart rate, and heart rate variability were assessed at baseline and after a meal. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability was used as a measure of the sympathovagal regulation of the heart rate. RESULTS: Both groups of IBS patients showed a significant postprandial increase in GI symptoms. IBS-D showed a significant increase in the low frequency/high frequency band ratio and a decrease in the high frequency band power during the first postmeal period, which was significantly different, not only from controls, but also from IBS-C. IBS-D also showed a significant postprandial increase in cortisol, which was not evident in controls or IBS-C. There was a significant correlation between the vagal response and the postprandial increase in GI symptoms in IBS-D (r = 0.6, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the notion that the IBS symptom groups are characterized by different physiological responses to visceral stimuli, and point to a role of autonomic pathways in IBS symptomatology.},

The negative impact of this disease includes not only pain, suffering and direct medical expenses but also significant social and job-related consequences. IBS can be the result of dysfunction in any part of the brain-gut axis: alterations in the CNS caused by psychological or other factors, abnormal gastrointestinal motility, or heightened visceral sensations. Diagnosis is based on either the Manning or Rome-II criteria. Education, reassurance and emotional support are the cornerstones of successful treatment. The mainstays of the current therapeutic approach continue to be: stress management strategies, dietary modification entailing addition of dietary fibre and pharmacotherapy. Pharmacotherapy is still limited to treating symptoms. Newer drugs that modulate motility or drugs that modulate visceral sensation may be useful in selected cases. Psychopharmacological agents are useful in the treatment of IBS, especially in those with psychological co-morbidity. Alternative therapies such as homeopathy, acupuncture, special diets, herbal medication and several forms of psychological treatments and hypnotherapy are sought by many patients and are now being offered by physicians as treatment options, either alone or in conjunction with conventional forms of therapy in patients with refractory symptoms.},

   abstract = {Probiotic ingestion can be recommended as a preventative approach to maintaining the balance of the intestinal microflora and thereby enhance 'well-being'. Research into the use of probiotic intervention in specific illnesses and disorders has identified certain patient populations that may benefit from the approach. Undoubtedly, probiotics will vary in their efficacy and it may not be the case that the same results occur with all species. Those that prove most efficient will likely be strains that are robust enough to survive the harsh physico-chemical conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract. This includes gastric acid, bile secretions and competition with the resident microflora. A survey of the literature indicates positive results in over fifty human trials, with prevention/treatment of infections the most frequently reported output. In theory, increased levels of probiotics may induce a 'barrier' influence against common pathogens. Mechanisms of effect are likely to include the excretion of acids (lactate, acetate), competition for nutrients and gut receptor sites, immunomodulation and the formation of specific antimicrobial agents. As such, persons susceptible to diarrhoeal infections may benefit greatly from probiotic intake. On a more chronic basis, it has been suggested that some probiotics can help maintain remission in the inflammatory conditions, ulcerative colitis and pouchitis. They have also been suggested to repress enzymes responsible for genotoxin formation. Moreover, studies have suggested that probiotics are as effective as anti-spasmodic drugs in the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome. The approach of modulating the gut flora for improved health has much relevance for the management of those with acute and chronic gut disorders. Other target groups could include those susceptible to nosocomial infections, as well as the elderly, who have an altered microflora, with a decreased number of beneficial microbial species. For the future, it is imperative that mechanistic interactions involved in probiotic supplementation be identified. Moreover, the survival issues associated with their establishment in the competitive gut ecosystem should be addressed. Here, the use of prebiotics in association with useful probiotics may be a worthwhile approach. A prebiotic is a dietary carbohydrate selectively metabolised by probiotics. Combinations of probiotics and prebiotics are known as synbiotics.},

Prebiotics are non-digestible foodstuffs (fiber, oligofructans - "colonic foods"), which enter the colon and are metabolized by the probiotics. Probiotics should fulfill the following criteria: Phenotypic and genotypic classification, no pathogenic properties, human origin, application in the living state, resistance to gastric acid and bile, ability to adhere to colonocytes, ability to colonize the gut, clinically proved favorable health-effect, and safety. Experimental and clinical studies supplied evidence of the possible use of probiotics in the following diseases: Traveler's diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, relapsing Clostridium difficile colitis, infantile diarrhea, rotavirus enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colon cancer, peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, and diarrhea associated with HIV infection. Probiotics displayed the following effects in these studies: Involvement in production of essential nutrients of the colonic mucosa, beneficial effect on intestinal immunity, recovery of the disturbed gut mucosal barrier and prevention of microbial translocation, elimination of toxins and eradication of microbial pathogens, production of steroids from cholesterol and reduction of its pool in circulation, participation in regulation of intestinal functions, reduced incidence of chemically induced colon tumors in rodents. Probiotics open new therapeutic modalities in a number of diseases and it may be expected that their importance will increase with growing knowledge and experience.},

We describe a case of ischemic colitis in a male patient with IBS who was briefly treated with alosetron. Clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic features of the focal colitis strongly suggested ischemia. Symptoms correlated temporally with alosetron use, and symptoms abated with discontinuation of the drug. Endoscopic and pathologic resolution of the colitis were documented.},

The objective of this clinical experience was to evaluate the progress of symptoms and the modifications in the frequency of evacuation in subjects affected by IBS and regularly taking PHGG. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The group was made up of 134 out-patients of both sexes, average age 43.12, suffering from IBS, both obese and of normal weigh, with a mean number of weekly evacuations between 2 and 35. The subjects, divided in 2 groups on the basis of Body Mass Index (BMI), were submitted for 24 weeks to a balanced, low or normal calorie diet supplemented by 5 g a day of PHGG. The following information was gathered: number of weekly evacuation, typical symptoms of IBS, cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels. In a few subjects (n. = 34) also the plasmatic electrolyte levels, before and during PHGG intake, were evaluated. RESULTS: Both groups showed positive results in the evacuation frequency (p < 0.01 at 12th week) and a decrease, after 3 weeks of PHGG intake, in frequency of IBS symptoms such as flatulence (-55.6%), abdominal tension (-4.7%) and abdominal spasm (-35%). On the other hand an increased number of subjects showed normal levels of cholesterol (+12.2%), lipids (+26.9%) and glucose (+16%). Concentrations of plasmatic electrolytes didn't change during PHGG intake, except for a marked increase of selenium levels, compared to pre-intake levels. CONCLUSIONS: The observations obtained from this clinical experience reassert that dietary fiber supplementation is useful in cases of altered intestinal motility. PHGG, due to its water-solubility and non-gelling properties, can be useful also in IBS.},

Since 1987, when the first publication on the properties of the Lactobacillus GG was done, overall, there have been over 200 publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals. This paper will report the status and the prospectus of probiotics research at the beginning of the Third Millennium. Probiotics have proven benefits in treatment and prevention of rotavirus diarrhoea in children and reduction of antibiotic-associated intestinal side-effects. Interesting results have recently been published regarding food allergies and atopic eczema in children. Prevention of vaginitis and of travellers' diarrhoea have also been reported. Promising results are being reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, dental caries and irritable bowel syndrome. It has also been suggested that probiotics could enhance oral vaccine administration, and that they may help treatment against Helicobacter pylori infection, but further studies are needed. Future areas of research regard probiotics' role in the process of carcinogenesis, given their influence on the gut microflora, and as immune modulators in autoimmune disorders. The possibility of introducing appropriate genes to the probiotics to make them produce various compounds is also under investigation. However, there is still confusion in the minds of the authorities over whether a probiotic is a drug, a food, or a dietary supplement. The challenge is to continue research to define the appropriate uses of probiotics and discover new applications which will bring benefit to humankind.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Bloating is an important but poorly understood symptom in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that is often aggravated by bran. The aim of our study was to determine whether IBS patients with bloating responded to bran differently from healthy controls. METHODS: A total of 12 patients with IBS (according to Rome I criteria), all with moderate to severe bloating, and 12 healthy controls participated in a two way, double blind, randomized, cross-over trial of bran versus placebo (crushed biscuits) 15 g b.i.d. An average daily pain index and bloating score were derived from daily symptom diaries. On day 14, gastric emptying, small bowel transit, percent remaining in ascending colon, and geometric center of a meal marker at 24 h were calculated from scintigraphic images obtained after ingesting a Tc99m-labeled rice pudding meal with 15 g of either placebo or coarse bran. RESULTS: Results are given as median (range). Bran significantly increased the pain index and bloating (p < 0.02) in IBS patients but not controls. The most striking finding was that the small bowel transit time of the meal without bran was markedly faster in IBS patients than in controls, being 203 min (range 109-313) versus 367 min (219-543), p < 0.001. Although in controls bran accelerated small bowel transit time to 262 min (180-380), p = 0.03, and significantly reduced % remaining in the ascending colon from 22% (0-46) to 3% (0-25), p = 0.03, this was not seen in the IBS patients. Bran accelerated whole gut transit as assessed by geometric center at 24 h in both IBS patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Bran accelerates small bowel transit and ascending colon clearance without causing symptoms in controls. Small bowel transit is rapid in IBS patients with bloating and, unlike in healthy control subjects, cannot be further accelerated by bran, which nevertheless aggravates symptoms of pain and bloating. We speculate that bran-induced bloating may originate in the colon rather than the small bowel.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Women are more likely than men to report irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms as well as chronic visceral and musculoskeletal pain. The study tests the general hypothesis that female IBS patients differ from their male counterparts in symptoms related to the viscera and musculoskeletal system, and that these differences are related to the menstrual cycle. METHODS: Seven hundred fourteen Rome positive IBS patients were evaluated for GI and extracolonic symptoms, psychological symptoms (SCL-90R), and quality of life (QOL) (SF-36). In addition, 54 postmenopausal women were compared with 61 premenopausal women and 54 age-matched males, all with IBS. RESULTS: Male and female subjects reported similar GI levels of symptom severity and psychological problems. Abdominal distension associated with a sensation of bloating was more commonly reported by female patients, as were symptoms of constipation. Female patients more often reported nausea, alterations of taste and smell, and unpleasant sensations on the tongue, muscle stiffness in the morning, greater food sensitivity, and side effects from medications. Forty percent of female patients reported menstrual cycle-related worsening of symptoms, but few symptom differences were found between pre- and postmenopausal women, making it unlikely that most of the gender differences observed are directly tied to the menstrual cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Female patients report higher levels of a variety of intestinal and nonintestinal sensory symptoms despite similar levels of IBS severity, abdominal pain, psychological symptoms, and illness impact. The apparent differences in sensitivity to nonpainful visceral sensations, medications, and food may represent altered sensory processes, autonomic responses, and/or cognitive hypervigilance.},

It is characterised by abdominal pain, excessive flatus, variable bowel habit and abdominal bloating for which there is no evidence of detectable organic disease. Suggested aetiologies include gut motility and psychological disorders, psychophysiological phenomena and colonic malfermentation. The faecal microflora in IBS has been shown to be abnormal with higher numbers of facultative organisms and low numbers of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Although there is no evidence of food allergy in IBS, food intolerance has been identified and exclusion diets are beneficial to many IBS patients. Food intolerance may be due to abnormal fermentation of food residues in the colon, as a result of disruption of the normal flora. The role of probiotics in IBS has not been clearly defined. Some studies have shown improvements in pain and flatulence in response to probiotic administration, whilst others have shown no symptomatic improvement. It is possible that the future role of probiotics in IBS will lie in prevention, rather than cure.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic, relapsing functional bowel disorder of unknown aetiology. Methods of studying intestinal motor function, nociception, and interactions of the central nervous system and enteric nervous system are not applicable for clinical use. The diagnosis is therefore made on the symptoms, but it is necessary to exclude relevant organic disease. Establishment of the diagnosis, information about the disorder, elimination of foods and other factors that provoke the symptoms, and a change in life-style are sufficient in most cases. Treatment is hampered by the lack of effective treatment and the psychological aspects. The therapeutic gain of drug administration is modest and the rate of response to placebo is high. Fibre supplementation, magnesium oxide or cisapride may be tried for constipation, diphenoxylate or loperamide for diarrhoea, and low dose tricyclic antidepressants or serotonin reuptake blockers for severe pain. The introduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists seems promising.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the pattern of symptoms and health care seeking behavior of IBS subjects in the rural population in Bangladesh. METHODS: This was an observational study to do a positive diagnosis of IBS. A total of 2426 persons > or =15 yr old were interviewed by a predesigned questionnaire based on the Rome criteria. Two villages of a northern district in Bangladesh were included. RESULTS: A response of 95.4% yielded 2426 questionnaires for analysis. Mean age of the surveyed sample was 32.3+/-14.2 yr. In total, 1113 (45.9%) were men, and 1313 (54.1%) were women. Farmers and housewives comprised 2058 (84.8%) persons. The apparent prevalence of IBS was 24.4% with a prevalence of 20.6% in men and 27.7% in women. With strict Rome criteria, the overall prevalence was 8.5% (10.7% in women and 5.8% in men). Age was not found to influence the prevalence in either sex. Other than abdominal pain, the most common IBS symptom was altered stool passage (81.1%). Others in order of frequency were passage of mucus with stool (56.8%), abdominal distension (46.2%), altered stool form (46%), and altered stool frequency (18.2%). Spastic colon pain was noted in 339 (57.2%). IBS subjects with more prevalence of colonic symptoms in the nonspastic group. Drinking milk was found to have a little impact on IBS. A total of 35% IBS subjects consulted doctors for symptoms. Age, sex, and number of symptoms did not influence health care seeking behavior. CONCLUSIONS: IBS is also a problem in rural people in Bangladesh with a prevalence almost identical to most other countries, and only a minority of them seeks health care. Positive diagnosis of IBS can be done by precisely enquiring colonic symptoms in apparently healthy people.},

   abstract = {The ingestion of probiotics is associated with various beneficial effects on human health and modifies the physiological homeostasis of the intestinal flora. Probiotics are microorganisms with some particular characteristics: human origin, safety in human use, bile and acid resistance, survival in the intestine, at least temporary colonization of the human gut, adhesion to the mucosa and bacteriocine production. Thanks to these characteristics, probiotics block the invasion of human intestinal cells by the enteroinvasive bacteria. Furthermore, they should be able to stimulate and modulate the intestinal immune response, and to protect and stabilize the mucosal barrier. Finally, the efficacy of probiotics should be evident and documented with valid studies. All their properties should be maintained during processing and storage. Probiotics are usually used to protect the host from pathogens. With regard to this, they are useful in the prevention of antibiotic and traveler's diarrhea and they may play a role in the management of gastric Helicobacter pylori infection. Furthermore, their efficacy in the treatment of infectious diarrhea, in inflammatory bowel diseases, in pouchitis and in food allergy has been shown. Probiotics can improve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and of lactose malabsorption. Finally, it has been suggested that such microorganisms may play a role in the prevention of carcinogenesis and of tumor growth.},

In a two-site study, 28 subjects 9 months to 18 years old (mean 6.9 +/- 5.9 years) with significant intake of apple juice or pear nectar (> 6 oz a day) with the diagnoses of irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal pain, or chronic nonspecific diarrhea were recruited. Breath hydrogen tolerance tests utilizing lactose, sucrose, and apple juice in the amount they typically consumed were positive in 32%, 0%, and 50%, respectively. Subjects were asked to refrain from the ingestion ofjuice for 1 month: 13 of the 28 (46%) subjects improved while 15 (54%) showed no change in their symptoms. In fact, none consuming 6 to 12 oz of apple or pear juice daily improved, 27% of those consuming 12 to 16 oz improved, and 91% of those consuming > 16 oz improved (P < 0.02). Subjects were then given comparable amounts of white grape juice for 1 year. The initial symptoms did not recur in any of the subjects who initially responded to the juice-free diet. Of the 15 subjects who did not respond to the juice-free diet, seven became asymptomatic. Overall, 20 subjects (71%) were asymptomatic, and eight (29%) had no change in their symptoms. Some individuals with irritable bowel syndrome have their symptoms based on their malabsorption of carbohydrates present in apple juice and pear nectar and may improve with adequate choices of fruit juice such as changing to white grape juice.},

Recent reports suggest that probiotics may have a role in regulating the motility of the digestive tract. AIM: To assess the efficacy of Lactobacillus plantarum 299V (LP299V) in patients with IBS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients were randomized to receive either LP299V in liquid suspension (20 patients) or placebo (20 patients) over a period of 4 weeks. Clinical examination was performed at baseline and at the end of the study. Additionally, patients assessed their symptoms by applying a scoring system. RESULTS: All patients treated with LP299V reported resolution of their abdominal pain as compared to 11 patients from a placebo group (P = 0.0012). There was also a trend towards normalization of stools frequency in constipated patients in six out of 10 patients treated with LP299V compared with two out of 11 treated with placebo (P = 0.17). With regards to all IBS symptoms an improvement was noted in 95% of patients in the LP299V group vs 15% of patients in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: LP299V seems to have a beneficial effect in patients with IBS. Further studies on larger cohorts of patients and with longer duration of therapy are required in order to establish the place of L. plantarum in the treatment of IBS.},

   abstract = {Functional (nonulcer) dyspepsia refers to upper abdominal pain or discomfort with or without symptoms of early satiety, nausea, or vomiting with no definable organic cause. The current Rome II criteria help to diagnose functional dyspepsia and avoid misdiagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome as functional dyspepsia. Assessment of gastric emptying with scintigraphy or breath testing may be useful in identifying delayed gastric emptying in patients with dyspeptic symptoms and may be helpful in patient management. Electrogastrography is a noninvasive test that evaluates for gastric dysrhythmias. Satiety testing is being evaluated as an indirect test for impaired fundic relaxation and visceral hypersensitivity. The symptom response to Helicobacter pylori therapy in patients with functional dyspepsia and a negative endoscopy examination but a positive H. pylori test is marginal. Lifestyle modifications often are suggested for initial treatment of functional dyspepsia. Dietary changes such as frequent small meals, low-fat diet, and avoidance of certain aggravating foods may improve symptoms. Additional measures include cessation of smoking, avoiding excess alcohol intake, and minimizing coffee intake. Antacids and over-the-counter histamine type 2 receptor antagonists may be helpful as an "on-demand" therapy for intermittent symptoms. They are safe and relatively inexpensive. Different subgroups of functional dyspepsia are based on the predominant symptom and may help in choosing an appropriate drug to initiate therapy. If the predominant symptom is epigastric pain (ulcer-like functional dyspepsia), histamine-2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors are the initial treatment of choice. If fullness, bloating, early satiety or nausea is the predominant complaint (dysmotility-like functional dyspepsia), a prokinetic agent may help. Metoclopramide is the only available effective prokinetic agent at present. If metoclopramide is used, short-term treatment and discussion of possible side effects with the patient are advised. If there is no response to these initial treatments, switching therapy from proton pump inhibitor to prokinetic or vice versa can be tried. If these treatment options fail, patient re-evaluation for other disorders (including other functional bowel disorders) is advised. A low-dose tricyclic antidepressant at bedtime may be helpful for treatment of visceral hypersensitivity.},

Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) has shown beneficial effects in animal and human studies, but its potential role in IBS symptom relief has not been evaluated yet. We investigated PHGG in IBS patients and compared it to a wheat bran diet. Abdominal pain, bowel habits, and subjective overall rating were longitudinally evaluated in 188 adult IBS patients (139 women and 49 men) for 12 weeks. Patients were classified as having diarrhea-predominant, constipation-predominant, or changeable bowel habits and were randomly assigned to groups receiving fiber (30 g/day of wheat bran) or PHGG (5 g/day). After four weeks, patients were allowed to switch group, depending on their subjective evaluation of their symptoms. Significantly more patients switched from fiber to PHGG (49.9%) than from PHGG to fiber (10.9%) at four weeks. Per protocol analysis showed that both fiber and PHGG were effective in improving pain and bowel habits, but no difference was found between the two groups. Conversely, intention-to-treat analysis showed a significantly greater success in the PHGG group (60%) than in the fiber group (40%). Moreover, significantly more patients in the PHGG group reported a greater subjective improvement than those in the Fiber group. In conclusion, improvements in core IBS symptoms (abdominal pain and bowel habits) were observed with both bran and PHGG, but the latter was better tolerated and preferred by patients, revealing a higher probability of success than bran and a lower probability of patients abandoning the prescribed regimen, suggesting that it can increase the benefits deriving from fiber intake in IBS, making it a valid option to consider for high-fiber diet supplementation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine if confirmation of hypolactasia offers any benefit to the dietary treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two consecutive IBS patients (37 male, 85 female) were given lactose hydrogen breath tests (LHBT). Those with positive LHBT followed a low lactose diet for 3 weeks. Those improving on the diet were given double-blind, placebo-controlled challenges (DBPCC) with 5 g, 10 g and 15 g of lactose and a placebo, to confirm lactose intolerance. Those who did not respond to the low lactose diet followed either an exclusion or low fibre diet. Symptoms scores were kept prior to the LHBT, 8 h post-LHBT and daily whilst following any dietary change. Patients with negative LHBT returned to clinic and subsequent dietary interventions were recorded. RESULTS: LHBT was positive in 33/122 (27%) IBS patients. Syrr otom scores prior to LHBT were not significantly different between the two groups, but after LHBT the symptoms in the positive group were significantly worse. Twenty-three patients followed a low-lactose diet of which only nine (39%) improved. Six who did not improve followed an exclusion diet, three improved and all were intolerant of milk. Three tried a low fibre diet with two improving. DBPCC were inconclusive. In the negative LHBT group 35 agreed to try a diet and 24 improved (69%). Eight were intolerant of cow's milk. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a low lactose diet was disappointing in IBS patients with lactose malabsorption. Food intolerance was demonstrated in IBS patients with positive or negative LHBT and milk was identified as a problem in both groups. DBPCC were inconclusive. There appears to be little advantage in trying to separate patients who malabsorb lactose from others with IBS.},

In the western world, 8% to 23% of adults have IBS and its socioeconomic cost is substantial. Research-generated insights have led to the understanding of IBS as a disorder of brain-gut regulation. The experience of symptoms derives from dysregulation of the bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain, mediated by neuroendocrine and immunological factors and modulated by psychosocial factors. The biopsychosocial model integrates the various physical and psychosocial factors that contribute to the patient's illness. This model and the recently revised symptom-based criteria (i.e. the "Rome II criteria") form the basis for establishing a comprehensive and effective approach for the diagnosis and management of the disorder.},

   abstract = {Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are often described as challenging. The diagnosis of IBS can safely be made using the Rome II criteria in conjunction with a thorough physical examination and a limited number of diagnostic studies. Although the diagnosis is generally made with a high degree of accuracy, the pathophysiology of IBS remains elusive, and treatment can be frustrating for both patient and physician alike. Important areas of research focus on the psychology of IBS, visceral hypersensitivity, motility abnormalities (e.g., heightened gastrocolonic response), and the "brain-gut axis." A multidisciplinary effort is often required to ameliorate symptoms and improve the patients' quality of life. This review article will discuss the myriad of treatments available for patients with IBS, and provide both a clinical and practical discussion of their use, providing evidence where available and clinical experience where it is not.},

   abstract = {Three decades ago, the observations of Trowell and Burkitt gave rise to the "fibre theory", in which it was contended that there was a link between the consumption of a diet rich in fibre and non-processed carbohydrates and the level of protection against many of the "first world diseases" such as constipation, diverticulosis, cancer of the colon, diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. Since that time, numerous studies have been presented to analyze the relationship between fibre and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and other processes with severe health implications. The present revision looks at the experience accumulated over this period regarding the importance of the consumption of fibre for certain phatologies. It not only deals with the epidemiological relationship existing between fibre intake and the development of diseases such as cancer of the colon or cardiovascular disorders but also reviews the interest of fibre a therapeutic agent, in view of the current information available on its different mechanism of action. Thus the possibility of using soluble fibre has taken on renewed interest for the treatment of inflammatory intestinal disease, for control of diarrhoea, in irritable bowel syndrome or no modulate the concentrations of glycaemia or cholesterol. Three is a discussion of the discrepancies found between the consumption of fibre and diverticular disease, the treatment of constipation and the association with obesity and cardiovascular disease. Despite the accumulated evidence on the consumption of fibre, there is currently no consensus as to recommendations on what type of fibre and the optimal amount that should be consumed. A high fibre intake (> 25-30 g/day) based on a variety of food sources (fruit, vegetable, legumes, cereals) is the only way to avoid many of the disorders mentioned. The consumption of a particular type of fibre (soluble or insoluble) is limited to the treatment of certain processes, because its individual relationship with many disorders is still pending determination.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastrointestinal (GI) and liver diseases inflict a heavy economic burden. Although the burden is considerable, current and accessible information on the prevalence, morbidity, and cost is sparse. This study was undertaken to estimate the economic burden of GI and liver disease in the United States for use by policy makers, health care providers, and the public. METHODS: Data were extracted from a number of publicly available and proprietary national databases to determine the prevalence, direct costs, and indirect costs for 17 selected GI and liver diseases. Indirect cost calculations were purposefully very conservative. These costs were compared with National Institutes of Health (NIH) research expenditures for selected GI and liver diseases. RESULTS: The most prevalent diseases were non-food-borne gastroenteritis (135 million cases/year), food-borne illness (76 million), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; 19 million), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; 15 million). The disease with the highest annual direct costs in the United States was GERD ($9.3 billion), followed by gallbladder disease ($5.8 billion), colorectal cancer ($4.8 billion), and peptic ulcer disease ($3.1 billion). The estimated direct costs for these 17 diseases in 1998 dollars were $36.0 billion, with estimated indirect costs of $22.8 billion. The estimated direct costs for all digestive diseases were $85.5 billion. Total NIH research expenditures were $676 million in 2000. CONCLUSIONS: GI and liver diseases exact heavy economic and social costs in the United States. Understanding the prevalence and costs of these diseases is important to help set priorities to reduce the burden of illness.},

   abstract = {Low-digestible carbohydrates represent a class of enzyme-resistant saccharides that have specific effects on the human gastrointestinal tract. in the small bowel, they affect nutrient digestion and absorption, glucose and lipid metabolism and protect against known risk factors of cardiovascular disease. In the colon they are mainly degraded by anaerobic bacteria in a process called fermentation. As a consequence, faecal nitrogen excretion is enhanced, which is used clinically to prevent or treat hepatic encephalopathy. Low-digestible carbohydrates are trophic to the epithelia of the ileum and colon, which helps to avoid bacterial translocation. Short-chain fatty acids are important fermentation products and are evaluated as new therapeutics in acute colitis. They are considered in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer. The bifidogenic effect of fructo-oligosaccharides merits further attention, Unfermented carbohydrates increase faecal bulk and play a role in the treatment of chronic functional constipation, symptomatic diverticulosis and, possibly, the irritable bowel syndrome. In conclusion, low-digestible carbohydrates may play a role in the maintenance of human digestive health. However, the strength of evidence differs between disease entities.},

The recent demonstration of abnormal colonic fermentation in some patients with this condition provides an opportunity for the objective assessment of the therapeutic value of these bacteria. This study was designed to investigate the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum 299V on colonic fermentation. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, four-week trial of Lactobacillus plantarum 299V in 12 previously untreated patients with IBS. Symptoms were assessed daily by a validated composite score and fermentation by 24-hr indirect calorimetry in a 1.4-m3 canopy followed by breath hydrogen determination for 3 hr after 20 ml of lactulose. On placebo, the median symptom score was 8.5 [6.25-11.25 interquartile range (IQR)], the median maximum rate of gas production was 0.55 ml/min (0.4-1.1 IQR), and the median hydrogen production was 189.7 ml/24 hr (118.3-291.1 IQR). On Lactobacillus plantarum 299V the median symptom score was 8 (6.75-13.5 IQR), the median maximum rate of gas production 0.92 ml/min (0.45-1.5 IQR), and the median hydrogen production 208.2 ml/24 hr (146-350.9 IQR). There was no significant difference. Breath hydrogen excretion after lactulose was reduced by the probiotic (median at 120 min, 6 ppm; placebo, 17 ppm; P = 0.019). In conclusion, Lactobacillus plantarum 299V in this study did not appear to alter colonic fermentation or improve symptoms in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The involvement of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions in the genesis of gastrointestinal symptoms after ingestion of foods containing wheat has been rarely reported. OBJECTIVE: To detect IgE specifically binding to wheat proteins in the sera of atopic and non-atopic patients suffering from gastrointestinal symptoms after ingestion of wheat and to evaluate the reliability of skin prick test and CAP in the diagnosis of food allergy to wheat. METHODS: The sera of patients (10 atopic and 10 non-atopic) previously diagnosed as suffering from irritable bowel syndrome and complaining of symptoms after wheat ingestion were analysed by immunoblotting for IgE binding to water/salt-soluble and insoluble wheat flour proteins. RESULTS: All the atopic patients and only one of the non-atopic patients were positive to wheat CAP. For the patients tested, skin prick test was positive for all the atopic patients and for only one of the non-atopic patients. However, immunoblotting experiments showed the presence of specific IgE to wheat proteins in all the patients. Ten out of 11 of the wheat CAP-positive patients had IgE binding to a soluble 16-kDa band, but the same band was recognized, in a slighter way, by only two out of nine of the wheat CAP-negative patients. Moreover, although almost all of the patients were negative in CAP testing with gluten, 19 out of 20 recognized protein bands belonging to the prolamin fraction. CONCLUSIONS: For the atopic patients the positivity to skin prick test and CAP to wheat was in accordance with the immunoblotting results and a food allergy to wheat could be diagnosed. In these patients a major allergen was a 16-kDa band corresponding to members of the cereal alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitors protein family, the major allergens involved in baker's asthma. In the non-atopic patients the positive immunoblotting results contrasted with the responses of the allergologic tests, indicating that the allergenic wheat protein preparations currently used are of limited value in detecting specific IgE to wheat and that the fraction of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients with food allergy may be larger than believed.},

The effects of nutrients on colonic perception in IBS are incompletely understood. SUBJECTS: We studied 13 healthy subjects and 16 patients with IBS-eight had diarrhoea predominant (IBS-D) and eight constipation predominant (IBS-C) IBS. METHODS: Colonic perception thresholds to balloon distension and viscerosomatic referral pattern were assessed before and after duodenal infusion of lipid or saline, respectively. At the end of the infusions, plasma levels of gastrointestinal peptides were determined. RESULTS: Lipids lowered the thresholds for first sensation, gas, discomfort, and pain in the IBS group but only for gas in the control group. The percent reduction in thresholds for gas and pain after lipids was greater in the IBS and IBS-D groups but not in the IBS-C group compared with controls. IBS patients had an increased area of referred discomfort and pain after lipids compared with before infusion whereas the referral area remained unchanged in controls. No group differences in colonic tone or compliance were observed. In both groups higher levels of cholecystokinin, pancreatic polypeptide, peptide YY, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and neuropeptide Y were seen after lipids. Motilin levels were higher in patients and differences in the subgroups were observed. Levels of corticotrophin releasing factor were lower in the constipated group than in the diarrhoea group. CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial symptoms in IBS patients may be explained in part by a nutrient dependent exaggerated sensory component of the gastrocolonic response.},

However, existing studies have come to different conclusions about the role of food in the pathophysiology of IBS. We explored the prevalence of subjective food-related gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and its relationship to clinical characteristics and psychological factors in IBS. METHODS: 330 patients with IBS and 80 healthy volunteers completed a food questionnaire developed for this study. The subjects graded their subjective symptoms after 35 different foods and a food score was obtained by adding the item scores. The relationship between subjective food-related GI symptoms and referral status, IBS subgroup (predominant bowel pattern), sex, anxiety, depression and body mass index (BMI) was estimated. RESULTS: In 209 (63%) of the patients the GI symptoms were related to meals. Gas problems and abdominal pain were the most frequently reported symptoms. Foods rich in carbohydrates, as well as fatty food, coffee, alcohol and hot spices were most frequently reported to cause symptoms. The food score was higher in patients than in controls (p < 0.0001). In the IBS group higher scores were observed in patients with anxiety (p = 0.005), and females (p < 0.001), but the results were unrelated to IBS subgroup, referral status or BMI. The BMI did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: A majority of IBS patients consider their symptoms to be related to meals. Especially foods rich in carbohydrates and fat cause problems. Nevertheless, the majority of IBS patients are normal or overweight. Female sex and anxiety predict a high degree of food-related symptoms in IBS.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome affects 10% of adults with an unexplained female predominance. Although only a few people see their family doctor, the disease causes reduced quality of life and represents a multi-billion pound health-care problem. The disorder clusters in families, which is possibly because of intra-familial learning and a genetic predisposition. Visceral hypersensitivity is a key feature in most patients. Results of imaging studies of regional cerebral blood flow during rectal distension suggest underlying disturbances of central processing of afferent signals, though this is not unique to the disorder, since it is seen in other chronic pain syndromes. Environmental factors that are strongly implicated in at least some patients include gastrointestinal infection and inflammation and chronic stress. Diagnosis is based on positive symptoms and absence of any alarm indicators. Treatment remains unsatisfactory and hinges on an excellent doctor-patient relationship, with drugs for symptom exacerbations. Cognitive behavioural treatment, psychotherapy, and hypnosis could provide long-lasting benefit in some patients. Tricyclic antidepressants in low doses seem to be the most effective class of drugs for the disorder on the basis of limited data.},

IC occurs primarily in women but also in men with recent findings indicating that chronic, abacterial prostatitis may be a variant of this condition. The prevalence of IC has ranged from about 8 - 60 cases/100,000 female patients depending on the population evaluated. About 10% of patients have severe symptoms that are associated with Hunner's ulcers on bladder biopsy; the rest could be grouped in those with or without bladder inflammation. Symptoms of IC are exacerbated by stress, certain foods and ovulatory hormones. Many patients also experience allergies, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and migraines. There have been various reports indicating dysfunction of the bladder glycosaminoglycan (GAG) protective layer and many publications showing a high number of activated bladder mast cells. Increasing evidence suggests that neurogenic inflammation and/or neuropathic pain is a major component of IC pathophysiology. Approved treatments so far include intravesical administration of dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) or oral pentosanpolysulphate (PPS). New treatments focus on the combined use of drugs that modulate bladder sensory nerve stimulation (neurolytic agents), inhibit neurogenic activation of mast cells, or provide urothelial cytoprotection, together with new drugs with anti-inflammatory activity.},

However, the pathogenesis of this disease is unknown, and opinions about how probiotics might work are speculative. Nevertheless, two small trials suggest they might benefit patients with IBS, particularly those suffering from pain and bloating. This possibility deserves further study. It is important though, that future trials employ criteria-identified subjects, be sufficiently powered and strictly double blind, and select a suitable outcome measure. Until state-of-the-art trials of probiotics are available, their use should remain in the experimental arena.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if 1) Afro-Caribbean women prefer large body sizes, 2) the body size preference of Afro-Caribbean men and women are associated, 3) women's preferences are associated with increased risk of obesity or with weight management behaviors. DESIGN: Population samples of 314 and 487 women, ages 20-55 years, were recruited on Barbados and Dominica with response rates of 74% and 77%, respectively. Body size preferences, stress related variables, and demographic data were ascertained by questionnaire. Height and weight were also measured. On Barbados, body preference data were collected from male partners of participants, and data on intentions to perform weight management behaviors were collected from 175 women. RESULTS: Most women preferred body sizes within normal limits, although women on Dominica had a slightly larger ideal body size (IBS) than did Barbadian women (P<.05). On both islands, the size that women thought men preferred was related to their IBS (P<.0001). Likewise, IBS was associated with increased odds of being overweight (P<.001), however most overweight women (>75%) wanted to be smaller. IBS was not related to the intention to exercise or to eat high fat foods. CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that body size preference poses a barrier to intervention efforts to reduce the prevalence of overweight in Afro-Caribbean women.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the possibility that sensitization is a psychobiological mechanism underlying not only multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), but a much more general cluster of illness, referred to as "subjective health complaints". Sustained arousal, or sustained "stress" responses, may be an important factor for the development of these conditions. Patients with subjective complaints without objective changes are sometimes referred to as having "fashionable diagnoses" or "unexplained symptoms". They may be given diagnoses like MCS, epidemic fatigue, chronic fatigue syndrome, burnout, stress, a variety of intoxications, environmental illness, radiation, multiple chemical hypersensitivity, food intolerance, functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel, myalgic encephalitis, postviral syndrome, yuppie flu, fibromyalgia, or vital exhaustion. One issue is whether this is one general condition or separate entities. Another issue is whether sensitization may be the psychobiological mechanism for most or all of these conditions. Finally, is it likely that sustained arousal may facilitate the development of sensitization in some or many neural circuits? In this review, the main emphasis will be on musculoskeletal pain. This is the most frequent and most expensive condition for sickness compensation and disability. The comorbidity of other complaints, however, will also be taken into account.},

   abstract = {The philosophy that food can be health promoting beyond its nutritional value is gaining acceptance. Known disease preventive aspects of nutrition have led to a new science, the 'functional food science'. Functional foods, first introduced in Japan, have no universally accepted definition but can be described as foods or food ingredients that may provide health benefits and prevent diseases. Currently, there is a growing interest in these products. However, not all regulatory issues have been settled yet. Five categories of foods can be classified as functional foods: dietary fibers, vitamins and minerals, bioactive substances, fatty acids and pro-, pre- and symbiotics. The latter are currently the main focus of research. Functional foods can be applied in pediatrics: during pregnancy, nutrition is 'functional' since it has prenatal influences on the intra-uterine development of the baby, after birth, 'functional' human milk supports adequate growth of infants and pro- and prebiotics can modulate the flora composition and as such confer certain health advantages. Functional foods have also been studied in pediatric diseases. The severity of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal allergy and lactose intolerance may be reduced by using functional foods. Functional foods have proven to be valuable contributors to the improvement of health and the prevention of diseases in pediatric populations.},

It is twice as potent as the racemic compound. because the anti-CCK activity is specific to the (R)-form, whereas the (S)-isomer is almost ineffective. It has been developed by Rotta Research Lab SpA for the treatment of diseases in which CCK1 receptor activity is potentially involved, including gastrointestinal motility, food intake and pancreatic disorders [218696]. Its receptor-mediated actions have been described in multiple in vitro and in vivo pharmacological systems. Results from both preclinical and clinical studies indicate that it is an effective inhibitor of gallbladder contraction, improves lower esophegal sphincter (LES) function, accelerates gastric emptying, accelerates colonic transit and significantly decreases symptoms in IBS and functional dyspepsia patients, and therefore has potential as an effective treatment for constipation-predominant IBS. functional dyspesia, constipation, LES function, gastric emptying disorders and biliary colics. Forest Laboratories has entered into an agreement with Rotta for the development and marketing of dexloxiglumide for the treatment of constipation-predominant IBS and phase III studies are currently ongoing in the US. In August 2000, Merrill Lynch expected that dexloxiglumide would not be launched until 2004 [379892], and in June 2001, predicted a US filing date in 2003 [413928].},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a remarkably frequent disorder that leads to relevant impairment in patients' quality of life. Four mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of IBS: altered intestinal motility; increased visceral sensitivity; disturbed intestinal reflexes (intrinsic and extrinsic), and psychological disorders. The close relationship between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system (the brain-gut axis) is the basis of the actual research on IBS therapy. It is conceivable that in the near future a better understanding of IBS pathophysiology will help us to tailor treatment for different IBS patients. At the moment, the subclassification of the diverse patterns of symptomatology allows the adjustment of treatments for IBS according to the clinical predominance of each patient. Dietary modifications like fiber supplementation, antidiarrheal agents and antispasmodic drugs are the basis of the current treatment of IBS and depend on the predominant symptom (constipation, diarrhea or pain, respectively). If severe pain is present, antidepressant agents are an appropriate alternative. However, the scientific evidence supporting this current therapeutic approach is limited. Visceral analgesics and serotonin agonists and antagonists may play an important therapeutic role in the near future. However, it is not likely that one single treatment will help every IBS patient and many of them will need a more complex approach with multidisciplinary therapy (diet, psychotherapy, medications).},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a problem reported to affect 22% of the general population. It is characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habit, but has so far defied elucidation of its pathogenesis and proved difficult to treat. There is a growing body of evidence which indicates therapeutic properties for artichoke leaf extract (ALE). Dyspepsia is the condition for which the herb is specifically indicated, but the symptom overlap between dyspeptic syndrome and IBS has given rise to the notion that ALE may have potential for treating IBS as well. A sub-group of patients with IBS symptoms was therefore identified from a sample of individuals with dyspeptic syndrome who were being monitored in a post-marketing surveillance study of ALE for 6 weeks. Analysis of the data from the IBS sub-group revealed significant reductions in the severity of symptoms and favourable evaluations of overall effectiveness by both physicians and patients. Furthermore, 96% of patients rated ALE as better than or at least equal to previous therapies administered for their symptoms, and the tolerability of ALE was very good. These results provide support for the notion that ALE has potential value in relieving IBS symptoms and suggest that a controlled trial is justified.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the procedure and tactics used in the cognitive therapy for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive therapy in the treatment of refractory IBS. METHODS: A self-control study on the cognitive therapy for 22 patients with refractory IBS symptoms (according to Rome II criteria) was performed. The procedure of cognitive therapy included five steps, namely health education, patients' questioning, relaxing training, dissensitization training, and patients' homework for enforcing the effect of former four steps. The effects of cognitive therapy for IBS were evaluated by improvement of symptom-related-anxiety, index of symptom, quality of life specific for IBS and coping. RESULTS: All 22 cases completed cognitive therapy and first follow-up unit (FFU), at the end of FFU, clinical symptoms in all patients improved (P < 0.05), of them, 81.8% improved significantly (P < 0.001); at 12-months-follow-up, complete remission of clinical symptoms occurred in 72.7% (8/11) patients. Comparison of the scores of symptom-related-anxiety, index of symptom, quality of life specific IBS and coping at the end of 1st follow-up unit with that at basal level, the scores of symptom-anxiety, indexes of severity and frequency of symptoms decreased significantly (P < 0.001, respectively); the scores of depression and anxiety in SCL-90 also decreased significantly (P < 0.001). The scores of active coping rose significantly (P = 0.000). IBS-QOL improved significantly (P < 0.05), of them, dysphoria, body image, food avoidence improved very significantly (P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive therapy for patients with refractory IBS is rational and effective. During cognitive therapy, we should follow the therapeutic procedure and the principle of individuation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of alosetron, a treatment recently approved in the United States for irritable bowel syndrome in diarrhea-predominant female patients, on health-related quality of life. METHODS: Quality of life was assessed as part of two 12-wk randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled irritable bowel syndrome studies comparing alosetron 1 mg b.i.d. with placebo (S3BA3001 and S3BA3002). Patients completed a validated disease-specific quality of life questionnaire, the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBSQOL), at baseline and at the 12-wk or final visit. The clinical relevance of data were also evaluated by a minimal meaningful difference instrument. RESULTS: A total of 626 and 647 patients were enrolled in studies S3BA3001 and S3BA3002, respectively. Approximately 70% of patients in each study had diarrhea-predominant IBS. In diarrhea-predominant patients enrolled in S3BA3001, statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvements with alosetron versus placebo were observed on all nine IBSQOL scales (emotional health, mental health, sleep, energy, physical functioning, food/diet, social functioning, role-physical, and sexual relations) and for all but one scale (mental health) in S3BA3002. In both studies, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with alosetron (p < 0.05) experienced clinically meaningful improvement on three of the nine IBSQOL scales (food/diet, social functioning, and role-physical) compared with patients treated with placebo. Patients treated with alosetron did not show worsening in any quality of life domain compared with patients treated with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: These results in women with diarrhea-predominant IBS demonstrate that alosetron significantly improves health-related quality of life.},

   abstract = {A significant proportion of IBS patients attribute their symptoms to adverse food reactions. Dietary elimination and re-challenge studies support the role of diet in the pathogenesis of IBS. The aetiopathogenesis of IBS is thought to be multifactorial involving an interaction between diet, infection, antibiotics and psychosocial factors. Serum IgE and IgG4 antibodies are elevated in food hypersensitivity induced atopic conditions and a similar mechanism has been postulated in IBS. Increased number of mast cells is present in the ileocaecal region of IBS patients. Once sensitized, they are capable of inducing secretory and sensorimotor abnormalities of the gut. The management of IBS is usually aimed at controlling symptoms, however, evaluation of food hypersensitivity may provide a useful adjunct in those with severe symptoms or a clear history of adverse food reaction. There are no well-established tests available but skin prick tests and food specific serum IgG4 and IgE antibodies may help in identifying the offending foods. Other options, which may be explored in individual cases, include sequential dietary exclusion, use of hypoallergenic diets, disodium cromoglycate and novel techniques such as colonoscopic allergen provocation test. Pathophysiology of hypersensitivity induced IBS has been discussed in the light of current data and a management algorithm has been proposed for managing food hypersensitivity in IBS.},
