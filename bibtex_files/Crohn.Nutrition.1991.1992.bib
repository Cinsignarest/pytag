   abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that an increased epithelial permeability may affect sites other than the intestine in patients with Crohn's disease by simultaneously evaluating their pulmonary and intestinal permeability. Pulmonary and intestinal permeability were measured by clearance of inhaled technetium-99m diethylene triamine pentacetate (99mTc-DTPA) and by urinary recovery of chromium-51 ethylene diamine tetracetate respectively in 22 patients with Crohn's disease. The half time clearance of 99mTc-DTPA from lung to blood (t1/2LB) was decreased--that is pulmonary permeability increased--in the whole group of patients with Crohn's disease as compared with 13 controls (median 45.5 minutes (8-160) v 85 minutes (34-130) (p less than 0.003)). When analysed separately only patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 15) had a decreased t1/2 lung to blood v controls (42 minutes (8-160) v 85 minutes (34-130) (p less than 0.0025)). Among patients with active Crohn's disease, six were studied again when their disease was quiescent and their t1/2 lung to blood did not differ significantly. The intestinal permeability was increased in the whole group of Crohn's disease patients as compared with 15 controls (5.25% (1.2-24) v 1.7% (0.65-5.75) (p less than 0.0002)). When analysed separately both patients with active and inactive Crohn's disease had increased intestinal permeability v controls (8.1% (1.6-24) and 3.5% (1.2.9.2) v 1.7% (0.65-5.75)) (p less than 0.0001, p = 0.05 respectively). Six patients with active Crohn's disease were studied again when their disease was quiescent and their intestinal permeability decreased significantly p less than 0.04). Pulmonary permeability was increased in patients with Crohn's disease but was not greatly influenced by Crohn's disease activity as opposed to intestinal permeability. The mechanism of this increase is unknown, but may be related in some patients to the presence of an alveolitis.},

   abstract = {Cellular immunity is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease; whether it is abnormal is not clear. The heterogeneity of patients with Crohn's disease probably underlies the disparity of reports, but attempts to determine which clinical features influence cellular immunity have been largely unsuccessful. This is probably caused by the omission of nutritional status as a potential factor, even though zinc deficiency has frequently been linked with abnormal immunity. Therefore, a detailed study of nutritional and tissue zinc status, nonspecific cellular immunity, and a measure of phagocytic function was performed in 32 patients with Crohn's disease and in a control group of 18 normal subjects and 12 patients with anorexia nervosa. Fourteen patients with Crohn's disease, all patients with anorexia nervosa, but none of the normal controls were malnourished. Peripheral blood lymphocyte population levels were normal in patients with Crohn's disease and in normal controls, but there was a small decrease in the levels of patients with anorexia nervosa. In vivo delayed hypersensitivity skin test responses were profoundly depressed in patients with anorexia nervosa and decreased in patients with Crohn's disease who were malnourished or receiving systemic glucocorticoids. In vitro lymphocyte transformation was reduced in malnourished patients with Crohn's disease, but there were only minor changes in patients with anorexia nervosa. There were alterations of in vitro immunoregulation in Crohn's disease, but they were not responsible for the abnormal lymphocyte transformation responses in malnourished patients. In vitro phagocytic function was reduced in patients with active Crohn's disease. These findings suggest that depressed in vivo and in vitro cellular immunity in malnourished patients with Crohn's disease is caused by a qualitative lymphocyte defect and that depressed in vivo but normal in vitro cellular immunity in anorexia nervosa is caused by a quantitative defect. Thus, malnutrition in Crohn's disease resembles kwashiorkor; in anorexia nervosa, it resembles marasmus. Tissue zinc status was mostly normal in Crohn's disease and anorexia nervosa, and zinc deficiency was not responsible for depressed nonspecific cellular immunity in either condition.},

Gallstone-free patients (n = 16) undergoing cholecystectomy because of adenomyomas or polyps of the gallbladder served as controls. The mean levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, rate-determining enzymes in bile acid, and cholesterol synthesis, respectively, were twofold to threefold higher in the ileum-resected patients than in the controls. Significant positive correlations were obtained between length of resected ileum and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Provided patients who had received total parenteral nutrition preoperatively were excluded from analysis, a significant correlation was also observed between length of resected ileum and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity. Significant positive correlations were also obtained between length of resected ileum and serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol (a marker for bile acid biosynthesis) and lathosterol (a marker for cholesterol synthesis). The plasma levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were negatively correlated to the length of resected ileum. The expression of hepatic low-density lipoprotein-receptor binding activity was determined in five of the patients and in three of the controls. A significant positive correlation was observed between 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and low-density lipoprotein-receptor binding activity. The results show that malabsorption of bile acids leads to parallel stimulation of cholesterol synthesis, cholesterol degradation, and low-density lipoprotein-receptor expression in human liver. The resulting effect in the present patients was a significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.},

The diseases found in decreasing frequency were: Crohn's disease, tuberculosis, carcinoids, lymphomas, endometriosis and leiomyomas. Seventy-seven percent of the cases were benign and the rest malignant. The number of cases in which the preoperative diagnosis was right or included among the differential diagnosis was as follows: clinical study 44%, radiological study 48%, endoscopical study 32% and histological study by means of endoscopic biopsy 20%. The most frequent differential diagnosis were Crohn's disease, tuberculosis and intestinal lymphoma. It is concluded that chronic disease of the ileum represents frequently a diagnostic problem due to their clinical, endoscopical and radiological similarities which may only be solved by histological analysis of the surgical specimens.},

In the past, it was felt that TPN would have a therapeutic role in IBD, but experience has shown that it functions more as an adjunct to other therapeutic interventions. The specific roles of TPN in IBD include: (1) nutritional maintenance in the short bowel syndrome, (2) TPN as adjunctive therapy in jejunoileitis of Crohn's disease, (3) home TPN (HTPN) in Crohn's colitis, and (4) preoperative repletion of significantly depleted patients going to surgery. The adaptation of hospital techniques to the home situation has allowed patients to carry out long-term TPN therapy at home. Patients with IBD on HTPN are subject to the same mechanical and metabolic problems as are other patients on HTPN and, in addition, have a higher infection rate. When carried out appropriately, however, HTPN is a valuable technique in the management of patients with IBD and may provide an improved quality of life.},

   abstract = {The growth spurt of adolescence, during which body weight nearly doubles and height increases by 16%, demands an increased delivery of nutrients by the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic disorders of digestion and absorption at this age, therefore have a potentially profound effect upon growth, skeletal maturation and sexual development. Moreover, the emotional climate of adolescence, which requires affiliation with peer groups, and a distancing from authority figures such as doctors and parents, is often associated with a deterioration in drug and dietary compliance and with erratic clinic attendance. Nutritional problems in adolescent patients with Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis and coeliac disease are the most common. About one third of adolescents with Crohn's disease experience growth failure and delayed sexual development, probably as a consequence of long-term undernutrition. There is a strong argument for the care of these patients being in the hands of paediatric gastroenterologists. Enteral nutrition, often administered overnight, is successful in inducing catch-up growth, and reducing steroid dosage, although resection of diseased gut is often followed by good growth, and surgery should not be overlooked. Cystic fibrosis in adolescence is commonly complicated by protein-energy malnutrition. Pathogenesis includes anorexia, maldigestion and an increase in resting energy expenditure. Malnutrition has been treated by a number of enteral regimens. In general, there is no place for repeated, short-term interventions of less than 6 months. Long-term studies have all shown good nutritional repletion and growth, but results with respect to improved respiratory function are conflicting. More prospective control trials are needed before the precise indications for enteral nutrition in cystic fibrosis can be accurately defined. Once started it is difficult to stop, although preoperative treatment of patients awaiting heart-lung transplantation seems entirely appropriate. The major problem in the management of coeliac disease in adolescence is dietary compliance. Even those patients who claim to have good dietary compliance often have jejunal biopsy evidence of gluten ingestion and tend to be underweight. This is particularly worrying, as after 5 years adherence to a gluten free diet, the increased risk of gastrointestinal malignancy appears to return to normal.},

It may be related to an abnormal utilization of available substrates, particularly proteins, due to an imbalance in protein metabolism kinetics. Its primary mechanism may be an increase in protein breakdown rates over synthesis, specifically related to the associated inflammatory syndrome, and progressively leading to a protein debt. Reduction in food intake would only exaggerate this trend by further reducing the synthesis to breakdown ratio, whereas nutrient supplementation merely compensates for the deficit by promoting protein synthesis.},

Sequential balance studies were performed to assess stool and urinary output, stool fat, and urinary electrolytes initially during intravenous rehydration and subsequently during administration of the necessary fluids and nutrients exclusively by oral supplementation. The additional effects of high-fat and low-fat diet, loperamide hydrochloride, and octreotide acetate were evaluated. When the patient sipped a hypo-osmolar oral rehydration solution while she was awake during the day and received a high dose of loperamide and a 40-g fat, disaccharide-free diet, salt and water homeostasis was maintained. The addition of octreotide did not substantially enhance fluid balance; rather, it increased fecal fat and fluid losses from the small bowel. Thus, hypo-osmolar polymeric glucose solutions maintain fluid homeostasis in patients with the short-gut syndrome. In such patients, simple balance studies are useful for assessing the absorptive capacity of the residual intestine, for developing an optimal individualized treatment, and for eliminating the need for costly, long-term home parenteral nutrition.},

The 45 and 38 kDa forms are the result of a partial or total removal of the carbohydrate moiety, respectively. We determined the molecular forms of fecal alpha-1-antitrypsin in 10 controls, 13 patients with protein-losing enteropathy other than inflammatory bowel disease, 70 patients with active (n = 55) (CDAI greater than 150) and inactive (n = 15) (CDAI less than 150) Crohn's disease, 14 patients with active (n = 12) and inactive (n = 2) ulcerative colitis, and 17 patients with ileostomy. Fecal 38 kDa alpha-1-antitrypsin was found in all controls, all patients with protein-losing enteropathy, in 82 percent of patients with inactive inflammatory bowel disease, and in 20 percent of patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast, the 51 kDa and 45 kDa forms were present in feces of 80 percent of patients with active inflammatory bowel disease, and in only 17 percent of patients with inactive inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with Crohn's disease and the 51 kDa form (n = 39) had significantly higher values of activity index (CDAI) and orosomucoid than patients with Crohn's disease and the 38 kDa form (n = 26) (P less than 0.01). Deglycosylated 38 kDa alpha-1-antitrypsin was never recovered in ileostomy samples. This suggests that deglycosylation of alpha-1-antitrypsin occurred in the colon and is impaired in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {PIP: In view of the significant and articulate minority view among pediatricians that breast feeding is not "worth the bother" in developed countries, this review of the literature delves into the evidence from both developed and developing countries for the advantages of breastfeeding, both in infants and for long-term health. Infants in developed settings experience twice the hospitalization rate and more severe illness from lower respiratory tract infection, primarily respiratory syncytial virus. In developing countries the mortality risk is 4-fold. for otitis media, the relative risks were 3.3-4.3 for Finnish infants. Bacterial meningitis and/or bacteremia had a 4-fold risk for hospitalization in a Connecticut study, and a 3-fold relative risk in 2 developing country studies. Human milk was the best preventative for bacteremia and necrotizing enterocolitis in prematures in British neonatal units. A 20-fold reduction in neonatal deaths occurred in Philippine study of breastfeeding, especially in low birth weight babies. Diarrhea causes the most infant mortality in developing nations, where bottle-feeding raises rates 14-fold. In the U.S. estimated relative risks is 3.7 for diarrheal mortality. Sudden infant death is about 1/5 less common in U.S. breast fed babies than in bottle fed. There is evidence for better long-term health after breast feeding in disorders such as celiac disease, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, malignant lymphoma, chronic liver disease, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies. The design of good studies of protection conferred by breast feeding, and the possible modes of action of breast milk are discussed.

   abstract = {Iron status, iron absorption, and intestinal blood loss were studied in 199 children undergoing diagnostic evaluation for suspected malabsorption. Evaluation of iron status included hematological indices, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation. Iron absorption was assessed by the increment of serum iron after an oral iron load. Iron deficiency was common among patients affected by malabsorptive states, such as celiac disease (84%), cow's milk intolerance (76%), Crohn's disease (72%), and giardiasis (64%), whereas it was less common among patients with postinfectious enteritis (41%) and chronic nonspecific diarrhea (11%). Intestinal blood loss was seen only in patients with Crohn's disease and cow's milk intolerance, irrespective of iron nutritional status. On the other hand, iron malabsorption was very common, affecting 85-95% of the iron-deficient patients in all diagnostic groups, except in chronic nonspecific diarrhea. Iron malabsorption was less common among patients with adequate iron nutritional status than in those with iron deficiency. Iron malabsorption appears to play a major role in the pathogenesis of iron deficiency in patients with malabsorption. The iron absorption test shows greater sensitivity as a screening test for upper intestinal malabsorption than the D-xylose absorption test.},

Four weeks' treatment resulted in significant improvement in disease activity (Harvey-Bradshaw index) and 4-day faecal (111)Indium-leucocyte excretion. Serum sIL-2R concentrations did not change significantly after treatment, 789 +/- 79.8 U/ml (p > 0.05). Serum sIL-2R concentrations were inversely correlated with albumin, pre-albumin, creatinine-height index and total body potassium. Only those patients with markedly elevated sIL-2R concentrations (>800 U/ml) and severe nutritional depletion prior to treatment, showed significant reductions in sIL-2R levels with elemental dietary treatment. These results demonstrate an association between nutritional impairment and immune activation in Crohn's disease.},

Before therapy both groups showed a significantly lower immune response compared with healthy controls. The therapeutical effect was similar in both groups concerning normalization of parameters of inflammation, CDAI and state of nutrition. In contrast, normalization of immune response in skin test was only observed after bowel resection, while conservatively treated patients remained in hyperergy. In conclusion, the impairment of the cell mediated immunity in Crohn's disease must be secondary.

Twenty-seven patients with established Crohn's disease who attained clinical remission after four weeks of enteral feeding were followed prospectively for up to 36 months. Twenty of these were willing to be tested for specific food intolerance using a pre-defined dietary elimination protocol; the others continued on a normal unrestricted diet. Eighteen patients (67%) have since relapsed; 89% of the relapse occurred within the first 6 months. Of the 15 patients with colonic involvement, 12 (80%) relapsed by 6 months. In contrast only 3 of 11 with isolated small bowel disease experienced early relapse. Of the 14 patients who completed the process of dietary testing, 5 could not identify any trigger foods; the remaining 9 were maintained on exclusion diets, 3 of whom relapsed early. Of the 11 taking a normal diet, 9 relapsed. Disease duration, previous intestinal resection or prior steroid therapy did not affect the relapse rate. Eight patients (31%) obtained a long-term remission, mean 23 months (range 12-36 months), without any medication. Long-lasting remissions can be obtained in about one-third of patients with Crohn's disease following treatment with a defined formula diet.

   abstract = {Malnutrition is a frequent occurrence in patients with acute inflammatory bowel disease. Total nutritional support provided either parentally (TPN) or enterally (TEN) has been advocated not only as an adjunct for improving nutrition but also as primary therapy. For patients with acute Crohn's disease, short-term rates of remission after TEN are equivalent to TPN. Coupled with certain advantages when compared with TPN, including simpler administration, fewer side effects, and preservation of the intestinal mucosal barrier, TEN may therefore be the preferred route for nutrient delivery. Controlled trials indicate equivalent or superior efficacy when enteral polymeric diets are compared with elemental diets for inducing remission in acute Crohn's disease. Moreover, when provided as an elemental diet, TEN is as effective as corticosteroids for achieving remission in acute Crohn's disease, but corticosteroids appear to be more effective than polymeric diets. Although the provision of nutritional support rather than bowel rest is the major factor contributing to symptomatic improvement, the optimal nutrient composition and the precise mechanisms whereby nutritional support achieves clinical remission remain to be clarified. In contrast to Crohn's disease, nutritional support is not effective for achieving remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. Thus, enteral nutritional support is an effective therapy for the short-term management of acute Crohn's disease. Whether long-term remission is equivalent to treatment with drugs or surgery requires prospective evaluation. Future avenues of investigation also include defining the optimal nutrient composition and the underlying mechanisms that achieve maximal nutritional repletion, promote mucosal cell renewal, and potentially directly retard production of inflammatory mediators.},

Nutritional parameters were evaluated initially and at the time of repeat study in those with abnormal emptying after a period of nutritional rehabilitation. All UC patients and 30 of 45 with CD (67%) had normal emptying of both liquid and solid components of the meal. Fifteen children with CD had delayed emptying of the solid liquid. Fourteen of these had preceding weight loss and one had no weight gain for 3 months prior to the study. Twelve complained of upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, early satiety, postprandial epigastric pain, and anorexia), and five had evidence of growth retardation. The group averaged 4.8 abnormal nutritional parameters, compared with an average of 2.2 in those with CD and normal gastric emptying. Twelve of the 15 with abnormal emptying had abnormal gastric and/or duodenal biopsies: 10 were treated with sulfasalazine and prednisone, whereas five were taking only sulfasalazine. Studies repeated 6-15 months later after establishment of weight gain by caloric supplementation showed significant improvements in gastric emptying, nutritional status, and disease activity for the group, despite persistence of upper gastrointestinal disease documented in eight patients who underwent reexamination.},

   abstract = {Over the past twenty five years the development of total parenteral nutrition has in many ways revolutionised the practice of surgery. It has enhanced survival in otherwise high mortality operations such as oesophageal surgery, especially with anastomotic complications. It has changed significantly the management of fistulae, either post operative or associated with diseases such as Crohn's enteritis. Here a basic general principle is applied--that a fistula will close if there is no distal obstruction and the throughput can be diminished. This can be achieved by withholding oral feeding and using the parenteral route. It has allowed survival in the short gut syndrome from whatever cause and it is interesting to see the degree of "intestinal adaptation" that occurs once the first critical year is survived with the help of intravenous nutrition. The assessment of nutritional status is difficult and while the level of serum albumin may be taken as a clinical standard, it is obvious that many patients survive extensive surgery with low albumin levels and also that there appears to be a lag period to the restoration of albumin levels, even with otherwise successful nutritional support and with other parameters being satisfactory. Even complex formulae using a combination of laboratory and antropometric parameters is not fully satisfactory as an absolute assessment of nutritional status. It is now interesting to see that nutrition can affect both immune competence and even carcinogenesis. The lipid element in intravenous nutrition may cause dysfunction of immunity and vitamin status, gastric and platelet function with impaired oxygen diffusion leading to increased wedge pressures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The catheter finally required replacement because of progressive lumen occlusion, which was presumed to be caused by thrombosis. At the time of replacement, the catheter was found to be friable and embedded in a hard sheath that made it adherent to the wall of the internal jugular vein and prevented complete removal. At some time during the ensuing 16 months, the retained fragment embolized asymptomatically to the pulmonary artery. During the first 2 months after the placement of a new Hickman catheter, progressive flow resistance developed, probably because of calcium phosphate precipitation, although no change had been made in the parenteral formulation. It resolved immediately upon the instillation of hydrochloric acid into the catheter.},

In case of early recurrence of inflammation during dose reduction or chronic steroid-dependent disease activity a combination of glucocorticoids with Azathioprine will be successful in about 75% of patients. In addition a combination of glucocorticoids with tube feeding (elemental or polymeric diet) will lead to remission of inflammatory activity in about 60 to 70% of these patients.

This longitudinal clinical information was reported to the North American Home Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Registry (Oley Foundation/A.S.P.E.N. joint project) between 1985 and 1989. The data shows that the number of active cancer patients on this therapy is increasing 13% per year. The annual survival rate is 25% for patients with active cancer, as compared with 88% for patients with radiation enteritis and 95% for patients with Crohn's disease. Although 50% of all active cancer patients starting HPN are dead within 6 to 9 months, the prognosis is somewhat better in children, and 20% of these active cancer patients appear to do well, returning to full oral nutrition and experiencing complete rehabilitation. These are presumed to be patients with a potentially curable cancer requiring super-aggressive treatment, which causes temporary severe gastrointestinal dysfunction. Adult active cancer patients have the same rehospitalization rate for HPN complications (once per year) as radiation enteritis and Crohn's disease patients. However, their rehospitalization rate for non-HPN complications is four times higher. This article reviews the factors that may explain the growth of HPN in active cancer patients and discusses some of the unanswered clinical questions that urgently need to be addressed to more effectively determine the appropriateness or inappropriateness of HPN management in the active cancer setting.},

   abstract = {The OASIS Registry started annual collection of longitudinal data on patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in 1984. This report describes outcome profiles on 1594 HPN patients in seven disease categories. Analysis showed clinical outcome was principally a reflection of the underlying diagnosis. Patients with Crohn's disease, ischemic bowel disease, motility disorders, radiation enteritis, and congenital bowel dysfunction all had a fairly long-term clinical outcome, whereas those with active cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had a short-term outcome. The long-term group had a 3-year survival rate of 65 to 80%, they averaged 2.6 complications requiring hospitalization per year, and 49% experienced complete rehabilitation. The short-term group had a mean survival of 6 months; they averaged 4.6 complications per year and about 15% experienced complete rehabilitation. The registry data also indicated HPN was used for 19,700 patients in 1987 with therapy growth averaging about 8% per year. This growth was chiefly from new cancer patients. The number of new patients with long-term disorders in whom HPN was initiated appeared rather constant. We conclude that these clinical outcome assessments justify HPN for long-term patients, but the utility and appropriateness of HPN for the cancer and AIDS patients remains uncertain and requires further study. Medical, social, and fiscal aspects of HPN management in long-term and short-term patients appear to involve quite separate considerations.},

This pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) included (a) subjective reporting of the degree of abdominal pain, stool pattern, and general well-being; (b) presence of extraintestinal manifestations, such as fever, arthritis, rash, and uveitis; (c) physical examination findings; (d) weight and height; and (e) hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum albumin. Independent evaluation of each patient by two physician-observers was performed at the time of a visit, and each physician completed a PCDAI index and a modified Harvey-Bradshaw index and made a "global assessment" of disease activity as none, mild, moderate, or severe. Excellent interobserver agreement was noted for the PCDAI, modified Harvey-Bradshaw index, and global assessment. There was a strong correlation between global assessment and both the PCDAI or modified Harvey-Bradshaw. Increasing PCDAI scores were noted with increasing disease severity, and significant differences in scores were noted between the severity groups. We propose that the PCDAI could be used in multicenter projects to facilitate patient stratification by disease severity and that longitudinal PCDAI scores might provide a numerical measure of response to therapeutic regimens.},

The PCDAI includes subjective patient reporting of symptoms, physical examination, nutritional parameters, and several common laboratory tests (hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin). In this report we examine the relationship of each of the laboratory parameters to the PCDAI, as well as to a modified Harvey-Bradshaw Index score and physician global assessment of disease activity. Data were gathered from the clinical and laboratory observations from 133 children and adolescents at 12 pediatric gastroenterology centers in North America. A statistically significant relationship (p less than 0.05) was noted between each of the laboratory tests and the PCDAI for patients with either disease limited to the small bowel or in those with colonic involvement. For patients with disease limited to the small bowel, a statistically significant (p less than 0.05) relationship was also noted between the three laboratory parameters and the modified Harvey-Bradshaw Index and global assessment. For patients with large-bowel involvement, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was statistically related to the modified Harvey-Bradshaw Index and global assessment (p less than 0.01), as was hematocrit to global assessment (p less than 0.01). Although the laboratory parameters used in the PCDAI appear to generally reflect disease activity in most patients, no single laboratory test is adequate to reflect disease activity in all patients. Future work will need to identify additional laboratory measures to reflect the inflammatory process and serve as important adjuncts in the assessment of disease activity.},

Occasionally, children are seen with minimal gastrointestinal symptoms but in whom severe anorexia and profound growth impairment are evident. Recent observations that elevated serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in cachexia associated with a number of disease states have suggested a similar possible role in inflammatory bowel disease. Accordingly, we determined TNF levels in 45 children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (18 ulcerative colitis, 27 Crohn's disease) at varying times during their clinical course and compared them to values obtained from a group of 25 children with functional bowel disease. No differences were noted in serum TNF levels between the children with inflammatory bowel disease and the control population. Values were generally within the range of the lower limit of detection of the assay. In the children with inflammatory bowel disease, there was no significant correlation between TNF levels and disease activity or growth parameters. Our observations suggest that elevated TNF levels are not associated with inflammatory bowel disease in children.},

The LTB5 generation in active Crohn's disease before this treatment was significantly lower than in healthy control subjects. The amount of LTB5 and the LTB5-LTB4 ratio increased significantly after fish-oil supplementation. The difference with LTB4 was not statistically significant. We have shown that daily intravenous administration of 0.6 g EPA influenced the generation of leukotrienes in active Crohn's disease even after short-term treatment. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the correlation between EPA and clinical improvement in Crohn's disease.},

Concentrations of vitamin A did not depend on the localization of inflammatory bowel disease, previous ileal resections, duration of the disease or age and sex of the patients. During successful treatment of active ulcerative colitis normalization of serum retinol levels without substitution of vitamin A was observed. Repeated determinations in patients with Crohn's disease who had low serum retinol levels in an active phase of disease revealed normal vitamin A levels in an inactive phase. The absorption of vitamins A and E in patients with inflammatory bowel disease was normal. The normal serum retinol concentrations in patients with diarrhea due to irritable bowel syndrome, and in those with anorexia nervosa exclude the influence of diarrhea and body weight itself on vitamin A levels. The results of this study indicate that serum retinol levels in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease are secondary to the decreased serum retinol-binding protein concentrations, and probably depend on the increased protein catabolism in these disorders.},

Alternate day corticosteroid treatment, use of azathioprine, enteral or parenteral hyperalimentation and surgery have been advocated to reverse growth failure. Because of nonacceptance of elemental diet 7 patients with Crohn's disease and growth retardation received parenteral nutrition for 2-3 months (maximal for more than 30 months in one patient). All of them exhibited a mean weight gain of 10 kg and a mean increase of their height velocity from 2.4 to 7.1 cm/year. Main problems were bacterial infections and dislocations of the central lines. Surgery was performed in 3 adolescents immediately after parenteral nutrition. One patient showed a catch-up growth during a 30-months nocturnal home parenteral nutrition at a biological age of 21 years. Parenteral nutrition is an effective regimen to manage growth failure in children with Crohn's disease, but has to be performed for larger periods in individual cases.},

All patients received 12.8 g N, 4725 kJ from carbohydrate and 4200 kJ from fat (10416 kJ total energy). The exchanges were related to nutrient oxidation and nutrient balances in the whole body as assessed by indirect calorimetry and nitrogen excretion. At rest, the subjects were found to be in positive balances for carbohydrate (+0.78 +/- 0.13 kJ/min), fat (+1.85 +/- 0.26 kJ/min) and protein (+0.240 +/- 0.04 kJ/min). Resting forearm muscle was also in positive amino acid balance and positive carbohydrate balance. Despite the large estimated uptake of glucose by forearm muscle (+1860 +/- 84 nmol/100 ml tissue/min) there was no net release of pyruvate and lactate. Glutamate and the branched chain amino acids (BCAA) were the dominant amino acids taken up by muscle (26% and 30% of total uptake respectively) and glutamine was the dominant amino acid carrying nitrogen out of muscle (78% of total amino acid nitrogen release). The energy taken up by muscle as non-esterified fatty acids, triacylglycerol and ketone bodies was small relative to that associated with glucose uptake. The results suggest that during the hypercaloric parenteral nutrition regimen, a) increased peripheral glucose uptake is not necessarily associated with increased release of glycolytic products, b) in the absence of glutamine intake for at least 10 days, muscle retains enough capacity to synthesise and release sufficient quantities of glutamine so that it remains the dominant amino acid carrying nitrogen out of muscle, c) despite the use of the intravenous route for administration of nutrients, and unusual amino acid composition of the regimen, the overall pattern of forearm metabolism bears many similarities to that which occurs after a mixed meal in normal subjects.},

   abstract = {Bacterial translocation is the passage of viable endogenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to mesenteric lymph nodes and other internal organs. The aim of this work was to study bacterial translocation in patients operated on for Crohn's disease. Twenty-eight patients, mean age 29 years, not having received any antibiotics since at least 8 days, presenting with ileal (n = 12), ileo-colonic (n = 14) or colonic (n = 2) Crohn's disease were studied. In 25 out of 28 cases (89%) indication for surgery was strictures inducing an upper small bowel distension in 9 out of 25 patients. Mesenteric lymph nodes and liver biopsies, portal blood samples and peritoneum swabs were harvested after laparotomy and before gut opening. Bacterial translocation, defined as the presence of intestinal bacteria in at least one of the specimens, was present in 8 out of 28 patients. This was found in lymph nodes draining surgical territories in 7 out of 8 cases. Bacterial strains involved in translocation included E. coli (n = 5), Enterococcus (n = 3), Clostridium perfringens (n = 2), Proteus (n = 2), and Bacteroides fragilis (n = 1). The rate of translocation differed neither according to Crohn's disease site nor with perforating or non perforating type of the disease. Five out of 9 patients operated on for strictures with proximal distension had a translocation. In conclusion, bacterial translocation was identified in 29% of patients operated on for Crohn's disease in this series. Distension of the intestine proximal to a digestive stricture could favor the occurrence of bacterial translocation in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {There is conflicting evidence of the effect of intravenous fat emulsions on pancreatic secretion. Intralipid is a safe component of intravenous nutritional support in patients with pancreatic fistulas, though it may minimally increase the volume, as well as the bicarbonate and amylase concentrations, of the output. Intravenous fat emulsions may rarely cause pancreatitis; this may be more likely in patients with Crohn's disease, given that three of the four reported cases occurred in patients with Crohn's disease. It is unclear whether hypertriglyceridemia secondary to the intravenous fat emulsion is a prerequisite for this complication to occur. Intravenous fat emulsions appear to be a safe component of intravenous nutritional support for the patient with pancreatitis, based on multiple studies proving their safety in a total of nearly 100 patients. It seems prudent to avoid hypertriglyceridemia secondary to intravenous fat emulsions, as this alone is a cause of pancreatitis, albeit uncommon, in patients with abnormalities of triglyceride metabolism. However, hypertriglyceridemia resulting from parenteral nutrition may be caused by glucose intolerance and not intravenous fat emulsion administration.},

Patients were subgrouped into those with small (less than 100 cm), intermediate (100-300 cm), and large (greater than 300 cm) resections. [3H]cholecalciferol or [3H]25-hydroxycholecalciferol were given orally and serial blood samples were taken for measurement of plasma radiolabeled vitamin. Absorption of both forms of the vitamin decreased with extent of resection but 25-hydroxycholecalciferol absorption was always greater than that of cholecalciferol. When compared with normal control subjects, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol absorption in these patients was better maintained than that of cholecalciferol. These data indicate that vitamin D malabsorption reflects the extent of distal small-bowel resection in Crohn's disease. Treatment with oral cholecalciferol is sufficient in those with small or moderate resections but oral 25-hydroxycholecalciferol supplementation may be preferred in those with a severe short-bowel syndrome.},

After the additional diagnosis of Crohn's disease was reached, the patient improved on antiinflammatory and nutritional therapy. This patient illustrates the pitfall in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease in a CF patient due to the clinical overlap between the two conditions.

   abstract = {Although defined formula diets may be useful for initial episodes of Crohn's disease, the effects of these diets on subsequent attacks of Crohn's disease or in conjunction with corticosteroids are unknown. To evaluate these issues, we studied 27 patients in a randomized prospective trial. Ten patients received only prednisone (group I), nine received only a defined formula diet (Vital HN [high nitrogen]) (group II), and eight received a combination of prednisone and Vital HN (group III). At the time of entry into the study, the groups were similar with respect to age, sex, Crohn's Disease Activity Index, previous and current treatments, anatomic site of disease, and nutritional status. After 1 month of treatment, we noted seven successes (70%) and three failures in group I (prednisone only), three successes (33%) and six failures in group II (Vital HN only), and six successes (75%) and two failures in group III (combination therapy). Four patients randomized to receive only Vital HN were unable or unwilling to tolerate the defined formula diet. Of the five patients who were able to take the defined formula diet for 1 month, however, three (60%) were successfully treated. The patients who received prednisone (groups I and III) responded better than did the patients who received only the defined formula diet. These results may be attributable to the use of a nonelemental diet or the treatment of patients who were not experiencing an initial attack of Crohn's disease or who had previously received corticosteroids. The expensive and often poorly tolerated defined formula diets should not be considered as a substitute for standard therapy with corticosteroids in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {This study compared the effect of enteral nutrition as the sole therapy of active Crohn's disease with drug treatment. Patients with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index greater than 200) were randomized to receive either enteral nutrition with a liquid oligopeptide diet (n = 55) or a combination of 6-methylprednisolone, 48 mg daily, subsequently tapered, and sulfasalazine, 3 g daily (n = 52). The two groups were not different with respect to age, sex, body weight, location of disease, or treatment before the study. The severity of disease was similar at the beginning of the study in both groups [Crohn's Disease Activity Index (mean +/- SEM), 323 +/- 12 vs. 316 +/- 11]. Remission was defined as a decrease of the initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index by 40% or at least 100 points. Twenty-nine patients in the diet group and 41 patients in the drug group reached remission within 6 weeks of therapy (chi 2 test, P less than 0.01). The median elapsed time to remission was 30.7 days in the diet group compared with 8.2 days in the drug group (Mantel Cox, P less than 0.01). To determine whether one of these treatments was more beneficial for a subgroup of patients, the effectiveness of both treatments was analyzed separately in patients with very severe disease (initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index greater than 300) and less severe disease (initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index less than 300), and in patients with different disease location. However, no influence of initial disease activity or disease location on the effect of either treatment could be shown. These data show that enteral nutrition is less effective than a combination of 6-methylprednisolone and sulfasalazine in treating active Crohn's disease.},

Children are less affected by modifying conditions such as smoking, alcohol ingestion, and the long-term use of medications, and because of their specific needs for ponderal and linear growth, children might benefit most from immunological therapy that has been proven to be steroid sparing. Therefore, clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of 6-MP and/or azathioprine in growing children with Crohn's disease would appear to provide a fruitful avenue for collaborative research. Efforts to organize a multicenter evaluation of these agents have been initiated. The studies are crucial in evaluating the efficacy and safety of immunosuppressive therapy in the pediatric population with IBD.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bowel for which there is no curative treatment. The purpose of treatment is to reduce mortality to the absolute minimum and to give the patients a normal quality of life. Acute episodes of low severity are treated with sulfasalazine and its most recent derivatives such as 5-aminosalicylate. More severe episodes require oral corticosteroid therapy which, when prescribed in adequate doses, results in clinical remission in over 90% of the cases. To this must be added parenteral nutrition in patients with very severe symptoms or when a major nutritional deficit is present. During remissions, a maintenance treatment with 5-aminosalicylate or azathioprine is justified when the acute episodes are frequent and/or severe. These continuous chronic forms require prolonged low-dose corticosteroid therapy or azathioprine. Artificial nutrition is the best way of treating corticosteroid-resistant episodes. In children, corticosteroids must be avoided as much as possible, and low-flow rate enteral nutrition is often used as primary treatment of salicylate-resistant episodes. The surgical treatment of Crohn's disease consists of resection of the lesions with anastomosis or ileostomy in case of total proctocolectomy. Following resection-anastomosis, the cumulative relapse rate is about 50% ten years after surgery; it is lower after colostomy and proctocolectomy. Surgery is indicated in case of complications (abscesses, stenosis, fistulae, perforation) and when the disease does not respond to a well-conducted medical treatment. Specialized teams including physicians, surgeons, proctologists and specialists in nutrition are essential to a correct treatment of Crohn's disease.},

An appreciable rise in TNF alpha was found only in children in relapse of ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn's disease. The group of children with small bowel Crohn's disease in relapse did not show increases of TNF alpha above control concentrations, despite an equivalent rise in disease indices. Height velocity was depressed in children with relapse of large bowel Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis compared with the equivalent condition in remission. The impairment of growth velocity was significantly greater in relapse of large bowel Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in small bowel Crohn's disease alone, although for the subgroups in stage 1 puberty (prepubertal) the differences were not significant. Inadequate growth in chronic inflammatory bowel disease is currently ascribed to inadequate nutrition and TNF alpha may contribute to this through its cachexia inducing effects. It may, in addition, diminish pituitary growth hormone release. These results suggest that production of TNF alpha may be associated with growth failure in relapse of colonic inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {The clinical appearance of Crohn's disease (CD) is especially marked by nutritional deficits and insufficiencies. For a long time the goal of nutritional care was reduced to the readjustment of the nutritional status. The development and clinical use of controlled parenteral nutrition (TPN) and enteral nutritive solutions (EN) did not only emphasize this therapeutical issue, but furthermore showed positive effects on the conservative as well as on the surgical treatment concepts. Therefore today artificial nutritional support is a firm part of therapy in acute, active phases or in the contact of surgical management of CD. This is especially valid in children, where complications in general and growth failure in particular can be reduced. EN is the preferred feeding method in most of the cases, due to a lower complication rate and reduced cost when compared to TPN. The question regarding the importance of nutritional support as primary therapy has also been investigated. The results differ extensively, but point towards the conclusion that patients with solitary small bowel disease do profit from this therapeutical concept. Nevertheless it is unclear, how TPN or EN interfere in the pathophysiology or -biochemistry in this process. A question about reduction e.g. of allergic components of daily diet did stimulate new theories regarding the hypothesis of a possible causal relationship between diet and the pathogenesis of CD. Investigations on dietary habits and daily dietary therapy did not reveal an overall accepted dietary guideline. Nevertheless it seems obvious that dietary counselling has a positive effect on the disease process. It does appear, that today in the acute, active phase as well as in the long term management of Crohn's disease nutritional-care is an important therapeutical method.},

The rationale for HEN was to improve the patients' lifestyle by reducing the need for repeated admissions for nutritional support: this method is extremely useful in correcting nutritional problems. Over the past ten years the use of HEN has expanded to cover other clinical areas including correction of growth retardation secondary to gastrointestinal disease, cystic fibrosis, inborn errors of metabolism, congenital heart disease, and chronic renal failure, in addition to many types of neoplasia and chronic neurological diseases. At the present time, approximately 150 patients receive HEN within the catchment area of the Greater Glasgow Health Board (population 940,000). Despite the increasing availability of HEN many clinicians and dietitians are still reluctant to consider HEN as a 'routine adjunct' to clinical management, claiming that it is too dangerous or complicated. The aims of this article are to explain our method of running a HEN service, offer advice on practical problems and discuss further developments and potential difficulties.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease involves a great risk of malnutrition. Malabsorption, bacterial contamination, frequent abdominal surgery, meal-related pain, protein loss through the damaged mucosa contribute to creating nutritional problems. Malnutrition can worsen the outcome, both in medical and surgical patients, and deteriorate an often already altered immune response. Weight loss, low levels of blood protein, electrolytes, micronutrients and vitamins are usually related to the extension of the mucosal damage. Nutritional assessment can be difficult due to oedema and bleeding, who interfere with both clinical and laboratory evaluation. The exact amount of nitrogen, lipids, minerals stool loss can be useful. It is widely accepted the use of nutritional support in Crohn's disease, but many Authors do not agree concerning the route (enteral or parenteral) and the kind of nutrient to be used. Still controversial is the role of nutrition: just support or real therapy? Most recent hypothesis concerning the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease indicate food and/or bacterial antigens as involved in determining the pathology. The "bowel rest", considered for many years as a fasting period necessarily supported by parenteral nutrition, can also be obtained by the temporarily reduction or stop in presenting those antigens to the bowel mucosa. This new concept can be achieved not only by parenteral nutrition, but with an enteral elemental diet as well. The elemental diet contains all nutrients in the simplest way and thus succeeds in lowering or eliminating the antigenic power. The reported results seem to indicate an equivalence of enteral and parenteral nutrition; anyway enteral is advisable when feasible, being more physiological and less expensive and involving a lower risk of serious complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {Growth failure is the most common extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease in childhood, occurring in up to 50% to 88% of affected patients. Previous studies have shown malnutrition to be the most likely cause of the decrease in height and weight velocities in these children. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an intermittent defined formula diet on growth and disease activity in children with Crohn's disease and growth failure. Six Tanner stage I-II patients, mean age 13.6 years with height less than the 5th percentile or height velocity less than the 3rd percentile were enrolled in a 1-year prospective study. An isotonic, hydrolyzed whey, medium-chain triglyceride formula was given by nocturnal nasogastric infusion at a caloric equivalent of 50th percentile for age, as the exclusive nutrient source 1 out of 4 months during a 1-year period. A 2-week exclusion diet and a 2-week low-residue diet followed the defined formula diet before resuming the regular diet for 2 months. Patients served as their individual control based on observations of at least 1 year before the study. Height and weight velocity significantly increased. Prednisone intake significantly decreased, and significant improvement was seen in disease activity, albumin, and somatomedin C. The results indicate that an intermittent defined formula diet can improve growth failure and significantly decrease disease activity in children with Crohn's disease.},

Postoperative complications occurred in 9.7% of the patients, 4% had to be reoperated on, and the overall mortality rate was 0.5%. In multivariate analysis by stepwise logistic regression, the only variable significantly (p = 0.03) associated with overall rate of complications was long-term corticosteroid therapy. Serious complications were more common in cases of intra-abdominal abscesses (p = 0.01) and preoperative steroid medication (p = 0.03). The combination of both of these risk factors increased the rate of reoperations from 0.6% (no steroids, no abscess) to 16% (steroids and abscess). No significant association with postoperative complications could be found for age, sex, duration of disease, previous operations, nutritional status, emergency surgery, extent of disease, type, number, and localization of anastomoses, presence of proximal ileo-/colostomy, or histologically inflamed margins of resection.},

A progressive increase in sIL-2R levels was noted to correlate with endoscopic measurement of disease extent, while sIL-2R levels did not correlate with other markers of systemic lymphocyte activation, suggesting possible local mucosal production. Sequential determinations in individual patients revealed a good correlation between sIL-2R and clinical course. More important, elevated levels of sIL-2R preceded clinical relapse of asymptomatic patients. We conclude that sIL-2R measurement may be a useful adjunct to clinical assessment and routine laboratory testing in pediatric and adolescent patients with Crohn's disease and that serial levels may be predictive of clinical course and the response to therapy.},

The initial energy intake (EI) of 10 MJ/day was increased to 21 MJ/day by three stepwise increments ( approximately 4MJ) in the glucose content of the feed. REE increased from 4.2 to 6.8 kJ/min, and body weight from 53 to 76kg. REE rose by a progressively greater amount with each increment in energy intake (DeltaREE DeltaEl = 0.12 to 0.26 ). The RQ increased progressively to a value up to 1.19 and persisted above 1.0 even 9h after the feed was stopped. The results suggest that the increase in REE a) was due to a combination of increasing lean body mass and increasing diet-induced thermogenesis, b) dissipated only a small proportion of the total energy infused, and c) was associated with net lipid synthesis from carbohydrate whilst on and off the feed. The results are discussed in relation to the energy equivalent of ATP and the circulating concentrations of insulin and the flux of substrates across forearm tissue.},

   abstract = {1. Twenty-four hour energy expenditure and its components, i.e. 'basal metabolic rate', activity energy expenditure and diet-induced thermogenesis were measured, using continuous whole-body indirect calorimetry, in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition while in remission from Crohn's disease (weight 51.9 +/- 9.9 kg, body mass index 19.2 +/- 2.0 kg/m2). 2. Total parenteral nutrition was infused continuously over 24 h in four subjects and cyclically, between 22.00 and 10.00 hours, in eight subjects. Twenty-four hour energy expenditure (6.83 +/- 1.10 MJ/24 h) was lower than total energy intake (10.09 +/- 1.63 MJ/24 h), resulting in a positive energy balance (3.26 +/- 1.42 MJ) in all subjects. Repeated measurements of resting energy expenditure in the continuously fed subjects (5.82 +/- 1.11 MJ/24 h) did not change significantly at different times of day (coefficient of variation 2.2-6.6%). In contrast, in cyclically fed subjects, resting energy expenditure was 24.2 +/- 9.0% higher towards the end of the 12 h feeding period than the 'basal metabolic rate', which was measured just before the start of the feeding period. 3. Diet-induced thermogenesis, calculated as the increment in resting energy expenditure above 'basal metabolic rate' over the 24 h period (adjusted for the reduction in energy expenditure during sleep), was found to be 0.60 +/- 0.29 MJ or 6.1 +/- 3.1% of the energy intake. 4. The energy cost of activity (activity energy expenditure) in the continuously fed patients, calculated as the difference between 24 h energy expenditure and the integrated 24 h measurements of resting energy expenditure, was 0.88 +/- 0.53 MJ, i.e. 12.9 +/- 5.9% of the 24 h energy expenditure. 5. The non-protein non-glycerol respiratory quotient exceeded 1.0 for varying periods of time (0.5-17 h) in 11 subjects, indicating net lipogenesis from carbohydrate. 6. The results demonstrate favourable rates of deposition, during intravenous feeding, of both energy and nitrogen over a 24 h period in patients recovering from an episode of Crohn's disease. The efficacy of these commonly used total parenteral nutrition regimens in these patients is related to three features that are absent in normal healthy individuals, namely a low basal metabolic rate, a low activity-related energy expenditure and prolonged periods of lipogenesis from carbohydrate.},

A statistically significant correlation was also found between plasma selenium and the Harvey-Bradshaw score (r = -0.44), body mass index (wt/ht2) (r = 0.47), and plasma albumin (r = 0.29). Patients with a small-bowel resection > 200 cm appear to be at risk of developing severe selenium deficiency.

Twenty four patients were studied (nine with ileal, 11 with ileocolonic, and four with colonic disease). Both feeds proved effective; nine of 13 patients randomised to receive the amino acid based feed were in clinical remission within three weeks as defined by a simple activity index compared with eight of 11 treated with the whole protein feed. Patients in clinical remission were then crossed over onto the other feed. None of the six patients who were changed to the whole protein feed relapsed over the subsequent three week period compared with three of seven patients who were changed to the amino acid based feed. In responders the median serum C reactive protein concentration fell from 21 mg/l (range 9-82) on entry to 6 mg/l (range 3-19) at six weeks. Seven patients relapsed within eight months of starting solid food (mean 3.7 months), while nine were still in remission (follow up period 3-9 months, median six months). Detailed studies of staged reintroduction of food and permitted food additives were carried out over a four year period in a patient with extensive stricturing small bowel Crohn's disease who had been brought into remission by open treatment with enteral feeding. Carrageenan, other permitted emulsifiers, bread, meat, potatoes, oranges, refined sugar, dairy produce, flour, and rice were all reintroduced without any objective ill effect, but green vegetables provoked a clinical and biochemical relapse within one week of introduction. Remission was rapidly achieved by switching back to the enteral feed but reintroduction of the low residue diet that had been previously tolerated produced a brisk relapse. Clinical and biochemical remission was again achieved by a return to the enteral feed but relapse again occurred with reintroduction of the low residue diet. These studies confirm the therapeutic effect of enteral feeding in Crohn's disease. This effect does not seem to be due to avoidance of whole protein, but the very low residue of chemically defined enteral feeds may be important, particularly in patients with intestinal strictures.},

They received a four to six week enteral nutrition course with either an elemental diet or a polymeric diet. Clinical remission occurred in 10 of the 15 patients on elemental diet compared with 11 of the 15 patients assigned to polymeric diet. Both groups showed similar improvements in nutritional status, biological inflammation, alpha 1 antitrypsin clearance, and colonoscopic lesions (diminished in 17 out of 24 patients). Most patients relapsed during the year after discharge.

Lactose restriction, low-fat diets and low-residue diets may be of value in specifically indicated clinical situations. A fibre-rich, unrefined carbohydrate diet has not been shown to alter the course of the disease, and the value of 'exclusion diets' remains to be confirmed in controlled, prospective studies. Nutritional insufficiency of varying degrees is common in Crohn's disease and can be corrected by the efficient use of enteral diets (usually with polymeric preparations) or intravenous nutritional support. Growth retardation in adolescents with Crohn's disease can usually be improved by enteral nutrition. Nutritional support of various kinds may be of value in the management of local complications of Crohn's disease; sub-acute obstruction, anal, perianal and rectal lesions, fistulas and ileostomy complications, and the management of bile acid-induced diarrhoea. The use of nutrition as 'primary therapy; in Crohn's disease is considered. Theoretical reasons why nutritional support and bowel rest may possibly induce remission of the disease are discussed. The evidence to date suggests that intravenous nutrition and bowel rest may not be effective in inducing a primary remission of the disease, and the possible value of elemental diets and polymeric diets in this respect are assessed. Further prospective controlled studies of elemental diets as primary therapy in Crohn's disease are required.},

The severity of CD was estimated according to an activity score. This was initially 66 +/- 19 reaching 100 in 16% of cases. Initial involvement included ileon and large intestine only (n = 23), large intestine (n = 11) and ileon only (n = 4), with upper GI tract or perineal involvement in 32 and 75% of cases respectively. The treatments consisted of corticosteroids (n = 34), azathioprine (n = 11), continuous enteral feeding (CEF) (n = 25), parenteral nutrition (PN) (n = 30). Mean recurrence rates per patient and per year were 0.6 in the groups including ileon and large intestine or the large intestine only and 0.3 in the ileal group. A surgical resection was performed in 20 cases with a mean rate of reoperation of 40% at 5 years. Reoperations were necessary only in the group involving the ileon and large intestine. Mean weight catch-up in 3 months and height growth speed were 6 kg and 1.7 to 3.1 cm/year under CED and/or PN. After a 6 year follow-up the activity index was decreased by 70% with a quality of life considered to be good in 60% of cases.},

The inflamed mucosa obtained from eight patients with nonperforating Crohn's disease did not react with antilipocortin antibody on immune blot analysis. In contrast, the inflamed mucosa from four patients with perforating Crohn's disease, as well as that obtained from histologically normal controls, contained lipocortins. In addition, higher concentrations of intramucosal ileal and colonic PGE2 were found in patients with nonperforating Crohn's disease (902 +/- 454 pg/wet weight [WW] mg and 1,268 +/- 567 pg/WW mg, respectively) compared with normal controls (90.2 +/- 43.1 pg/WW mg and 173 +/- 76.5 pg/WW mg, respectively) (p less than 0.01). The difference in intramucosal ileal and colonic PGE2 levels between patients with perforating Crohn's disease (109.6 +/- 16.7 pg/WW mg and 252 +/- 34.4 pg/WW mg, respectively) and normal controls was not significant. These findings indicate that there may be two distinct patterns of Crohn's disease that differ in the amount of lipocortin present in the intestinal mucosa.},

   abstract = {Previous reports have suggested that there may be a protective effect of active cigarette smoking on the risk of ulcerative colitis. Because passive smoking may also have other health consequences, the authors examined the effect of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke during childhood on adult risk of ulcerative colitis in a case-control study of 172 cases drawn in 1986-1987 from the rosters of North Carolina chapters of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America and 131 peer-nominated neighborhood controls. Active smokers were less likely to develop ulcerative colitis than were nonexposed nonsmokers (odds ratio = 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.24-1.14). The risk was also decreased in passive smokers, i.e., those whose parents had smoked (odds ratio = 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.25-1.00). Risk estimates were not related to sex, education, age at onset of symptoms, or year of onset of symptoms. Both active smoking in adulthood and passive childhood exposure to environmental tobacco smoke appear to decrease the risk of ulcerative colitis. The results indicate that childhood passive smoke exposures can influence adult susceptibility to ulcerative colitis.},

Accurate evaluation of the patient's nutritional status and appropriate nutritional support, whether enteral or parenteral, constitute integral parts of the management of the growing child with IBD. Over the past two decades, a number of studies have supported the potential use of nutritional therapy to induce remission and to control disease activity in symptomatic Crohn's disease. More recently, preliminary studies on the use of dietary supplements of marine-oil-derived omega-3 fatty acids have also indicated a beneficial effect in IBD patients. In parallel with these clinical trials, scientific research has recently focused on the concept that specific dietary alterations can modulate the immune response. Components of the diet that may have particular relevance to mucosal immunity and the pathogenesis of IBD include polyunsaturated fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acids such as glutamine and arginine. Future research in the interactions between specific nutrients and the immune system will likely increase our understanding of the causes of IBD, as well as enhance the development of novel nutritional therapies for IBD patients.},

   abstract = {It is clear that the nutritional state of patients with inflammatory bowel disease is often impaired and can be improved by the provision of nutritional support. Improvement in nutritional status can be achieved as effectively with enteral as with parenteral nutrition. Nutritional support appears to have no primary therapeutic effect in patients with ulcerative colitis. With regard to nutritional support in Crohn's disease, parenteral nutrition should be restricted to use as supportive rather than primary therapy. Available information now seems to suggest that most of the benefits of parenteral nutrition in Crohn's disease are related to an improvement in nutritional state rather than as primary therapy, and its use should be restricted to the treatment of specific complications of Crohn's disease, such as intestinal obstruction related to stricture formation or short bowel syndrome following repeated resection. Although some doubt exists over the efficacy of oligopeptide-containing elemental and polymeric enteral diets, the present evidence indicates that chemically defined free amino acid-containing elemental diets have primary therapeutic efficacy in the management of acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. As such, these diets are worthy of therapeutic trial in patients with severe Crohn's disease involving the distal colon and rectum, particularly in those patients who are malnourished and who prove to be resistant to treatment with a combination of topical corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid-containing compounds. Clinicians should be aware, though, that the beneficial effects are likely to be restricted to the short term, with high relapse rates by 1 year, this being particularly so in patients with distal Crohn's proctocolitis (Teahon et al, 1988). Volatile fatty acid enemas clearly have potential in the management of patients with severe steroid-resistant proctitis. Finally, one of the most important observations made in recent years is the one concerning the large losses of nitrogen that will occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with corticosteroids in the absence of adequate protein intake (O'Keefe et al, 1989). Hopefully the days of treating patients with severe inflammatory bowel disease with high dose corticosteroids and a peripheral dextrose or dextrose-saline drip have passed into history.},

In this review, the use of enteral and parenteral nutrition support as primary therapy for active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is discussed. Other roles for nutrition support in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, including preoperative nutrition support, nutritional treatment of intestinal fistulas and growth retardation, and home parenteral nutrition for gut failure, are also reviewed.},

Eight people were studied. After 8 h of saline administration, they received 20% lipid emulsion and 8% amino acid solution during the next 5 h (rate 3.8 mg.kg-1.min-1 fat and 1.9 mg.kg-1.min-1 amino acid). Before the onset of the infusion and 3 and 5 h after, gas exchange and REE were measured. The rapid lipid emulsion administration led to a significant rise in serum triglyceride level. A significant increase in VO2 (from 269.0 +/- 66.8 to 319 +/- 55.8 ml/min) and REE (from 1858 +/- 438 to 2155 +/- 385 kcal/24 h) was observed 5 h after the onset of substrate administration (P less than 0.01). Pulmonary ventilation and VCO2 production were not influenced by the infusion. The thermic effect of nutrients administered reached 3.5 and 6.5% 3 and 5 h after the start of infusion, respectively. We conclude that REE can be increased by the rapid administration of lipid-based parenteral nutrition.},

The mean (+/- SE) age was 31.5 +/- 2.0 years. The serum albumin level was less than 35 g/L in 93.5% of patients; all had a hematocrit value less than 0.36, and 80.4% lost more than 15% of their normal body weight. No patient received parenteral nutrition either preoperatively or postoperatively. No change in the preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative approach to treating patients with predominantly ileal Crohn's disease occurred during the 10-year period of review. There was a 2.2% incidence of perioperative complications (one superficial wound infection) and a 6.5% incidence of late (>1.49 months) complications (two suture sinuses and one wound abscess unassociated with a fistula).

Urinalysis revealed numerous leukocytes and Enterobacter was identified by urine culture. Cystoscopy revealed an edematous region. Contrast film of small intestines demonstrated vesicoileal fistula. Judging from these and the radiographic findings, we made the diagnosis of vesicoileal fistula with Crohn's disease. After medical therapy between February 22 and May 25, urinalysis became normal and we assumed that the fistula had closed. Now, it is about a year since the therapy began, the patient remains well, without urinary and enteric symptoms. Cystoscopy and urinalysis did not reveal recurrence of the fistula. Despite previous reports that vesicoenteric fistulas complicating Crohn's disease require surgical treatment, this case responded to medication, and required no surgical treatment. This case is a reminder of the importance of the principle of therapy.},

   abstract = {Indium-111 leukocyte scanning and colonoscopy were performed in 19 children and adolescents with chronic inflammatory bowel disease to study the correlation of evaluation between these two diagnostic modalities in comparison to histologic study for colonic disease. Seven patients had ulcerative colitis, 10 had Crohn's disease, and two patients had no specific diagnosis after evaluation. The sensitivity of indium-111 scan was 18%, specificity was 62.5%, and accuracy for diagnosing colonic disease was only 37%. In comparison, sensitivity and specificity for colonoscopy were 100 and 57%, respectively. Furthermore, accuracy with colonoscopy was 84%. Our data suggest that the usefulness of scans is limited to patients in whom standard diagnostic procedures are contraindicated. In addition, it is essential to confirm the visual diagnostic impression on colonoscopy with histologic study.},

   abstract = {Vascular manifestations as extraintestinal symptoms of Crohn's disease are rare and only occasionally reported in children. A 14-year-old girl with vascular compromise prior to intestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease is described. The vascular symptoms were due to segmental narrowing of several major arteries as shown by angiography. This kind of vascular involvement in our patient is different from the pattern described in Crohn's disease and resembles Takayasu's disease. Recently, it has been suggested that Crohn's disease could be mediated by multifocal gastrointestinal infarction due to chronic focal mesenteric arteritis at the level of the muscularis propria of the gut. In Takayasu's disease, a granulomatous inflammation of the vasa vasorum of affected vessels is frequently found. An intramural arteritis, granulomatous in nature, could be the common pathway in both Crohn's and Takayasu's diseases. Until the etiologies of both diseases are uncovered, the interrelation between them will remain subject to speculation.},

   abstract = {To determine whether information available at time of diagnosis of Crohn's disease can predict initial clinical course, I followed 239 patients prospectively from time of diagnosis to initial relapse. The patient's sex, smoking habits, contraceptive usage, disease extent, and presence of granulomas in the first histological specimen were recorded. No association was found between this demographic data and the interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis, the severity of symptoms at presentation, or the time to relapse. The type of relapse, however, was influenced by the type of the first attack; 70% of relapses were of the same type as the initial attack. Cigarette smoking was associated with ileocolitis (p = 0.028). There was a trend for oral contraceptive users to have ileocolitis, whereas the presence of granulomas in the first histological specimen was not associated with a specific disease distribution. Patients with ileocolitis had more inflammatory attacks than those with ileitis or colitis (p = 0.001). There was also a trend for cigarette smokers and those on oral contraceptives to have more inflammatory attacks, but the presence of granulomas had no effect on the type of relapse. There is little to assist in prognosis of early disease when the diagnosis of Crohn's disease is first made, although the types of attacks tend to repeat themselves.
PIP: A surgeon followed 239 people diagnosed with Crohn's disease while they were patients at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa between 1970 and 1988 until 1st relapse or for 10 years to determine whether risk factors of the disease predicts the clinical disease course. 156 (65%) had suffered from a relapse. The relapse type of about 70% of these cases was of the same type as the 1st attack. Cigarette smokers were more likely to experience ileocolitis than nonsmokers (47% vs. 32%; p=.028). Ileocolitis was linked to an increased number of inflammatory attacks (47% vs. 35% for ileitis and 14% for colitis; p=.001). Thus the researcher concluded that cigarette smoking is linked to Crohn's disease and influences the underlying disease process. A nonsignificant trend existed for combined oral contraceptive use and increased numbers of inflammatory attacks and ileocolitis. Histological granulomas did not effect the relapse pattern of the patients. The Quetelet Index indicated that females were more likely to be malnourished than males (561 vs. 645; p.0001). They presented with more severe Crohn's disease at diagnosis. Obstruction was responsible for 40% of relapses in patients with ileitis. Other than the fact that the type of attack 1st experienced by an individual tends to be the same as the relapse attack, this study did not provide physicians any additional information to help with prognosis of early diagnosis of Crohn's disease.

   abstract = {Enteral nutrition (EN) containing part of the energy substrates in the form of triacylglycerols with medium chain fatty acids (MCT) has a number of advantages in particular in patients with an impaired utilization of energy and impaired nutrient absorption from the small intestine. The increased MCT supply reduces the risk of the development of shock lung, consumption coagulopathy and has a very favourable effect in patients with severe catabolism associated with Crohn's disease. On the other hand EN containing MCT may produce also some undesirable effects such as deterioration of glucose utilization in the liver, changes, on the composition of plasma lipids and lipoproteins and an undesirable thermogenic effect. Investigations of the effect of EN containing 50% of fat in the form of MCT (Preciten MCT 50R, Sandoz Nutrition-Wander) indicate that even an energy supply corresponding to 1.7 X REE in the form of EN with 50% MCT does not lead to a statistically significant rise of REE, does not produce a marked thermogenic effect and the value of the respiratory quotient (RQ) does not increase significantly. Already after 8 days of EN significant changes occur in the spectrum of lipids and lipoproteins characterized by a decline of high density lipoproteins HDL3 (p less than 0.05). The parallel decline of low density lipoproteins LDL and VLDL, however, is the reason why adverse changes of the atherogenic index do not occur.},
