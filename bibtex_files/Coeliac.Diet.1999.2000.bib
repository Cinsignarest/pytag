   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an increasingly diagnosed enteropathy (prevalence, 1:200-1:300) that is induced by dietary exposure to wheat gliadins (as well as related proteins in rye and barley) and is strongly associated with HLA-DQ2 (alpha1*0501, beta1*0201), which is present in over 90% of CD patients. Because a variety of gliadin peptides have been identified as epitopes for gliadin-specific T-cell clones and as bioactive sequences in feeding studies and in ex vivo CD intestinal biopsy challenge, it has been unclear whether a 'dominant' T-cell epitope is associated with CD. Here, we used fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes from individual subjects undergoing short-term antigen challenge and tissue transglutaminase-treated, overlapping synthetic peptides spanning A-gliadin to demonstrate a transient, disease-specific, DQ2-restricted, CD4 T-cell response to a single dominant epitope. Optimal gamma interferon release in an ELISPOT assay was elicited by a 17-amino-acid peptide corresponding to the partially deamidated peptide of A-gliadin amino acids 57-73 (Q65E). Consistent with earlier reports indicating that host tissue transglutaminase modification of gliadin enhances gliadin-specific CD T-cell responses, tissue transglutaminase specifically deamidated Q65 in the peptide of A-gliadin amino acids 56-75. Discovery of this dominant epitope may allow development of antigen-specific immunotherapy for CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although clinical manifestations of celiac disease may change throughout life, clinical, histologic, immunologic, and genetic studies show that there are incomplete forms of this condition, making it difficult to define the disease at a given moment. Because there is no information published in the Latin American-Amerindian population, this study was conducted to assess relations between these parameters in Chileans with celiac disease and their first-degree relatives. METHODS: Sixty-two persons with confirmed celiac disease (mean age, 17.9 +/- 5.1 years; 78.3% females) and 126 relatives (mean age, 27.9 +/- 17.2 years; 65.1% females) were evaluated. Clinical manifestations, antiendomysial antibodies (EMAs), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes were studied in patients. Additionally, jejunal biopsy specimens were assessed (light microscopy) in EMA-positive (EMA+) relatives. RESULTS: Of the patients, 24.1% adhered to a strict gluten-free diet; 26% were oligosymptomatic, and none were malnourished; 45% were EMA+; 13.8% who ingested gluten were EMA-negative (EMA-); one patient consuming a strict gluten-free diet was EMA+. The DQA1*0501 allele was present in the highest frequency (48%, P < 0.0005), whereas combinations of DQ8 were predominant. Of the relatives, 4.8% were EMA+; they had a significantly higher frequency of diarrhea, weight loss, and anorexia (P < 0.03); and all had abnormal histology in biopsy specimens. CONCLUSIONS: After childhood, celiac disease is oligosymptomatic and is often unrecognized by patients. Disease in 13.8% of patients and in 4.8% relatives appeared as incomplete forms of celiac disease. Predominance of DQ8 HLA haplotypes reflects the genetic Spanish-Mapuche heritage of this population.},

In EATL, a similar monoclonal population that shows clonal identity with the lymphoma itself is also present in the enteropathic mucosa. In this study we show that in all three circumstances the monoclonal T-cell population is constituted by cytologically normal, noninvasive intraepithelial T lymphocytes that share an identical aberrant immunophenotype with EATL. Patients with refractory sprue and/or ulcerative jejunitis are, therefore, suffering from a neoplastic T-cell disorder for which hematological treatment strategies need to be devised.},

The aim of this study was to determine whether a high AGA value in the serum of patients with coeliac symptoms can also be regarded by itself, without typical mucosal atrophy, as a marker of latent CD, as some authors suggest in relatives of celiac patients. METHODS: We observed 31 patients with suspected CD and pathological values of serum IgA ang IgG AGA. In all we performed intestinal biopsy, assayed antiendomisium antibodies (AEA) in serum, AGA IgA, IgG, and IgM in duodenal jejunal fluid and in some of the lymphocytcs CD3+ gamma/delta+ in the lamina propria of the intestinal mucosa. RESULTS: In this study only pathological values of serum AGA without mucosa atrophy don't seem to be markers of latent CD, but an aspecific allergic response. CONCLUSIONS: As shown by other authors serum AEA, intestinal fluid AGA IgM and lamina propria lymphocytes CD3+ gamma/delta+ seem markers of latent CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal motor abnormalities could account for some of the dyspeptic symptoms of celiac patients. However, the data on gastric emptying time are conflicting, and the pathophysiology of motor disturbances is still unclear. Neurotensin modulates upper gastrointestinal motor activity, and its postprandial increase is a reliable index of nutrient delivery to the ileum. We therefore assessed both plasma neurotensin levels and gastric emptying in untreated celiacs. METHODS: The gastric antral area of nine untreated celiac patients and nine controls was measured with ultrasound at base line and every 30 min after a fatty meal (227 kcal, 45% fat); the base-line and postprandial neurotensin plasma levels were determined by means of radioimmunoassay. The data are mean values +/- standard deviation and were analyzed by using non-parametric tests. RESULTS: The overall and half gastric emptying time were significantly longer in the patients (203+/-32 versus 133+/-15 min, P = 0.0117, and 137+/-32 versus 78+/-11 min, P = 0.0001). The pattern of the changes in antral area was similar in both groups during the observation period as a whole but differed significantly in the first 120 min (P = 0.0343). Base-line neurotensin levels were significantly higher in the patients (41.6+/-23.9 versus 18.2+/-5.5 pg/ml, P = 0.0214) and their net postprandial increase was lower than in controls (15.0+/-15.9 versus 29.8+/-13.0 pg/ml, P = 0.046). In both groups the base-line neurotensin levels were related to the half gastric emptying time (P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: In untreated celiac patients gastric emptying time is longer than in controls and is concomitant with an increase in base-line plasma neurotensin levels.},

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the nutritional status and body composition of adult celiac disease patients consuming a gluten-free diet who were in clinical, biochemical, and histologic remission. DESIGN: We studied 71 patients (51 women and 20 men; mean age: 27 y; range: 17-58 y) and 142 healthy control subjects matched by sex and age. The subjects' height, weight, body mass index, fat and lean mass, and bone mineral content (evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were measured; a 3-d dietary questionnaire was administered; and total daily energy, fat, carbohydrate, and protein intakes were calculated. RESULTS: The weight, height, and body mass index of male celiac disease patients and the weight and body mass index of female celiac disease patients were significantly lower than the corresponding measurements in control subjects. The fat and lean mass of both male and female patients was significantly different from that of control subjects; however, bone mineral content was significantly lower only in females in whom celiac disease was diagnosed in adulthood. Total energy intake was lower in the patients than in the control subjects (9686 +/- 1569 and 11297 +/- 1318 kJ/d in males and 6736 +/- 1318 and 7740 +/- 1715 kJ/d in females), and the diet of the patients was unbalanced, with a higher percentage of energy as fat and a lower percentage of energy as carbohydrates. CONCLUSIONS: Although strictly compliant with their gluten-free diet and in complete remission, patients with celiac disease showed differences in body composition and dietary intakes compared with control subjects. Strict follow-up and dietary advice in terms of the choice and composition of foods seem necessary to prevent malnutrition.},

We here report the case of a 67-year-old woman referred to us because of a malabsorption syndrome lasting for 2 years; massive lymph node enlargement and cavitation were detected by means of ultrasonography and a computed tomography scan. Celiac disease was definitely diagnosed by means of duodenal histology, and a laparotomy was performed to exclude an underlying T-cell lymphoma. The adoption of a gluten-free diet led to a rapid and dramatic improvement in the clinical and histologic picture and normalization of the size of the lymph nodes. Celiac disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients with mesenteric lymph node cavitation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is the most common cause of malnutrition in children of Western countries. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to measure body composition in children at the time celiac disease was diagnosed and after consumption of a gluten-free diet (GFD). DESIGN: We assessed body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 29 children and adolescents with a mean (+/-SD) age of 9.5 +/- 3.4 y at the time celiac disease was diagnosed and in a subset of 20 patients after 1.2 +/- 0.2 y of a GFD. We also studied 23 patients aged 21.2 +/- 4.6 y who consumed a GFD for 10.6 +/- 4.5 y. Each patient was matched with a healthy control subject of the same age and sex. RESULTS: Untreated patients weighed less than control subjects (P = 0.04). Fat mass and bone mineral content were lower in the patients than in the control subjects (P < 0.01), as was lean mass of the limbs (P = 0.0013). After approximately 1 y of the GFD, there were no significant differences in body-composition values between patients and control subjects. Similarly, body-composition values of celiac disease patients who consumed the GFD long term were comparable with those of healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Remarkable abnormalities in body composition were found in children at the time of diagnosis of celiac disease. Appropriate dietary treatment reverses body-composition abnormalities quickly and the beneficial effects of gluten withdrawal are persistent. Because these results are harder to achieve if celiac disease is first diagnosed in adulthood, efforts to encourage early diagnosis of celiac disease should be made.},

   abstract = {A central feature of arterial lipid deposition is its nonuniform and variable distribution. In immature human and rabbit aortas, spontaneous lesions occur most frequently downstream of branch points, but they tend to occur upstream of the same branches at later ages. In cholesterol-fed rabbits, the juvenile pattern has been seen regardless of age. These distributions may be determined by transport properties of the arterial wall, because uptake of plasma macromolecules is elevated downstream of aortic branches in immature rabbits and upstream in mature ones, except during cholesterol feeding, when the juvenile pattern is seen in adult vessels. The effect of cholesterol could reflect its inhibitory influence on the nitric oxide (NO) pathway because the adult transport pattern is NO dependent. Using protocols expected to preserve NO function and the mature pattern of transport during hypercholesterolemia, we made 2 attempts to induce upstream disease in rabbits. In trial I, plasma concentrations of cholesterol were kept within the normal human range for 15 weeks by using dietary levels of 0.05% to 0.2%. Although disease patterns reverse with age in human vessels exposed to these concentrations, lesions in both immature and mature rabbits occurred downstream of intercostal branch ostia. Trial II used older rabbits, a different base diet containing more vitamin E (96 mg/kg rather than 57 mg/kg), and higher levels of cholesterol (1%, administered for 8 weeks). For some animals, extra vitamin E (2000 mg/kg) was added to the diet. The mature pattern of lipid deposition was apparent around intercostal branches in the first group and was accentuated by the additional vitamin E, a change that was associated with a significant increase in the plasma concentration of NO metabolites. Spontaneous lesions, assessed on the base diet, were too rare to have influenced these distributions. This is the first report of upstream disease in the cholesterol-fed rabbit. The results support but do not prove the view that NO and transport are important in atherogenesis.},

After dapsone had to be discontinued because of side effects, a gluten-free diet and supportive therapy controlled the disease; the AEmA and tTG antibodies became negative. Our data on 10 consecutive DH cases examined by DIF and by serum studies for AEmA and antibodies to tTG, point to frequencies of 90% DIF positive and 70% AEmA and tTG positive cases. The use of both DIF and serum tests for AEmA and tTG reveals DH cases not detected by DIF alone that respond to gluten-free diet. Findings on autoantibodies to tTG, an enzyme that metabolizes gliadin, points to a role of tTG in the immunopathology of gluten-sensitive enteropathy and helps to explain the need for a gluten-free diet in the management of DH cases.},

   abstract = {There have frequently been doubts as to the relevance of food allergy, in particular as far as the involvement of the intestinal tract is concerned. Several studies, however, have confirmed the existence of allergic reactions in the gut, with an estimated prevalence of about 1-2% in adults. Clinical symptoms are unspecific and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping and diarrhea. Intestinal mast cells, as well as intestinal eosinophils, have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of food-allergy-related enteropathy. In addition to classical IgE-dependent degranulation, further agonists have been demonstrated for mast cell activation, for example IL-4. The methods used to confirm the diagnosis of intestinal allergy are still insufficient. Until now, blinded oral challenge procedures with food antigens have been accepted as the 'gold standard' in diagnosing food allergy, although these tests have practical problems. Therefore, new test systems have been developed, such as endoscopic provocation tests, that may improve diagnostic procedures. Elimination diet still presents the main basis of therapy. Aspects to be focused on in the future are the role fo IgE-independent allergic mechanisms in intestinal allergy, the impact of cross-reactivity with other allergens and the relationship to other inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {In pathogenesis of celiac disease, the significance of prolamin peptide interactions with enterocytes is controversial. Changes in cellular metabolism induced by gliadin peptides, as well as uptake and presentation by enterocytes, are discussed. We analyzed peptide binding to enterocytic membranes as a potential key event. Binding capacities of brush border membranes isolated from small intestinal biopsies of untreated (n = 49) and treated celiac patients on a gluten-free diet (n = 30), as well as control subjects (n = 43), were measured with a dot blot chemiluminescence assay. Synthetic gliadin peptides comprising amino acid position 8-19 (G XIV) and 30-41 (G XI) of alpha-gliadins, a peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin (PT-GLI), and a synthetic zein peptide were used. Comparing treated celiac patients with controls, we observed significantly enhanced membrane-binding of PT-GLI [mean 122.4 densitometric units/microg (95% confidence interval 116.0-128.9) vs 108.9 (102.1-115.7)] and of zein peptide [50.2 (38.4-61.9) vs 28.8 (13.4-44.2)], but only slightly increased binding of the synthetic gliadin peptides G XIV [65.5 (60.6-70.5) vs 62.4 (56.3-68.5) and G XI [75.2 (69.8-80.6) vs 65.9 (55.2-76.5)]. Independent of patient group, membrane-binding capacities for celiac-active gliadin peptides exceeded those of the zein peptide. Thus, interaction of gliadin peptides with the apical enterocytic membrane was not found exclusively in celiac disease. Furthermore, increased binding capacities in treated celiac disease were not confined to celiac-active peptides. Quantitative differences in gliadin peptide binding as a primary characteristic in celiac disease might contribute to pathogenetic effects exerted on small intestinal epithelial cells.},

DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial. SETTING: Institutionalized patients in three gastroenterological rehabilitation clinics. PARTICIPANTS: 52 institutionalized patients with a faecal fat output > or = 14 g/day, operated on for malignant gastric disease a median of 198 days (interquartile range (IQR) 47-608) previously, and free from recurrence and/or metastasis. INTERVENTIONS: Nine sachets of pancreatic enzymes per day (each containing lipase 36,000, amylase 27,000, protease 2400 FIP (Federation International Pharmaceutique)) or identical-looking placebo were given for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Abdominal symptoms, energy intake, bowel habits and fat malassimilation. RESULTS: After treatment, patients on enzyme therapy felt better overall (P = 0.006), but no improvement of a specific symptom could be identified. During the intervention, the median kilojoule intake per kilogram body weight was 9% higher in the placebo group (170.8 (IQR 146.9-202.6)) than in the enzyme-treated group (157.0 (IQR 134.8-170.4)) (P = 0.03). Enzyme treatment did not result in a significant difference between the placebo and the enzyme-treated group regarding bowel habits or fat malassimilation. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of high-dose pancreatic enzymes supplementation on symptoms and steatorrhoea after total gastrectomy is marginal and does not justify its routine use.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Permanent changes in intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes have been observed in coeliac patients. The aim of this investigation was to study small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes by using flow cytometry and to evaluate its diagnostic value in coeliac disease. Three-colour flow cytometry analyses were performed on isolated epithelial cells of 117 intestinal biopsies obtained from 113 children (54 coeliac disease, 4 other enteropathies, 18 Helicobacter pylori associated gastritis and 37 normal controls). A multiple logistic regression model was developed to select the best intraepithelial lymphocytes subset predictor of coeliac disease. Coeliac patients had significant higher levels of T cell receptor gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes than control patients (p < 0.01), H. pylori patients (p < 0.01) and other enteropathies (p < 0.05). The density of CD3-/CD7+ intraepithelial lymphocytes, a intraepithelial lymphocyte subset poorly characterized by immunohistochemical methods, was significantly lower in coeliac patients than in the control group (p < 0.01). H. pylori group (p < 0.01) and other enteropathies (p < 0.01). Both changes remained altered independent of the coeliac patient's diet. The data were used on a logistic regression analysis in order to calculate sensitivity [94.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 83.7-98.6%], specificity (94.9%; 95% CI 84.9-98.7%) and likelihood ratio for a positive test 18.5 (95% CI 6.1-55.8) in the diagnosis of coeliac disease. CONCLUSION: Changes in T cell receptor gammadelta and CD3-/CD7+ intraepithelial lymphocytes subsets are permanently observed in paediatric coeliac disease. Their assessment, by three-colour flow cytometry on routine diagnostic biopsies, permits a better characterization of coeliac enteropathy and represents a valuable procedure to identify coeliac patients with different clinical presentations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of celiac disease has been on the rise in both Europe and the United States. Celiac disease patients are at high risk of undernutrition because of nutrient malabsorption. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate changes in body composition and energy metabolism in a group of patients with celiac disease before and after consumption of a gluten-free diet (GFD). DESIGN: Body composition (by anthropometry and isotopic dilution), resting metabolic rate (RMR), and substrate oxidation rates (by indirect calorimetry) were assessed in 39 adult celiac disease patients (16 men and 23 women) with a mean (+/-SD) age of 29. 9 +/- 7.6 y, weight of 58.3 +/- 6.6 kg, and percentage body fat of 20.1 +/- 6.7%, and in 63 (29 men and 34 women) age- and height-matched control subjects (age: 33.2 +/- 8.1 y; weight: 66.8 +/- 6.6 kg; and percentage body fat: 25.4 +/- 3.7%). Celiac disease patients were studied twice, at diagnosis and 1 y after treatment with a GFD. RESULTS: Before treatment, celiac disease patients had a lower body weight (P < 0.05) and a higher carbohydrate oxidation rate (P < 0.01) than did control subjects. Carbohydrate oxidation rates correlated positively with fecal lipid loss in untreated celiac disease patients (r = 0.80, P < 0.0001). After the GFD, percentage body fat was higher in celiac disease patients than in control subjects (P < 0.01), and lipid intakes tended to be higher than before treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study showed that the GFD treatment significantly increased body fat stores. Untreated patients preferentially utilized carbohydrates as a fuel substrate, probably as a consequence of both lipid malabsorption and a high carbohydrate intake, and lipid utilization increased with the restoration of the intestinal mucosa.},

Along with typical forms of the disease characterized by overt symptoms and signs of malabsorption, many cases are undiagnosed because they are subclinical, atypical or even symptomless. In adults, the disease may present with infertility; in particular celiac disease may be responsible of multiple abortions. These manifestations, whose pathogenesis is unknown, are not related to the severity of the disease; the gluten-free diet strongly ameliorates the fertility. In this paper we have focused the connection between abortion and celiac disease. A better knowledge of this relationship may lead to correctly diagnose and consequently to treat the cause of some cases of abortion, previously labelled as cases of unidentified origin.},

AIM: To evaluate the usefulness of IgG(1) antiendomysium and IgG antitissue transglutaminase tests for CD diagnosis in IgAD. METHODS: IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies (IgA- and IgG-AGA), IgA and IgG(1) antiendomysium antibodies (IgA- and IgG(1)-EMA), and IgA and IgG antitissue transglutaminase (IgA- and IgG-anti-tTG) were assayed in: (a) 20 untreated IgAD/CD patients; (b) 34 IgAD/CD patients on a strict gluten free diet (GFD); (c) 10 IgAD/CD patients not on a strict GFD; (d) 11 untreated CD patients without IgAD; (e) 10 healthy IgAD patients; and (f) 25 healthy controls. RESULTS: In all untreated IgAD/CD patients, IgG(1)-EMA, IgG-anti-tTG, and IgG-AGA were positive whereas IgA antibodies against these antigens were negative. IgAD/CD patients on a strict GFD did not produce IgG-AGA or IgG(1)-EMA but four of 34 produced IgG anti-tTG. IgAD/CD subjects not on a strict GFD produced IgG-AGA whereas 5/10 and 4/10 were IgG(1)- EMA and IgG-anti-tTG negative, respectively. Untreated CD patients without IgAD were AGA (IgA and IgG), EMA (IgA and IgG(1)), and anti-tTG (IgA and IgG) positive. Healthy controls were AGA and EMA negative whereas two of 10 apparently healthy IgAD subjects and one of 25 healthy negative control were IgG-anti-tTG positive. CONCLUSIONS: Both IgG(1)-EMA and IgG-anti-tTG tests appear to be useful for identification of IgAD/CD patients whereas they are less satisfactory for monitoring dietary compliance in these subjects. In addition, our findings seem to suggest that IgG-EMA autoantibodies produced by coeliac patients are mainly of the IgG(1) subtype.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adult refractory sprue is a poorly defined disorder. We did a multicentre national study of patients with refractory sprue to characterise their clinical and pathological profile and outcome, and to assess the frequency and prognostic significance of phenotypic and molecular abnormalities in the intraepithelial T-cell population. METHODS: Patients with severe symptomatic villous atrophy mimicking coeliac disease but refractory to a strict gluten-free diet, and with no initial evidence of overt lymphoma, were diagnosed at gastrointestinal referral centres between 1974 and 1998. Fixed and/or frozen duodenojejunal biopsy samples were reanalysed and immunostained with CD3 and CD8 monoclonal antibodies to find out the phenotype of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). TCRgamma gene rearrangements were assessed on frozen biopsy samples by multiplex fluorescent PCR. FINDINGS: There were 21 patients with refractory sprue and 20 controls with coeliacs disease. 16 (84%) of 19 assessed patients had an aberrant intraepithelial lymphoid intestinal population expressing intracytoplasmic CD3 but not surface CD8. Clonal intestinal TCRgamma gene rearrangements were found in 13 (76%) of 17 patients assessed; four (out of 12 assessed) had clonal dissemination to the blood. The 16 patients with an aberrant phenotype all had uncontrolled malabsorption; three subsequently developed overt T-cell lymphoma, and eight died. The three (16%) patients without aberrant clonal IEL made a complete clinical and histological recovery with steroid therapy plus a gluten-free diet. INTERPRETATION: An immunophenotypically aberrant clonal intraepithelial T-cell population (similar to that of most cases of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma) can be found in up to 75% of patients with refractory coeliac sprue; its identification by simple diagnostic techniques represents a marker of poor outcome (including occurrence of overt T-cell lymphoma). We suggest that refractory sprue associated with an aberrant clonal IEL may be the missing link between coeliac disease and T-cell lymphoma and may be classified as cryptic enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.},

   abstract = {HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 31-year-old woman was admitted because of heptomegaly and abnormal liver functions. For years she had suffered from diarrhoea but its cause had never been elucidated. She was underweight and had mild ankle edema. The liver margin was palpable at 20 cm below the midcostal margin, but the abdominal examination was otherwise unremarkable. INVESTIGATIONS: Sonography revealed a very large fatty liver. Biopsy showed fatty infiltration of nearly all the hepatocytes, without significant inflammation and fibrosis. Small-intestinal biopsy showed the typical histology of coeliac disease. Laboratory tests indicated abnormal liver function with increased transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, GPT and LDH, but no sign of inflammatory aetiology. These findings suggested that the liver changes were due to the coeliac disease. TREATMENT AND COURSE: After the patient had been put on a gluten-free diet the diarrhoea stopped and she started to gain weight. The liver function tests briefly became worse, but over the following 6 weeks normalized completely. The patient gained 5 kg in the subsequent 18 months and the liver became sonographically normal. The small-intestinal biopsy now showed merely discrete villar atrophy. CONCLUSION: Coeliac disease should be considered in any case of fatty liver of unknown cause. Strict gluten-free dietary treatment of the underlying cause can quickly lead to complete regression of the hepatic changes.},

DESIGN: In the retrospective study, data collected on 690 upper endoscopies in coeliac patients, carried out between 1990 and 1997, were analysed. In the prospective study 263 consecutive adult patients were studied for follow-up of coeliac disease or suspected malabsorption/coeliac disease. Tests included routine blood tests; serum dosage of EMA; IgG anti-HP and, in a subgroup of participants, anti-CagA antibodies; upper endoscopy with multiple gastric and duodenal biopsies; histological examination of gastric and duodenal specimens with staining providing evidence for the presence of HP. SETTING: A centre for the treatment of malabsorptive diseases, University Federico II of Naples, Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with coeliac disease at the time of diagnosis and follow-up. RESULTS: In the retrospective study, peptic disease had a prevalence of 0.72% in the endoscopy series of coeliac patients examined. In the prospective study, the prevalence of HP infection was significantly lower in untreated coeliac patients when compared with treated patients and controls (20.7%, 32.4% and 55.3%, respectively; P = 0.001, chi2). The prevalence of HP was related to both gender and age. It was found more frequently in men and the frequency increased with age in all groups. The study confirmed the low prevalence of peptic disease in coeliac patients compared with controls (0.9% vs 3.8%, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with coeliac disease show a significantly lower prevalence of HP infection and peptic disease when compared to controls. Gluten free diet-induced changes in the intestinal environment and/or the host immuno-response may explain the increased HP prevalence in treated coeliac patients.},

DESIGN: Statistical analysis on coeliac patients on gluten-free diet who agreed to answer the questionnaire. SETTING: Children with coeliac disease on gluten-free diet followed by the Department of the Pediatric Division of the City Mayor Hospital, Chair of Paediatrics, Verona University. SUBJECT: 39 patients (15 male and 24 female) from 10 years old to 21 who chose to answer a questionnaire of 25 questions dealing with the psychological implications of coeliac disease and with the need of following a particular dietary regime, in the presence of a psychologist. The questionnaire was made up of 6 SIGNALLING questions, 15 EVALUATING questions, 4 FILTER questions. They also filled up an information sheet on the composition and social position of the family. RESULTS: Fathers were on average 45.5 years old, mothers 43. Only 2 parents had no educational qualifications. Father's professions were of various kinds, 22 mothers were housewives. Only 4 patients were only children, 22 had one brother or sister. 13 patients only out of 39 claimed not to have been admonished by their parents, though, showed a conflictual relationship with food. The awareness of their difference from friends was: a) lack in children 10 to 12, b) uneasiness in adolescents 13 to 17, c) maturation and consensus in older patients. A significant number of patients feel different from their friends and these patients showed a latent envy to friends on free diet. A sense of latent envy towards the condition of independence was exhibited by patients who felt different from friends. CONCLUSIONS: The acceptance of a gluten-free diet is problematic for the majority of coeliac children and adolescents, particularly for those between 12 and 17. In this group the search of an individual personality is disturbed. Difficulties connected with gluten-free diet seem to be absent in the family environment, whereas difficulties emerge significantly when relating with friends. The number of cases of our study was limited but we consider these conclusions quite significant. DESCRIPTORS: Gluten-free diet, adolescents and children, relationship with parents, relationship with friends.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of an immune reaction towards cytoskeleton structures such as actin filaments in CD. METHODS: Eighty three antiendomysial antibody positive CD patients (52 children and 31 adults) were studied at our outpatient clinics from 1996 to 1998 using indirect immunofluorescence, ELISA, and western blotting for antiactin (AAA) and antitissue transglutaminase (TGA) antibodies before and after a gluten free diet (GFD). Sixteen patients with smooth muscle antibody positive autoimmune hepatitis, 21 with inflammatory bowel diseases, seven with small bowel bacterial overgrowth, and 60 healthy subjects were studied as controls. RESULTS: Fifty nine of 83 CD patients (28/31 adults (90.3%); 31/52 children (59.6%)) were positive for IgA and/or IgG AAA. Seventy seven (92.7%) were positive for IgA TGA. IgA AAA were strongly correlated with more severe degrees of intestinal villous atrophy (p<0.0001; relative risk 86.17). After a GFD, AAA became undetectable within five months. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from the immune reaction against the extracellular matrix, we have described an immune reaction against the cytoskeleton in both children and adults with CD. As AAA are strongly associated with more severe degrees of villous atrophy, they may represent a useful serological marker of severe intestinal atrophy in CD.},

   abstract = {The clinical spectrum of celiac disease has widened over the past decades. The condition is no longer a severe malabsorption syndrome. Instead, a typical celiac disease patient today has merely mild abdominal symptoms. Malabsorption can be subclinical or absent, and there is usually only moderate, if any, loss of weight. Simultaneously, the current prevalence has increased from 1:1,000 to 1:300 inhabitants, or even higher. Clinically silent celiac disease cases are being detected in increasing numbers since the introduction and widespread use of serologic screening tests. Symptoms of celiac disease can appear outside the intestine, a typical example being dermatitis herpetiformis. Gluten intolerance is no longer limited to overt villous atrophy. Inflammation without villous damage may be observed in genetically susceptible individuals. The term latent celiac disease is applied in situations where the patient has normal villous architecture while on a gluten-containing diet, but later develops small bowel villous atrophy compatible with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Untreated celiac disease can lead to serious behavioral disorders. We describe three adult patients with undiagnosed or untreated celiac disease without particular intestinal signs, causing persistent depressive symptoms in three of the parents of our pediatric patients. In two of the three cases, the pediatrician suspected the diagnosis when taking the family history of the children. In fact, a diagnosis of celiac disease was made during childhood, when they had intestinal symptoms, but the gluten-free diet was spontaneously interrupted during the teenage period because of the disappearance of the typical intestinal signs. In the third case the mother was tested for antiendomysium antibodies (EmA), as she had a diagnosed celiac child. In all three patients, the depressive symptoms improved quickly with a gluten-free diet. In conclusion, celiac disease should be taken into consideration in the presence of behavioral and depressive disorders, particularly if they are not responsive to the usual antidepressive therapy.},

   abstract = {To date, tests of small intestinal passive permeability have involved the ingestion of test molecules whose permeation is assessed indirectly by measuring their urinary recovery. Excretion ratios of marker molecules (eg, lactulose-to-mannitol excretion ratio, LMER) are useful clinically. Measurement of permeability markers in serum would improve the convenience of the tests. Our aim was to assess small intestinal permeability in celiac patients using serum lactulose and mannitol levels with calculation of lactulose to mannitol serum ratios (LMSR) and to compare the results with the standard methods using urinary recoveries. Twenty-four newly diagnosed celiacs and 10 control subjects were studied; 10 celiacs were restudied while established on a gluten-free diet. Test subjects and patients ingested 10 g lactulose and 2.5 g mannitol in 50 ml water. In 10 untreated celiacs and the controls, blood was taken from 0 to 120 min and all urine was collected for 6 hr. The remaining 14 untreated and the 10 treated celiacs had a single serum sample taken 60 min after ingestion of the test solution. At 1 hr after ingestion, the mean mannitol level in normals (0.156 mmol/liter) was significantly higher than in untreated celiacs (0.06 mmol/liter). The 1-hr mean serum lactulose level in normals (0.125 micromol/liter) was significantly lower than in untreated celiacs (0.56 micromol/liter). The median 1-hr LMSR in untreated celiacs was 0.42 compared with 0.039 in normals and 0.08 in treated celiacs. There was a significant correlation between LMSR and LMER. Permeability testing using serum measurements of lactulose and mannitol gave comparable results in celiac patients to the tests using urinary recovery of the permeability markers and may prove to be more convenient, especially in pediatric patients.},

When possible, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be discontinued. If steatorrhea is documented, a low-fat diet may be helpful. In the presence of bile salt malabsorption, binding resins such as cholestyramine might be useful. Nonspecific diarrheal agents such as loperamide hydrochloride, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine, deodorized tincture of opium, or codeine might prove effective in some patients. Antibacterial agents such as bismuth subsalicylate (8 chewable 262-mg tablets daily) have been effective in symptom control. Metronidazole and erythromycin achieve response rates of 60%. Sulfasalazine, at the usual dose of 2 to 4 g daily, used in collagenous-lymphocytic colitis, demonstrated cessation of diarrhea in 1 to 2 weeks for 50% of patients. Other 5-aminosalicylic (5-ASA) compounds are preferred for patients with a history of sulfa allergy, and those who experience adverse reactions to sulfasalazine. Adrenocorticoid medication is reserved for patients whose conventional treatment with sulfasalazine or 5-ASA has failed. Resolution of diarrhea has been documented in 80% to 90% of patients within 1 week of treatment, however, in most patients, long-term therapy is required. Surgical management is reserved for those patients with disease refractory to medical therapy. Colectomy with ileostomy resulted in clinical and histologic resolution in small case series. If there is no abatement of symptoms, rule out other etiologies of diarrhea such as thyroid dysfunction, celiac disease, or bacterial overgrowth.},

STUDY DESIGN: One hundred thirty-seven children with DS were followed up longitudinally. CD screening was offered in 1994, 1996, and 1999 by determination of serum immunoglobulin A-anti-endomysium antibodies (AEA). The HLA-DQA1*0501/DQB1*02 allelic combination known to be strongly positively associated with CD was typed. All IgA-AEA-positive children were given the opportunity to undergo a small bowel biopsy: if villous atrophy was found, the diagnosis of CD was established. RESULTS: CD was diagnosed in 11 (8%) children: 8 in 1994 and 3 in 1996. All of them carried the HLA-DQ alleles associated with CD. The presence of symptoms was not useful in discriminating which children could have CD. CONCLUSIONS: Screening once in a lifetime is not enough to detect CD in patients with DS. We propose a new, accurate, and cost-sparing 2-step strategy for screening, based on selection of the individuals with potential CD by HLA-DQ typing and on longitudinal serologic CD screening in this selected group.},

AIMS: To compare the cellular expression of mRNA transcripts for the two major matrix degrading proteases, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-3, their inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, and procollagen I in the intestinal mucosa of patients with untreated and treated CD and normal controls. PATIENTS/METHODS: Duodenal biopsy specimens from ten untreated CD patients, from six of these after a gluten free diet, and from ten control patients were hybridised with 35S-labelled RNA probes. The number of positive cells in the subepithelial region and lamina propria were counted microscopically. RESULTS: The numbers of cells positive for MMP-1 (p<0.005), MMP-3 (p<0.01), and TIMP-1 (p<0.05) mRNA were higher in the subepithelial region of CD mucosa than in that from controls. In the lamina propria, only cells positive for MMP-1 mRNA were increased in CD patients compared with controls (p<0.01). MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA expression returned to normal in CD patients after treatment with a gluten free diet (p<0.05), while TIMP-1 mRNA expression remained elevated. The number of procollagen I mRNA expressing cells did not change. Expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA was mainly localised to subepithelial fibroblasts and macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased ratio of collagen I and TIMP-1 mRNA expressing cells to MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA expressing cells in untreated CD suggests a shift towards ECM degradation. ECM degradation by activated subepithelial fibroblasts and macrophages may be an important mechanism driving mucosal transformation in CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Assessment of body composition is of primary importance in the management of celiac adolescents. We aimed to evaluate body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and bioelectrical impedance in celiac adolescents on a gluten-free diet to investigate whether impedance may provide an alternative method to assess nutritional status in these patients. METHODS: We studied body composition in 43 adolescents affected by celiac disease on a gluten-free diet for > or = 1 yr and 30 healthy subjects. Fat, fat-free, and bone masses were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Fat and fat-free masses were also assessed by bioelectrical impedance. All anthropometric measurements were performed according to standard procedures. RESULTS: All patients had a significantly lower body weight, height, fat-free mass, bone mineral density (p < 0.001), and body mass index (p < 0.01) compared with controls. In contrast, parameters predicting fat compartment (sum of skinfolds and fat mass) did not differ from those of controls. No significant difference was found between patients strictly adherent to a gluten-free diet and patients partially compliant. Compared with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements, bioelectrical impedance showed a high accuracy to estimate fat-free mass (R2 = 0.97) and limited accuracy for fat mass (R2 = 0.75). Furthermore, impedance was more reliable for estimating hydration of soft tissue underlying the fat-free mass changes. CONCLUSIONS: In adolescents with celiac disease, after a mean of 1 yr of gluten-free diet all the parameters assessing body compartments, except fat mass, were affected, compared with healthy controls. Bioelectrical impedance holds promise for routine assessment of body composition changes in celiac adolescents on a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is characterized by life-long gluten intolerance. Clinical features of patients with celiac disease are variable. In the present study, clinical, laboratory and histologic features of 104 patients with celiac disease were evaluated. METHODS: Intestinal biopsy and serum antigliadin and anti-endomysium antibodies were used for the diagnosis of patients. Mucosal lesions were classified according to the criteria of Marsh. Antigliadin antibodies were measured with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-endomysium antibodies were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence with the use of a section of monkey esophagus. Routine hematological and biochemical analyses and measurement of immunoglobulin levels were undertaken. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) patient age was 5.9 +/- 4.1 years (range 10 months-16 years) and the most common symptom was diarrhea (81.7%) followed by abdominal distention, weight loss, anorexia and failure to thrive. Abdominal distention (60.6%), short stature (45.2%) and iron-deficiency anemia were the most common findings. High serum alanine aminotransferase levels were found in 38.3% of patients and these levels became normal after adoption of a gluten-free diet in all but two patients with cirrhosis. Immunoglobulin A, IgG antigliadin antibodies and IgA anti-endomysium antibodies were found in 76, 94 and 90% of patients, respectively. Biopsy of the small intestine revealed that 95, two and seven patients had type 3, type 2, and type 1 lesions, respectively, according to the Marsh classification. There was no statistically significant difference between patients and control groups with regard to antinuclear antibody, antismooth muscle antibody, anti-DNA and anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG and IgM). CONCLUSIONS: Although classical celiac disease was seen in most patients in the present study, clinical variability of the condition should be kept in mind. In particular, patients with uncommon findings, such as short stature, cryptogenic liver disease and iron-deficiency anemia, should also be screened for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Several studies have demonstrated that chronic exposure to gluten may damage the structure and function of the gastric mucosa in gluten-sensitive patients. However, until now, these abnormalities have been incompletely studied. Our purpose in the present study was to characterize, in a prospective controlled study, the endoscopic and histological appearance of the gastric mucosa in a large cohort of patients with celiac disease with and without Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. METHODS: We evaluated biopsy specimens taken from the gastric body and antrum of 218 individuals who underwent upper endoscopy for small bowel biopsy. One hundred-four patients had celiac disease (80 of them at the time of diagnosis-untreated). In 114 subjects celiac disease was excluded. RESULTS: Endoscopic findings did not show a difference between the groups. The prevalence of cases with normal gastric mucosa, chronic superficial gastritis, and atrophic gastritis was similar in patients and controls. Similarly, presence of metaplasia, inflammatory activity, and lymphoid follicles and aggregates did not show differences between the groups. Histological or serological evidence of H. pylori infection was detected in 86% of patients (82% of untreated celiacs and 95% of those on those taking treatment). The infection was highly prevalent in patients (89%) and controls (97%) diagnosed with chronic gastritis. Untreated patients had a significant greater IEL count in the antrum and corpus than controls (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.001, respectively). A global analysis of the data on intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) counts in the different populations suggest that the inflammatory state may represent the cumulative effect of H. pylori infection and gluten sensitivity. Only three patients had IEL infiltration compatible with diagnosis of lymphocytic gastritis (count >25%) and three other patients had borderline counts. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, celiac disease patients presented a similar prevalence of gastric mucosal abnormalities compared with the control population. Evidence of H. pylori infection was very high compared with the prevalence in the general Argentine population. As a particular observation in our celiac population, the disease was rarely associated with lymphocytic gastritis. We suggest that the chronic inflammatory state evidenced by a gastric mucosal lymphocyte infiltration may be secondary to the combination of H. pylori infection and chronic gluten ingestion in gluten-sensitive subjects.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of duodenal villous atrophy (VA) among patients undergoing routine upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and the value of endoscopic markers for VA in selecting patients for duodenal biopsy. METHODS: One hundred and fifty adult patients with upper GI symptoms or iron-deficiency anemia had inspection and biopsy of the second part of the duodenum during endoscopy. Endoscopic markers for VA sought were mosaic or nodular mucosa, scalloping of duodenal folds, and reduction in number or absence of duodenal folds. RESULTS: Endoscopic markers were seen in seven patients (5%): scalloped folds with mosaic pattern mucosa (three patients), scalloped folds, reduced in number with mosaic pattern mucosa (three patients), and nodular mucosa with reduction in fold numbers (one patient). All seven patients had partial, subtotal, or total VA. One of 143 patients with no endoscopic abnormality had patchy VA. The prevalence of VA was thus 1:19 (8 of 150). Endoscopic markers had a sensitivity of 87.5% (7 of 8), specificity of 100% (142 of 142), positive predictive value of 100% (7 of 7), and negative predictive value of 99% (142 of 143). Of the eight patients with VA, the indications for endoscopy were upper GI symptoms in seven patients (two with anemia) and anemia without GI symptoms in one. After 6 months of dietary gluten exclusion, improvement by at least one criterion was documented in all eight patients. CONCLUSIONS: Careful inspection of the duodenum during routine upper GI endoscopy allows accurate selection of patients for biopsy but may not detect patchy VA or milder enteropathy. Celiac disease should be considered as a cause of dyspeptic and reflux symptoms, as well as of iron-deficiency anemia.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although serum IgA-class endomysial antibody (EmA) has high sensitivity for villous atrophy (VA) in patients with untreated celiac disease, few studies have attempted to correlate EmA seroconversion with histological recovery after starting a gluten-free diet. We prospectively studied changes in EmA status and in duodenal histology of seropositive patients after dietary treatment. METHODS: Patients with VA and EmA had repeat EmA testing at 3, 6, and 12 months after starting gluten-free diet, plus assessment of dietary compliance by dietitians and follow-up duodenal biopsy at 12 months. VA before and after treatment was classified as partial (P), subtotal (ST), and total (T). RESULTS: Of 77 patients with newly diagnosed VA and without IgA deficiency, 62 (81%) had EmA: 46 of 57 (81%) with T or STVA and 16 of 20 (80%) with PVA. Of 53 initially EmA-positive patients who completed study criteria, EmA was undetectable in 31 patients (58%) after 3 months' diet, in 40 (75%) after 6 months, and in 46 (87%) after 12 months. However, only 21 patients (40%), all seronegative by 12 months, had complete villous recovery. Only three (33%) of 10 patients with persisting ST or TVA and two (9%) of 22 with PVA remained EmA positive. Four of the five patients with persisting EmA had poor dietary compliance. CONCLUSIONS: EmA is a poor predictor of persisting VA after patients have started gluten-free diet, although it may be of value in monitoring dietary compliance. Although there are no clear guidelines regarding the need for follow-up biopsy, EmA seroconversion cannot substitute. The apparent association between dietary compliance and seroconversion suggests that gluten intake may determine whether untreated celiac patients are EmA positive or negative for a given degree of small bowel damage.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although IgA endomysial antibody (EmA) is currently the serologic test of choice in selecting suspected coeliac patients for duodenal biopsies, false-negative cases have been reported and may be more common than previous studies suggest. We assessed the sensitivity of EmA for patients with biopsy-confirmed villous atrophy (VA). METHODS: We studied 89 patients without IgA deficiency for whom biopsy had not been primarily prompted by a positive EmA result. VA was graded as partial, subtotal, or total (PVA, STVA, TVA). Serum EmA was assayed with indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The sensitivity of EmA for VA was 78% (69 of 89) and was similar for PVA (79%) and ST/TVA (77%). Only 4 of the 20 EmA-negative patients had increased serum IgA-class antigliadin antibody levels as measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All seronegative patients who complied with dietary gluten exclusion responded clinically, with histologic improvement after 12 months in 8 (67%) of 12 patients who had follow-up biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: EmA-negative coeliac disease is common. Reliance on EmA testing to select patients for biopsy will result in significant underdiagnosis.},

   abstract = {Dermatitis herpetiformis is a gluten-sensitive disease with a symmetrically distributed blistering over extensor surfaces. The association with celiac disease is further supported by the high rate of immunoglobulin A autoantibodies to endomysium in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, which are highly specific and sensitive indicators of celiac disease. Therefore, we determined immunoglobulin A antibodies to tissue transglutaminase, the recently discovered endomysial autoantigen in celiac disease, in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and controls. Sera of 61 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, as characterized by granular immunoglobulin A deposits in the subepidermal basement membrane and known endomysial antibody titers (determined by indirect immunofluorescence) as well as 84 control sera of patients with dermal or intestinal diseases unrelated to dermatitis herpetiformis, were analyzed for circulating immunoglobulin A antibodies to tissue transglutaminase by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase titers in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis were significantly elevated above the controls. Furthermore, the immunoglobulin A anti-tTG titers showed a positive correlation with semiquantitative endomysial antibody data. Compared with endomysial antibodies, determination of immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase reached a specificity and sensitivity of 97.6% and 89.1%. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have elevated immunoglobulin A autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase, confirming its pathogenic relation with celiac disease and further supporting the usefulness of this novel assay for screening and therapy control.},

Celiac disease is diagnosed by the demonstration of an altered intestinal mucosa in a jejunal biopsy specimen (3). Celiac disease patients invariably have antibodies directed against gliadin and endomysium, a structural component of the extracellular matrix: both antibodies disappear under a gluten-free diet. Therefore, these antibodies are useful tools for diagnosis, and in the dietary control of coeliac disease (3-7). Serum IgA antibodies against endomysial antibodies (EMAs) are especially considered to be sensitive and highly specific markers for celiac disease (8)(9). Previously, EMAs were detected by indirect immunofluorescence on tissue slides of monkey esophagus or human umbilical cord (10-12).},

   abstract = {Both total subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (TVAGX) and serotonin(3) receptor blockade with tropisetron or ondansetron attenuate amino acid-imbalanced diet (Imb) anorexia. Total vagotomy is less effective than tropisetron in reducing Imb-induced anorexia and also blunts the tropisetron effect. With the use of electrocautery at the subdiaphragmatic level of the vagus, we severed the ventral and dorsal trunks as well as the hepatic, ventral gastric, dorsal gastric, celiac, and accessory celiac branches separately or in combination to determine which vagal branches or associated structures may be involved in these responses. Rats were prefed a low-protein diet. On the first experimental day, tropisetron or saline was given intraperitoneally 1 h before presentation of Imb. Cuts including the ventral branch, i.e., TVAGX, ventral vagotomy (above the hepatic branch), and hepatic + gastric vagotomies (but not hepatic branch cuts alone) caused the highest (P < 0.05) Imb intake on day 1 with or without tropisetron. The responses to tropisetron were not affected significantly. On days 2-8, groups having vagotomies that included the hepatic branch recovered faster than sham-treated animals. Because the hepatic and gastric branches together account for most of the vagal innervation to the proximal duodenum, this area may be important in the initial responses, whereas structures served by the hepatic branch alone apparently act in the later adaptation to Imb.},

METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography of low-molecular-weight peptides in the urine was performed over 6 months, before and after a gluten-free diet was instituted in children who clinically improved while consuming the diet. RESULTS: A significant decrease of peptide levels was observed in children consuming the gluten-free diet. Certain peptide peaks thought to be gluten related decreased the most after the patients began the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Because the peptides decrease in patients consuming a gluten-free diet, it is reasonable to conclude that such peptides have a mostly dietary origin.},

A role for nitric oxide in coeliac disease has been suggested because of increased expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase in the small intestine of patients with untreated coeliac disease. DESIGN: During small bowel endoscopy in 11 control subjects, 10 patients with untreated coeliac disease and seven patients with treated coeliac disease, gas was aspirated from different parts of the upper gastrointestinal tract and immediately analysed using a chemiluminescence technique. Luminal nitric oxide concentrations were also quantified in 13 control subjects who had undergone colonoscopy. RESULTS: Jejunal luminal nitric oxide concentrations were more than 20 times higher in patients with coeliac disease than in normal control subjects (mean 755 +/- 173 ppb, range 215-1690 ppb, vs. mean 31 +/- 9 ppb, range 1-83 ppb, P < 0.001). Jejunal luminal nitric oxide levels in patients with treated coeliac disease (mean 54 +/- 18 ppb, range 3-126 ppb) did not differ from those of control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that intraluminal jejunal nitric oxide concentrations are significantly increased in patients with untreated active coeliac disease.},

In our case the interval between the appearance of arthritis and the diagnosis of CD was 2 years. The boy was asymptomatic for bowel disease and his nutritional status was normal. The diagnosis of CD was established using anti-gliadin (AGA) and anti-endomysium (EMA) antibody tests and was confirmed by small bowel biopsy. The introduction of a gluten-free diet resulted in the persistent remission of arthritis. As the treatment of CD-associated arthritis is based on dietary therapy, physicians should be alert to the possibility of occult CD in any child with arthritis of unclear origin.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whereas many people with coeliac disease (CD) are asymptomatic when consuming a gluten-free diet (GFD), a proportion continues to experience symptoms. The reasons for this are unclear. METHODS: Thirty-nine adult members of The Coeliac Society of New South Wales, all of whom had persistent gastrointestinal symptoms despite adhering to a GFD, were evaluated. Dietary analysis indicated that 22 (56%) were consuming a GFD as defined by the WHO/FAO Codex Alimentarius (Codex-GFD), in which foods containing up to 0.3% of protein from gluten-containing grains can be labelled as 'gluten free'. The remaining 17 were following a no detectable gluten diet (NDG)-GFD, as defined by Food Standards Australia. All subjects were required to follow a NDG-GFD during the study. Those in whom symptoms persisted after changing from a Codex-GFD and those who entered the study already on a NDG-GFD began an elimination diet followed by open and double-blind challenges to identify specific non-gluten food or food chemical intolerances. RESULTS: Of 22 patients who switched to a NDG-GFD symptoms resolved in 5 (23%) and were reduced in 10 others (45%). Thirty-one subjects commenced the elimination diet. Symptomatic improvement was experienced in 24 (77%). Subsequent food or food chemical challenges resulted in a mean of five positive challenges per individual. Diarrhoea was the most commonly provoked symptom, followed by headache, nausea, and flatulence. Symptoms were especially provoked by amine, salicylate and soy. CONCLUSION: The consumption of trace amounts of gluten, traditionally allowed in a Codex-GFD, may be responsible for the continuing symptoms seen in some patients with CD. Further investigation for non-gluten food intolerances should follow if symptoms persist after adherence to a NDG-GFD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Adult celiac disease is a genetically determined condition resulting from intolerance to gluten. This familial disease is associated with HLA B8 DR3 and is characterized by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte reaction in the digestive wall leading to a maladsorption syndrome. Adult celiac disease would be an expression of a silent disease already present in childhood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in 19 patients. Diagnosis was established in a department of internal medicine in adulthood. We analyzed histological findings and the clinical history and course. RESULTS: The age curve at diagnosis peaked at 22 years and 67 years. Female sex predominated. Average delay to diagnosis was 3.1 years. The patients were admitted for reasons other than digestive disorders in 17 out of 19 cases. Careful history taking did however disclose subtle digestive signs. The principal manifestations were hematological disorders such as chronic anemia, abnormal liver function tests, and poor control of associated diseases. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was the main associated disease (4/19). Patients with prolonged nutritional deficiencies experienced serious situations. CONCLUSION: Adult celiac disease is a clinical variant suggesting the presence of other non-digestive disorders. Specific antibodies should be assayed in patients with even minimal signs of deficiency in order to identify associated diseases. The principal cause of mortality is digestive T-cell lymphoma. A gluten-free diet is essential to control the course of this chronic disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac sprue is associated with specific HLA-DQ genes (mainly DQ2). Because there are epidemiological and histopathological similarities between celiac sprue and microscopic colitis, we hypothesized that these syndrome may share an HLA genetic predisposition and pathogenesis. METHODS: The HLA-DQ genes of 25 patients with celiac sprue, 53 patients with the microscopic colitis syndrome, and 429 normal controls were typed and compared. Serum was analyzed for antigliadin and antiendomysial antibodies. Small intestinal biopsies were analyzed for signs of histopathology. RESULTS: HLA-DQ2 or DQ1,3 (the latter as DQ1,7,DQ1,8, or DQ1,9) were seen more frequently in both patient groups relative to controls. In patients with the microscopic colitis syndrome, serological tests for celiac sprue were weakly positive in 17%; mild inflammation of the small intestine without villous atrophy was present in 43%, and inflammation plus partial or subtotal villous atrophy was present in 27%. CONCLUSIONS: A shared set of predisposing HLA-DQ genes account for the epidemiological overlap of celiac sprue and microscopic colitis. Mild to moderate mononuclear cell inflammation of the small intestine, often accompanied by partial or subtotal villous atrophy, is frequent in patients with the microscopic colitis syndrome. Although further studies will be necessary to determine if this enteropathy is induced by dietary gluten, we speculate that the small intestinal but not colonic histopathology in patients with microscopic colitis is caused by immunological gluten sensitivity.},

Sera from 30 confirmed CD patients (13 boys, 17 girls), 1-24 years old, were examined for antibodies using ELISA (AGA) and Immunofluorescence (EmA, ARA) at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following institution of gluten-free diet and also at 3 and 6 months after challenge with gluten. One month following the exclusion of gluten from the diet, most antibodies are still positive. Twenty-three to 43% of antibodies remained positive by the end of the third month. At 6 and 9 months, 17% and 10% were positive, respectively. At 12 months no positive antibodies were detected. After gluten challenge, positive IgA-AGA and IgA-EmA titers were already demonstrated at 3 months (90% and 86%, respectively), while Ig-ARA titers showed a slow increase. Finally IgG-AGA responded with a slow decrease of titers to gluten-free diet levels and a fast increase upon provocation. The morphology of the intestine at diagnosis and during the periods of gluten-free diet and gluten challenge corresponds with the antibody titers. On the basis of these results, immunological markers may be applied to follow-up CD patients. IgA-AGA and IgA-EMA appear to be the most sensitive to dietary changes in gluten and correlate best with intestinal mucosal morphology.},

The possible influence of somatostatin, which inhibits gallbladder motility, however, has never been evaluated. In this study gallbladder emptying and cholecystokinin and somatostatin plasma levels were evaluated in response to a fatty meal in patients with celiac disease at diagnosis and after long-term gluten-free diet and in controls. METHODS: Gallbladder volume and plasma levels of cholecystokinin and somatostatin were measured by ultrasonography and radioimmunoassay, respectively, at 0 time and 30, 60, 75, and 90 min after an oral fatty meal (227 kcal, 45% fat) in 10 celiac patients at diagnosis and after 18 months of successful gluten-free diet and in 10 healthy subjects. The pattern of gallbladder emptying was evaluated by mixed factorial analysis of variance and the curve fitting by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients at diagnosis had significantly greater fasting gallbladder volume and higher somatostatin plasma levels than controls (25.7 +/- SD 9.7 ml vs 16.8 +/- 7.0 ml, p = 0.021 and 9.3 +/- 4.6 vs 4.8 +/- 3.4 pmol/L, p = 0.023, respectively), significantly lower fatty meal-induced gallbladder ejection fraction (55 +/- 11.2% vs 76 +/- 7.2%, p = 0.005), and cholecystokinin peak and smaller area under the cholecystokinin secretion curve (3.1 +/- 2.3 pmol/L vs 10.5 +/- 6.9 pmol/L, p = 0.028 and 157 +/- 142 pmol/L/90 min vs 453 +/- 229 pmol/L/90 min, p = 0.028, respectively). The two groups had a similar emptying pattern (p = 0.8913) expressed by a significant quadratic term of the emptying function (p = 0.0001). The mean overall emptying volume was significantly greater in patients than in controls (p = 0.0007). Gluten-free diet normalized these findings. CONCLUSIONS: In patients at diagnosis, elevated somatostatin levels were associated with increased gallbladder fasting volume, whereas decreased cholecystokinin secretion was responsible for the reduced gallbladder emptying. Gluten-free diet reversed these abnormalities.},

The authors describe the clinical condition persisting for seven years, where hypoparathyroidism was associated with coeliac disease which did not respond to dietary measures.

The main problem is the patient's tendency to respond by tachyphylaxis to oral vitamin D administration. The only effective therapeutic procedure apart from those listed is so far parenteral administration of vitamin D3, calcitrol.},

Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and islet cell antibodies (ICAs) - especially the tyrosine phosphatase-like protein IA-2 antibodies - are considered to be serological markers of DM-I future development. The aim of this study is to investigate the presence of autoantibodies (GAD, IA-2) in individuals with CD, on a gluten-free diet, who have normal intestinal morphology. Thirty patients with CD (4-22, mean 15 years), 30 newly diagnosed diabetic children (2.5-16, mean 10 years) and 30 healthy subjects (7-35, mean 18 years) were investigated. Serum GAD and IA-2 autoantibodies were assessed by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method in all patients and controls. Seven CD patients (23%), 28 diabetic children (93%) and none in the control group had positive GAD and IA-2 antibodies. The FPIR was normal in CD patients (>/=46 mU/l). CONCLUSIONS: GAD and IA-2 antibodies are detected in 23% of patients with CD. These patients may be at risk to develop DM-I. Regular follow-up and determination of FPIR for the early diagnosis of the prediabetic phase in patients with CD having circulating autoantibodies is recommended.},

ANIMALS: 44 dogs of a 6-generation family of Irish Setters with GSE and 7 healthy Irish Setters. PROCEDURE: Phenotype of each dog was determined after oral administration of gluten in the weaning diet, using morphometric evaluation of jejunal biopsies (all generations) and measurement of small intestinal permeability by use of a lactulose-rhamnose permeation test (generations 1, 2, and 3). Overall probability for each of 4 genetic models of inheritance (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, sex-linked recessive, and sex-linked dominant) accounting for segregation of partial villus atrophy within the entire family was calculated. RESULTS: The autosomal recessive model was most tenable and was 56,250 times more likely to account for segregation of partial villus atrophy than the autosomal dominant model, assuming disease prevalence of 0.8%. Both sex-linked models were untenable. These conclusions were robust to the error attached to estimation of disease prevalence. High intestinal permeability without morphometric jejunal abnormalities in 4 of 20 dogs in the 3 youngest generations suggested heterogeneity of lesions associated with GSE. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic transmission of GSE is under the control of a single major autosomal recessive locus.},

   abstract = {AIM: In recent years, the high frequency of atypical cases of celiac disease (CD) and of forms of this disease with minor symptoms has prompted the search for analytical markers that may support indications for intestinal biopsy. The commonest tests are those for serum class IgG and IgA antigliadin antibodies (IgG-AGA, IgA-AGA) and IgA antiendomysial antibodies (IgA-EmA). METHODS: We report our 10 year experience of studying AGA in 1,075 serum samples from patients with CD and IgA-EmA in 534 samples. The serological markers were compared with 152 intestinal biopsies performed simultaneously with the other tests. RESULTS: In patients with severe intestinal atrophy the sensitivity of IgA-AGA (91%) and IgA-EmA (94%) was high. IgA-EmA and the latter showed the highest positive (88%) and negative (97%) predictive values. In all patients, IgA-EmA positivity coincided with alterations in the biopsy. Determination of IgA-EmA was also the most efficient marker for monitoring the gluten free diet phase. However, in patients in whom minimal histological changes were found in the intestinal mucosa, none of the markers was sufficiently accurate. RESULTS: IgA- EmA antibodies are the most accurate serological marker of CD. In view of these results and the estimated prevalence of the disease, protocols for the use of serological markers are proposed for the differential diagnosis of malabsorption symptoms, for use in patients at low and high risk of CD and for the followup of those with a diagnosis of CD.},

METHODS: The study includes 26 patients (11 boys and 15 girls) with typical celiac disease who were younger than 2.5 at diagnosis and were followed by means of a growth longitudinal monitoring from the introduction of a gluten-free diet (mean age, 1.7 +/- 0.5 years) until adulthood, over a median period of 15.3 years. Growth indicators used were: height, skeletal age, weight and BMI. RESULTS: At the time of admission, the patients had a general tendency to short stature, underweight and retarded skeletal maturation. They did not catch up completely in height and skeletal age after a dietary treatment period of 3 years. Most of them were seen to be slightly below average height for age during childhood and adolescence with skeletal maturity retardation, even if a fairly large interindividual variation of height profiles was evident. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the early treatment, the careful follow-up, and the good adhesion to the dietary rules of the patients under study, slight negative effects of the disease on growth were not avoided.},

Stored sera from 378 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were tested for immunoglobulin (Ig) A endomysium and tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Ten patients were positive for both antibodies (2.6%); five of these patients had had small bowel biopsies confirming celiac disease. A further 44 patients (11.6%) had raised titres of IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody but were negative for IgA endomysium antibody. The increased prevalence of celiac-related antibodies in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis suggests that the two conditions are associated, although the reason for the association remains unclear. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis should be considered to be at high risk for celiac disease. Although liver biochemistry does not improve when these patients are fed a gluten-free diet, the complications of untreated celiac disease warrant the identification and treatment of the condition in this population.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in girls with Turner syndrome (TS) in British Columbia. METHODS: Forty-five girls with TS were prospectively screened for CD using blinded testing with the current 'gold standard' - immunoglobulin A (IgA) endomysium antibody (EmA) and the novel IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG). Those with positive results were offered small bowel biopsies, and a gluten-free diet was recommended if CD was confirmed. RESULTS: One asymptomatic prepubertal East Indian girl was positive for EmA, had an elevated tTG concentration of 560 U/mL and histological evidence of CD. Seven girls were negative for EmA but had elevated tTG concentrations (175 to 250 U/mL); five were white, one was Asian and one was East Indian. Small bowel biopsies were performed on three girls, and the histologies were normal. The remaining four patients declined biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: One girl with TS was identified with CD from 45 screened, giving an overall biopsy-confirmed prevalence of 2.2%. This study confirms previous observations placing girls with TS at higher risk for CD and suggests a similar high prevalence in British Columbia.},

The most frequent conditions were polyneuropathy (seven patients) and spinocerebellar ataxia (three patients). Other conditions were lower motor neuron disease, myelopathy, epilepsy and encephalopathy. The patients used various degrees of gluten-free diet at the time of admission. It remains unclear whether there is a shared common pathogenetic mechanism or the neurological disorder is a complication to the coeliac disease. Both vitamin depletion and immunological mechanisms may cause neurological disorder. Neurological manifestations may occur before the gastrointestinal symptoms. With reference to our patients and available literature we discuss prevalence, clinical picture, pathogenesis, treatment and prognosis. Neurologists, gastroenterologists and general practitioners should be aware that coeliac disease can cause neurological diseases, especially polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia and encephalopathy.},

   abstract = {Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a blistering skin disease characterized by cutaneous deposits of IgA and an associated, most often asymptomatic, gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE). Gluten sensitive enteropathy is also seen in patients that do not have skin disease or cutaneous IgA deposits, but do have significant gastrointestinal (GI) complaints. Patients with DH and with GSE without skin disease have similar small bowel morphologic changes and HLA associations and both the skin disease and the GI symptoms can be controlled by a gluten free diet. It is not known what factors allow almost all patients with DH to continue to eat gluten and not develop symptomatic gastrointestinal disease. We have examined the expression of the Vbeta T-cell receptor (TCR) in the small bowel of patients with DH (n=11) and of patients with both symptomatic (n=10) and asymptomatic (n=7) GSE without skin disease to determine if differences in the pattern of TCR Vbeta expression are associated with differences in the clinical manifestations of these diseases. TCR Vbeta expression was analyzed using RT-PCR from small bowel biopsies. Patients with DH and those with GSE without skin disease that were on a gluten free diet and asymptomatic were found to express 6.6 and 5.6 out of 20 Vbeta families respectively, with no single family preference. Examination of peripheral blood lymphocytes from these patients did not reveal any restriction of TCR Vbeta family expression. In contrast, patients with symptomatic GSE expressed 12.6 Vbeta families (P< 0.05), with no consistent preferential expression of any single Vbeta family between patients. Patients with DH, who are continuing to ingest wheat, show a more restricted pattern of TCR Vbeta utilization, similar to that of treated patients with GSE without skin disease, and significantly different from GSE without skin disease patients eating gluten. These findings suggest that the restricted nature of the TCR Vbeta expression may play a role in the different clinical manifestations of dermatitis herpetiformis and isolated gluten sensitive enteropathy.},

   abstract = {Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and isolated gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) are gluten-sensitive diseases in which ingestion of dietary gluten results in the development of clinical disease. Patients with DH develop cutaneous IgA deposits and a severe skin disease, but rarely develop gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients with isolated GSE develop clinically significant gastrointestinal symptoms, but not skin disease or cutaneous IgA deposits. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which a mucosal immune response to the same dietary antigen can result in two distinct clinical phenotypes. T-cell lines were derived from activated T-cells in the small bowel mucosa of five patients with DH and 14 patients with isolated GSE and analyzed for T-cell markers and cytokine production in vitro. T-cell lines from DH and isolated GSE patients produced IFN-gamma after stimulation (mean: DH = 2,619 pg/ml; isolated GSE = 1,993 pg/ml; NS). T-cell lines from patients with DH, however, produced significantly more IL-4 than the T-cell lines from patients with isolated GSE (IL-4: DH = 2,010 pg/ml; isolated GSE = 235 pg/ml; P < 0.05). Analysis of intracytoplasmic cytokine production by the T-cell lines showed that T-cell lines from patients with DH were CD4+ predominant, with a greater proportion of CD4+/IL4+ cells than CD4+/IFN-gamma+ cells. In contrast, isolated GSE T-cell lines were predominantly CD8+, with an equal proportion of IL-4- and IFN-gamma-positive cells. These studies demonstrate that T cell lines from patients with DH produce significantly more IL-4 than T-cell lines from patients with isolated GSE, while producing similar amounts of IFN-gamma. This difference in cytokine pattern may play an important role in the different clinical manifestations of these two forms of gluten sensitivity.},

The article consists in a review of published reports, and an account of our experience of including oats in the gluten-free diets of adults. Oats were found to be safe and well tolerated by adults with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis, though the risk of wheat contamination of commercial oat products remains a cause of concern. Similar findings were reported from a study of adolescents, but no such studies have been made of small children. Thus, the inclusion of oats, known to be a fibre-rich, naturally gluten-free food, would broaden the range of foodstuffs tolerable to coeliac patients, though for safety reasons they should be used only by adults until more information is available.},

The initial step in the evaluation of these patients should include stool studies to confirm fat malabsorption. If fat malabsorption is confirmed, endoscopy with small-bowel biopsies and aspirates for bacterial culture usually follows. A normal endoscopic examination should lead to assessment of pancreatic function. In the setting of normal pancreatic function and the absence of bile acid deficiency, a barium radiograph of the small bowel should be made, looking for anatomical abnormalities. Celiac sprue is an intolerance to gluten caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors. It classically causes malabsorption. However, it is likely that many patients who exhibit only minor manifestations of the disease go unrecognized and untreated. A presumed diagnosis of celiac sprue is confirmed after a clinical and endoscopic response to a gluten-free diet. Serological markers are available with high degrees of sensitivity and specificity, but duodenal biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. A minority of patients are unresponsive to a gluten-free diet, and intestinal lymphoma should be suspected in these cases.},

   abstract = {The hypothesis that early exposure of the infant to cow's milk (or lack of breast-feeding) predisposes the child to type 1 diabetes dates from the 1980s. It has important implications, but remains controversial because the evidence on which it is based has been indirect and is open to criticism. Two meta-analyses of multiple studies in which diabetes prevalence was associated retrospectively with infant feeding revealed only a marginal increase in relative risk. Two recent prospective studies found no apparent association between development of antibodies to islet antigens and feeding patterns in high-risk infants with a first-degree type 1 diabetic relative. Studies reporting increased humoral and cellular immunity to cow's milk proteins in children with type 1 diabetes often lack appropriate controls and standardization and do not, in themselves, establish a causal connection to disease pathogenesis. A review of published data leads to the conclusion that increased immunity to cow's milk proteins is not disease-specific, but reflects genetic predisposition to increased immunity to dietary proteins in general, associated with the HLA haplotype A1-B8-DR3-DQ2 (A1*0501, B1*0201), which also predisposes to celiac disease and selective IgA deficiency. We suggest that the cow's milk hypothesis could be productively reframed around mucosal immune function in type 1 diabetes. Breast milk contains growth factors, cytokines, and other immunomodulatory agents that promote functional maturation of intestinal mucosal tissues. In the NOD mouse model, environmental cleanliness may influence diabetes incidence through mucosal mechanisms, and exposure of the mucosa to insulin (present in breast milk) induces regulatory T-cells and decreases diabetes incidence. The mucosa is a major immunoregulatory barrier, and cow's milk happens to be the first dietary protein it encounters. The basic question is whether impaired mucosal immune function predisposes to type 1 diabetes.},

DESIGN: Retrospective case-finding study using pathology, dietetic and clinical records, data from hospital activity analysis, general practice records and a Coeliac Society questionnaire. Incidence rates were calculated using the Registrar General's mid-year estimates. SETTING: Regional hospitals, South Glamorgan, Wales. PARTICIPANTS: All new cases of coeliac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Crude incidence rates (per quinquennia) for both children and adults. Age, sex, family history, symptoms at the time of diagnosis and time to diagnosis from symptom onset. RESULTS: In total, 137 cases of coeliac disease (27 children, 110 adults) and 19 cases of dermatitis herpetiformis were detected. In adults with coeliac disease, incidence rates have risen from 1.32 to 3.08 per 100,000 with a 3:1 female predominance. Almost 50% of adults were over fifty years old when diagnosed and 25% had no abdominal symptoms. In children, the disease incidence has remained stable but with a rising trend in mean age at diagnosis and higher likelihood of atypical symptoms in older children. There has been no change in the incidence of dermatitis herpetiformis. Only 8.3% of all patients had an affected first-degree relative. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to other reports of declining incidence, coeliac disease in children has remained constant in South Glamorgan, but has markedly increased in adults, particularly women. Presentation may be at any age, often with atypical symptoms, which may delay diagnosis.},

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a self-controlled, open-label, 6-month trial of a commercial oat breakfast cereal product. Primary outcome variables were small bowel histomorphology and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody titer. RESULTS: The 10 children who completed the study were 6.8 +/- 4.0 (mean +/- SD) years of age and 5 were male. Over 6.6 +/- 0.7 months, they consumed 24 grams of oat cereal per day, or 1.2 +/- 0.9 g/kg/d. Compared with start of study, at completion there was a significant decrease in biopsy score (P <.01), intra-epithelial lymphocyte count (P <.005), anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody titer (P <.01), and number of symptoms (P <.01). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that consumption of a commercially available oat cereal product for 6 months is safe for children with celiac disease beginning a gluten-free diet. Studies are needed to determine the long-term safety of including oat cereal in the gluten-free diet.},

The patient's history with permanent meteorism, recurrent episodes of watery diarrhea and dystrophy dates back to her early childhood. Multiple biopsies from the distal part of the duodenum showed a complete atrophy of villi with an extensive subepithelial layer of collagenous fibers. No antigliadin or antiendomysial antibodies could be detected. Under a strictly gluten-free diet, the patient's symptoms quickly improved. During the follow-up of one year, no recurrence of diarrhea and meteorism has been seen. The patient showed a continuous improvement of her general condition and nutritional state with a weight gain to 50 kg. Repeated control biopsies still revealed a pronounced villous atrophy. However, no subepithelial collagenous fibers were detectable. A diagnosis fitting to the patient's clinical symptoms of severe malabsorption, would be the rare "collagenous sprue", which is considered to be gluten-insensitive. However, the patient's good response to a gluten-free diet raises the possibility, that the collagenous layer represents a manifestation of more severe forms of common celiac disease. In this case, it would not be necessary to regard collagenous sprue as a distinct entity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of symptomatic coeliac disease in Norway is 1:675. Coeliac disease has previously been reported in presumably healthy people. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of latent coeliac disease in apparently healthy (i.e. asymptomatic) Norwegian individuals. METHODS: Blood donor sera were tested for gluten antibodies (IgA, IgG). Positive samples (IgA AGA > 0.35, IgG AGA > 0.90) were further tested for endomysium antibodies (IgA EMA). EMA positive individuals were offered gastroenterological investigation. RESULTS: Of 2096 sera, 83 fulfilled the criteria for EMA testing (M/F = 55/28). Eight individuals were EMA positive. On biopsy, seven out of eight had villous atrophy (six subtotal, one partial). None of the patients had significant symptoms. Biochemical data showed iron deficiency (two), hypocalcaemia (one), and low serum zinc (five). All patients were treated with a gluten-free diet and followed up. CONCLUSION: The study indicates a prevalence of 1:340 among asymptomatic and presumably healthy people. This is in keeping with studies from other countries. Lack of symptoms does not exclude secondary deficiency conditions.},

   abstract = {The function of jejunal intraepithelial gamma delta+ T cells is obscure, but they are commonly implicated as playing a role in inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. In coeliac disease (CoD), there are controversial reports as to gluten dependency of these cells. We have now studied the small bowel mucosal intraepithelial T cell densities, and the ratios of gamma delta+ to CD3+ T cells and gamma delta+ to alpha beta+ T cells during early disease development and on a gluten-free diet. Nine children initially excluded for CoD were followed up and rebiopsy after 0.8-4.5 years showed mucosal deterioration. Further, 21 biopsy specimens from newly diagnosed CoD patients were studied, together with 20 specimens taken from children on a gluten-free diet. During CoD development the density of gamma delta+ and alpha beta+ T cells as well as the ratios of gamma delta+ to CD3+ T cells and gamma delta+ to alpha beta+ T cells increased. In the latent stage of CoD when the small bowel mucosal architecture was still normal, two children had clearly normal densities of gamma delta+ (< 2.5 cells/100 epithelial cells) and alpha beta+ (< 25.0 cells/100 epithelial cells) T cells, and low ratios as well. In patients with newly diagnosed CoD the densities decreased significantly on a long-term gluten-free diet. We conclude that the density of intraepithelial gamma delta+ T cells as well as alphabeta+ T cells in CoD is gluten-dependent. CoD can develop in a child ingesting normal amounts of gluten and having normal jejunal mucosal morphology on biopsy and a normal density of gamma delta+ T cells.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) can be classified both clinically and biologically an autoimmune disease. A close relationship obtains between heat shock proteins (HSPs) and numerous autoimmune diseases. HSPs are overexpressed when protecting the host against environmental insult. We sought here to establish whether dietary gluten is such a stress stimulus in patients clinically suspected of CD, and whether the expression of HSP-65 associates with densities of intraepithelial gammadelta+ T cells and/or with expression of mucosal HLA-DR. METHODS: Seventy-eight children with clinical suspicion of CD underwent a jejunal biopsy. Monoclonal antibodies were used to stain jejunal epithelial HSP-65, intraepithelial lymphocytes and mucosal HLA-DR. Serum IgA-class endomysial autoantibodies (EMA) were measured by an indirect immunofluorescence method. CD susceptibility HLA DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201 alleles (HLA DQ2) were determined. RESULTS: Enhanced expression of epithelial cell mitochondrial HSP-65 was found in 80% (16/20) of coeliacs and in 24% (14/58) of children excluded for the disease, but in only 7% (2/28) of control subjects (p < 0.001, p = 0.049, respectively). Children with enhanced expression of HSP-65 had significantly higher gammadelta+ T cell densities than those with normal HSP-65 expression. A clear association between HSP-65 and serum IgA-class EMA were also ascertained in patients with normal jejunal mucosal morphology. HLA DQ2 positivity did not correlate with the HSP-65 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten might be an environmental insult not only in CD patients but also in some patients excluded for the disease on biopsy. Enhanced expression of epithelial cell stress proteins might be an indicator of such an insult.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease, or permanent gluten sensitive enteropathy, has emerged as a widespread health problem. It is considered an immunological disease, possibly of autoimmune type, albeit strictly dependent on the presence in the diet of wheat gluten and similar proteins from rye and barley. There are reasons to believe that the aetiology of coeliac disease is multifactorial, i.e. that other environmental exposures than the mere presence in the diet of gluten affect the disease process. Our studies have shown that prolonged breast-feeding, or perhaps even more important, ongoing breast-feeding during the period when gluten-containing foods are introduced into the diet, reduce the risk for coeliac disease. The amount of gluten consumed is also of importance in as much as larger amounts of gluten-containing foods increase the risk for coeliac disease, while it still is uncertain if the age for introducing gluten into the diet of infants is important. Thus, a challenging possibility, that need to be further explored, is if the coeliac enteropathy can be postponed, or possibly even prevented for the entire life span, by favourable dietary habits early in life.},

The aim of the present study was to analyse trends in the occurrence of symptomatic coeliac disease in Swedish children from 1973 to 1997, and to explore any temporal relationship to changes in infant dietary patterns. We established a population-based prospective incidence register of coeliac disease in 1991, and, in addition, retrospective data from 1973 were collected. A total of 2151 cases fulfilled the diagnostic criteria. Furthermore. We collected national data on a yearly basis on duration of breastfeeding, intake of gluten-containing cereals and recommendations on when and how to introduce gluten into the diet of infants. From 1985 to 1987 the annual incidence rate in children below 2 y of age increased fourfold to 200-240 cases per 100000 person years, followed from 1995 by a sharp decline to the previous level of 50-60 cases per 100000 person years. This epidemic pattern is quite unique for a chronic disease of immunological pathogenesis, suggesting that prevention could be possible. The ecological observations made in this study are compatible with the epidemic being the result, at least in part, of a change in and an interplay among three factors within the area of infant feeding, i.e. amount of gluten given, age at introduction of gluten, and whether breastfeeding was ongoing or not when gluten was introduced. Other factor(s) may also have contributed, and the search for these should be intensified.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recent research suggests that oats do not harm intestinal villi in adults with coeliac disease. As the immunological effects of oats have not been examined in detail, it was decided to compare the immunological responses of a gluten free diet including oats with those of a conventional gluten free diet. DESIGN: A randomised controlled intervention study over 6-12 months. SUBJECTS: Forty adults with newly diagnosed coeliac disease and 52 with coeliac disease in remission were examined. INTERVENTION: The effects of a gluten free diet including oats and a conventional gluten free diet were compared. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum levels of gliadin and reticulin antibodies as well as numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in intestinal mucosa were examined before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The rate of disappearance of gliadin and reticulin antibodies did not differ between the diet groups in patients with newly diagnosed coeliac disease. Oats also had no effect on gliadin or reticulin antibody levels in the patients with remission. The number of IELs decreased similarly regardless of the diet of newly diagnosed patients, and no increase in the number of IELs was found in the patients in remission with or without oats. CONCLUSIONS: These results strengthen the view that adult patients with coeliac disease can consume moderate amounts of oats without adverse immunological effects.},

We found significantly higher serum levels of soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1, 492.5 +/- 22.1 ng/ml) in patients with active celiac disease (including IgA-deficient patients) than in patients on a gluten-free diet (335.7 +/- 20.0 ng/ml) (P < 0.001) and healthy controls (207.4 +/- 11.2 ng/ml) (P < 0.001). The concentration of soluble E-selectin in sera from celiac patients (37.2 +/- 3.4 ng/ml) was also higher (P < 0.001) than in sera from healthy controls (15.5 +/- 0.7 ng/ml) but, in contrast to sICAM-1, it remained high in the patients after treatment (30.2 +/- 2.7 ng/ml). Interestingly, the concentration of circulating soluble interleukin-2 receptors, molecules indicating lymphocyte activation, was only increased in sera from patients with active celiac disease (2943.0 +/- 214.1 pg/ml), and the level in sera from treated patients and healthy controls was comparable (1936 +/- 349 and 1416 +/- 111.7 pg/ml). The elevated serum level of soluble cell adhesion molecules could be used as a supplementary, noninvasive procedure for monitoring intestinal immune reactions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously reported that IgA antigliadin antibodies (IgA-AGA) in the majority of healthy subjects are transient and do not indicate enteropathy, and also that an increased intake of gluten in the form of soda bread may be part of the explanation for this phenomenon. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether gluten challenge with soda bread in subjects with transiently positive IgA-AGA could induce a significant titre of IgA-AGA. DESIGN: Food challenge study. METHODS: All subjects with positive IgA-AGA on screening at the time of the MONICA project in 1991 (T0) who developed negative serology at 3-year follow-up (T1) were invited to participate in a 'soda bread challenge' (1 loaf per day) for 1 month. Analysis of food intake was carried out prior to the challenge (T2) and compared to the analysis at the time of screening (T0). IgA-AGA and IgA antiendomysial antibodies (EMA) were checked pre- (T2) and post-challenge (T3). RESULTS: Ten subjects agreed to participate. Quantities of food ingested for the various categories did not differ significantly from T0 to T2. IgA-AGA titres did not differ significantly from T1 to T2 (20.2 versus 35.0, P=0.085). Mean IgA-AGA titres rose significantly between T2 and T3 (35.0 versus 40.3, P=0.005), although none of the subjects developed a significant titre of IgA-AGA. None of the subjects were positive for IgA-EMA. CONCLUSIONS: Intake of soda bread does not appear to be an important explanation as to why subjects may have a transient rise in IgA-AGA titre since none of the subjects developed a significant titre of IgA-AGA.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is the most common disorder with malabsorption of the small intestine, caused by the gluten fraction of cereals in genetically predisposed individuals. T-cell mediated autoimmune processes are initiated by gluten exposure, leading to both intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations, therefore coeliac disease is nowadays considered to be a systemic disorder. More and more diseases are proved to be associated with coeliac disease, in these conditions screening is strongly recommended. The studying of the recently explored autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase brought us further in the understanding of the pathophysiology of coeliac disease. The spreading of reliable serologic methods modified our knowledge on the clinical picture and prevalence of the disease. In case of long-term dietary abuse the most common complications are decreased bone mineral density and development of lymphomas. Sustained glutenfree diet results in clinical and histological restitution, affects the course of associating diseases beneficially and decreases the risk for malignancies.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD), perceived as a rare cause of chronic diarrhea three decades ago, was diagnosed as a cause of diarrhea in 60 (7.5%) post weaned children among 800 cases of chronic diarrhea. The diagnosis was established on the basis of a detailed clinical history, histopathological studies on small bowel mucosa and a complete recovery on gluten free diets. Thirty four children were followed up for a period of 0.3 to 8.2 years (mean 3.45 +/- 2.28). Catch up growth was seen in all. A rapid gain in height and weight was observed in first year following exclusion of gluten from the diet. However, on subsequent follow up, flattening of growth curve was seen in 9 subjects which was attributed to non-compliance of gluten free diets and dietary inadequacies. Strict dietary compliance is difficult to adhere to with wheat being a staple cereal in India. Other factors affecting compliance include lack of awareness and non availability of gluten free diets as well as contamination of other items with wheat at grocery shops. A few cases may present as celiac crisis which is a medical emergency requiring aggressive management including use of corticosteroids to improve survival in this otherwise life threatening situation. Effective management of CD requires intense family cooperation as well as concerted national efforts to provide these patients easy access to gluten free diets. The evolution of Celiac Societies, and widespread dissemination of knowledge through all available media will greatly help in management of patients with this chronic disease.},

Of these, 8 were on a spare agluten diet, in whom the time-related course of clinical manifestations of the illness was characterized by stabilization of the primary symptoms of disturbed intestinal absorption, improvement in the psychoemotional state at year of their prophylactic management. The glucose tolerance test had gotten normalized after two years of being on a spare diet, lactose tolerance test remaining below the normal range in 37.5 percent of cases at year 3 of the observation, with the content of IgG antibodies to gliadine exceeding the threshold values in 33.3% on an average three times as much as the norm. In those patients having not been on a spare diet, retardation in physical development was recordable together with bone abnormalities manifested by pathologic fractures of the tubular bones. The level of anti-gliadine antibodies of both classes was found to be augmented in 71.4 percent of cases, their values having been fifty times as much as the norm. Glucose tolerance test suggested to us a steady decline in the absorption that was still to be seen at year 10 of the prospective follow-up. Lactase intolerance was somewhat less, remaining at lower values in the half of the patient population.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In children with celiac disease (CD) bone metabolism and mineralization are frequently disturbed. The present study aimed to assess the influence of gluten free diet (GFD) on bone mineral density (BMD) in 73 children with CD, mean age of 12.4 +/- 0.4 years and mean body mass index (BMI) 17.9 +/- 0.4 kg/m2 (mean +/- SEM). Diagnosis of CD was established according to ESPEGAN criteria. Compliance to the GFD was verified on the basis of interview and by estimation of antiendomysial antibodies (IgAEmA/IgGEmA) in blood serum. BMD was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Plasma calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) concentrations, alkaline phosphatase (AP) and its bone fraction (BAP) were estimated before BMD measurement. All children were divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 33 children where gluten free diet was strictly respected for 11.7 +/- 0.6 years. The second group (Group B) comprised 40 children without strictly respected GFD. Children who strictly followed GFD showed statistically higher BMI, AP-spine BMD and total body BMD in comparison with children without GFD (BMI 19 +/- 0.52 kg/m2 vs 17.3 +/- 0.4 kg/m2; p < 0.01, AP-spine BMD 0.951 +/- 0.04 g/cm2 vs 0.767 + 0.03 g/cm2; p < 0.005, Total Body BMD 1.013 +/- 0.02 g/cm2 vs 0.933 +/- 0.01 g/cm2; p < 0.05) respectively. No significant differences were found in plasma Ca, P, AP, BAP between both groups. A statistically significant positive correlation (p < 0.001) was found between duration of GFD and AP-spine BMD and total body BMD, respectively. A statistically significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) was also found between duration of GFD and BMI. CONCLUSION: Long-term GFD significantly improves BMD and BMI in children with CD.},

METHODS: The study involved 41 children and adults with coeliac disease and 11 adults with dermatitis herpetiformis adhering to a gluten-free diet for 8 years on average. Thirty-five newly diagnosed coeliac patients at diagnosis and 6 to 24 months after the start of a gluten-free diet and 27 non-coeliac patients with dyspepsia were investigated for comparison. Daily dietary gluten and wheat starch intake were calculated. Small-bowel mucosal villous architecture, CD3+, alphabeta+, and gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes, mucosal HLA-DR expression, and serum endomysial, reticulin, and gliadin antibodies were investigated. RESULTS: Forty of 52 long-term-treated patients adhered to a strict wheat starch-based diet and 6 to a strict naturally gluten-free diet; 6 patients had dietary lapses. In the 46 patients on a strict diet the villous architecture, enterocyte height, and density of alphabeta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes were similar to those in non-coeliac subjects and better than in short-term-treated coeliac patients. The density of gammadelta(+)cells was higher, but they seemed to decrease over time with the gluten-free diet. Wheat starch-based gluten-free flour products did not cause aberrant upregulation of mucosal HLA-DR. The mucosal integrity was not dependent on the daily intake of wheat starch in all patients on a strict diet, whereas two of the six patients with dietary lapses had villous atrophy and positive serology. CONCLUSION: Wheat starch-based gluten-free flour products were not harmful in the treatment of coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abdominal complaints after ingestion of cereals are not uncommon. We assessed how reliable such a history is as a marker for the presence of overt coeliac disease, and whether we should also take into account latent coeliac disease and cereal allergy. METHODS: The study group comprised 93 consecutive adults from health centres spontaneously reporting abdominal symptoms after consumption of cereals. Small bowel mucosal morphology, CD3+, alphabeta+ and gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), HLA DQ alleles and serum IgA-class endomysial (EmA), tissue transglutaminase (tTg) and gliadin (AGA) antibodies were determined. Skin prick and patch tests and serum radioallergosorbent tests for cereals were carried out. Thirty non-coeliac adults served as biopsy controls. RESULTS: Eight (9%) patients had coeliac disease and one mild partial villous atrophy. Altogether 17 had an increased density of gamma delta+ IELs without atrophy. However, only seven (8%) showed evidence of latent coeliac disease, i.e. both an increase in gammadelta+ IELs and the presence of coeliac disease-type HLA. One or more of the allergy tests for cereals was positive in 19; 9 adopted a gluten-free diet and abdominal symptoms were alleviated in all. In non-coeliac patients, serum EmA and tTg tests were negative in all, whereas AGA was seen in 40%. CONCLUSIONS: Intolerance to cereals is not a specific sign of overt or latent coeliac disease. All experimental dietary interventions before proper diagnosis of coeliac disease are therefore to be discouraged. Allergy to cereals, on the other hand, should be considered even in adults.},

   abstract = {We investigated the bone mineral density (BMD) and prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in adult celiac patients with varying disease states. In this cross-sectional study the data on the severity of celiac disease and BMD were collected from 77 celiac patients (28 newly diagnosed and 49 previously diagnosed celiac patients), and BMD results were compared with those of 157 control subjects matched for age, gender, and menopausal status. The celiac patients had significantly lower BMD than the control subjects at the lumbar spine (-6%) and femoral neck (-5%). The mean BMD did not differ significantly among celiac patients classified by severity of disease. Based on Z scores, 35% of the celiac patients and 17% of the control subjects had low BMDs for age at the lumbar spine (p = 0.005), whereas 31% of celiac patients and 16% of control subjects had Z scores of < or =-1 at the femoral neck (p = 0.01). Altogether, 26% of all celiac patients, but only 5% of control subjects, were classified as having osteoporosis (T score < or =-2.5 SD) at the lumbar spine (p = 0.03), whereas osteoporosis was rare at the femoral neck in both groups (3% vs. 1%, p = 1.00). Prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was highest in newly diagnosed celiac patients and in patients with disease not in remission. A low 25-(OH)D vitamin concentration was a typical biochemical abnormality in our patients (64% of men and 71% of women). The main associated variables of low BMD were age (men), low serum vitamin D level, low body weight, and postmenopausal status (women). The present study suggests that celiac disease constitutes a risk factor for osteoporosis. This finding applies particularly to untreated and poorly treated patients.},

The study group consisted of 28 newly diagnosed celiac patients (9 men, 19 women) recruited between 1990 and 1991. Six patients withdrew from the 5-year follow-up. Compliance with the gluten-free diet was good: 96% at 1 year and 82% at 5 years. During the follow-up period, the body mass index increased significantly (8%). Both in men and women, bone mineral density (BMD) values determined by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) increased at the lumbar spine (2%), the femoral neck (1%), the trochanter (6%), and the Wards' area (3%) during the follow-up. The increase in BMD was found already during the first year of follow-up. After 1 year, BMD increased or remained the same in 69% of the patients at the lumbar spine and in 67% of the patients at the femoral neck, 89% of patients at the throchanter, and 67% of patients at the Wards' area. During the 5-year follow-up, these figures were 52%, 46%, 68%, and 59%, respectively. At the baseline, 19 out of 28 patients, after 1 year, 14 out of 26 patients, and after 5 years, 2 out of 26 patients had low serum 25(OH)D vitamin values (p = 0.0001). A high serum parathormone value was noticed in 6 out of 25 patients at the baseline, but after 1 year, 5 of them showed normalized values (p = 0.03). According to our results, bone disease in celiac patients is cured in most patients during 5 years on a gluten-free diet. The improvement in BMD mostly occurred already within the first year after the establishment of a gluten-free diet.},

This frequently results in malabsorption of a range of important nutrients including iron, folic acid, calcium and fat-soluble vitamins. Coeliac disease in now considered to be a common disorder, possibly affecting 1:300 of the general population. Many patients present in adulthood, have minimal symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations are frequently absent. The diagnosis and screening for coeliac disease has been dramatically facilitated by testing for endomysial autoantibodies, although biopsy and demonstration of a characteristic histological lesion remains the definitive diagnostic investigation. Treatment with a gluten-free diet is effective but requires good patient compliance and monitoring to succeed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated whether children with food allergy (FA) express increased densities of intraepithelial gammadelta+ T cells similarly to subjects with celiac disease. METHODS: The duodenal specimens taken by gastroduodenoscopy from 20 children with untreated FA, 17 with treated FA, 12 with celiac disease (CD) and 12 controls were studied with monoclonal antibodies and a three-layer peroxidase staining method. RESULTS: The subjects with untreated FA expressed equal densities of total intraepithelial CD3+ and alpha/beta+ T cells, but significantly higher densities of gammadelta+ cells than the subjects currently on an elimination diet for FA or the controls. Accordingly, their gammadelta+/CD3+ ratio was higher. On the other hand, the results differed clearly from CD, where all the three cell populations showed high densities. Another finding that discriminated the subjects with FA from the CD patients was endoscopic examination. Lymphonodular hyperplasia (LNH) of the duodenal bulb with a normal villous pattern was demonstrated in 14 (70%) of the 20 subjects with untreated FA and in 8 (47%) of the 17 with treated FA, but in none of the celiac patients or controls. Surprisingly, the biopsy samples from the subjects with FA showed quite normal histological findings. CONCLUSIONS: According to this preliminary observation, high densities of intraepithelial gammadelta+ T cells and a significantly elevated gammadelta+/CD3+ ratio are associated with untreated FA. If seen LNH in a gastroduodenoscopy and/or increased densities of gammadelta+ T cells in the biopsy specimen, the possibility of gastrointestinal FA should be reliably assessed by a food challenge.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To investigate the clinical significance of the determination of IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) for the detection of silent coeliac disease in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: A total of 520 patients with diabetes (median age 14.2 years, range 1-27) were tested for IgA antibodies to tTG (IgA anti-tTG, ELISA), endomysium (EmA, indirect immunofluoresence) and gliadin (IgA-AGA, enzyme immunometric assay) after ruling out IgA deficiency. RESULTS: The prevalence of IgA anti-tTG among patients with diabetes was 4.4% (23 of 520), and that of EmA and IgA-AGA 3.5% (18 of 520, respectively). The coefficient of agreement between IgA anti-tTG and EmA was high (Cohen's kappa = 0.87, P < 0.001). Thirteen of the 23 IgA anti-tTG-positive patients underwent duodenal biopsy. Coeliac disease was confirmed in nine of 13 patients. One of them was negative for EmA and AGA, but positive for IgA anti-tTG. Retrospective annual determinations up to 8 years in six IgA anti-tTG-positive patients showed both permanent and transient elevations of the serological markers. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that a positive IgA antibody test to tTG is a more sensitive parameter than EmA for silent coeliac disease in patients with diabetes. Confirmatory small bowel biopsy, however, remains necessary for diagnosis as some patients with positive antibodies may be without histological changes.},

   abstract = {Sensibility to gluten is a condition with high immunological reaction against gluten proteins from wheat, barley, rye and oats in individuals genetically susceptible. Celiac disease is its most frequent expression with various forms of clinical presentation. The treatment consists in gluten free diet. Although the biopsy of proximal small bowel is necessary, the importance of serological tests is increasing in the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of gluten free diet in celiac patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of antiendomysium (EmA-IgA) and anti-reticulin (ARA-IgA) antibodies in 56 celiac patients (17 at diagnosis, 24 adherent to the diet and 15 with transgression to the diet). The antibodies were detected by indirect immunofluorescence, using human umbilical cord as substrate for the EmA-IgA and rat liver and kidney for the ARA-IgA. In the patients at diagnosis and in the group with transgression to the diet the total positivity was 100% for EmA-IgA and 59.4% for ARA-IgA. Antibodies were not detected in gluten-free diet patients. Among the 32 positive patients, the concordance of both tests was of 59.4% (19/32), being 40.6% (13/32) negative to ARA-IgA and positive to EmA-IgA. No patient was positive for ARA-IgA and negative for EmA-IgA. Thus, the sensitivity for EmA-IgA was of 100% and 59.4% for ARA-IgA. The association of the two tests did not improve the positivity in the samples. In conclusion, EmA-IgA can be considered the best serological test for diagnosis and follow up of celiac patients, because it presents high predictive value, high specificity and sensibility and is not expensive if using human umbilical cord as substrate.},

Moreover, the proliferation of spleen and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) lymhocytes from both groups of gliadin-treated suckling and hand-fed rats was specifically increased by the in vitro gliadin challenge. Spleen B cells from gliadin-treated rats spontaneously produced higher amounts of gliadin-specific antibodies than those from the controls, however, in vitro stimulation by gliadin caused no further increase in antibody production. Apoptotic DNA fragmentation in MLN cells was higher in gliadin-treated rats than in albumin-treated ones, independently of the milk diet during the suckling period.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gluten-derived peptides (e.g., amino-acids 31-49 of alpha-gliadin) have been shown to cause changes typical of celiac disease in the gut. Gluten-derived peptides have mostly been used in in vitro studies. The easiest access to the gastrointestinal system may be the mouth. In the present study we were interested to see whether a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino-acids 31-49 of alpha-gliadin could induce inflammatory changes in the oral mucosa after a local challenge in celiac disease patients. METHODS: The challenge was made by injecting the peptide solution at a concentration of 10 microg/ml submucosally into the oral mucosa of 10 celiac disease patients after a gluten-free diet (GFD) and 12 healthy control subjects. B and CD45RO+ T cells, mast cells, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ lymphocytes, and alphabeta and gammadelta T-cell receptor-bearing (TcR alphabeta, TcR gammadelta) lymphocytes were counted and HLA DR expression was determined. The expression of CD25 and Ki-67 antigen was also examined. RESULTS: The peptide significantly increased the total number of T cells in the lamina propria of the celiac disease patients. The expression of T-cell activation marker CD25 (IL-2 receptor), but not that of cell proliferation marker Ki-67, was also significantly increased in the lamina propria after peptide challenge. Such a reaction was not observed in the controls. The numbers of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria were also increased in celiac disease patients after the challenge. The count of TcR gammadelta+ cells was very small in the oral mucosa in celiac disease and showed no increase when the oral mucosa was challenged with the peptide. The expression of HLA DR staining was enhanced after the submucosal peptide challenge in celiac disease; however, the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that in the celiac disease patients after the peptide challenge the oral mucosal lamina propria responds with a nonproliferative increase of lymphocytes. Thus, submucosal challenge with the peptide 31-49 can be used as an aid in the diagnosis of celiac disease. However, further studies with optimized methodology, including various concentrations of the peptide, adjuvants, other peptides, etc., are warranted, especially because the oral mucosa provides the easiest access to an in vivo peptide challenge in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {In coeliac disease, gluten-containing diet challenges over many years are sometimes required for diagnosis, especially if the initial diagnosis was equivocal. The rectal gluten challenge has been proposed to simplify coeliac disease diagnosis. We were interested in studying whether the oral mucosa could be used for local challenge with gliadin as an aid in finalizing the diagnosis of coeliac disease. The study groups consisted of 37 treated coeliac disease patients and 10 controls. The challenges on the oral mucosa were performed either supramucosally with gliadin powder (coeliac disease patients) or by submucosal injection of dissolved gliadin (10 microg/ml) (coeliac disease patients and controls). A control challenge with submucosal gliadin solvent was made in the coeliac disease patients. B and T cells, mast cells and T cell subsets were counted and HLA-DR expression was determined. Biopsies were taken from each provoked area 24 h post-challenge. A significant increase in the number of CD4+ lymphocytes in the lamina propria (observed in 27/37 patients), but a decrease in the number of mast cells was observed in treated coeliac disease patients after submucosal challenge with gliadin. Following supramucosal challenge with gliadin the counts of intraepithelial CD4+ (in 25/37 patients) and CD8+ T cells (in 27/37 patients) increased significantly and the number of CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria was also significantly increased. Control subjects were tested by submucosal gliadin challenge and no significant changes in the number of cells were observed. HLA-DR expression did not show increased positivity in coeliac disease patients on submucosal challenge. For the first time the oral mucosa has been used for immunological testing and shown to react to gliadin challenge in coeliac disease patients. Recruitment of T cells upon submucosal gliadin challenge occurred towards the lamina propria, whereas it occurred towards the epithelium in supramucosal gliadin challenge. The numbers of T cells increased in the lamina propria after submucosal challenge. The results suggest that local oral challenge with gliadin may be used as a diagnostic method in coeliac disease; however, further studies in untreated coeliac disease patients are needed to evaluate the usefulness of this method.},

   abstract = {The definitive diagnosis of coeliac disease is based on typical changes in the small intestine biopsy specimens. To screen individuals for coeliac disease serum IgA and IgG antigliadin (AGA), IgA antireticulin (ARA) and IgA antiendomysium (EmA) antibodies are used. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these antibodies can also be detected in saliva as diagnostic markers of coeliac disease. The study population comprised 30 patients with coeliac disease treated with a gluten-free diet, 14 patients with untreated coeliac disease and 13 healthy control subjects. Sera and saliva were tested simultaneously for the presence of IgA and IgG AGA and IgA EmA. None of patients studied had a selective IgA deficiency. There was no significant difference in salivary IgA AGA levels between the three groups tested and there was no correlation between the individual serum and salivary values of IgA AGA. Salivary IgG AGA levels were very low or undetectable. Serum IgA AGA showed a low sensitivity (36.4%) to detect an untreated patient with coeliac disease. All salivary samples, regardless of the study group were negative for IgA EmA. Serum IgA EmAs were universally detected in the sera of patients with newly diagnosed coeliac disease and also in the sera of five of 30 patients with treated coeliac disease. No IgA EmA was detected in the sera of controls. None of the patients studied had a selective IgA deficiency either. Serum IgA EmA is the most sensitive, and IgA and IgG AGA are good indicators for coeliac disease, but salivary IgA or IgG AGA and salivary IgA EmA are not helpful for the diagnosis or follow-up of coeliac disease patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In coeliac disease, the gut involvement is gluten-dependent. Following the introduction of a gluten-free diet, inflammatory cell infiltration decreases in the small intestinal mucosa. Our hypothesis was that the oral mucosa might mirror the changes found in coeliac disease similarly to the mucosa of the small intestine. Thus, the number of inflammatory cells in the oral mucosa would decrease in patients with coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet. METHODS: The distribution CD45RO+ and CD3(+) T cells, T-cell subpopulations (CD4(+), CD8(+), T-cell receptor (TCR)alpha beta+ and TCR gamma delta+ cells) and HLA DR expression were studied in the buccal mucosa of 15 untreated and 44 gluten-free diet treated coeliac disease patients, and of 19 controls. All 15 patients with untreated coeliac disease were immunglobulin (Ig)A endomysial antibody positive and all 44 patients on gluten-free diet except one were endomysial antibody negative, as were all control subjects. RESULTS: Untreated coeliac disease patients did not differ from controls in the densities of CD45RO+ cells, CD3(+) cells or of T-cell subsets. In contrast, in treated coeliac disease patients, a significant increase in the numbers of mast cells, CD3(+) and CD4(+) lymphocytes was found in the lamina propria of oral mucosa as compared with patients with untreated coeliac disease and controls. The increase in CD3(+) T cells was in part owing to an increase in lymphocytes expressing no TCR. No differences were found in the expression of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) DR in the epithelium or in the lamina propria in the patient groups studied or in the controls. In treated coeliac disease patients only a few TCR gamma delta+ T cells were found intraepithelially and in the lamina propria, but these cells were not detected in the lamina propria of oral mucosa of patients with untreated coeliac disease or in the controls. CONCLUSIONS: The infiltration of T cells into oral mucosa was increased in treated coeliac disease patients in spite of adherence to a gluten-free diet. Because the CD3(+) T cell count was higher than those of the TCR alpha beta+ and TCR gamma delta+ T cells, there must be other cells involved, probably natural killer (NK) cells. The increase in T-cell subsets in the treated coeliac disease patients seems not to result from poor dietary compliance, but might occur as a late immune response in coeliac disease and reflect chronic immunologic stimulation followed by regeneration of memory T cells.},

   abstract = {Many systemic diseases impair salivary flow rate and composition and therefore incite oral pathological processes. This study analyses the composition of whole saliva in patients with diagnosed coeliac disease (CD) and in healthy controls, and monitors possible changes in saliva composition after a short oral gluten challenge. Paraffin-stimulated whole saliva was collected from 128 CD patients and 55 healthy controls. In a separate study, paraffin-stimulated whole saliva samples were collected from 33 CD patients and 10 controls both before and 24 h after an oral mucosal and submucosal gluten challenge. No difference in saliva flow rate was observed, but total protein (P</=0.001), albumin (P</=0.001), IgA (P</=0.01) and IgG (P</=0.001) concentrations, as well as salivary peroxidase (P</=0.001) and myeloperoxidase (P</=0.001) activities, were significantly higher in CD patients than in healthy controls. The relative amounts of secreted proteins (mg/mg), e.g. amylase (P</=0. 001), total IgA (P</=0.005) and IgM (P</=0.001) were significantly lower in CD patients than in healthy controls. In CD patients, gluten challenge resulted in a decrease in myeloperoxidase (P</=0. 005) activity, IgA (P</=0.001) and IgM (P</=0.005) concentrations and the relative amounts of secreted IgA (P</=0.001). In healthy individuals, however, gluten challenge caused a decrease in total and relative amylase activity (P</=0.005; P</=0.001) and total IgM (P</=0.005) concentration. It is concluded that CD patients, following a strict gluten-free diet, secrete lower relative amounts of amylase, IgA and IgM into paraffin-stimulated whole saliva than do healthy controls.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine characterized by intolerance to gluten. Traditionally, diagnosis is made by intestinal biopsy. Testing for immunoglobulin (Ig) A endomysial antibodies in the serum also is used for diagnosis. Biopsy and serology revert to normal with adherence to a gluten-free diet. Often, after an index case is diagnosed, siblings with symptoms adhere to a gluten-free diet without biopsy or serologic confirmation. More than 90% of patients with celiac disease have the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 genotype. Non-HLA genes also have been implicated. METHODS: One hundred ninety-five individuals with confirmed or suspected celiac disease were identified in 73 families affected by the disease. IgA endomysial antibody testing was performed for all symptomatic family members who did not have biopsy-confirmed diagnoses. DNA samples were genotyped at D6S276 and the HLA class II loci DQA and DQB. RESULTS: At the time sampling was begun in families, 88 of 177 (49.7%) individuals were self-diagnosed and adhering to a gluten-free diet. Ninety percent (91/101) of confirmed cases (biopsy or serology) had at least 1 copy of the DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 genotype, whereas only 67% (46/69) of cases self-diagnosed (adherence to gluten-free diet without confirmation) had at least 1 copy. Of confirmed cases, 61% carried two copies of DQB*0201. It is estimated that the HLA association and other unlinked genes contribute approximately equally to the sibling risk of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: A dosage effect of DQB1*0201 may be associated with an increased risk of celiac disease. Self-diagnosis of celiac disease is as common as confirmed diagnosis in families in the United States. Diagnosis of celiac disease on the basis of clinical response to gluten restriction is inaccurate. With long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet, serologic test results are likely to be negative. Based on HLA genotype, approximately one third of self-diagnosed individuals are unlikely to have celiac disease. However, it is not possible to determine which individuals consuming a gluten-free diet have the disease. Therefore, before starting a gluten-free diet, serologic screening and biopsy confirmation are necessary.},

To further investigate the site of action of Ent, we compared the feeding responses to Ent injected intra-arterially near the celiac artery, into the carotid artery, or intravenously in rats adapted to a high-fat diet. After near-celiac arterial injection there was an immediate dose-dependent (0.05-13.5 nmol) inhibition of food intake occurring within 5 min in overnight-fasted rats that lasted up to 20 min. Carotid arterial Ent had a similar, immediate dose-related response, and the inhibitory effect was long lasting. The response to intravenous Ent was only evident at the highest dose (13.5 nmol) and was delayed for at least 120 min. Pretreatment with capsaicin, which causes degeneration of vagal sensory neurons, abolished the inhibitory responses to near-celiac Ent but not to intravenous or intracarotid Ent. These results provide further evidence for both a gastrointestinal site of action for peripheral Ent and a central site of action for intracarotid Ent and suggest that the delayed response to intravenous Ent may reflect either binding or slow uptake of this peptide into the central nervous system.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic undernutrition resulting from coeliac disease (CD) could be associated with changes in the circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, which may participate in the pathogenesis of growth retardation occurring in these patients. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in CD subjects attempting to (1) document the pattern of serum IGF-I and IGF binding protein (IGFBP) 1 and 3 at diagnosis and (2) assess the response of circulating IGF system to dietary treatments, in comparison with the response of clinical and laboratory findings utilized for the diagnosis of CD. Thirty-two prepubertal CD children were divided into three groups based on the dietetic treatment: at diagnosis (D, n=18); on gluten-free diet for at least 6 months (GFD, n=7); and on gluten challenge for at least 3 months (CH, n=7). Six postpubertal CD patients were also studied at diagnosis. RESULTS: In prepubertal children IGF-I levels were significantly reduced (by 29%) in D vs sex- and age-matched normal control (NC) subjects, with reductions being more pronounced before 3 years of age. Likewise, serum IGFBP-3 concentrations were decreased by 22%, whereas circulating IGFBP-1 levels were increased by 60%, compared with NC, with more marked IGFBP changes in older children. Similar alterations were observed in postpubertal patients. Changes in the circulating IGF system disappeared in GFD subjects and reappeared in CH children, as positivity of disease-specific antibodies. Body mass index (BMI) also improved in GFD subjects, but did not decrease in CH children. Changes in IGF-I and IGFBPs did not correlate with each other. Levels of IGF-I, but not of IGFBPs, maintained the relation with age and correlated significantly with BMI and positivity of antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that CD patients show significant changes in serum IGF-I, in younger children, and IGFBPs (particularly IGFBP-1), in older children and adolescents, correlating with clinical course and response to dietary treatments. The alteration in the circulating IGF system could be implicated in the pathogenesis of growth retardation occurring in CD and may provide an additional tool in monitoring of the disease.},

The aim here was to establish whether such a diet sustains abdominal symptoms. METHODS: The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) was applied to 58 coeliac disease patients on gluten-free diets and 110 non-coeliac controls. An estimate was made of daily dietary fibre and wheat starch-derived gluten. Psychological well-being was evaluated by a structured interview. Twenty-three coeliac patients consented to small-bowel biopsy. RESULTS: The mean GSRS score in coeliac disease patients did not differ from that in control subjects. Poorer psychological well-being was associated with abdominal symptoms in coeliac patients, whereas the daily amount of wheat starch had no effect on GSRS score. Overall dietary compliance was good, and villous atrophy was found in only 2 out of 23 patients. The average fibre consumption, 13 g per day, was lower than recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Wheat starch-based gluten-free products are well-tolerated in coeliac disease patients, provided that their diets are otherwise strict.},

   abstract = {Life-long gluten-free diet is the established therapy of coeliac disease. Patients suffering from dermatitis herpetiformis benefit from the same treatment. In Norway the gluten-free diet has excluded oats as well as wheat, rye and barley. The basis for this recommendation was a 1972 report indicating that ten out of 23 children consuming oats as part of their gluten-free diet for at least 18 months developed signs of damage to the intestinal mucosa. During the last decades, the clinical picture of coeliac disease has changed as a result of better diagnostic tools. Controlled clinical trials during the last few years indicate that some patients may tolerate small amounts of oats in their gluten-free diet. As a consequence, patients may be confused with regard to what dietary regime is recommended in coeliac disease. Compliance with gluten-free diet is important to secure growth and development, the all-round condition, fertility, bone density and a reduced risk of nutrient deficiency and malignancy. Consensus on dietary treatment is essential. A number of controlled trials are under way and the outcome of these studies will in a few years determine whether oats might be included in the standard gluten-free diet. So far oats are not recommended. The physician who makes the diagnosis is responsible for all patients getting adequate dietary counselling and management. Dietary advice given by health personnel must be consistent.},

   abstract = {Based on analysis by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry, we have developed a new method for fast and sensitive fingerprinting of gliadins and glutenins in wheat flour. Using this procedure the two protein fractions from seven durum wheat varieties have been analysed by high resolution high performance liquid chromatographic separation coupled to accurate determination of molecular mass. In this way, the molecular mass of the single components from both gliadin and glutenin fractions were measured and more than forty components were detected for each fraction indicating a high heterogeneity. Although the chromatographic profiles were similar, the molecular masses of protein components with similar retention times among the varieties were often different. The difference ranged from a few mass units corresponding to single amino acid substitution(s) up to thousands implying peptide deletion or insertion along the protein chain. Two components representing about a half of the gliadin fraction, e.g. gamma(2)- and gamma(3)-gliadin, were identified through the N-terminal sequence and molecular mass determination. We suggest the use of the high level and the molecular mass of these gliadin components as markers to detect traces of wheat in gluten-free food preparations for celiac patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Up to 50% of women with untreated coeliac disease experience miscarriage or an unfavourable outcome of pregnancy. In most cases, after 6-12 months of a gluten free diet, no excess of unfavourable outcome of pregnancy is observed. The prevalence of undiagnosed coeliac disease among pregnant women is not known. AIM: To determine the prevalence of untreated coeliac disease among women attending the obstetrics-gynaecological department. METHODS: Endomysial antibodies, which are specific and sensitive for coeliac disease, were evaluated in all women attending the obstetrics-gynaecology department of a large city hospital over a 90 day period. RESULTS: Of 845 pregnant women screened, 12 were identified as having coeliac disease. Three had previously been diagnosed but were not following a gluten free diet. The remaining nine underwent a small intestinal biopsy, which confirmed the diagnosis. The outcome of pregnancy was unfavourable in seven of these 12 women. Six healthy babies were born with no problems after the women had been on a gluten free diet for one year. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 1 in 70 women was affected by coeliac disease, either not diagnosed (nine cases) or not treated (three cases). Their history of miscarriages, anaemia, low birth weight babies, and unfavourable outcome of pregnancy suggests that testing for coeliac disease should be included in the battery of tests prescribed for pregnant women. Coeliac disease is considerably more common than most of the diseases for which pregnant women are routinely screened. Unfavourable events associated with coeliac disease may be prevented by a gluten free diet.},

We investigated possible influences of breast-feeding duration and time of gluten introduction on such presentation of the disease. Study included coeliacs born in Medimurje between 1985 and 1994 (N = 31). Patients' adherence to treatment was also studied. Although short breast-feeding (mean 2.9 months) and early gluten introduction (mean 4.9 months) were shown, no correlation was found between those factors and time of the disease presentation. Concerning adherence to gluten-free diet, only 50% of patients maintained it strictly, 23% irregularly, while 27% were on normal diet. In order to improve it, regular follow-ups are recommended.},

Nonetheless, jejunum is not the only site of the gastrointestinal tract that is involved in celiac disease. In recent years, Ensari and colleagues (2,3), by using immunohistochemical analysis and computerized image analysis for numerical quantitation, have significantly contributed to a definitive and clear demonstration of a celiac disease-associated "proctitis," and its gluten dependence. Morphometry has shown increased populations of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and mast cells in the rectal mucosa of untreated patients, with these changes being reverted, with the sole exception of mast cells, by dietary treatment (2). The immunohistochemical approach has demonstrated highly significant increases in CD3(+) and gammadelta(+) lymphocytes within both the lamina propria and the epithelium. Mononuclear cells, both lymphocytes (CD3(+)) and macrophages (CD68(+)) expressing interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors (CD25(+)), have been found to be increased in the lamina propria, usually immediately below the basal lamina. Enterocytes have been noted to be positive for major histocompatibility complex class II display, a pattern usually absent in normal colon. Furthermore, increased expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) molecules in the rectal mucosa of untreated, compared to either treated celiac rectum or control mucosae, has been reported (3). As a whole, these data suggest, analogously to jeunum, an ongoing T-cell-dependent, cell-mediated immune response in the rectal mucosa.},

Serological testing for antibodies against endomysium and gliadin has only a preliminary significance. In children with strong clinical suspicion of CD, histological investigation of a small bowel biopsy should be performed independently of the results of serological screening (endomysium and gliadin antibodies). In children with less clear clinical suspicion of CD, serological screening may be used to select those who need investigation of small bowel histology. The number of small bowel biopsies that should be performed has been changed. In children < 2 years with clinical symptoms and small bowel villous atrophy, CD is confirmed when symptoms and atrophy significantly improve during gluten-free diet, while small bowel histology significantly deteriorates during gluten challenge. In children > 2 years with clinical symptoms combined with abnormal serology and villous atrophy, CD is confirmed when during gluten-free diet the symptoms disappear and serology improves. In case of family screening, diseases associated with CD or Down's syndrome, CD is confirmed when symptoms (if any), and previous abnormal serology and small bowel histology significantly improve during gluten-free diet.},

In other syndromes associated with luminal antigens, including celiac and Crohn's disease, increased intestinal permeability has been suggested to play an etiological role. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether increased permeability was also present in BB rats before disease development. By measuring gastrointestinal permeability, in animals on a regular or hydrolyzed casein diet, we were able to demonstrate that increased gastric and small intestinal permeability appeared before the development of both insulitis and clinical diabetes. Although hydrolysis of dietary protein significantly reduced the incidence of diabetes, it did not alter the small intestinal permeability abnormality, suggesting that this is an early event. Increased permeability appears to have an early role in the genesis of several immunological diseases and may represent a common event in these diseases.},

We have tried to ascertain the prevalence of coeliac disease in 99 couples who were being evaluated for infertility, compared with the known prevalence of silent disease in the population of Northern Sardinia, in which it is endemic. Of all women, four tested positive for at least two out of three markers: immunoglobulin A (IgA) antigliadin, immunoglobulin (IgG) antigliadin, and anti-endomysium antibodies, and underwent a jejunal biopsy; three had histological evidence of coeliac disease. One male partner was positive for two markers, and had a diagnostic jejunal biopsy. The prevalence of coeliac disease in infertile women seems higher (three out of 99, 3. 03%) in the study group than in the general population (17 out of 1607, 1.06%), and particularly in the subgroup with unexplained infertility (two out of 25, 8%, P < 0.03). Screening for coeliac disease should be part of the diagnostic work-up of infertile women, particularly when no apparent cause can be ascertained after standard evaluation.},

During recent years the patient suffered neither from bowel disorders, nor from dryness of the skin. Laboratory tests revealed high values of parathormone and a high level of antiendomysial antibodies. The total bone-mineral density was about 78% of normal levels. A duodenal mucous membrane specimen showed total atrophy of the villi. Skin biopsy revealed an acquired ichthyosis mimicking an ichthyosis vulgaris. The patient underwent a gluten-free diet, supported by folic acid and vitamin D and six months later, after the regression of secondary hyperparathyroidism, a remarkable improvement of the cutaneous symptoms was obtained.},

   abstract = {In a previous screening study, 16% of patients with psoriasis had IgA and/or IgG antibodies to gliadin (AGA). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in 33 AGA-positive and six AGA-negative psoriasis patients. Of the 33 AGA-positive patients, two had IgA antibodies to endomysium (EmA) and 15 an increased number of lymphocytes in the duodenal epithelium, but in some this increase was slight. Two patients had villous atrophy. A 3-month period on a GFD was followed by 3 months on the patient's ordinary diet. The severity of psoriasis was evaluated with the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). The examining dermatologists were unaware of the EmA and duodenal biopsy results throughout the study. Thirty of the 33 patients with AGA completed the GFD period, after which they showed a highly significant decrease in mean PASI. This included a significant decrease in the 16 AGA-positive patients with normal routine histology in duodenal biopsy specimens. The AGA-negative patients were not improved. After GFD, the AGA values were lower in 82% of those who improved. There was a highly significant decrease in serum eosinophil cationic protein in patients with elevated AGA. When the ordinary diet was resumed, the psoriasis deteriorated in 18 of the 30 patients with AGA who had completed the GFD period. In conclusion, psoriasis patients with raised AGA might improve on a GFD even if they have no EmA or if the increase in duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytes is slight or seemingly absent.},

In patients with mono- or oligosymptomatic celiac disease the time interval between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis often is unacceptably long. CASE REPORT: A female patient with Down syndrome is presented who had acute watery diarrhea, which spontaneously ceased but recurred after a few days. After endoscopic and histologic evaluation and measurement of gliadin, endomysium, and reticulin antibodies celiac sprue was diagnosed. Further investigation showed findings of autoimmune hypothyroidism and secondary hyperparathyreoidism. After the patient was put on a gluten-free diet her state quickly improved. CONCLUSION: Associations between Down syndrome and autoimmune diseases exist. Patients with acute gastrointestinal symptoms should be evaluated as to celiac disease. The time interval between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of celiac disease can be shortened, if all diagnostic tools are used at the appropriate time.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Osteoporosis and alterations of bone metabolism are frequent complications of celiac disease. We evaluated the impact of long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) initiated during childhood and adolescence on bone mineralization and bone metabolism. METHODS: We studied 30 celiac patients on GFD for > or = 5 yr. The mean age at diagnosis was 11.4+/-5.0 yr, and the mean duration of GFD was 10.7+/-4.3 yr. Results were compared with those obtained in 240 healthy controls. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured in the lumbar spine and in the whole skeleton by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) were measured as bone formation indices, and urine levels of N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) as bone resorption index. RESULTS: BMD measurements of celiac patients (lumbar spine: 1.131+/-0.121 g/cm2; total body: 1.145+/-0.184 g/cm2) did not differ from those of control subjects (lumbar spine: 1.131+/-0.184 g/cm2; total body: 1.159+/-0.118 g/cm2). The levels of BALP, PINP, and NTx of celiac patients did not differ from those of controls. Patients who started GFD before puberty had BMD and bone metabolism measurements comparable to those of patients who started GFD during puberty. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that long-term dietary treatment ensures normal mineralization and bone turnover.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: to determine the incidence of hypertransaminasemia in adult patients with celiac disease with or without relevant chronic liver disease, and to evaluate the response after a gluten-free diet. PATIENTS AND METHODS: retrospective study of 20 cases of adult celiac disease (> 14 years old at diagnosis). Patients were included in the study if they fulfilled the revised EPSGAN criteria. If laboratory tests of liver function revealed alterations, hepatitis B and C viral serology, thyroid hormones, and use of alcohol and drugs were investigated, and liver ultrasound scans were done. Liver biopsy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were done only in patients for whom these studies were considered necessary. RESULTS: ten patients had hypertransaminasemia (50%), ascribed to benzodiazepine use in 1 patient, chronic HCV hepatitis in 1, and celiac disease in 8. In all of these last patients except 1 (benzodiazepine use), laboratory values returned to normal after 4-10 months on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: celiac disease was frequently associated with hypertransaminasemia. In most patients transaminase levels returned to normal within 1 year after dietary gluten intake was restricted. If alterations in laboratory values persist, other causes that may be related (e.g., autoimmunity or tumors) or unrelated to celiac disease (e.g., virus) must be ruled out.},

   abstract = {The treatment of coeliac disease (CD) is straightforward and simple: life-long adherence to a gluten-free diet. However, in a small subgroup of patients, the clinical and histological abnormalities persist or recur. This non-responsiveness leaves a poorly understood syndrome known as refractory coeliac disease (RCD). A specific definition of RCD is lacking in the literature. We speculate that RCD may appear in a subgroup of coeliacs with persisting histologic abnormalities. In all patients screened for RCD we look for DQ2 and DQ8. In non-DQ2/DQ8 patients we reconsider the diagnosis of CD and of auto-immune enteropathy. Most of the patients referred to us because of suspicion of RCD are affected by other diseases. Probably the commonest cause of non-responsiveness is continued gluten intake. Exocrine pancreas insufficiency, hyperthyroid disease, collagenous colitis are other common explanations. RCD and enteropathy-associated T cell lymphomas (EATL) can be distinguished by intra-epithelial lymphocyte phenotyping and TCR-gamma gene rearrangements. In RCD, an unexplained sustained stimulation of T cell cytotoxic activity is present. Immunosuppressive treatment might moderate this. Cyclosporine has been reported as a resounding success in case reports; however, our results were disappointing. We suggest azathioprine and steroids in RCD without aberrant T-lymphocytes in their mucosa. However, in RCD with aberrant T-lymphocytes we suggest chemotherapy. As the prognosis of EATLs is extremely poor the early detection of RCD with aberrant T cells is crucial.},

Isolated intestinal trehalase deficiency is found in 8% of Greenlanders, but is rare elsewhere. The normal range of trehalase activity and the incidence of isolated trehalase deficiency in the UK have not been reported. Patients (n 400) were investigated for suspected malabsorption. Endoscopic distal duodenal biopsies were taken for histological assessment and maltase, sucrase, lactase and trehalase estimation. Disaccharidase activities were determined by Dahlqvist's technique (Dahlqvist, 1968). Most patients (n 369) had normal duodenal histology. In these, square root transformation of trehalase activity produced a normal distribution. The normal range (mean +/- 2 SD) was 4.79-37.12 U/g protein. One patient had an isolated borderline trehalase deficiency. The thirty-one patients with villous atrophy had significantly reduced disaccharidase activities. With ingestion of a gluten-free diet, maltase, sucrase and trehalase activities recovered to normal in most patients, whereas lactase activity did not. The normal range and very low incidence of isolated enzyme deficiency is comparable with that described in populations from the USA and mainland Europe. Activity is significantly reduced in untreated coeliac disease and recovers with treatment with a gluten-free diet. There is no place for routine determination of trehalase activity in the UK population and there should be no concern over the introduction of trehalose-containing dried foods.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a permanent intolerance to ingested gluten that results in immunologically mediated inflammatory damage to the small-intestinal mucosa. Celiac disease is associated with both human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes and with other immune disorders, notably juvenile diabetes and thyroid disease. The classic sprue syndrome of steatorrhea and malnutrition coupled with multiple deficiency states may be less common than more subtle and often monosymptomatic presentations of the disease. Diverse problems such as dental anomalies, short stature, osteopenic bone disease, lactose intolerance, infertility, and nonspecific abdominal pain among many others may be the only manifestations of celiac disease. The rate at which celiac disease is diagnosed depends on the level of suspicion for the disease. Although diagnosis relies on intestinal biopsy findings, serologic tests are useful as screening tools and as an adjunct to diagnosis. The treatment of celiac disease is lifelong avoidance of dietary gluten. Gluten-free diets are now readily achievable with appropriate professional instruction and community support. Both benign and malignant complications of celiac disease occur but these can often be avoided by early diagnosis and compliance with a gluten-free diet.},

In addition, 23 CP patients with steatorrhea and daily fecal fat excretion > or =5 g were given a pancreatic enzyme preparation at a dose 3-8 times higher than the usual dose to investigate its effect on fecal fat excretion. Among CP patients whose fat intake was <40 g, the incidence of fecal fat excretion <5 g was 56% and that of fecal fat excretion > or =10 g (severe steatorrhea) was 8%. In CP patients whose fat intake was > or =40 g, the incidences were 27.9 and 34.9%, respectively; a significant increase in the number of affected patients was noted when fat intake was > or =40 g. The fat absorption rate was 76.2% among patients whose fat intake was <40 g and 77.8% among patients whose fat intake was > or =40 g, revealing no significant difference between the two groups.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate exocrine pancreatic function in relation to jejunal morphology in celiac disease. METHODS: Thirty-six patients fulfilling the ESPGHAN criteria for celiac disease, aged 3 to 18 years and 36 control subjects matched for age and sex were investigated. The design of the study included measurement of serum pancreatic isoamylase by a chromogenic method after selective inhibition of sialic isoamylase in the untreated phase in patients consuming a gluten-containing diet and after gluten elimination for a period of 1 year; fecal human elastase activity determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in patients consuming a gluten-free diet and again after gluten challenge for 6 months; correlation of serum pancreatic isoamylase and fecal elastase to the jejunal morphology, classified by criteria described by Marsch; the enzymes in the control group; and ultrasonography of the pancreas in both groups. RESULTS: Enzyme values obtained from celiac disease patients with normal mucosa were significantly higher than those obtained from patients with villous atrophy (p < 0.001) and comparable to those obtained from the control group. Serum pancreatic isoamylase activity increased to normal after gluten elimination, and human elastase activity decreased to values below 200 microg/g of stool after gluten challenge. Enzyme activity was related inversely to the degree of intestinal damage. The echogenicity of the pancreas was normal, regardless of enzyme activity or gut morphology. CONCLUSIONS: Exocrine pancreatic function is abnormal in celiac disease when mucosal atrophy is present. Exocrine pancreatic function parameters are associated with the changes of intestinal mucosal morphology in three consecutive phases of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and potential pathogenetic factors of hypertransaminasaemia in patients with coeliac disease prior to initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) and to assess the course of transaminases on a GFD. PATIENTS: A retrospective study was made of 178 patients with coeliac disease (130 women, 48 men; median age 36 years; range 17-84 years) at the gastroenterological department of a university hospital. METHODS: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured prior to initiation of a GFD and at 3, 6 and 12 months of GFD. Intestinal permeability, a test for functional integrity of the small bowel, was investigated before starting a GFD in 116 patients by an oral test using lactulose and mannitol. RESULTS: In 72 patients (40.4%) AST and/or ALT were increased prior to initiation of a GFD. Within 1 year on a GFD ALT and AST normalized except in eight cases (4.6%). The intestinal permeability index (% lactulose/% mannitol in 5 h urine) was higher in patients with elevated (median 0.34; range 0.03-1.43) than in patients with normal transaminases (0.11; 0.02-1.28) (P < 0.0001) and correlated with AST (tau = 0.34; P < 0.0001) and ALT (tau = 0.32; P < 0.0001). In five cases with hypertransaminasaemia a liver biopsy was performed prior to initiation of a GFD. Two patients had mild to moderate hepatitis with septal fibrosis. The other three had minimal lymphocytic infiltrates of the portal tracts. Inflammatory alterations of the bile ducts were not found. CONCLUSION: Hypertransaminasaemia before GFD is frequent in coeliac patients, correlates with intestinal permeability and normalizes on a GFD in most patients. In cases of persistently elevated liver function tests of unknown origin underlying coeliac disease should be considered.},

Untreated coeliac disease is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, particularly of lymphoma. We describe four patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus and coeliac disease who developed lymphoma. CASE REPORTS: Two patients were male and two female. In three patients, coeliac disease and lymphoma were diagnosed simultaneously. Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma occurred in two patients, Hodgkin's disease in one, and B cell lymphoma in one. Response to treatment was in general poor, and three patients died soon after the diagnosis of lymphoma was made. CONCLUSION: As the relative risk of lymphoma is reduced by a gluten-free diet, a high index of suspicion for coeliac disease should exist in all Type 1 diabetic patients with unexplained constitutional or gastrointestinal symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: We modified the surgical procedure for segmental gastrectomy, which is normally used for peptic ulcers, to treat early gastric cancer of the mid-stomach. In this paper, we describe the surgical technique and its results. METHODOLOGY: The location of the tumor was confirmed by intra-operative endoscopic examination. An area 2 cm proximal and distal to the tumor was marked with sutures. Firstly, the lymph nodes were dissected from around the perigastric and along the left gastric and common hepatic arteries. Then, a segmental gastrectomy was performed. The greater omentum, omental sac, and vagal nerve, including the hepatic, pyloric and celiac rami, were left intact. An end-to-end gastrogastrostomy was performed using Gambee's sutures and 4-0 monofilament polydioxanone. Gastric drainage was not necessary. RESULTS: We performed segmental gastrectomies on 30 patients. Tumors less than 1 cm in diameter were found in 4 patients; 1.1-2 cm in 14, 2.1-5 cm in 11, and a tumor exceeding 5.1 cm in one patient. The cancer was confined to the mucosa in 23 patients; in the other 7, it had penetrated the submucosa. No lymph node metastases were found but 2 patients had microscopic invasion or permeation of the lymphatic vessels. One patient required post-operative balloon dilation of the pyloric sphincter for delayed gastric emptying. The remaining patients had no post-operative complications. To date, 29 patients, excluding one who died in a traffic accident, have survived disease-free for a mean of 30 months (range: 7-51). Their body weight and dietary volume returned to pre-operative levels within 12 months of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent segmental gastrectomy have had a reasonably good quality of life in the post-operative follow-up to date.},

The clinical spectrum varies greatly, steatorrhoea and weight loss affecting less than half of the patients. CD should be suspected in case of positive gliadin (IgA and IgG) and endomysial (IgA) antibodies. The diagnosis is based upon histological examination of duodenal biopsies taken during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Most patients respond quickly and satisfactorily to treatment with a gluten-free diet. This treatment also eliminates the excess risk of small bowel malignancy.

   abstract = {AIM: Until now IgA-EmA and IgA-AGA antibodies have been considered to be specific and sensitive markers of celiac disease. Anew antibody, the tissue transglutaminase (IgA-tTG), antibody has recently been identified, which is believed to be if not a better marker then a more practical one in screening for celiac disease, especially in large populations. To evaluate the usefulness of the IgA-tTG antibody in the diagnosis and screening of celiac disease and to determine the relationship between this antibody and other better known and over-used antibodies, antigliadin (IgA-AGA) and antiendomysial (IgA-EmA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was performed in 115 children divided into three groups: 31 patients diagnosed with the celiac disease, according to the ESPGAN criteria; 21 patients with celiac disease following a gluten free diet, and 63 considered as control group. Two enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assays (ELISA) were used to detect AGA and tTG antibodies, respectively. EmA antibodies were determined by using an indirect immunofluorescence technique with commercial sections of distal monkey oesophagus as antigen. RESULTS: In the 115 patients taken as a whole, the tTG antibody showed 91% agreement with the EmA antibody and 85% agreement with the AGA antibody. In the celiac group, agreement was 84% and 61% respectively. Sensitivity of the tTG antibody was 83% compared with 94% for EmA and 74% for AGA. Specificity was similar in all three tests. CONCLUSIONS: The ELISA test for tTG correlates well with the traditional AGA and EmA tests and could be used as a new test for celiac disease. The procedure is simple and shows high specificity and sensitivity compared with classical EmA and AGA tests and does not involve subjective scoring. It is cheap and very well suited for large scale screening for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis is a severe form of allergy; the reaction is caused by ingestion of a specific food before exercise. This disorder often escapes diagnosis because neither the ingested food nor the exercise alone induces the symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to characterize the allergens involved in wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis and to describe the clinical outcome in a series of 18 adult patients. METHODS: All 18 patients had experienced recurrent episodes of generalized urticaria during exercise, 17 patients in association with collapse and 15 patients with an anaphylactic reaction. The symptoms appeared only when the patients had eaten food containing wheat before exercise. Wheat allergens were detected by immunoblotting, purified by gel filtration and reversed-phase chromatography, and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The IgE-binding ability of the purified proteins was studied by ELISA, and their in vivo reactivity was studied by skin prick testing. RESULTS: IgE antibodies from pooled patient sera were bound to 65-kd and 40-kd wheat proteins in immunoblotting. The 65-kd allergen was a previously undescribed wheat protein, showing 61% sequence identity to gamma-gliadin, whereas the 40-kd allergen had 100% identity to alpha-gliadin. In ELISA, all 18 patients showed elevated IgE levels to the novel gamma-like gliadin, and 13 of the patients showed elevated IgE levels to the alpha-gliadin. None of the 54 control subjects with wheat allergy, urticaria, or coeliac disease had IgE antibodies to the gamma-like gliadin. The in vivo reactivity of the gamma-like gliadin was verified by positive skin prick test responses in all of the 15 patients who were tested. During the follow-up on a gluten-free or wheat-free diet, 3 patients experienced reactions after having unknowingly eaten wheat before exercise, but all the other patients who were adhering to the diet remained symptom-free. CONCLUSION: This study shows that wheat is a frequent cause of food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis and suggests that the major allergen is a previously undescribed gamma-like gliadin. For screening of this life-threatening allergy, we recommend skin prick testing with crude gliadin and we recommend a gluten-free diet for treatment.},

The underlying immunological mechanisms causing the disorder are still being worked out. In recent years a wide range of clinical presentations has become increasingly apparent, as has a lengthening list of associated conditions. Severe malabsorption with steatorrhoea and profound weight loss is seen infrequently, perhaps as a result of earlier diagnosis and the recognition of 'silent' and 'latent' disease. The prevalence of CD as judged by population screening with, in particular, anti-endomysial antibodies, appears to be much higher than that found with clinically apparent cases. There are a variety of well recognized complications, the commonest probably being osteopenia and osteoporosis. The marked increased risk of lymphoma can be avoided by a strict gluten-free diet. Follow-up of patients needs to be lifelong with prompt investigation of new symptoms and blood test abnormalities.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is associated with pancreatico-biliary disease. Postulated mechanisms include reduced gallbladder emptying due to impaired cholecystokinin release and pancreatitis due to malnutrition. We hypothesize that celiac disease may also be associated with pancreatico-biliary abnormalities due to duodenal inflammation and papillary stenosis. METHODS: Over a 48-month period, 169 patients referred for possible sphincter of Oddi dysfunction who underwent pancreatico-biliary manometry were tested for gliadin and endomysial antibodies. Duodenal and papillary biopsies were preformed in those patients who were positive. RESULTS: Celiac disease was diagnosed in 12 (7.1%; 3 men, 9 women). The mean age was 61 years as compared with 37 years for those patients without celiac disease. All of the celiac patients had been referred for recurrent abdominal pain and/or idiopathic pancreatitis. Ten had idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis with elevated amylase and lipase levels. Two of these patients also had mildly elevated liver function tests associated with the abdominal pain. Only 3 of 12 patients had a prior diagnosis of celiac disease. These 12 patients had manometric evidence of stenosis and histologic evidence of periampullary inflammation as well as histologic changes consistent with celiac disease. In 10 of 12 patients sphincterotomy or extension of a prior papillotomy was performed. Two patients were treated with a gluten-free diet alone. CONCLUSIONS: We describe 12 patients with papillary stenosis and celiac disease. In 9 cases the celiac disease was a new diagnosis. Celiac disease should be considered in the etiology of papillary stenosis or idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis.},

   abstract = {AIMS: We recently showed that refractory sprue is distinct from coeliac disease, the former being characterized by abnormal intraepithelial T-lymphocytes expressing a cytoplasmic CD3 chain (CD3c), lacking CD3 and CD8 surface expression, and showing TCRgamma gene rearrangements. To take advantage of the abnormal phenotype of CD3c + CD8 - intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) in refractory sprue we developed a simple method to distinguish coeliac disease from refractory sprue. METHODS AND RESULTS: Comparative immunohistochemical studies using anti-CD3 and anti-CD8 antibodies were applied on paraffin-embedded and frozen biopsy specimens in refractory sprue (n = 6), coeliac disease (n = 10), healthy controls (n = 5) and suspected refractory sprue (n = 6). Comparable results were obtained on fixed and frozen biopsy specimens. In four of the six patients with suspected refractory sprue, abnormal CD3c + CD8 - IEL and TCRgamma gene rearrangements were found, as in refractory sprue; the remaining two patients had normal (CD3 + CD8 +) IEL and no TCRgamma gene rearrangements. Both patients had coeliac disease, as one failed to comply with a gluten-free diet, while the other was a slow responder. CONCLUSION: This simplified immunostaining method using anti-CD3 and anti-CD8 antibodies on paraffin sections can distinguish active coeliac disease from refractory sprue and should prove useful in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Several gastrointestinal motor abnormalities have been detected in patients with celiac disease, but it is unclear whether they are able to influence the gastric emptying rate. The aim of this work was to evaluate the gastric emptying rate of solids in children with celiac disease before and after a gluten-free diet. Nine children with celiac disease and nine healthy controls (age range 4-16 y) underwent a 13C-octanoic acid breath test to measure gastric emptying. Half emptying time (t1/2) and lag phase (t(lag)) were calculated. After 6 mo of a gluten-free diet, all celiac children underwent a repeat 13C-octanoic acid breath test. The gastric motility parameters, t1/2 and t(lag), were significantly longer in patients than in controls. No significant correlation between abnormal gastric emptying and specific symptom patterns or severity of histological damage was found. On a gluten-free diet, the gastric emptying rate normalized in all celiac patients. This finding supports the hypothesis that gluten-driven mucosal inflammation might determine motor abnormalities by affecting smooth muscle contractility or impairing the release of neurotransmitters. Alternatively, nutrient malabsorption might determine significant changes in intraluminal milieu, which, in turn, may affect intestinal motor functions. CONCLUSION: patients affected by celiac disease have a markedly delayed gastric emptying of solids, which returns to normal after gluten withdrawal.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is characterized by a chronic immune response to dietary gluten, in which T cell responses result in elevated mucosal levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, which induce profound mucosal remodeling associated with increased enterocyte proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. Reduced intestinal expression of the morphoregulatory cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, which forms complexes with beta-catenin, can increase enterocyte proliferation and migration. However, its mechanism of action in gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions and any involvement in celiac disease is unknown. In this study, we describe changes in E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression in celiac disease tissue and determine the effect of cytokines on their expression in an in vitro model. We assessed E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression in intestinal biopsies from 24 patients with celiac disease, 12 patients with treated celiac disease, and 10 healthy patients by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy. Using Caco-2 cells, we examined the effect of TNF-alpha, IL-1, IFN-gamma, and TGF-beta on E-cadherin expression. E-cadherin transcription was assessed in both intestinal biopsies and Caco-2 cells by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR, respectively. A marked reduction in protein expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin that returns to normal levels after treatment was observed in celiac disease; this reduction was associated with reduced levels of E-cadherin mRNA. E-cadherin expression in Caco-2 cells was significantly reduced after TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IFN-gamma stimulation. The effect of TNF-alpha on E-cadherin expression was maximal after stimulation for 48 hours and also induced modest reductions in beta-catenin expression. The action of TNF-alpha on E-cadherin was reversible and was shown to act at the transcriptional level. These results demonstrate the novel findings that E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression are reversibly down-regulated in celiac disease and that such changes in epithelial cadherin/catenin complexes may be mediated by cytokines acting on cadherin transcription.},

The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence of EMA of IgG isotype in EMA IgA negative children with clinical suspicion of malabsorption and their relationship with CD. Serum EMA IgG1 determination was performed on 30 EMA IgA negative children with clinical suspicion of CD. Total serum IgA levels were further investigated. Sixty children with gastroenterological diseases other than CD were used as control disease patients and 63 healthy children were evaluated as the control group. Eighteen out of 30 children in the study showed EMA IgG1 positivity in sera and a villous height/crypt depth ratio <3:1 as index of intestinal atrophy. It is noticeable that a selective IgA deficiency was present in only 9 of 18 EMA IgG1 positive children. In addition, clinical symptoms, EMA IgG1, and mucosal atrophy disappeared after 8-10 mo on a gluten-free diet. Neither EMA IgA nor EMA IgG1 were detected in the children in the control groups. The other 12 children in study group showed no histologic abnormalities and were EMA IgG1 negative. In this study, we reveal a group of EMA IgG1 CD children without IgA deficiency. The diagnosis was based on the presence of gluten-dependent typical serological and histologic features of CD. Our data suggest that EMA IgG1 determination could be a new tool in the diagnostic workup of CD, useful in avoiding possible misdiagnosis.},

Failure to thrive, anemia, and muscle wasting are more common in children. Symptomatic CD represents the tip of the iceberg. Clinically there may be overt, silent, latent and potential CD. Modified ESPGAN criteria for diagnosis of CD is based on demonstration of characteristic histological changes in small intestinal biopsy while on gluten, and unequivocal clinical improvement when on gluten free diet. However, in developing countries there are several conditions which can give rise to villous atrophy and using it as a diagnostic criteria may lead to overdiagnosis of CD. IgA antigliadin antibody has a high sensitivity (98%) and specificity (90%) for CD and hence, may be an ideal adjunct to modified ESPGAN criteria in the diagnosis of CD in India.},

METHODS: Angioplasty for atherosclerotic stenosis of celiac arteries was performed in 30 male white rabbits after being fed with cholesterol-supplemented diet for 8 weeks, which were then randomized to control group, high-cholesterol group and XZhK group. After 4 weeks, the local vessels were collected for morphological observation. C-myc mRNA level was measured with RT-PCR and C-myc protein with immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Morphological observation showed that the neointimal area in the XZhK group were less than the control group (P < 0.05), and that in control group were less than that in the high-cholesterol group (P < 0.05). The levels of C-myc mRNA measured with RT-PCR and the percentage of C-myc protein positive cell by immunohistochemical analysis were lower in the XZhK group than in the control and high-cholesterol group (P < 0.05), The levels in the latter two groups showed no difference (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: XZhK can inhibit the neointimal proliferation and the expression of C-myc gene after angioplasty in rabbits.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disorder of the small intestine induced by cereal prolamins. The demonstration of IgA endomysial antibodies (EMA) is currently the most reliable serological screen for CD. The antigenic target is transglutaminase. The aim of this study was to develop an ELISA assay for the detection of antibodies to transglutaminase (TGA), and to assess the sensitivity and specificity of TGA for the detection of celiac disease against the benchmarks of jejunal biopsy, antigliadin antibodies (AGA) and EMA. Sera from 57 patients with celiac disease were tested for IgA and IgG TGA, IgA EMA, IgA and IgG AGA, and the total IgA level. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and concordance of AGA, EMA and TGA were assessed against the gold-standard biopsy result. IgG plus IgA TGA offered 100% sensitivity in CD patients for whom no dietary intervention had been commenced, with a specificity of 61%. The sensitivity of TGA dropped from 100 to 79% after dietary restriction. In patients on no gluten restriction, there was 100% agreement between TGA and EMA, and 100% agreement between TGA and AGA for the IgA isotype. The false-positive rate for TGA was 53% in Down's syndrome patients and 25% in patients with systemic autoimmune disorders. We conclude that testing for TGA is a reliable diagnostic serology for celiac disease, with improved sensitivity compared with established methods. The results suggest that serial TGA measurements may be a more and accurate marker for dietary compliance than AGA, but prospective studies are required.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disorder of the upper small intestine in which gluten acts as an essential factor in its pathogenesis. Although it is generally accepted that cereal protein activation of the immune system is involved in CD progression, a non-immunomediated cytotoxic activity of gliadin-derived peptides on the jejunal/duodenal tract cannot be excluded. In this work, considering that (a) little has been reported about the intracellular metabolic events associated with gliadin toxicity, and (b) an important role for free radicals in a number of gastrointestinal disease has been demonstrated, we investigated the in vitro effects of gliadin-derived peptides on redox metabolism of Caco-2 intestinal cells during a kinetic study in which cells were exposed to peptic-tryptic digest of bread wheat up to 48 h. We found that the antiproliferative effects displayed by gliadin exposure was associated with intracellular oxidative imbalance, characterised by an increased presence of lipid peroxides, an augmented oxidised (GSSG)/reduced (GSH) glutathione ratio and a loss in protein-bound sulfhydryl groups. Significant structural perturbations of the cell plasma membrane were also detected. Additional experiments performed by using the specific GSH-depleting agent buthionine sulfoximine provide evidence that the extent of gliadin-induced cell growth arrest critically depends upon the 'basal' redox profile of the enterocytes. On the whole, these findings seem to suggest that, besides the adoption of a strictly gluten-free diet, the possibility for an adjuvant therapy with antioxidants may be considered for CD patients.},

   abstract = {The vast majority of patients with celiac disease respond to a gluten-free diet; yet, a small number of refractory patients do not respond and have persistent malabsorption and residual mucosal abnormalities of the small intestine. The histologic features of refractory/unclassified sprue have been published as case reports, often without long-term follow up, and no clear histologic picture has emerged. We present the results of a long-term study of the clinical and histologic features of 10 patients with refractory/unclassified sprue. The histologic features of small bowel biopsies in this group of patients were compared with those of 10 patients with responsive celiac disease and with 10 patients without malabsorption who had normal duodenal biopsies. Five of the 10 refractory patients ultimately developed collagenous sprue as a distinct histologic marker of refractory disease. Additional distinctive findings found in small bowel biopsies in the refractory group were subcryptal chronic inflammation (10 of 10) and marked mucosal thinning in three patients. Other nonspecific findings included acute inflammation and gastric metaplasia. One patient with collagenous sprue developed a B-cell lymphoma of the ileum, and in general collagenous sprue was associated with a poor prognosis. Two of five patients died whereas two others require total parenteral nutrition for survival. Pathologists evaluating small bowel biopsies in the setting of malabsorption should be aware of the subtle histologic changes described here that may portend a refractory course.},

Although the true nature of this condition needs to be further elucidated, it is known to represent a difficult therapeutical problem with potentially fatal course. Herein, we report a patient with refractory sprue-like disease who after failing to respond to corticosteroids and TPN was in a critical condition. He responded promptly to cyclosporine and made a remarkable recovery. In contrast to previous reports, the cyclosporine treatment in this patient was pursued only for 1 month, whereupon the patient turned responsive to steroids. Subsequent treatment with azathioprine allowed corticosteroids to be reduced to a low maintenance dose and eventually all drugs could be discontinued without reappearance of symptoms. Cyclosporine therapy might be lifesaving in occasional patients with refractory sprue-like disease and it may result in reversal of steroid resistance. Moreover, azathioprine seems to have a steroid sparing effect in this setting. Short term immunosuppressive treatment may have an advantage of lower risk for drug related side effects.},

   abstract = {The multiple effects of vagotomy on the thermoregulatory response to systemic inflammation are reviewed (primarily, for the model of intravenous lipopolysaccharide administration in the rat). The following conclusions are drawn. (1) Vagotomy-associated thermoeffector insufficiency is likely to account for the attenuation of the fever response observed in some--but not all--studies; such an insufficiency is, however, preventable by postoperative care, including the use of a liquid diet. (2) The febrile response to low doses of lipopolysaccharide (monophasic fever) is mediated by the hepatic (but not gastric or celiac) vagal fibers, presumably afferent; the same fibers are likely to be involved in the development of tolerance to low doses of circulating endotoxins. (3) Phase 1 of the polyphasic febrile response to moderate doses of lipopolysaccharide involves capsaicin-sensitive afferents (either nonvagal only or both nonvagal and vagal), does not involve cholecystokinin A-receptors, and may involve peripheral prostaglandins. (4) Febrile phase 2 does not require the integrity of abdominal nerve fibers, either vagal or nonvagal, at least in the rat. (5) Phase 3 of the febrile response to intravenous lipopolysaccharide (and perhaps the response to intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide) involves capsaicin-insensitive vagal fibers, presumably efferent; the involvement of these fibers in febrigenic mechanisms is strongly modulated by an unknown factor. (6) A hepatoceliac vagal, presumably efferent, mechanism ('an anti-inflammatory pathway') counteracts the development of lipopolysaccharide-induced hypothermia and shock.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is highly associated with celiac disease. Recently, tissue transglutaminase (tTG) was identified as the autoantigen of IgA antibodies in celiac disease. The prevalence of antibodies to tTG in DH patients is not known. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether DH patients show circulating IgA autoantibodies to tTG, to compare their serum levels with those from patients with other subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases, and to correlate levels of antibodies to tTG with the extent of small bowel disease. METHODS: Sera were obtained from consecutive patients with DH (n = 11), linear IgA disease (n = 15), bullous pemphigoid (n = 10), and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (n = 6) and were studied by indirect immunofluorescence on monkey esophagus and NaCl-split human skin. IgA reactivity to tTG was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The extent of mucosal involvement in jejunal biopsy specimens was assessed according to the grading of Marsh. RESULTS: All untreated DH patients showed circulating IgA autoantibodies to tTG. One DH patient already undergoing therapy, the 15 patients with linear IgA disease, and all other controls revealed no autoantibodies to tTG. In addition, serum levels of IgA anti-tTG antibodies reflected the degree of histopathologic changes in jejunal mucosa from biopsy specimens in DH patients. CONCLUSION: Our results show that circulating IgA autoantibodies to tTG are detectable in DH but not in linear IgA disease or other subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases. The levels of IgA anti-tTG antibodies reflect the extent of histopathologic changes of the jejunal mucosa in DH.},

   abstract = {The mucosal lesion in coeliac disease (CD) represents an immunologically mediated injury triggered by gliadin and is restricted by a particular assortment of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. Therefore, immunomodulatory strategies to tolerize gliadin-specific, class II-restricted T-cell responses could represent an alternative to current treatments of CD, which are based on a gluten-free diet. In this study, BALB/c mice derived from a gluten-free diet colony were tolerized by either intranasal (i.n.) or intravenous (i.v.) administration of single or multiple doses of gliadin. While a single dose failed to induce tolerance, a significant decrease in gliadin-specific T-cell proliferation was detected (P < 0.001) after multiple i.n. or i.v. administrations. No significant difference in antibody titre was detected for antigen-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) or the IgG1 subclass, but a lower IgG2a-specific titre was observed. Both interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin (IL)-2 expression, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were reduced on antigen administration, both i.v. and i.n. Neither regimen showed a regulatory effect on IL-4 production. As T helper 1 (Th1) cytokines seem to be important in the pathogenesis of CD, our data therefore highlight the potential of i.n. and i.v. routes for the design of useful immunomodulatory strategies for CD.},

This study assesses for the first time the sensitivity and reliability of anti-endomysium in screening for coeliac disease in patients with milder forms of villous atrophy using human umbilical cord and monkey ileum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum from 124 adults and children > 2 years old including 33 patients with coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet and 91 patients referred to the laboratory for screening was studied. The presence of IgA-anti-gliadin (AGA) (ELISA) and IgA-anti-endomysium (EMA) was detected in the serum using monkey ileum and human umbilical cord (HUC) substrates. Patients with abnormal serology results or severe clinical complaints were invited to attend for a small-bowel biopsy. The prevalence of EMA detected on monkey ileum and HUC was compared with the histopathological features of coeliac disease at presentation. Fifty-three of the 91 patients screened for coeliac disease underwent a small intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: Twenty-three of the 91 patients suspected of having coeliac disease had coeliac disease. The EMA test was positive in 18 of 23 using both monkey ileum and HUC (sensitivity 78%). Partial villous atrophy (PVA) was seen in four of the five EMA-negative patients, and subtotal/total villous atrophy (SVA/TVA) was demonstrated in 18 of the 23 cases with positive EMA. Both substrates detected identical positive cases. There was an excellent concordance between EMA sensitivity evaluated on HUC and those on monkey ileum. One patient was EMA-negative on monkey ileum but positive on HUC and one patient who was EMA-positive on monkey ileum was EMA-negative on HUC. Only one of 33 coeliac disease patients on gluten-free diet for more than one year with persisting TVA had positive EMA. The rest of the cases had a negative EMA on both HUC and monkey ileum. CONCLUSION: A negative result for EMA in coeliac disease patients with a normal IgA value does not exclude the diagnosis of coeliac disease. A positive EMA is seen mostly in those coeliac disease patients with severe tissue damage (SVA/TVA). EMA has a low sensitivity in coeliac disease patients with PVA in spite of use of different substrates.},

DESIGN: The aim of this study was to investigate the age at menarche in patients with CD and in mothers of patients. MATERIALS: 59 mother/daughter pairs; daughter with coeliac disease: 49--treated with a gluten-free diet [FGD (+)] and 10 with untreated or late onset coeliac disease [FGD (-)]. METHODS: CD was diagnosed on the basis of ESPGAN criteria. All patients and mothers were asked for information on the age at menarche. RESULTS: The mean age of menarche was significantly higher in FGD (-): girls--mean 16.16 years and mother's--mean 15.49 years, than in FGD (+) patients. The mean age of menarche in FGD (+) patients and mother's were: 12.33 and 13.82 years respectively in the country (11 pairs), 13.08 and 13.49 years respectively in the little town (19 pairs), 12.90 and 13.33 years respectively in the town (19 pairs). CONCLUSIONS: The age at menarche in patients with CD and FGD is decreased to age at menarche in mother's, but is higher in the untreated CD patients and mother's. These findings support the hypothesis that the age at menarche in girls with coeliac disease is regulated by gluten-free diet and by other genetic and environmental factors.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy, characterized by villous atrophy, which is reversed by gluten withdrawal. A minority of patients with celiac-like enteropathy are resistant to gluten-free diet, so-called refractory sprue, or unclassified sprue. Refractory sprue is a diagnosis of exclusion; all other causes of a celiac-like enteropathy must be eliminated before a diagnosis of refractory sprue can be made. Recent evidence suggests that refractory sprue comprises a heterogenous group of patients with diverse underlying causes. A small proportion of these patients seem to have an adult form of autoimmune enteropathy, characterized by the presence of antienterocyte antibodies. However, a larger group of patients with refractory sprue now seem to have a cryptic intestinal T-cell lymphoma, characterized by the presence of phenotypically abnormal, monoclonal intraepithelial lymphocytes, despite benign cytology. Current therapeutic options include nutritional support and immunosuppressive therapy, but response is variable. The prognosis of refractory sprue may be poor; patients may die of severe malabsorption, or through synchronous or metachronous development of an enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Based on this recent evidence, patients with refractory sprue should be screened for antienterocyte antibodies and have T-cell receptor and monoclonal antibody studies performed; this could facilitate identification of cases of adult-onset autoimmune enteropathy and those of cryptic T-cell lymphoma. Moreover, early recognition of the malignant nature of the intestinal infiltrate in some cases of refractory sprue could permit the development of novel chemotherapeutic regimens for this condition.},

Diagnosis may be delayed because the presentation is highly variable. OBJECTIVE: To outline an approach to diagnosis and management of coeliac disease. DISCUSSION: Newer, more specific serological testing is helpful in screening asymptomatic individuals but endoscopic small intestinal biopsy is required for diagnostic certainty. A gluten free diet induces remission but not cure. Lifelong adherence reduces the risk of complications, including malignancy. All patients diagnosed with coeliac disease require expert dietetic assessment and counselling and all should be encouraged to join their state Coeliac Society. Excellent internet based sites now offer appropriate information for patients and their families.},

Celiac disease is an inflammation most frequently affecting the proximal small intestine, depending on the presence of gluten in the diet, whose pathogenesis seems to be immunological in nature. 107 cases were divided in three groups following clinical manifestations types at hospitalisation time: typical digestive, untypical digestive and extra digestive manifestations. Intestinal biopsies, made with Crosby probe, in children aged between 1.3 and 8 years (one single case was diagnosed as late as at the age of 15), regardless of gender. Then we analysed morphologically (HE usual and PAS histochemical staining) and immunohistochemically (lymphocytes B, T with possible subtypes). The lesions were counted at the first biopsy according to the Marsh score. The immunohistochemical tests have indicated the prevalence of T lymphocytes (UCHL1, CD3, CD4, CD8, gamma-delta) both in the luminal epithelium with various degrees of aggression in lamina propria and also spread in stroma. B-lymphocytes (L26) are distributed prevalently nodular in stroma. In conclusion, it is CD4 T cells that are present in particular in the control of the gluten immune response in patients with Marsh I and Marsh III lesions.},

PATIENTS: We examined 120 serum samples from patients with celiac disease (CD) including 72 on a gluten-free diet (GFD) and eleven on a gluten challenge, 47 with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) including 16 on a GFD and one on a gluten challenge, 96 with non-CD gastrointestinal diseases, and 117 with others; i.e. 380 serum samples altogether. Follow-up sera from 13 patients were included. METHODS: Results of an ELISA with guinea pig liver tTG were compared with the EMA test using monkey esophagus. Inhibition of endomysial staining was performed with sera positive on the EMA test but negative with the guinea pig tTG ELISA. RESULTS: The specificity and sensitivity of the tTG ELISA are high (98.6% and 92.5%). The serum IgA antibody titers against tTG decrease after introduction of a GFD. In one case, endomysial staining could not be inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the guinea pig tTG ELISA is suitable for use as a simple diagnostic screening and follow-up method for GSE. Further studies are necessary to identify possible additional minor antigens in GSE.},

Duodenal biopsies revealed subtotal villous atrophy of the mucosa of the small intestine. A strict gluten-free diet led to an increase in serum iron, resolution of anaemia, and restitution of normal mucosal morphology. Thus, severe iron-deficiency anaemia associated with asymptomatic coeliac disease is responsible to gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a 1-year gluten-free diet on bone metabolism and nutritional status in coeliac disease. METHODS: Bone mineral density, serum indices of bone remodelling, clinical and biochemical nutritional assessment were evaluated in 86 consecutive newly-diagnosed, biopsy proven, coeliac disease patients (untreated). A complete reevaluation, including intestinal biopsy, was repeated within 1 year of dietary treatment (treated). RESULTS: Untreated: according to WHO criteria, 34% of patients had a normal bone mineral density, 40% had osteopenia and 26% osteoporosis. Between males and females there were no statistical differences in bone metabolism or in most of the nutritional indices, while, between fertile and postmenopausal women, bone mineral density and several bone metabolism markers were significantly different. Compared to subjects with a normal bone mineral density, osteopenics had higher bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and Bone-Gla-protein (BGP) values. In patients with a concomitant BAP increase and 25OH vitamin D serum level reduction, bone mineral density and several bone turnover markers were statistically different compared to patients without such a serological pattern. Treated: notwithstanding intestinal biopsy which showed a mucosal recovery in only 57%, gluten-free diet led, even in postmenopausal women, to a significant improvement in bone mineral density, bone metabolism and nutrition, except for folic acid, albumin and pre-albumin serum levels which persisted as abnormal in patients with obdurate mucosal impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac disease patients are at high risk for developing a low bone mineral density and bone turnover impairment. A gluten-free diet can improve this situation even in postmenopausal women and in patients with incomplete mucosal recovery.},

The latter has recently been identified as the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG). The linkage between gliadins, tTG and the autoimmune response has still to be clarified. In this work we report the production and analysis of a phage antibody library from the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PLB) of a CD patient. The library contained polyreactive and monoreactive antibodies to alpha-gliadin, to the dietary antigen beta-lactoglobulin, but not to tTG. The majority of the VH regions of the anti-alpha-gliadin antibodies belonged to the VH 4 family. The possibility of exploiting phage display antibodies as tools to study the molecular events associated with CD is discussed.},

METHODS: A cohort of 403 Austrian children and adolescents with type I diabetes mellitus (210 males and 193 females; age range, 1-22 years) was screened for celiac disease using the IgA anti-endomysium antibody test (EMA) and the immunoglobulin (Ig)G anti-gliadin (AGA-IgG) and IgA anti-gliadin (AGA-IgA) antibody test. RESULTS: Twelve patients' sera (2.98%) yielded positive EMA results and two patients' sera (0.49%) with IgA deficiency had high AGA-IgG values. All but one of these patients underwent intestinal biopsy. Six (1.49%) had clear histologic evidence of CD (flat mucosa), whereas three (0.74%) showed minor histologic changes (increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes) and four (0.99%), including the EMA-negative patients with IgA deficiency, had a normal mucosa. When the cases with silent and potential CD were combined, the overall prevalence in the current cohort was 2.98%. There was no difference in the hemoglobin (Hb)A1c level between antibody-positive and -negative patients, and subsequent gluten-free diet did not change this metabolic parameter. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of clinically unrecognized CD, found by EMA screening, is much higher in Austrian children with diabetes than in a comparable population without diabetes. The prevalence of CD in diabetic children in Austria is distinctly lower, however, than in several other countries.},

METHODS: The level of IgA-gliadin antibodies (IgA-AGA), of IgA-containing circulating immune complexes (IgA-CIC), and the degree of glomerular IgA deposits were compared between marmosets suffering from WMS and animals not affected by the disorder. RESULTS: Both IgA-AGA and IgA-CIC were demonstrable in all groups of monkeys investigated. IgA-AGA and IgA-CIC were significantly higher in monkeys with WMS than in non-affected animals. There was a significant correlation between the glomerular IgA-deposition and titre of IgA-AGA. The group of marmosets strongly positive for glomerular IgA deposits comprised significantly more animals suffering from WMS than the group without deposits. In the diet of the animals a considerable amount of gliadin-like cereal proteins was assayed. CONCLUSIONS: There are several parallels between the human disorders (coeliac disease and IgA-nephropathy/Berger's disease) and the changes observed in WMS. It should be further investigated if WMS in marmosets is a suitable animal model for both human diseases.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a major cause of intestinal malabsorption. Previous studies have demonstrated that celiac disease is associated with significant osteoporotic bone loss. These studies have suggested that successful treatment of the malabsorption is associated with amelioration of the bone loss. Such studies have failed to examine bone mass at peripheral skeletal sites which is more likely to be responsive to changes in parathyroid hormone (PTH) in response to calcium malabsorption. We have examined bone density in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and distal forearm in 35 patients with celiac disease who had been established on gluten-free diet. In addition, the concentrations of PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) were measured. Bone density was below that expected for the subject's age and gender at all sites. This was most marked in the distal forearm where the bone density was 1.40 SD below expected (p < 0.0001). In the forearm, there was a negative relationship between bone density and PTH concentration (r = -0.49, p = 0.009). In the forearm and lumbar spine, there was a negative relationship between 1,25(OH)2D concentration and bone density. Bone mass was not related to the concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D at any of the skeletal sites measured. Bone density is reduced in the peripheral skeleton in celiac disease and this deficit persists despite treatment with apparent normalization at axial skeletal sites. This reduction in bone mass is related to the presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism which should be sought in all patients with treated celiac disease.},

However, in many this is not the case. This study aims to determine whether this persistent villous atrophy (VA) could be due to continued ingestion of the trace amounts of gluten in 'gluten-free' foods, as defined by the WHO/FAO Codex Alimentarius. METHODS: Duodenal biopsy specimens from 89 adults with long-standing coeliac disease were examined, and the findings correlated with their form of gluten-free diet. RESULTS: In 51 subjects the duodenal specimen was normal, whereas in 38 there was villous atrophy (partial, 28; subtotal, 8; total, 2). There was no relationship between the presence or absence of VA and ingestion of either a GFD as defined by the Codex Alimentarius (Codex-GFD; 39 patients) or a GFD that contained no detectable gluten (NDG diet: 50 patients). Intraepithelial lymphocyte counts were higher, and lactase levels lower, in subjects with an abnormal biopsy specimen than in those in whom it was normal. However, within each of these biopsy groups there was no difference in these variables between patients on a Codex-GFD and those on an NDG-GFD. IgA antigliadin antibody was detected in 4 of 29 patients on a Codex-GFD and in 3 of 13 on a NDG-GFD (NS). CONCLUSION: The persistent mucosal abnormalities seen in patients with coeliac disease on a GFD are not due to the ingestion of trace amounts of gluten. The consequences of these abnormalities have yet to be determined.},

   abstract = {Several gastrointestinal and liver diseases impair the absorption of calcium, phosphate, and/or vitamin D, and are associated with an increased incidence of bone disease. Changes in bone mineral density (BMD) using dual-energy X-ray absorptiomety (DXA) have been best studied in the malabsorptive disorder, celiac disease. Celiac disease is an inflammatory condition of the small intestine triggered by ingesting gluten present in wheat, rye, or barley. Chronic inflammation leads to intestinal atrophy and nutrient malabsorption. The disease affects the proximal small bowel; the site where calcium is best absorbed. About 70% of adults with celiac disease have abnormally low BMD values. Treatment with a gluten-free diet increases BMD, but not to normal values. As celiac disease may not be detected until adult life, the failure to reach normal BMD on a gluten-free diet can be explained, at least in part, by the failure to reach peak bone mass. All individuals with malabsorptive disorders should be screened for secondary bone disease. The development of easier and less expensive methods to assess BMD will facilitate screening those at risk for bone disease.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: It has recently been suggested that in adults with coeliac disease, faecal blood loss may play a role in the development of iron deficiency. A group of 45 children diagnosed with coeliac disease during 1996 and 1997 were therefore prospectively evaluated for the presence of gluten in their diet, iron deficiency anaemia, and faecal occult blood. Sixty children admitted for elective surgery or asthma served as controls. Faecal occult blood was found in four iron deficient children on normal diet, of whom three were newly diagnosed. Occult blood loss disappeared in three of the four children when gluten was removed from their diet. Faecal occult blood was found in 26.7% of children on gluten-containing diet, but not in children on gluten-free diet (P = 0.01), or in control children (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the incidence of occult blood loss in coeliac disease occurs mainly in newly diagnosed cases and responds to a gluten-free diet. Occult blood testing may not be warranted in the absence of iron deficiency anaemia nor in children with iron deficiency anaemia who are on a gluten-free diet.},

Epidemiological surveys show that there is a potential risk for selenium deficiency in pregnant females and in 7-10-year-old children. The negative impact of radiation on serum selenium levels was evidenced by a survey of Chernobyl Atomic Power Station workers. Higher selenium levels in the hairs of the pubis, beard, celiac plexus, and axillary spaces than those in the hair of the head (by 1.41, 1.34, 1.36, and 1.14 times, respectively) confirm that there is a relationship between selenium and sexual hormones in the body. Dietary fiber concentrates that are derived from plant materials and contain a complex of structural carbohydrates and lignin may be used in combination with selenium compounds in human diets to prevent selenium deficiency.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is diagnosed by the presence of specific antibodies and a jejunal biopsy showing mucosal atrophy and mononuclear cell infiltration. Mucosal cell-mediated immune response is considered the central event in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease, and untreated coeliac patients show specific features of T-cell activation in the small intestine. Here we describe the use of iodine-123-interleukin-2 scintigraphy in coeliac patients as a non-invasive tool for detection of lymphocytic infiltration in the small bowel and its use for therapy follow-up, and we demonstrate the specificity of binding of labelled-IL2 to activated lymphocytes by ex-vivo autoradiography of jejunal biopsies. 123I-IL2 was administered i.v. [74 MBq (2 mCi)], and gamma camera images were acquired after 1 h. Ten patients were studied with 123I-IL2 scintigraphy at diagnosis and seven were also investigated after 12-19 months of gluten-free diet. Results were expressed as target-to-background radioactivity ratios in six different bowel regions before and after the diet. At the time of diagnosis all patients showed a significantly higher bowel uptake of 123I-IL2 than normal subjects (P < 0.003 in all regions). A significant correlation was found between jejunal radioactivity and the number of IL2R + ve lymphocytes per millimetre of jejunal mucosa as detected by immunostaining of jejunal biopsy (r2 = 0.66; P = 0.008). Autoradiography of jejunal biopsies confirmed that labelled-IL2 only binds to activated T-lymphocytes infiltrating the gut mucosa. After 1 year of the diet, bowel uptake of 123I-IL2 significantly decreased in five out of six regions (P < 0.03), although two patients still had a positive IL2 scintigraphy in one region. We conclude that 123I-IL2 scintigraphy is a sensitive non-invasive technique for assessing in vivo the presence of activated mononuclear cells in the bowel of patients affected by coeliac disease. Unlike jejunal biopsy, this method provides information from the whole intestine and gives a non-invasive measure of the effectiveness of the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent gluten intolerance disorder characterized by malabsorption, intestinal mucosa villus atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. Clinical and histologic features improve in persons consuming a gluten free diet. The pathogenesis of CD involves environmental, genetic, and immunologic factors. METHODS: The frequencies of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles were evaluated in white Brazilian patients who had CD and compared with those observed in healthy individuals from the same geographical area (Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo) and of similar ethnic background. Twenty-five patients with CD, 11 females and 14 males, and 91 control individuals were studied. The HLA class II alleles were typed using amplified DNA hybridized with sequence-specific primers. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed Fisher exact test. The relative risk (RR), etiologic fraction (EF), and preventive fraction (PF) were also estimated. The EF represents the attributable risk for the development of CD at the population level, whereas PF represents the protective risk. RESULTS: The frequency of the HLA-DRB1*03, HLA-DRB1*07, and HLA-DQB1*02 alleles was significantly increased in patients. The RR conferred by these alleles was 5.35, 7.15, and 10.6, respectively, and the EF was 48.7%, 44.7%, and 76%, respectively. The frequency of HLA-DQB1*06 alleles was significantly decreased in CD patients, conferring an RR of 0.08 and a PF of 48%. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that HLA-DRB1*03, HLA-DRB1*07, and HLA-DQB1*02 alleles conferred susceptibility to CD in Brazilian patients. In contrast, HLADQB1*06 alleles conferred protection against development of the disease.},

   abstract = {HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 67 year old female patient presented herself to our emergency room with paraesthesia in both hands, chronic diarrhea and continuous weight loss. From the past medical history, only an autoimmune hypothyroidism was known. On initial, examination leading features were carpopedal spasms and a pulse deficit. Her general condition, especially the nutritional status was low. INVESTIGATIONS: Serum levels of potassium (2.2 mmol/l) and calcium (1.45 mmol/l) were low, as well as the levels of total protein (5.1 g/dl) and albumin (2.94 g/dl). Clotting time was prolonged (Quick 51%). The ECG showed a ventricular bigeminus and a prolonged QT-period (120% rel). Endoscopy and biopsy showed a total villous atrophy suggesting celiac disease as probable cause. This was emphasized by the high antibody levels against gliadin (1:80) and endomyosin (1:40). Furthermore, the Human Leukocyte Antigen molecules HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3 showed increased expression. TREATMENT AND COURSE: After normalizing the electrolyte imbalance intravenously the neurological symptoms disappeared as well as the arrhythmia. The QT-period went back to normal. Under initial drip feeding and a strict gluten-free diet the general condition improved quickly and the diarrhea stopped. A follow-up investigation 3 months later showed the woman in a good condition having gained 10 kg weight and an improvement in histological findings, so that diagnosis of celiac disease could be proved. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of ventricular arrhythmia and a prolonged QT-period in the ECG should be taken into account for patients diagnosed with celiac disease, especially in case of electrolyte imbalance. In these cases addition to a strict gluten free diet a rapid correction of the electrolyte imbalance is necessary because of the risk of sudden cardiac death. Furthermore associated disorders like autoimmune diseases expressing the same HLA-antigens (HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3) must be considered. Combined incidence of celiac disease and autoimmune hypothyroidism is well documented. For patients with celiac disease we therefore recommend a routine testing of thyroid hormone levels.},

In Denmark surveys in paediatric departments have shown a prevalence of only 1:10,000. The aim of the present study was to study the prevalence of CD in southern Sweden. METHODS: From October 1996 to February 1997, 1970 healthy blood donors were screened for CD in a serial procedure: first IgA and IgG gliadin antibodies (GA) and then endomysial antibodies in those positive for GA. RESULTS: One patient had previously known CD. Two patients had gastrointestinal symptoms and an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, with improvement on a gluten-free diet. Three of 185 GA-positive blood donors had endomysial antibodies and biopsy-verified CD. Thus, 4 of 1970 blood donors had classic CD, resulting in a prevalence of 1:492 (0.20%)--that is, rather similar to that found in Linkoping, Sweden, and in Finland and Norway. If the two persons with gluten-sensitive diarrhoea were also included, the prevalence was 6:1970 = 1:328, or 0.30%. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of classic CD (1:492) in southern Sweden is comparable to that found in the rest of Scandinavia, except for Denmark.},

Identification of patients with CD has been facilitated in recent years by serological screening, including the use of antigliadin antibodies (AGAs) and endomysial antibodies (EMAs). The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of CD in a clinic-based paediatric population with type 1 DM, and to study longitudinal changes in AGA status. Two-hundred-and-eighty-one children and adolescents with type 1 DM aged 9.9 +/- 3.8 yr were screened using AGAs of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) classes (AGA-IgA and AGA-IgG). Thirty-five patients had both antibodies positive and underwent gastro-duodenoscopy and multiple biopsies. Fifteen of the 35 patients had histological evidence of CD, and the overall clinic prevalence of CD was 5.7%. A number of patients did not exhibit florid symptoms, and recurrent unexplained hypoglycaemia was a significant finding. Patients who perceived themselves to be asymptomatic had more problems with compliance with a gluten-free diet (GFD). Ninety-seven patients had follow-up AGAs performed after 2.5 +/- 1.5 yr. One patient with initially normal AGAs developed positive antibodies and histological findings of CD. Antibody status has fluctuated in other patients. CD is common in patients with DM, and diagnosis is important to detect to minimize long-term morbidity related to both disorders. Initial normal screening does not exclude CD and repeat screening is indicated.},

The small bowel biopsy showed villous atrophy and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate of the lamina propria. The antiendomysial and antireticulin antibodies were negative. The IgA antigliadin antibody was positive (1:120). The patient was initiated on a gluten free diet and oral iron. After four months of treatment, hemoglobin and the iron serum levels were normal and at 6 months, the small bowel biopsy showed striking improvement.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The loss of lactase activity that occurs in active celiac disease resolves on adherence to a gluten-free diet that excludes the cereals wheat, barley, rye, and oats. Recently, an immunohistochemical technique has been described to evaluate lactase expression in primary hypolactasia. We have adapted this method to study lactase activity in adult celiac patients and to assess its value as a diagnostic tool. In addition, given the results of two recent studies suggesting the safety of reintroducing oats cereal into the celiac diet, we have also evaluated the response of lactase expression to oats exposure. METHODS: Duodenal biopsies from 26 patients were stained for lactase expression using an indirect immunoperoxidase method. Eleven disease control patients had normal architecture and nine had features of active celiac disease. Ten patients, who had celiac disease in clinical and histological remission, underwent oats challenge for 12 wk. RESULTS: Confluent expression of lactase was observed in the 11 control patients with normal histology, whereas staining was absent in the nine patients with active celiac disease. All 10 patients with treated celiac disease had normal lactase expression after exposure to oats. CONCLUSIONS: The immunohistochemical technique used in this study provides an easy, reliable method of assessing lactase enzyme and confirms the value of this index as a marker of celiac disease activity. The results of two recent studies demonstrating the lack of oats toxicity in adult celiac patients have been further corroborated by our findings, which show the preservation of lactase enzyme after oats challenge.},

   abstract = {In the past coeliac disease, or intolerance to gluten, has been considered a rare disease in infancy, whose most important signs were chronic diarrhea with malabsorption and reduced growth. However, besides this classical form, there are a number of other clinical and subclinical forms which may appear even in the adult life and without any overt intestinal sign. The alterations may affect, e.g., the liver, thyroid, skin and the female and male reproductive system. The overall prevalence of the different forms of coeliac disease in Western Europe is at least 1:300. The aim of the present paper is to describe and evaluate the effects of coeliac disease on female reproduction. Such effects include delayed menarche, amenorrhea, infertility and early menopause. Epidemiological studies show that besides reduced fertility, affected women are at higher risk of reproductive problems such as pregnancy loss, low birthweight of offspring and reduced duration of breastfeeding. There are no adequate studies to evidentiate a possible increase of birth defects; nevertheless, coeliac disease induces malabsorption, with deficiencies of nutritional factors essential to prenatal development such as iron, folic acid and vitamin K. The mechanisms underlying the reproductive alterations are still awaiting clarification; however, an interaction among specific nutritional deficiencies, endocrine imbalances and immune disturbances is suspected. As for the other effects associated to the coeliac disease, the possible prevention or treatment of the reproductive effects is only the lifelong maintenance of a gluten-free diet.},

In the past, celiac disease has been considered a rare disease of infancy characterized by chronic diarrhea and delayed growth. Besides the overt enteropathy, there are many other forms which appear later in life; target organs are not limited to the gut, but include liver, thyroid, skin and reproductive tract. It is now recognized that celiac disease is a relatively frequent disorder; the overall prevalence is at least 1:300 in Western Europe. Celiac disease may impair the reproductive life of affected women, eliciting delayed puberty, infertility, amenorrhea and precocious menopause. Clinical and epidemiological studies show that female patients with celiac disease are at higher risk of spontaneous abortions, low birth weight of the newborn and reduced duration of lactation. No adequate studies are available on the rate of birth defects in the progeny of affected women; however, celiac disease induces malabsorption and deficiency of factors essential for organogenesis, e.g. iron, folic acid and vitamin K. The overall evidence suggests that celiac disease patients can be a group particularly susceptible to reproductive toxicants; however, the pathogenesis of celiac disease-related reproductive disorders still awaits clarification. At present, like the other pathologies associated with celiac disease, the possible prevention or treatment of reproductive effects can only be achieved through a life-long maintenance of a gluten-free diet.},

It has been stated that poor EFA status is difficult to correct in patients with cystic fibrosis, and an impaired EFA metabolism with reduced synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has been proposed. In this study, the effects of an oral energy supplement rich in linoleic acid were investigated in patients with cystic fibrosis who had a body weight below 95% of normal for height. METHODS: Thirty-six patients (16 girls) more than 4 years of age were randomized either to a control group (n = 20, age 13.3 +/- 3.8 years, mean +/- SD) receiving intensive dietary counseling only, or an intervention group (n = 16, age, 10.4 +/- 4.3 years) treated for 3 months with dietary counseling plus 628 +/- 254 mL (= kcal) per day of an energy supplement rich in fat (31% of energy) and linoleic acid (16% of energy). RESULTS: In contrast to the control group, the patients with supplemented diets achieved significant increases of energy intake (2189 +/- 731 kcal/day vs. 2733 +/- 762 kcal/day), weight for height (82.8% +/- 8.6% vs. 84.8% +/- 9.6% of normal), and body fat (5.1 +/- 1.7 kg vs. 5.8 +/- 2.2 kg) as well as the initially low values of plasma phospholipid linoleic acid (11.8% +/- 1.1% vs. 17.6% +/- 1.6% of total phospholipid fatty acids) and its main metabolite arachidonic acid (4.4% +/- 0.4% vs. 5.9% +/- 0.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cystic fibrosis with low body weight and poor EFA status benefit from EFA-rich energy supplements and can synthesize arachidonic acid from the precursor linoleic acid.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The safety and efficacy of Minimicrospheres, which are enteric-coated, delayed-release pancrelipase capsules, on fat absorption in pediatric/adolescent and adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients was assessed. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, common in CF patients, causes steatorrhea due to insufficient release of pancreatic enzymes. METHODS: In the open-label phase, 97 CF patients with pancreatic insufficiency and steatorrhea were stabilized on a high-fat diet and administered pancrelipase. Seventy-four patients with >80% coefficient of fat absorption received placebo or pancrelipase in the double-blind phase. Fat intake and excretion, stool frequency and consistency, and clinical global improvement were recorded. RESULTS: Average daily fat intake was comparable between treatment groups within each age group (adults vs pediatric/adolescent), but placebo patients had a significant (p < 0.001) mean decrease in coefficient of fat absorption (adult, 36.9 percentage points; pediatric/adolescent, 34.9 percentage points) from open-label to double-blind treatment compared to pancrelipase patients (adult, 2 percentage points; pediatric/adolescent, 3.25 percentage points); this difference was caused by a greater (p < or = 0.001) increase in mean fecal fat excretion (grams per day) in the placebo groups compared to pancrelipase groups (adult: 61.9 vs 2.3; pediatric/adolescent: 45.4 vs 4.1). Change in mean stool frequency from open-label to double-blind phases was significantly different (p < or = 0.002) between treatment groups, with increases in placebo groups and no difference (adult) or decrease (pediatric/adolescent) in pancrelipase groups. Pancrelipase patients' stool consistency remained about the same from open-label to double-blind. Placebo patients' stool consistency decreased (became softer) from open-label pancrelipase to double-blind placebo. Clinical global improvement data showed that > or =83% of pancrelipase patients improved or remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Enteric-coated, delayed-release (Minimicrospheres) pancrelipase capsules are an effective treatment for steatorrhea associated with pancreatic insufficiency in patients with cystic fibrosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Murine T cell mediated acute semiallogeneic graft versus host disease (GVHD) is characterised by lymphocytic infiltrates, crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy. It has been shown that programmed cell death (apoptosis) of the crypt epithelium takes place during the intestinal manifestation of acute GVHD. AIMS: To investigate which of the two most investigated inductors of apoptosis (Fas ligand (FasL) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)) is responsible for the induction of apoptosis in this animal model. METHODS: Animals undergoing acute semiallogeneic GvH reaction were treated with neutralising anti-TNF-alpha, two different anti-FasL antibodies, or pentoxifylline. RESULTS: Anti-TNF-alpha application inhibited the appearance of apoptotic cells in the intestinal mucosa, whereas anti-FasL antibodies had no influence on mucosal apoptosis. In addition, the transfer of FasL deficient (gld) donor lymphocytes still induced crypt cell apoptosis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. Furthermore, when the animals were treated with pentoxifylline, a known inhibitor of TNF-alpha secretion in vitro and in vivo, there was significant normalisation of the intestinal morphology accompanied by inhibition of epithelial apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The FasL-Fas interaction is not involved in the induction of apoptosis during acute GVHD. However, neutralisation of TNF-alpha by an antibody or by pentoxifylline inhibits the occurrence of apoptosis and of mucosal atrophy in this animal model. These results have implications for the treatment of immunologically mediated human atrophic gut diseases-for example, diet refractory cases of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatment of human exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is suboptimal. This study assessed the effects of bacterial lipase, porcine lipase, and diets on carbohydrate, fat, and protein absorption in pancreatic-insufficient dogs. METHODS: Dogs were given bacterial or porcine lipase and 3 diets: a 48% carbohydrate, 27% fat, and 25% protein standard diet; a high-carbohydrate, low-fat, and low-protein diet; or a low-carbohydrate, high-fat, and high-protein diet (66%/18%/16% and 21%/43%/36% calories). RESULTS: With the standard diet, coefficient of fat absorption increased dose-dependently with both lipases (P < 0.05), but more fat was absorbed with porcine lipase (P < 0.05); 600, 000 IU of bacterial lipase (240 mg) and 300,000 IU of porcine lipase (18 g) nearly abolished steatorrhea. With 300,000 IU of bacterial lipase or 135,000 IU of porcine lipase, fat absorption was greater with the high-fat and -protein diet (P < 0.05 vs. low-fat and -protein diet). There were no interactions among carbohydrate, fat, and protein absorption. CONCLUSIONS: Correcting steatorrhea requires 75 times more porcine than bacterial lipase (18 vs. 240 mg). High-fat and high-protein diets optimize fat absorption with both enzymes. High-fat diets with bacterial or porcine lipase should be evaluated in humans with pancreatic steatorrhea.},

Diagnosis of this treatable condition is often delayed or missed because of a failure to appreciate that celiac disease can present at any age and that symptoms are often subtle and not clearly related to gastrointestinal disease. Nonspecific symptoms and nutritional deficiencies are especially common in older patients and may not always be investigated thoroughly. Use of serological screening tests has improved ease of detection of celiac disease in patients without classical symptoms.},

There are unusual manifestations like refractory anemia, rickets, recurrent abdominal pain and short stature without other gastrointestinal manifestations. Definitive diagnosis still requires undertaking multiple intestinal biopsies, before and after wheat withdrawal from the diet. Additional difficulty in diagnosing celiac in tropical countries like India includes confounding factors of malnutrition and parasitic infestations like giardia. Serological tests like antigliadin antibodies (IgG and IgA), anti-reticulin antibodies and endomysial antibodies have shown some promise in screening and definitive evaluation of the disease. Gluten free diet gives dramatic results.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of gluten on the autoimmunity and function of the endocrine glands in adolescent celiac patients. METHODS: To clarify this aspect we investigated 44 patients (28 females), aged 11-20 yr (15.21+/-2.7 yr): 25 (mean age, 15.1+/-2.2 yr) on a gluten-free diet (treated patients) and 19 (mean age 15.4+/-2.9 yr) with a diet containing gluten (untreated patients). Forty adolescent subjects, aged 14-19 yr (mean age, 14.9+/-2.7 yr), of whom 20 were females, were studied as controls. Antibodies against the thyroid, adrenal, and pancreas were evaluated. Thyroid-stimulating hormone FT3, FT4, T3, T4, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, 17-OH progesterone, and cortisol, analyzed basally and 60 min after intravenous ACTH stimulation, were assayed to evaluate thyroid and adrenal function. The fasting glycemia level was used to evaluate the endocrine pancreas function. An ultrasonogram of the thyroid gland was performed on all patients. HLA class II typing for DR3 and DQB1 was performed in 32 of 44 patients. RESULTS: Seven of 44 (15.9%) patients were positive for antibodies against peroxidase. Six of 44 (13.6%) were positive for antibodies against thyreoglobulin and four of them also showed positive antibodies against peroxidase. Therefore, in nine of 44 at least one antibody directed against thyroid tissue was positive. Seven of 44 (15.9%) were positive for antibodies against islet cell, one of 44 (2.3%) positive for antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxilase, one of 44 (2.3%) positive for antibodies against insulin, and none for antibodies against islet cell- 512bdc. In 15 of 44 (34%) at least one antibody against an endocrine tissue was positive. The genotype DR3 was found in 21 of 32 (65.6%) celiac patients (10 in the untreated and 11 in the treated group, respectively) and the genotype DQB1*02 (DQ2) was found in 30 of 32 (93.8%) patients (16 in the treated and 14 in the untreated group, respectively). DHA-S values were significantly lower in the untreated (30.5+/-28.5 microg/dl) than in the treated group (61.3+/-59.4 microg/dl, p < 0.05), and both showing significantly (p < 0.01) lower levels with respect to the controls (161+/-52 microg/dl). One patient showed diabetes, another one clinical hypothyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone > 6), and two patients showed preclinical hypothyroidism. Interestingly, at least one antibody was positive in 10 of 19 untreated patients (52.6%) but only in five of 25 treated patients (20%), with a significantly different distribution (p < 0.001) between the two groups and without differences in the HLA genotype. The ultrasonographic evaluation of the thyroid resulted in a pathological score in six patients of the 44 examined (13.6%), suggesting the presence of thyropathy. CONCLUSIONS: The main results of this study are the high incidence of thyroid and pancreatic antibodies, and the possible role of gluten in the induction of the antibodies as well as, in few cases, the consequent organ dysfunction.},

The aim of this study was to assess sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of IgA and IgG antibodies to tTG in the diagnosis of celiac disease compared with endomysial antibodies. STUDY DESIGN: We established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedures to measure IgA and IgG antibodies to tTG in sera from 48 untreated and 33 treated patients with celiac disease and from 63 patients with gastrointestinal disease who were in a control group. Sera from 10 patients with celiac disease were examined at various times after gluten was reintroduced into the patients' diet. RESULTS: Both IgA and IgG to tTG were significantly (P <.001) higher in serum of untreated patients with celiac disease versus those in the control group; IgA but not IgG was significantly (P <.001) higher in untreated versus treated patients with celiac disease. IgA and IgG antitissue tTG had a diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 92% and 21%, 98% and 97%, and 98% and 83%, respectively. The concordance rate of IgA anti-tTG with IgA antiendomysial antibodies was 95%. In 5 of the 10 patients undergoing gluten challenge, IgA antiendomysium antibodies were detected earlier than IgA anti-tTG antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: tTG-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is an effective diagnostic test, although immunofluorescent-based assays are more sensitive, particularly during gluten challenge.},

   abstract = {We tested the hypotheses that vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression on endothelium at lesion-prone sites in the rabbit aorta correlates with exposure to plasma cholesterol and that macrophage accumulation is associated with endothelial cells expressing VCAM-1. After rabbits were fed 0.25% cholesterol for 2 weeks, VCAM-1 expression was selectively increased at the distal and lateral portions of the major abdominal branches. In the arch and the celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal artery branches, VCAM-1 expression was positively correlated with the plasma cholesterol integrated over the duration of the experiments. After 2 weeks of cholesterol feeding, more macrophages were present around distal and lateral portions of the intercostal arteries and major abdominal branches relative to nonbranch regions. In the arch and around the intercostals and major abdominal branches, macrophage densities were positively correlated with the integrated plasma cholesterol. VCAM-1 and macrophage levels were correlated in lesion-prone regions. In normocholesterolemic rabbits, 23+/-4% (mean+/-SEM) of the macrophages were directly associated with VCAM-1-positive endothelium. After 2 weeks of 0.25% cholesterol feeding, the association increased to 37+/-4% (P<0.015). Associations were highest around the lateral and distal regions of the major abdominal branches. These results suggest that (1) VCAM-1 expression and intimal macrophage densities are influenced by plasma cholesterol and regional factors such as arterial fluid dynamics and (2) VCAM-1 plays a significant role in the localization of macrophages.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with coeliac disease have low bone mineral density (BMD), but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Our aim was to study circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and its possible relationship to BMD in adults with untreated coeliac disease and after 1 year on a gluten-free diet. METHODS: In 29 consecutive adult coeliac patients fasting IGF-I and BMD (n = 28) were examined before and 1 year after starting a gluten-free diet. Intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was measured (n = 20) before the gluten-free diet was started. RESULTS: Untreated coeliac patients had lower IGF-I values than controls matched for age and sex, and their BMD was low. A relationship was observed between BMD and IGF-I but not independent of age and body mass index. During the 1st year on a gluten-free diet BMD increased (P < 0.001), as did the circulating IGF-I levels in 21 of the 29 patients (P = 0.078). In the subgroup of 14 patients with normal initial PTH the increase in IGF-I correlated positively with the increase in BMD (femoral trochanter, r = 0.62, P < 0.05, and lumbar spine, r = 0.70, P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: BMD and circulating IGF-I levels are low in adults with untreated coeliac disease. In patients with normal initial PTH level there is an association between the change in BMD and circulating IGF-I, although this parallel increase may not be causally connected.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanisms of disturbances in bone mineral density (BMD) in coeliac disease are not completely understood. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the possible significance of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) with regard to BMD in patients with untreated coeliac disease. METHODS: One hundred and five adult patients with untreated coeliac disease were examined for BMD and serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration. BMD in the hip, lumbar spine, and forearm were examined up to 3 years after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: SHPT was found in 27% (28 of 105) of the patients. In patients with SHPT serum levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D were lower and those of alkaline phosphatase higher than in patients with normal PTH, but ionized serum calcium did not differ between the two groups. BMD was more severely reduced in patients with SHPT. Although the BMD increment was more rapid in patients with than in those without SPTH, only in the latter group did mean BMD became normal after 1-3 years on a gluten-free diet (GFD). After 3 years on a GFD more than half of the patients with initial SHPT still had low BMD in both the hip and the forearm. Furthermore, in patients with SHPT the intestinal mucosa more often remained atrophic at the 1-year follow-up, despite good compliance with the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Low BMD in patients with untreated coeliac disease is often associated with SHPT. After 3 years on a GFD the BMD remains low only in patients with initial SHPT. We therefore suggest that PTH should be measured when the diagnosis of coeliac disease is made, as an indicator of more serious intestinal disorder and complicating bone disease.},

   abstract = {The coexistence of autoimmune endocrine diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease and celiac disease (CD), has recently been reported. We here present a 23-year-old woman with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, autoimmune Addison's disease, and kariotypically normal spontaneous premature ovarian failure. Considering the close association between autoimmune diseases and CD, we decided to search for IgA anti-endomysium antibodies (EmA) in the serum. The positivity of EmA and the presence of total villous atrophy at jejunal biopsy allowed the diagnosis of CD. On a gluten-free diet the patient showed a marked clinical improvement accompanied, over a 3-month period, by a progressive decrease in the need for thyroid and adrenal replacement therapies. After 6 months, serum EmA became negative and after 12 months a new jejunal biopsy showed complete mucosal recovery. After 18 months on gluten-free diet, the anti-thyroid antibodies titre decreased significantly, and we could discontinue thyroid substitutive therapy. This case emphasizes the association between autoimmune polyglandular disease and CD; the precocious identification of these cases is clinically relevant not only for the high risk of complications (e.g. lymphoma) inherent to untreated CD, but also because CD is one of the causes for the failure of substitute hormonal therapy in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) production catalyzed by iNOS (inducible NO synthase) is thought to take place mainly in macrophages after activation by inflammatory mediators. NO is subsequently oxidized to nitrite and nitrate, which are excreted in urine. The concentration of inflammatory mediators in small bowel biopsy specimens from patients with coeliac disease is increased. The latter could induce increased NO production by stimulation of intestinal macrophage iNOS, resulting in high levels of urinary NO oxidation products, nitrite and nitrate (NOx). AIM: In the present study we evaluated the urinary NOx/creatinine ratios in children with active coeliac disease (n = 22), coeliac disease patients on a gluten-free diet (n = 9), healthy (n = 11) and sick control children (n = 18). METHODS: The Griess reagent method was used for measuring urinary NOx. RESULTS: Median NOx/creatinine ratios of active coeliac disease patients, coeliac disease patients on a gluten-free diet, healthy and sick control patients were 1.21, 0.19, 0.10 and 0.13 mmol/mmol, respectively. All active coeliac disease patients showed increased NOx/ creatinine ratios. Urinary NOx/creatinine ratios of the active coeliac disease patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls (p < 0.0001), sick controls (p < 0.0001) and coeliac disease patients on a gluten-free diet (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The urinary NOx/creatinine ratio is increased in patients with active coeliac disease and reverts to normal on a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cereal grains are recognized as the cause of adverse reactions in some patients exposed to grain or flour by either inhalation or ingestion. Cereal-related diseases, such as celiac disease and baker's asthma, have been well studied and the causative cereal proteins have been characterized. Although cereals form an essential part of daily nutrition, the allergenic proteins causing symptoms on ingestion in atopic dermatitis (AD) have remained obscure. In this study, we have investigated the allergenic fraction of wheat in AD. METHODS: Skin prick tests (SPT) with a NaCl wheat suspension and the ethanol-soluble wheat gliadin were performed on 18 wheat-challenge-positive or -negative children with AD, six adult AD patients with suspected cereal allergy, and one adult with wheat-dependent exercise-induced urticaria/anaphylaxis. Serum total IgE and specific IgE-antibody levels to wheat and gluten were measured with the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) simultaneously. In addition serum samples of all 25 patients were analyzed by IgE immunoblotting with the ethanol-soluble wheat-protein extract. RESULTS: Thirteen of the AD children were wheat-challenge-positive, 11/12 of them appeared to be positive with gliadin SPT, and all had an elevated gluten RAST value. Those challenge-negative were negative with both gliadin SPT and gluten RAST. Positive wheat SPT and RAST alone were not associated with positive challenges. Four of the adult patients responded to a cereal-free diet, although only two of them appeared to be positive with gliadin SPT and gluten RAST. A broad and intensive staining of gliadin peptides in IgE-immunoblotting studies was seen in challenge-positive children with positive gliadin SPT and/ or gluten RAST. Besides staining of peptides in the main gliadin area of 30-46 kDa, a characteristic finding was the staining of small, <14-kDa proteins with sera of challenge- and gliadin-SPT-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found that wheat-allergic AD patients have IgE antibodies against gliadin that can be detected by both SPT and the sensitive immunoblotting method. This suggests that gliadin peptides are important allergens, and ingestion of wheat causes symptoms of AD. A broad and intensive IgE staining was seen of gliadin peptides against both the previously characterized peptides in the main gliadin area and small, previously uncharacterized peptides of less than 14 kDa. The gliadin SPT and gluten RAST are good screening methods. Further characterization of the IgE-stained gliadin proteins is needed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although osteopenia and osteoporosis are well-recognized complications of celiac disease, no controlled studies have been done to assess the prevalence of fractures in a large cohort of patients. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of bone fractures and vertebral deformities in celiacs and to analyze the relationship between fractures and clinical data of patients. METHODS: We studied 165 patients with a well-established diagnosis of celiac disease. A similar number of age- and gender-matched control subjects with functional GI disorders were evaluated. The design of the study was cross-sectional, with a retrospective historical review through a personal interview of all subjects. All patients underwent bone mineral density measurement by dual-energy, x-ray absorptiometry and spinal x-ray. Vertebral deformities were determined by visual inspection of spinal x-rays and by morphometric analysis. RESULTS: Among celiacs, 41 patients (25%) referred have had from one to five fractures in the peripheral skeleton. On the contrary, only 14 (8%) control subjects experienced fractures. This difference was highly significant (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-7.2; p<0.0001). Although inspection of spinal x-rays showed evidence of vertebral deformities in the lumbar spine in only two patients, a more detailed examination of lateral x-rays using morphometric criteria detected lumbar spine vertebral deformities in nine (five also had fractures in the peripheral skeleton) and in four controls (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% CI, 0.7-11.5; p = NS). Eighty percent of fractures were detected before the diagnosis of celiac disease or in patients who were noncompliant with the gluten-free diet; only 7% of patients experienced fractures after starting treatment. Regression analysis adjusted for multiple comparisons showed that patients with fractures were diagnosed with celiac disease later (p<0.06) and remained undiagnosed for more prolonged periods (p<0.05). There was a trend, which did not reach statistical significance, for a lower bone mineral density in the lumbar spine and total skeleton among patients with fractures. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that patients with celiac disease had a high prevalence of bone fractures in the peripheral skeleton. Most of these events occurred before diagnosis or while patients were noncompliant with gluten-containing diet. Our results suggest that early diagnosis and effective treatment of celiac disease were the most relevant measures to protect patients from the risk of fractures.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tissue transglutaminase has recently been identified as the main autoantigen recognized by antiendomysial antibodies in celiac disease. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig)A antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG-ab) determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique have been reported to correlate closely with IgA antiendomysial antibodies (EMA). The purpose of this study was to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of tTG-ab measured by a commercially available ELISA technique, compared with those of EMA and IgA antigliadin antibodies (AGA) for the diagnosis of celiac disease. METHODS: Twenty-seven serum samples were obtained from patients with untreated celiac disease, 37 from patients who had had gluten withdrawn from their diets for varying time spans, and 34 from control subjects without celiac disease. All were younger than 14 years. Presence of tTG-ab and AGA was determined by ELISA and of EMA by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Twenty-six of 27 serum samples obtained from patients at the time of diagnosis of celiac disease were AGA positive. All 27 (concordance rate 100%) were positive for EMA and tTG-ab. Of the 34 control subjects, 1 was for AGA and 2 for tTG-ab. All 34 were negative for EMA. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value within this group were, for tTG-ab: 100%, 94%, 93%, and 100%, respectively; for EMA: all four indexes were 100%; and for AGA: 96%, 97%, 96%, and 97%, respectively. Of the 37 with treated celiac disease, 2 were AGA positive, 9 were EMA positive, and 6 were tTG-ab positive. The concordance rate between EMA and tTG-ab was 100% in the group with untreated celiac disease, 94% in the control subjects, and 76% in the group with treated celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Immunoglobulin A antibodies to tissue transglutaminase are new, highly sensitive, and specific markers of celiac disease. They can be determined easily by an accurate, comparatively cheap technique and thereby may advantageously replace the EMA marker traditionally used.},

This was a promising result for diagnosis of potential/latent celiac disease. Therefore, we tested the usefulness of the production of EMAs of in vitro-challenged mucosa for diagnosis of celiac disease and determined the location of EMA production. METHODS: We investigated EMAs in the serum, in the supernatants of in vitro gliadin-challenged duodenal mucosa specimens in 68 patients, and in homogenized native duodenal and gastric specimens in seven patients. Twenty-one of the 68 patients served as nonceliac controls, 11 as candidates for potential celiac disease, 23 celiac patients were on glutenfree diet, and 13 were newly diagnosed. RESULTS: EMAs were just found in the supernatants of duodenal biopsies of those celiac patients who had demonstrable EMAs in serum, independent of gliadin challenge. In these patients EMAs were also found in homogenized native duodenal biopsies, but not in gastric biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: EMAs seem to be produced in the small bowel mucosa of celiac patients, but not in other tissues such as gastric mucosa. The production of EMAs could not be initiated under standard in vitro conditions and therefore, such as in vitro challenge cannot be used for diagnostic purposes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteopenia is common in patients with celiac disease and is believed to result from malnutrition. Osteoporosis in otherwise healthy individuals is related to genetically determined polymorphisms within the vitamin-D-receptor (VDR) gene. We hypothesized that in celiac patients particular genes of the VDR enhance the susceptibility for malnutrition-associated low-bone density. METHODS: We determined allelic frequencies within the VDR gene by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 92 patients with celiac disease (age, 15-83 years). Thirty-eight patients were on a gluten-free diet; 54 patients did not adhere to a diet. The determined VDR polymorphisms in 111 unrelated newborns served as controls. Osteopenia was determined by means of ultrasound measurements of the calcaneus (n = 78). Bone turnover was estimated by osteocalcin determination (n = 60). RESULTS: There was no difference in the frequency of the VDR gene polymorphisms in patients with celiac disease compared with controls. Adjusted ultrasound measures of the calcaneus were low in 47% of patients, but there was no difference of the VDR gene frequencies in these patients compared with those with normal ultrasound results or controls. Bone turnover was higher in patients without a gluten-free diet (P = 0.02). Again, there was no association with any particular VDR gene. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with celiac disease frequently have osteopenia, which is not related to any of the determined genes within the VDR.},

Children with IDDM and biopsy-proven coeliac disease aged <18 years were included and compared with IDDM controls matched for age, sex and duration of diabetes. Twenty patients with coeliac disease and IDDM participated (15 female, age 7.4-17.3 yr), with two matched IDDM controls for each (age 6.9-17.4 yr). The prevalence of coeliac disease in this diabetes clinic population was 2.6%. All patients completed a 3 day food record (3DFR) and a 7 day food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to assess dietary intake and gluten-free compliance. Diabetes control measured by HbA1c was not different between groups or compared to the overall clinic population (8.48 +/- 0.98% for coeliac patients vs 8.87 +/- 1.46 for IDDM controls vs 8.60 +/- 1.30 for overall clinic population aged 5.0-17.9 yr). Height, weight and BMI standard deviation scores were not different between coeliac patients and IDDM controls. No clinically significant differences were found in intake of energy, macronutrients or micronutrients. The proportion of energy intake from carbohydrate, protein and fat was within recommended ranges, except for a higher saturated fat intake. Only 30% of coeliac patients complied with a strict gluten-free diet, but growth parameters were unaffected by dietary compliance. Thus, we found that children and adolescents with coexisting IDDM and coeliac disease have normal growth, equivalent diabetes control and no differences in energy or nutrient intake compared to matched IDDM controls in our clinic population.},

These include disorders of the central nervous system encompassing epilepsy, myoclonus, ataxia, internuclear opthalmoplegia, multifocal leukoencephalopathy and dementia. Most of these associated conditions show a poor response to gluten restriction. Peripheral neuropathies, of axonal and demyelinating types, have also been reported and may respond to elimination of gluten from the diet. The mechanism underlying these processes remains obscure but may be immunological or related to trace vitamin deficiencies. Controversially, it has also been claimed that occult coeliac disease accounts for a substantial proportion of patients with neurological dysfunction of unknown cause. Some authorities recommend that cryptogenic ataxias and neuropathies should be routinely screened for the presence of gluten-sensitivity but this remains contentious and has not been universally accepted. This review will attempt to review the clinical and pathological findings in this condition and speculate on pathogenesis and directions for future research.},
