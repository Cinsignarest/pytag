Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) findings of the small bowell were compared with DQ-typing. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with chronic abdominal pain (with or without diarrhea) and at least one positive result of any of the coeliac serological markers (AGA, TTG, EMA) and normal duodenal biopsy were enrolled and underwent VCE. Twelve healthy volunteers with VCE served as control group. Coeliac related HLA DQ2 or DQ8 markers were determined. RESULTS: 12/ 22 (55%) patients had small bowel abnormalities with VCE. No mucosal abnormalities were recognized in the control group (p = 0.002). Inflammatory changes were classified as moderate or pronounced. Eight patients (36%) had moderate changes and four patients (18%) demonstrated pronounced changes. Only 6 of the 21 IBS patients were positive for DQ2 and/or DQ8. CONCLUSIONS: The patients in this study fulfilled the diagnostic Rome criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome. We suggest that patients with positive coeliac serology and normal duodenal biopsies should undergo HLA typing. In patients positive for DQ2 and/or DQ8, a VCE should be performed. Patients with mucosal abnormalities compatible with CD should be considered as a group distinct from IBS patients and could be tested with gluten challenge or treated with a gluten free diet.},

   abstract = {Women with irritable bowel syndrome often report premenstrual distress syndrome and dysmenorrhea. A descriptive, four-group comparison design was used to compare the symptoms and psychological distress levels of women with irritable bowel syndrome (age 18-45 years) with and without dysmenorrhea and premenstrual distress syndrome. Data from three studies on women with irritable bowel syndrome (n = 226) collected between 1995 and 2004 were combined. Of these, 38 had self-reported irritable bowel syndrome with dysmenorrhea and premenstrual distress syndrome, 59 had irritable bowel syndrome with premenstrual distress syndrome, 15 had irritable bowel syndrome and dysmenorrhea, and the remaining 114 had irritable bowel syndrome only. Participants completed the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised and a symptom diary. Pain symptoms and computed scales of anxiety, depression, anger, and cognitive difficulties were compared during the luteal phase, menses phase, and for the change from luteal to menses phases. Premenstrual distress syndrome and dysmenorrhea had a strong impact on uterine cramping at menses, and a weaker effect on other pain symptoms at both luteal and menses phases. Premenstrual distress syndrome was associated with higher depression, anger, and cognitive problems at both luteal and menses phases; however, it was not associated with a greater increase from luteal to menses phases for any symptoms other than uterine cramping. The multiple symptoms reported by women with both irritable bowel syndrome and premenstrual distress syndrome suggest that this group may be particularly challenging to treat and may require a multicomponent (e.g., education, diet, relaxation, cognitive restructuring) approach.},

METHODS: Two HRQOL instruments were administered by telephone interviews to a sample of 253 IBS French patients recruited from the general population. IBS was diagnosed according to the Manning, Rome I and Rome II criteria. Patients with organic diseases were excluded from the study. A generic instrument, the Short Form 36 (SF-36), and an IBS disease-specific instrument, the IBSQOL, were used. RESULTS: Patients with IBS had statistically significant (P<0.05) lower scores for all SF-36 QOL domains compared with the general French population. Women (N=192) reported significantly (P<0.05) poorer HRQOL on both the SF-36 and the IBSQOL scores than men (N=61) for all domains except energy on the SF36 and the sleep on the IBSQOL. HRQOL deteriorated with time since onset of IBS symptoms for some domains such as diet. For both instruments, a positive correlation was observed between low scores and intensity of pain and discomfort. IBS patients with a predominance of diarrhea (N=72) exhibited significantly greater impairment of HRQOL in the emotional domain than IBS persons with constipation predominance (N=65) (P<or=0.05). CONCLUSION: IBS has a significant impact on HRQOL of patients. In addition, specific characteristics such as gender, symptom severity and time since onset of symptoms are predictive of more impaired health-related quality of life.},

   abstract = {AIM: As optimal therapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains elusive, current approach to therapy is based on symptomatic treatment. With this case-control experience we wanted to determine the beneficial effect in IBS patients of a dietary integrator (IBS Active), composed of L-tryptophan, inulin, angelica, vegetal charcoal, vitamin PP, group B vitamins (B1, B2, B6) and probiotics (Lactobacillus sporogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus). METHODS: The treatment group comprised 37 patients (11 men and 27 women; mean age, 44.3+/-5.1 years) given IBS Active (440 mg bid) over a mean period of 6 months (range, 5-8). The control group comprised 28 patients (6 men and 22 women; mean age, 48.6+/-3.7 years) who were instructed to continue their customary therapy for 6 months (range, 5-7). All subjects were assessed for the presence of abdominal pain and/or distension, constipation, diarrhea and alternating constipation and diarrhea. RESULTS: Compared with baseline values, the reduction in abdominal pain in the treatment group was 62% (P<0.0001), 55% (P<0.0001) in abdominal distension, 58% (P=0.05) in constipation, 33% (P=0.3) in diarrhea, and 62% (P=0.01) in alternation constipation and diarrhea. Compared with baseline values, no statistically significant reduction in symptoms was found in the control group. Post-treatment comparison between the two groups showed that the study product had reduced symptoms and that the difference was statistically significant for abdominal pain (P<0.000001), abdominal distension (P=0.003) and constipation (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The use of IBS Active led to a significant improvement in pain symptoms, abdominal distension and regulation of bowel movement in IBS patients. Further study is needed to evaluate the long-term benefit of the study product.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Evidence suggests that postprandial platelet-depleted plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentrations may be abnormal in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, interpretation of the data has been hampered by the variable methodology and rather small numbers used in previous studies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure concentrations of platelet-depleted plasma 5-HT and its metabolite 5-HIAA under fasting and fed conditions in a large group of patients with diarrhea-predominant (d-) and constipation-predominant (c-) IBS, compared with controls. The ratio of plasma 5-HIAA:5-HT and platelet stores was also assessed. METHODS: Twenty-nine c-IBS patients (aged, 19-53 years), 55 d-IBS patients (aged, 19-52 years), and 35 healthy volunteers (aged, 18-46 years) had platelet-depleted plasma 5-HT/5-HIAA concentrations measured using reverse-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection before and after a standard meal. RESULTS: d-IBS patients had raised platelet-depleted plasma 5-HT concentrations under fasting and fed conditions (P < .05). However, the postprandial relative to fasting concentration was similar to controls. In contrast, c-IBS patients failed to show an increase in platelet-depleted plasma 5-HT concentration with meal ingestion compared with controls (P < .01). c-IBS was associated with decreased 5-HIAA (P < .01) but normal 5-HIAA:5-HT ratio and d-IBS with normal 5-HIAA concentrations but reduced 5-HIAA:5-HT ratio (P < .005). C-IBS but not d-IBS patients had increased platelet 5-HT. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the concept that d-IBS is characterized by reduced 5-HT reuptake, whereas impaired release may be a feature of c-IBS. These results also provide a rational basis for current pharmacologic approaches involving modulation of different 5-HT receptors in c- and d-IBS.},

   abstract = {There has been recent interest into the potential role of cellular and molecular mechanisms in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the intestinal mucosa of IBS patients is endoscopically and histologically "normal," it contains an increased number of activated T lymphocytes and mast cells, along with evidence of an increased release of mediators known to signal to epithelial, neuronal, and muscle cells leading to intestinal dysfunction. In this issue, Dunlop et al. provide evidence of increased intestinal permeability in patients with diarrhea predominant IBS. There is now consistent evidence indicating that mucosal barrier defects allow the passage of an increased load of luminal antigens of dietary and bacterial origin which, in turn, elicit the activation of mucosal immune responses involved in the generation of diarrhea. Further work has now to be done to better understand the interplay among luminal factors, epithelial cells, and mucosal immunocytes in the pathogenesis of IBS.},

We evaluated the ability of CLA and n-3 PUFA alone or in combination to modulate IBD in a pig model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. METHODS: Sixty-four, 15-day-old pigs were used to evaluate the effect of CLA, n-3 PUFA and a 50:50 mixture of CLA and n-3 PUFA on growth, clinical activity and colonic PPAR-responsive gene expression. Diets were formulated to contain: 1.33% soybean oil (control); 1.33% CLA; 1.33% fish oil; or 1.33% of a 50:50 mixture of CLA and fish oil. Intestinal inflammation was induced by an intragastric challenge with DSS on day 42 of dietary supplementation. The colonic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), PPAR gamma- and delta-responsive genes, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) were assayed by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: The onset of IBD was delayed, colitis less severe and growth suppression attenuated in pigs fed CLA, which correlated with induction of colonic PPAR gamma and its responsive gene PPAR gamma-coactivator-1alpha (PGC1-alpha) and downregulation of TNF-alpha. However, dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFA alone or in combination with CLA resulted in an early onset of disease (i.e., day 2) and faster recovery on days 6 and 7, which correlated with a marked induction of the PPAR delta-responsive gene uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3). CLA and n-3 PUFA acted synergistically to upregulate colonic KGF expression in DSS-challenged pigs but n-3 PUFA blocked CLA-induced PPAR gamma activation. CONCLUSION: Dietary CLA-supplementation upregulated colonic PPAR gamma expression and contributed to delaying the onset of experimental IBD, whereas n-3 PUFA failed to protect from IBD, although it accelerated colonic regeneration and clinical remission by activating PPAR delta.},

METHODS: Twenty-nine women with IBS participated in a programme of instruction on medical care, physical activity, stress-management, diet and health insurance. The women completed the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and the Psychological General Well-Being Index and provided information about their requirements of medical care before and after the course. RESULTS: Twenty-three of the women included, completed the questionnaires at 12 months after the course. When comparing these values to those at baseline, there were improvements in abdominal pain (p < 0.037) and vitality (p < 0.045) as well as a reduction in the number of visits to physicians (p < 0.037) and dieticians (p < 0.042). CONCLUSION: Information related to the disease, might help women with IBS to perceive less pain and more vitality and thereby experience a higher quality of life. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: A course of instruction for patients with IBS may be of benefit for the patients, and could be a part of a multicomponent approach in the treatment of this patient group.},

OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the causes, diagnosis and management of IBS. DISCUSSION: Disturbed motility and sensory function underlie much of the disturbance in function that, not infrequently, begins following an episode of gastroenteritis. There is an intimate role for the brain-gut axis in modulating symptoms relating to underlying causes of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, food intolerance and sensitivity, and abnormalities of corticotropin releasing factors. Management requires long term involvement with the patient as there is no single therapeutic strategy that is predictably effective. However, diet, bulking agents, antispasmodics and a variety of alternative therapies including herbs, probiotics, and psychological intervention are important in individual patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To present a practical approach to the symptom complex called chronic pelvic pain (CPP). Chronic pelvic pain is defined as nonmenstrual pain lasting 6 months or more that is severe enough to cause functional disability or require medical or surgical treatment. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from January 1996 to December 2004. MAIN MESSAGE: While the source of pain in CPP can be gynecologic, urologic, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, or psychoneurologic, 4 conditions account for most CPP: endometriosis, adhesions, interstitial cystitis, and irritable bowel syndrome. More than one source of pain can be found in the same patient. Management involves treating the underlying condition, the pain itself, or both. Nonnarcotic analgesics are first-line therapy for pain relief; hormonal therapies are beneficial if the pain has a cyclical component. A multidisciplinary approach addressing environmental factors and incorporating medical management with physiotherapy, psychotherapy, and dietary modifications works best. CONCLUSION: Although caring for patients with CPP can be challenging and frustrating, family physicians are in an ideal position to manage and coordinate their care.},

The concept of probiotics is to restore and maintain a microflora advantageous to the human body. Probiotics are found in a number of fermented dairy products, infant formula, and dietary supplements. Basic research on probiotics has suggested several modes of action beneficial for the human body and clinical research has proven its preventive and curative features in different intestinal and extraintestinal diseases. Chronic diseases cause considerable disablement in patients and represent a substantial economic burden on healthcare resources. Research has demonstrated a crucial role of nutrition in the prevention of chronic disease. Thus, positive, strain-specific effects of probiotics have been shown in diarrheal diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, and Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis, and in atopic diseases and in the prevention of cancer. As the majority of probiotics naturally inhabit the human intestinal microflora, their use has been regarded as very safe. However, in view of the range of potential benefits on health that might be achieved by the use of some probiotic bacteria, major and thorough evaluation is still necessary. In conclusion, probiotics act as an adjuvant in the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of chronic diseases.},

   abstract = {JUSTIFICATION: Yogurt has been historically used to restore gut microflora adversely affected by antibiotic treatment. Certain fermented dairy products are probiotics; "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host." Microorganisms in foods may benefit certain health conditions such as diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. A potential new probiotic from a Polynesian traditional food is poi; a starchy paste made from the corm of taro plants. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if consumption of poi, a potential non-dairy probiotic, altered the microflora in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy adults. METHODS: A cross-over clinical study included 18 subjects (19-64 years of age) divided into a poi group (n = 10) and control group (n = 8). The study duration of 14 weeks consisted of a 2-week washout, 4-week treatment or control, a subsequent 2-week washout, cross-over of 4-week treatment or control, and a final 2-week washout. Subjects thus served as their own controls. While receiving the poi treatment, participants consumed fresh poi (1-2 days old) three times a day (130 g/meal or approximately 1/2 cup/meal); the control group did not. Both groups filled out 3-day dietary records to ensure compliance. Measurable outcomes included pre- and post-treatment microbiological fecal culture analyses. RESULTS: We found no significant differences in total bacterial counts following a poi diet versus following a control diet, nor were significant differences found in counts of specific bacterial species. Lactococcus tends to be higher in poi when it is analyzed for specific bacteria, but the poi consumption in our study did not alter the mean concentration of individual bacterial species (log10 CFU/g wet feces) for Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Bifidobacterium. No significant differences in stool frequency or consistency were observed between the treatment and control group periods. CONCLUSION: Poi consumption did not significantly alter total or individual bacterial counts in the human gastrointestinal tract. Further research might determine if "sour poi" (3-4 days old) has a greater affect than "fresh poi" (1-2 days old) as a potential probiotic, and a larger trial with longer diet durations may detect more subtle effects of poi consumption on bacterial counts.},

We have suspected that there are differences compared with white Caucasian coeliacs, especially with respect to iron-deficiency anaemia and vitamin D deficiency at presentation. AIMS: To compare the clinical and laboratory features of South Asian adult coeliac patients with adult white Caucasian coeliacs. METHODS: We reviewed the notes of patients attending the adult coeliac clinic over the past 10 years. All patients were older than 16 years at diagnosis. There were 40 South Asians and 90 white Caucasians. Symptoms, haematology, biochemistry, endomysial antibody status, HLA alleles and small bowel histology at presentation were compared between the two racial groups. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the racial groups. South Asians were younger at presentation than the Caucasian patients (mean age 27 years compared with 47 years respectively, P<0.0001); they were less likely to have 'irritable bowel syndrome' symptoms (P<0.01), but more likely to have features of vitamin D deficiency (P<0.03). Their haemoglobin (P<0.05), mean cell volume (P<0.0004), serum iron (P<0.01), transferrin saturation (P<0.05), serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (P<0.002), and levels were lower, while serum alkaline phosphatase levels were higher (P<0.04) than in white Caucasian coeliac patients. There were no differences with respect to serum folate, vitamin B12, serum calcium, alanine aminotransferase and small bowel histology. IgA class endomysial antibody positivity was similar in the two groups (88.5% for South Asians compared with 73.5% for white Caucasians). White Caucasian patients were significantly more likely to be DQ2-positive than the South Asian patients (97.2% compared with 83.3%, P=0.02). CONCLUSION: South Asians with coeliac disease are less likely to present with 'irritable bowel syndrome' symptoms, but more likely to have features of vitamin D deficiency and iron deficiency, and have a higher alkaline phosphatase than white Caucasians. The differences in HLA alleles seen in South Asians with coeliac disease compared with white Caucasian patients suggests that among the South Asians, non-HLA regions may play a stronger role in disease susceptibility and presentation.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common functional gastrointestinal disorder. IBS is likely to be a multifactorial condition resulting from a number of different mechanisms such as disordered motility, visceral hypersensitivity, abnormal central processing, psychological factors, genetic factors, gut inflammation, and dietary factors. Many patients with IBS give a history of adverse food reactions, but the foods identified to be relevant have been highly variable. Food hypersensitivity can be mediated by immunoglobulin E-dependent and -independent mechanisms involving mast cells, eosinophils, and other immune cells. Recent clinical and experimental studies suggest that there is a possible role for food hypersensitivity in IBS, with improvement of IBS symptom severity in a subset of patients on elimination diets, but the underlying mechanisms in IBS have yet to be fully understood. This review considers the evidence for the role of food hypersensitivity in IBS, based on the available epidemiologic and pathophysiologic data, and the clinical implications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary nucleotide supplementation has been shown to have important effects on the growth and development of cells which have a rapid turnover such as those in the immune system and the gastrointestinal tract. Work with infants has shown that the incidence and duration of diarrhoea is lower when nucleotide supplementation is given, and animal work shows that villi height and crypt depth in the intestine is increased as a result of dietary nucleotides. Dietary nucleotides may be semi-essential under conditions of ill-health, poor diet or stress. Since people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome tend to fulfil these conditions, we tested the hypothesis that symptoms would be improved with dietary nucleotide supplementation. METHODS: Thirty-seven people with a diagnosis of Irritable Bowel gave daily symptom severity ratings for abdominal pain, diarrhoea, urgency to have a bowel movement, incomplete feeling of evacuation after a bowel movement, bloating, flatulence and constipation for 28 days (baseline). They were then assigned to either placebo (56 days) followed by experimental (56 days) or the reverse. There was a four week washout period before crossover. During the placebo and experimental conditions participants took one 500 mg capsule three times a day; in the experimental condition the capsule contained the nutroceutical substances. Symptom severity ratings and psychological measures (anxiety, depression, illness intrusiveness and general health) were obtained and analysed by repeated measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: Symptom severity for all symptoms (except constipation) were in the expected direction of baseline>placebo>experimental condition. Symptom improvement was in the range 4 - 6%. A feeling of incomplete evacuation and abdominal pain showed the most improvement. The differences between conditions for diarrhoea, bloating and flatulence were not significant at the p < .05 level. There were no significant differences between the conditions for any of the psychological measures. CONCLUSION: Dietary nucleotide supplementation improves some of the symptoms of irritable bowel above baseline and placebo level. As expected, placebo effects were high. Apart from abdominal pain and urgency to have a bowel movement, the improvements, while consistent, are modest, and were not accompanied by improvements in any of the psychological measures. We suggest that the percentage improvement over and above the placebo effect is a physiological effect of the nucleotide supplement on the gut. The mechanisms by which these effects might improve symptoms are discussed.},

Gastroenteritis or antibiotic therapy may damage the colonic microflora, leading to increased fermentation and the accumulation of gas. Gas excretion may be measured by whole-body calorimetry but there has only been one such study on IBS to date. We aimed to assess the relationship between IBS symptoms and fermentation rates in IBS. A purpose-built, 1.4-m3, whole-body calorimeter was used to assess excretion of H2 and CH4 in IBS subjects while consuming a standard diet and, again, after open randomization on either the standard diet together with the antibiotic metronidazole or a fiber-free diet to reduce fermentation. Metronidazole significantly reduced the 24-hr excretion of hydrogen (median value compared to the control group, 397 vs 230 ml/24 hr) and total gas (H2 + CH4; 671 vs 422 ml/min) and the maximum rate of gas excretion (1.6 vs 0.8 ml/min), as did a no-fiber polymeric diet (hydrogen, 418 vs 176 ml/min; total gas, 564 vs 205 ml/min; maximum rate of gas excretion, 1.35 vs 0.45 ml/min), with a significant improvement in abdominal symptoms. IBS may be associated with rapid excretion of gaseous products of fermentation, whose reduction may improve symptoms.},

   abstract = {Functional diarrhea (FD), one of the functional gastrointestinal disorders, is characterized by chronic or recurrent diarrhea not explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. The treatment of FD is intimately associated with establishing the correct diagnosis. First, FD needs to be distinguished from diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), in which, unlike in FD, abdominal pain is a primary diagnostic criterion. Next, FD must be differentiated from the myriad organic causes of chronic diarrhea. Unlike IBS, in which a positive diagnosis can be made with an acceptable level of confidence using symptom-based criteria and minimal testing, the diagnosis of FD is still primarily a diagnosis of exclusion. Thus, the onus is on the physician to eliminate potential underlying causes, both common and uncommon, in the proper clinical setting. Once the diagnosis has been established, the clinician and patient should first focus on identifying, eliminating, and/or treating aggravating factors. These may include physiologic factors (eg, small bowel bacterial overgrowth), psychological factors (eg, stress and anxiety), and dietary factors (eg, carbohydrate malabsorption). Thereafter, appropriate treatment for functional diarrhea may be instituted. Treatment options include dietary and lifestyle modification, pharmacologic therapies, and alternative modalities. Although many of these strategies have been studied in IBS, almost none of them has been examined specifically in FD. Furthermore, given the poorly understood pathophysiologic basis of FD, these treatments primarily target a patient's symptoms and presumed altered physiology rather than underlying etiologic mechanisms. Therefore, we stress that treatment must be approached in an individualized manner and that dietary and pharmacologic therapies should be part of a comprehensive therapeutic approach in which education and reassurance form the foundation. In general, we attempt to remove dietary triggers and recommend increased fiber intake. We then add anticholinergic, antispasmodic, antimotility, and antidiarrheal agents as the first line of pharmacotherapy. Should a patient not respond to these, and for patients who have a significant degree of psychological dysfunction, central acting agents, including antidepressants and/or anxiolytics, may be beneficial. During the treatment period, we also recommend that physicians keep an open mind. If signs or symptoms that suggest an ongoing or previously unrecognized organic process develop, then a re-evaluation of the clinical picture is indicated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is based on arbitrary criteria due to the lack of an accurate diagnostic test. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether rectosigmoid tone modification after a meal represents an accurate diagnostic approach. METHODS: In a secondary care setting, 32 constipation predominant and 24 diarrhoea predominant IBS patients, 10 functional diarrhoea and 10 functional constipation patients, 29 organic gastrointestinal disease patients, and 10 healthy volunteers underwent a rectal barostat test to measure fasting and postprandial rectosigmoid tone. Rectosigmoid response was assessed following three meals containing different amounts of calories: 200 kcal, 400 kcal and 1000 kcal. RESULTS: After 200 kcal, healthy volunteers and patients with organic diseases showed a reduction in rectosigmoid volume of at least 28% of fasting volume, indicating a meal induced increase in muscle tone. In contrast, patients with diarrhoea predominant IBS showed dilation of the rectosigmoid colon, indicative of reduced tone, and patients with constipation predominant IBS showed a mild volume reduction or no modification. Functional diarrhoea and constipation patients showed rectosigmoid tone modification resembling that of the corresponding IBS subtype. A 400 kcal meal normalised rectosigmoid tone in more than half of the constipation predominant IBS patients but none of the diarrhoea predominant IBS patients. In contrast, a 1000 kcal meal normalised tone response in all IBS patients. Sensitivity of the test was 100%, specificity 93%, positive predictive value 96%, and negative predictive value 100%. CONCLUSION: A postprandial reduction in rectosigmoid tone of at least 28% of fasting value after a low caloric meal accurately separates organic and functional gastrointestinal disease patients. This parameter may therefore be used in the positive diagnosis of IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In Irritable Bowel Syndrome, the gut-associated immune system may be up-regulated resulting in immune complex production, low-grade inflammation, loss of Class I bacteria, and translocation of inflammatory mediators and macromolecules outside of the GI lumen. Since food intolerance may be one of the reasons for this upregulation, our goal was to investigate the role of food intolerance in IBS patients. METHODS: In this open label pilot study, we enrolled 20 patients with IBS by Rome II criteria (15 women, ages 24-81) who had failed standard medical therapies in a tertiary care GI clinic. Baseline serum IgE and IgG food and mold panels, and comprehensive stool analysis (CSA) were performed. Breath-hydrogen testing and IBS Quality-of-Life (QOL) questionnaires were obtained. Patients underwent food elimination diets based on the results of food and mold panels followed by controlled food challenge. Probiotics were also introduced. Repeat testing was performed at 6-months. We followed up with this cohort at 1 year after trial completion to assess the reported intervention and for placebo effect. RESULTS: Baseline abnormalities were identified on serum IgG food and mold panels in 100% of the study subjects with significant improvement after food elimination and rotation diet (p < 0.05). Significant improvements were seen in stool frequency (p < 0.05), pain (p < 0.05), and IBS-QOL scores (p < 0.0001). Imbalances of beneficial flora and dysbiotic flora were identified in 100% of subjects by CSA. There was a trend to improvement of beneficial flora after treatment but no change in dysbiotic flora. The 1-year follow up demonstrated significant continued adherence to the food rotation diet (4.00 +/- 1.45), minimal symptomatic problems with IBS (4.00 +/- 1.17), and perception of control over IBS (4.15 +/- 1.23). The continued use of probiotics was considered less helpful (3.40 +/- 1.60). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that identifying and appropriately addressing food sensitivity in IBS patients not previously responding to standard therapy results in a sustained clinical response and impacts on overall well being and quality of life in this challenging entity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonists improve symptoms in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS), 5-HT 4 agonists help those with constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS). These data suggest excess or deficiency in 5-HT in D-IBS or C-IBS, respectively. Mucosal 5-HT-containing enterochromaffin cells (EC) are increased in postinfectious IBS (PI-IBS). Our aim was to define the postprandial release of 5-HT in PI-IBS and C-IBS patients and to relate this to mucosal 5-HT turnover. METHODS: Fifteen PI-IBS patients with diarrhea-predominant symptoms, 15 C-IBS patients, and 15 healthy controls underwent serial (platelet-poor) plasma 5-HT measurement for 3 hours after a standard 520-kcal meal. Rectal biopsy specimens were assayed for 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Colonic transit was measured using radio-opaque markers. RESULTS: Colonic transit was prolonged in C-IBS patients (mean +/- SEM) (49.4 +/- 3.8 h) compared with PI-IBS (26.7 +/- 4.5) and control patients (34.1 +/- 4.5) ( P < .02). Release of 5-HT assessed by area under the curve (AUC) of platelet-poor plasma 5-HT from 0 to 180 minutes postprandially was significantly lower in C-IBS patients (2593 +/- 309 mmol/L . min) compared with P-IBS (5623 +/- 721) and control patients (4822 +/- 598) ( P < .001). PI-IBS patients showed significantly higher peak postprandial plasma 5-HT values (median, range) (71.7, 43.4-125.3) ng/L compared with C-IBS patients (31.2, 15.2-40.5) and control patients (43.6, 26.7-50.1) ( P < .01). Mucosal 5-HT turnover as assessed by mucosal 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was decreased in both C-IBS and PI-IBS patients, .14 (.01-.6) and .21 (.02-2.5), respectively, compared with control patients 1.12 (.17-3.1) ( P < .002). CONCLUSIONS: C-IBS patients show impaired postprandial 5-HT release whereas PI-IBS patients have higher peak levels, abnormalities that may be related to their different symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The determinants of the placebo effect are not well established. Goal of this study was to explore likely predictive factors in an already published data set. METHODS: We re-analysed data from a study in 120 patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that were randomly assigned to three arms of the study to receive (double-blind) either a drug (mebeverin) (n = 40) or placebo (n = 40), or (in an open trial) dietary treatment (fibre) (n = 40) for up to 16 week. Treatment was conducted by 3 different doctors (A, B, C) with 44, 27, and 18 patients, resp. A fourth group (n = 31) was treated by different varying physicians. Symptoms were assessed every 4 weeks, and the degree of patient compliance and the number of drop-outs, the number of patients improved/not improved (in %), symptom severity (Kruis Score) at enrolment, and age and gender as covariates were included into the analysis. RESULTS: Drop-out rate was 30 % for placebo, 30 % for mebeverin, and 15 % for the diet. For the patients remaining in the study, average compliance was 75 % with placebo, but 89 % for the drug and 82 % for the diet. Response rates were 39 % for placebo, but 20 % for the drug; response rate for the diet (open trial) was 43 % under all doctors. Response rates for drug and placebo combined were 32 % for doctor A (female,43 years), but 19 % for doctors B and C together (both males, 32 and 40 years)); this effect was not significant. Placebo responders were more often women (47 %) than men (28 %), while age effects were only found with dietary treatment: responders were younger. Placebo responders had an overall lower Kruis Score than non-responders (45 vs 52 points), but this was also true for drug (52 vs. 62 points) and diet responders (56 vs 68 points). CONCLUSION: The major factors contributing to the placebo response are the treating physician (gender, training), and the patients gender (female). Patients with lower Kruis score (more likely non-functionally disordered) may be prone to higher (placebo) response rates.},

On the other hand, the presence of clinically important abdominal discomfort or pain associated with constipation defines irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation. Intake of dietary fibre and bulking agents (psyllium) may be effective in alleviating chronic constipation in patients without slow colonic transit or disordered constipation. On the other hand, fibre may improve stool consistency in patients with IBS with constipation, but it is considered to be not effective in improving abdominal pain, distension or bloating. Probiotics may be effective in relieving constipation; however, the effect of lactic acid bacteria ingestion may be dependent on the bacterial strain used and the population being studied. Lactulose, which is a substrate for lactic acid bacteria (prebiotic), is effective to treat patients with chronic constipation.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and irritable bowel syndrome are chronic, debilitating gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. There are no known causes of inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome. Both of these GI conditions significantly impair quality of life and the ability to complete activities of daily living. Unfortunately, there has been little education and research surrounding the evaluation of effective coping strategies with respect to GI disorders, particularly from the perspective of those diagnosed. As such, exploring the strategies of individuals with GI disorders would provide information concerning coping strategies from the perspective of those afflicted. PURPOSE: The overall objective of this research was to explore the lived experience of women who had been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome. This article specifically explores the relationship between food and irritable bowel syndrome and/or inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Eight females, diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and/or irritable bowel syndrome, were recruited via on-campus posters from a university in southern Ontario, Canada. Qualitative information was collected in the form of background questionnaires, e-mail interviews, and face-to-face interviews, which were subsequently analyzed for trends. RESULTS: Every woman reported that one of the most significant means by which to cope with their condition centered around food consumption or controlling their food consumption. Subjects identified the importance of determining their "trigger foods," selecting healthy food choices, the impact of stress, and problems associated with food and travel. CONCLUSIONS: This research, predicated on the narratives of women diagnosed with GI disorders, substantiates the profound effect that food has on conditions of the GI tract. All of the women identified their relationship with food as a dynamic learning process, one that they thought would be a lifelong struggle. The implications for community health nurses in assisting individuals with GI disorders are discussed.},

   abstract = {GOAL: The goal of this report is to review the use of dietary intake and probiotics in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in published reports. BACKGROUND: Dietary factors can be important in inducing symptoms that occur in patients with the IBS. Dietary intolerances, dietary allergies, specific food metabolites, and regular diet contents all may act as triggers and aggravate the symptoms of IBS; but when any of these mechanisms can be proven to cause the symptoms, then their elimination results in the resolution of that patient's IBS. METHODS: Our previous review was updated. In addition, a careful Medline search was made for the years from 1975 to 2004 to evaluate human research reports on diet and probiotics in the IBS. Forty-six manuscripts were reviewed on diet and six were available on probiotic use in IBS. The most common dietary factor evaluated in the literature was bran, and the most common probiotic used was Lactobacillus plantarum. CONCLUSIONS: Although investigations have shown that bran may be helpful in some patients, a complete review of the literature does not reveal conclusive evidence that diet therapy is effective in IBS. From the limited reports on probiotics, there appears to be a trend to decreasing symptoms. It is clear that much more prospective research is needed to study both dietary factors and probiotics in these areas.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the world's most common gastrointestinal functional disorder and is associated with several social and economic costs. Health-related quality of life is often impaired in patients with IBS. The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying IBS remain poorly defined. The therapeutic approach to patients with IBS is based on symptoms, and fibers may play an important role in treatment. Among the various types of fiber, water-soluble, non-gelling fibers seem to be a promising option for treatment of IBS. Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a water-soluble, non-gelling fiber that has provided therapeutic benefits. In clinical trials, PHGG decreased symptoms in constipation-predominant and diarrhea-predominant forms of IBS and decreased abdominal pain. Further, an improvement in quality of life was observed in patients with IBS during and after treatment with PHGG. Moreover, PHGG seems to have prebiotic properties because it increases the colonic contents of short-chain fatty acids, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacteria.},

Because overlapping irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is so common, one of the most important interventions a clinician can make is recognizing its existence. This requires a thorough understanding of underlying pathophysiologic processes. Differentiating among the causes of symptoms is especially significant in a minority of patients mislabeled as having 'refractory IBD.' Escalating therapy directed at disease activity may have no effect on functional symptoms other than to reinforce their presence. Treatment of IBS in patients with IBD is similar to that of the general population. The cornerstone of treatment is establishing a constructive doctor-patient relationship. Initial therapy usually involves a conservative approach that includes patient education and diet and lifestyle modifications. Pharmacologic treatment is individualized and generally directed at the predominant symptoms. Options may broadly include antispasmodics, antidiarrheals, and antidepressants, either alone or in combination. Psychosocial therapies have shown to be beneficial in selected individuals.},

   abstract = {While irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common in the West, early studies suggest that the prevalence is low in developing countries. However, recent studies point to increasing prevalence in newly developed Asian economies. The presentation appears to differ from the West, with a lack of female predominance, a greater frequency of upper abdominal pain and defecatory symptoms perceived as being less bothersome. This difference, together with the preoccupation with organic disease, could explain why we may be missing IBS in Asia and also why excess surgery has been observed in some Asian countries. While a recent study from China, consistent with western studies, support an important role for infection and inflammation, early studies from India reporting no association between amoebic infection and IBS appear to dispute this observation. To reconcile these seemingly contradictory observations, an hygiene hypothesis model is proposed. Exposure to a variety of microorganisms early in life could result in the colonization of the intestine with microflora that can respond more efficiently to an episode of gastroenteritis. Together with the changes with evolution of Asian economies such as westernization of the diet and increased psychosocial stress, it is proposed that loss of this internal protective effect, could give rise to a more uniform worldwide prevalence of IBS.},

There are many causes of gas and bloating including aerophagia, luminal obstructive processes, carbohydrate intolerance syndromes, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, diseases of gut motor activity, and functional bowel disorders including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Because of the prominence of gaseous complaints in IBS, recent investigations have focused on new insights into pathogenesis and novel therapies of bloating. The evaluation of the patient with unexplained gas and bloating relies on careful exclusion of organic disease with further characterization of the underlying condition with directed functional testing. Treatment of gaseous symptomatology should be targeted to pathophysiologic defects whenever possible. Available therapies include lifestyle alterations, dietary modifications, enzyme preparations, adsorbents and agents which reduce surface tension, treatments that alter gut flora, and drugs that modulate gut transit.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: No national survey on the present clinical spectrum and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in people with coeliac disease has been conducted in Germany until now. METHODS: The German Coeliac Society DZG posted a set of questionnaires (self-developed socio-demographic and medical questionnaire, the Short Form Health Survey, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Giessen Symptom Check List) to 1000/18 355 of their members who were >/=18 years (every 18th member following consecutive postal codes of the membership directory). RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-six usable questionnaires were returned (diagnosis proven by biopsy; 78% female, median age 45.5 years). The median interval between the first medical examination due to symptoms of coeliac disease and the final diagnosis was 1 year. Ninety-eight percent reported a reduction of initial symptoms, 85% an improvement of HRQOL with a median gain in weight of 8 kg after starting a gluten-free diet (median duration of 6 years). Sixty-seven percent adhered all the time to the dietary regimen and 26% adhered most of the time. The most frequent diseases associated with coeliac disease were osteoporosis (15%), oral aphtae (12%) and dermatitis herpetiformis (9%). Because of the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms 26% of the patients met the modified Rome I criteria for irritable bowel symptom. Compared to representative samples from the German population, coeliac disease patients had higher scores for anxiety , fatigue, dyspeptic and musculoskeletal pain, and a reduced HRQOL in 9/10 scales of the SF-36 (all P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Despite being on a gluten-free diet German coeliac disease patients suffer from a high burden of general and extra-intestinal symptoms and a reduced HRQOL.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Out-of-pocket expenditures of over 34 billion dollars per year in the US are an apparent testament to a widely held belief that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies have benefits that outweigh their costs. However, regardless of public opinion, there is often little more than anecdotal evidence on the health and economic implications of CAM therapies. The objectives of this study are to present an overview of economic evaluation and to expand upon a previous review to examine the current scope and quality of CAM economic evaluations. METHODS: The data sources used were Medline, AMED, Alt-HealthWatch, and the Complementary and Alternative Medicine Citation Index; January 1999 to October 2004. Papers that reported original data on specific CAM therapies from any form of standard economic analysis were included. Full economic evaluations were subjected to two types of quality review. The first was a 35-item checklist for reporting quality, and the second was a set of four criteria for study quality (randomization, prospective collection of economic data, comparison to usual care, and no blinding). RESULTS: A total of 56 economic evaluations (39 full evaluations) of CAM were found covering a range of therapies applied to a variety of conditions. The reporting quality of the full evaluations was poor for certain items, but was comparable to the quality found by systematic reviews of economic evaluations in conventional medicine. Regarding study quality, 14 (36%) studies were found to meet all four criteria. These exemplary studies indicate CAM therapies that may be considered cost-effective compared to usual care for various conditions: acupuncture for migraine, manual therapy for neck pain, spa therapy for Parkinson's, self-administered stress management for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, pre- and post-operative oral nutritional supplementation for lower gastrointestinal tract surgery, biofeedback for patients with "functional" disorders (eg, irritable bowel syndrome), and guided imagery, relaxation therapy, and potassium-rich diet for cardiac patients. CONCLUSION: Whereas the number and quality of economic evaluations of CAM have increased in recent years and more CAM therapies have been shown to be of good value, the majority of CAM therapies still remain to be evaluated.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common and likely a multifactorial gastrointestinal disorder in which a disturbed brain-gut axis has been thought to have a mandatory role. Recent clinical and experimental studies imply that dietary factors may be more important in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome than was earlier anticipated. The purpose of this review is to present those studies and discuss their findings in relation to the crosstalk between the gastrointestinal immune and nervous systems. RECENT FINDINGS: Food elimination based on serum immunoglobulin G antibodies in irritable bowel syndrome has been found to result in a significant decrease in symptoms, compared with diets in which dietary restrictions are not guided by those antibodies. Both numbers of mast cells and their mediators have been shown to be increased in intestinal mucosa in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, especially in the close proximity of intestinal nerves. Animal studies have demonstrated that this increase in intestinal mast cell density could be a consequence of local hypersensitivity to food antigens. That kind of local gastrointestinal hypersensitivity seems to be beyond the reach of current diagnostic methods available in clinical practice. SUMMARY: Dietary factors may significantly contribute to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome. Elimination diets based on the detection of local food hypersensitivity may offer a treatment option for irritable bowel syndrome patients in the future.},

   abstract = {How to treat patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who do not respond to pharmacotherapy is an unsolved problem. Psychotherapy, which has been reported on in previous studies, is available only in specific centers. We describe in this study a novel and simple psychotherapy; that is, the fasting therapy (FT) for treatment of patients with IBS. Of 84 inpatients with IBS, 58 patients who still had moderate to severe IBS symptoms after 4-week basic treatment were investigated retrospectively. Of the 58 patients enrolled in this study, 36 underwent FT, whereas the remaining 22 received a consecutive basic treatment (control therapy). There were no significant differences in the 4-point severity scales of gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms between the 2 groups before the start of FT. The basic treatment consisted of pharmacotherapy and brief psychotherapy, whereas the FT consisted of 10 days of starvation followed by 5 days of refeeding. Changes in scores of symptoms before and after each treatment were analyzed. FT significantly improved 7 out of the 10 symptoms assessed; that is, abdominal pain-discomfort (p < .001), abdominal distension (p < .001), diarrhea (p < .001), anorexia (p = .02), nausea (p < .01), anxiety (p < .001), and interference with life in general (p < .001). However, the control therapy significantly improved only 3 out of the 10 symptoms assessed; that is, abdominal pain-discomfort (p = .03), abdominal distension (p < .01), and interference with life (p = .01). Our results suggest that FT may have beneficial effects on intractable patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome has been said to be less common in developing countries compared with western populations. In some case series of irritable bowel syndrome from the Indian subcontinent and Africa, the female predominance typical of western patients did not occur. AIM AND METHODS: A systematic review was performed on Medline, of community prevalence studies of irritable bowel syndrome, chronic constipation and chronic diarrhoea using standardized criteria, with special reference to the effect of geography and ethnicity, and the gender distribution in different countries. RESULTS: There is a wide variation, depending in part on the criteria used and differences in diagnostic practices and health care utilization. No convincing evidence emerged of a difference between east and west. Most series, eastern or western showed a female predominance or no gender difference. Several US studies in communities and specific populations suggest that stool frequency is lower, and the prevalence of constipation higher, among Afro-Caribbean Americans compared with white individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Community studies in multi-racial populations are a useful way of assessing possible ethnic differences in the frequency of irritable bowel syndrome, chronic constipation and diarrhoea, and would additionally present opportunities to relate any ethnic differences to dietary and other environmental factors.},

METHODS: Forty-eight patients with Rome II IBS were randomized in a parallel group, double-blind design to placebo or VSL# 3 twice daily (31 patients received 4 weeks and 17 patients 8 weeks of treatment). Pre- and post-treatment colonic transit measurements were performed using scintigraphy with (111)In charcoal. Symptoms were summarized as an average daily score for the entire period of treatment and separately for the first 4 weeks of treatment. Weekly satisfactory relief of abdominal bloating was assessed. RESULTS: Treatment with VSL# 3 was associated with reduced flatulence over the entire treatment period (placebo 39.5 +/- 2.6 vs VSL# 3 29.7 +/- 2.6, P = 0.011); similarly, during the first 4 weeks of treatment, flatulence scores were reduced (placebo 40.1 +/- 2.5 vs VSL# 3 30.8 +/- 2.5, P = 0.014). Proportions of responders for satisfactory relief of bloating, stool-related symptoms, abdominal pain and bloating scores were not different. Colonic transit was retarded with VSL# 3 relative to placebo (colon geometric center 2.27 +/- 0.20 vs 2.83 +/- 0.19, P = 0.05 respectively). CONCLUSION: VSL# 3 reduces flatulence scores and retards colonic transit without altering bowel function in patients with IBS and bloating.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is considered to be prevalent in the general population, but there are little data on bowel habits and IBS in Korea. Because nurses are frequently called on to help this patient population with IBS and help manage their symptoms, it is very necessary to get some practical information about patients' experiences and to outline a multifaceted approach to the practical management of patient with IBS. So this study aims to describe the bowel habits and the prevalence of IBS in young university students in Korea and to investigate the influence of lifestyle factors, including dietary habits, on IBS prevalence. Finally, we discuss the nursing needs for an holistic approach. METHODS: A cross-sectional study, using the self-reported questionnaire based on previous studies done abroad and the Rome alpha criteria was applied with 1717 young university students. RESULTS: The answers of 747 men and 970 women were included in the study. The prevalence of IBS, as defined by the Rome alpha criteria, was 5.7% of the subjects. The proportion of women (70.7%) was significantly higher than the proportion of men in the IBS group as compared to that in the non-IBS group (odds ratio 2.07, 95% CI 1.2-3.7). Residential type (odds ratio 1.27, 95% 1.06-1.5) and frequency of meals (odds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.2-2.5) significantly differed between the IBS group and non-IBS group. There was a trend towards the higher prevalence of IBS with fewer hours of exercise (odds ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.95-1.04). 90.6% of respondents reported stool frequencies between three times per day and three times per week. Characteristics of defecation differed significantly between men and women (p<0.05, to p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IBS in healthy young people of Korea was lower compared with those reported in the West. This study shows that proportionately more women suffered from IBS than men and dietary factors and lifestyle were significantly related to IBS. From our study results, we found that there are multifaceted nursing aspects required to reduce symptoms, such as dietary education and encouragement to change lifestyle aimed at controlling stress.},

   abstract = {Because of the wide variations in the clinical presentation of celiac disease and because treatment exists that is effective in most cases, screening of the general population for celiac disease has been considered. There is still no evidence that patients who have symptom-free celiac disease are at increased risk of small intestinal lymphoma or other complications. Prevention of osteoporosis seems to be the strongest indicator for widespread screening today [22]. The major cause of failure to respond to a gluten-free diet is continuing ingestion of gluten, but other underlying diseases must be considered. Many different drugs (eg, anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) have been used in patients who have RCD [23]. Steroid treatment has been reported to be effective even in patients who have underlying early EATL. Histologic recovery in patients who have celiac disease usually takes several months but can take up to 1 year, even if the patient remains on a strict gluten-free diet. Some patients report celiac-related symptoms for months after a single gluten intake. The definitions for RCD in literature vary. The authors consider the definition give by Daum and colleagues [24] suitable. They defined true RCD as villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and increased IELs persisting for more than 12 months in spite of a strict gluten-free diet. If a patient is not responding well to a gluten-free diet, three considerations are necessary: (1) the initial diagnosis of celiac disease must be reassessed;(2) the patient should be sent to a dietician to check for errors in diet or compliance problems, because problems with the gluten-free diet are the most important cause for persisting symptoms; (3) other reasons for persisting symptoms (eg, pancreatic insufficiency, irritable bowel syndrome, bacterial overgrowth, lymphocytic colitis, collagenous colitis, ulcerative jejunitis, protein-losing enteropathy,T-cell lymphoma, fructose intolerance, cavitating lymphadenopathy, and tropical sprue) should be considered. Other causes for villous atrophy are Crohn's disease, collagenous sprue, and autoimmune enteropathy. Abdulkarim and colleagues [25] examined 55 patients who had a diagnosis of nonresponsive celiac disease. He found that 6 did not have celiac disease, and25 still had some gluten ingestion.Tursi and colleagues [26] reported 15 patients who had celiac disease with persisting symptoms. Because histology improved in all patients after several months, RCD was excluded. Of the 15 patients, 10 had small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, 2 showed lactose malabsorption causing the described symptoms, 1 had mistakenly taken an antibiotic containing gluten, and 1 patient each had Giardia lamblia and Ascaris lumbricoides. Thus, other entities must be considered in patients who have celiac disease and ongoing symptoms. In a follow-up clinical trial, 158 patients who had celiac disease underwent follow-up small intestine biopsies within 2 years after starting a gluten-free diet. Eleven patients (7.0%) with persisting (partial) villous atrophy were considered to have RCD; 5 of them developed EATL [27].RCD type I is characterized by normal expression of T-cell antigens and polyclonal TCR gene rearrangement.RCD type II is characterized by an abnormal IEL phenotype with the expression of intracytoplasmic CD3e, surface CD103, and the lack of classic surface T-cell markers such as CD8, CD4, and TCR-alpha/beta. This clonal IEL population can be considered crypt IEL [24]. RCD II has a poor prognosis, which is a problem for therapy. Clonal TCR gene rearrangements and loss of T-cell antigens such as CD8 and TCR-beta in IELs may indicate the development of an EATL in patients who have RCD. The markers for an overt EATL are a positive stool blood test, increased lactate dehydrogenase, or beta2-microglobulin [24]. If an overt lymphoma is suspected, upper and lower endoscopy, an ear, nose, and throat work-up, CT scan, capsule endoscopy, and possibly double-balloon enteroscopy should be performed. Most reports of the difficulties in treating patients who have true RCE are casereports. Turner and colleagues [28] reported on an induction of remission by useof the anti-TNF-alpha antibody infliximab and maintenance with prednisoloneand azathioprine. Olaussen and colleagues [29] and Mandal and colleagues [30]tried a nonimmunogenic elemental diet. Gillet and colleagues [31] reported successful treatment of a patient who hadRCD using anti-TNF-alpha antibodies (infliximab) for induction and azathioprinefor maintenance. Maurino and colleagues [32] studied seven consecutive patients diagnosed ashaving refractory sprue and no response to oral or parenteral steroids. Aftertreatment with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/d) and oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/d), fivepatients had a complete clinical remission. Two patients who did not respond totreatment at any time died. Goerres and colleagues [33] described 18 patients who had RCD, 10 of whomhad type I RCD, and 8 of whom had type II RCD. Treatment consisted ofazathioprine combined with prednisone for 1 year. Consistent with reports byother investigators, the response rates in the two groups differed. Eight of the10 patients who had type I RCD had a histologic response. Seven of the eightpatients who had type II RCD died, and six of the eight developed a lymphoma. At present there is no effective treatment for type II RCD.Fig. 3 presents a proposed algorithm for monitoring patients who have ce-liac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Yoga is promoted or weight maintenance, but there is little evidence of its efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether yoga practice is associated with lower mean 10-year weight gain after age 45. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 15,550 adults, aged 53 to 57 years, recruited to the Vitamin and Lifestyle (VITAL) cohort study between 2000 and 2002. MEASUREMENTS: Physical activity (including yoga) during the past 10 years, diet, height, and weight at recruitment and at ages 30 and 45. All measures were based on self-reporting, and past weight was retrospectively ascertained. METHODS: Multiple regression analyses were used to examined covariate-adjusted associations between yoga practice and weight change from age 45 to recruitment, and polychotomous logistic regression was used to examine associations of yoga practice with the relative odds of weight maintenance (within 5%) and weight loss (> 5%) compared to weight gain. RESULTS: Yoga practice for four or more years was associated with a 3.1-lb lower weight gain among normal weight (BMI < 25) participants [9.5 lbs versus 12.6 Ibs] and an 18.5-lb lower weight gain among overweight participants [-5.0 lbs versus 13.5 Ibs] (both P for trend <.001). Among overweight individuals, 4+ years of yoga practice was associated with a relative odds of 1.85 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-5.42) for weight maintenance (within 5%) and 3.88 (95% Cl 1.30-9.88) for weight loss (> 5%) compared to weight gain (P for trend .026 and .003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Regular yoga practice was associated with attenuated weight gain, most strongly among individuals who were overweight. Although causal inference from this observational study is not possible, results are consistent with the hypothesis that regular yoga practice can benefit individuals who wish to maintain or lose weight.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder characterized by abdominal discomfort and disordered bowel habits. Despite the high prevalence of IBS, little is known about how physicians perceive this condition. The aims of our study were to measure physicians' understanding of IBS, to assess their attitudes towards patients with IBS, and to determine whether there are differences in the way Internal Medicine physicians (IM), Family Practice physicians (FP), and Gastroenterology physicians (GI) evaluate and treat IBS patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A survey was sent to 3000 physicians nationwide, 1000 each to IM, FP, and GI. The survey contained 35 questions assessing demographics, the etiology and pathophysiology of IBS, the use of diagnostic tests, and practice patterns and attitudes. RESULTS: Of the deliverable questionnaires, 501 were returned completed; 472 of the respondents interviewed only adult patients, representing the cohort for this analysis. The mean age of all respondents was 47; most were men (80%). IM and FP made a new diagnosis of IBS 1.3-1.6 times each week, while GI made a new diagnosis 5.4 times each week (p<0.0001). Compared with the perceptions of FP and IM, GI felt that IBS patients were less sick than other patients (p<0.001), although they required more time per visit. More GI compared with FP and IM stated that prior infection and a history of abuse were the causes of IBS (p<0.01), while FP were more likely to believe that diet was a cause of IBS (p<0.01). GI felt a new diagnosis of IBS could be made without further testing 42% of the time. FP and IM felt that one-third of IBS patients needed referral to a GI. CONCLUSIONS: The attitudes and practice patterns of physicians towards patients with IBS differ depending on practice specialty. This may be due to differences in training, the ability to perform specialized tests, and/or differences in referral patterns. Further training may improve the ability of physicians in all specialties confidently to diagnose and treat patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To present the case of a collegiate tennis player with celiac disease symptoms. BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a common intestinal disorder that is often confused with other conditions. It causes severe intestinal damage manifested by several uncomfortable signs and symptoms. Failure by the sports medicine staff to recognize symptoms consistent with celiac disease and treat them appropriately can have deleterious consequences for the athlete. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn disease, Addison disease, lupus erythematosus, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, lactose intolerance, herpes zoster, psychogenic disorder (depression), fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome, hyperthyroidism, anemia, type I diabetes. TREATMENT: The athlete underwent a series of blood and allergen tests to confirm or refute a diagnosis of celiac disease. When celiac disease was suspected, dietary modifications were made to eliminate all wheat-based and gluten-based products from the athlete's diet. UNIQUENESS: The athlete was able to fully compete in a competitive National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I tennis program while experiencing the debilitating effects associated with celiac disease. The immediacy of symptom onset was notable because the athlete had no history of similar complaints. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects more people than reported. A properly educated sports medicine staff can help to identify symptoms consistent with celiac disease early, so damage to the intestine is minimized. Prompt recognition and appropriate management allow the athlete to adjust the diet accordingly, compete at a high-caliber level, and enjoy a healthier quality of life.},

Research on the relationship between GI symptoms (including irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]), weight, and weight-related behaviors are rare. This study assessed rates of GI symptoms in a sample of obese patients in a weight-loss program and explored relationships among GI symptoms and obesity, binge eating, dieting (fat and fruit/fiber consumption), and physical activity. METHODS: A total of 983 participants (70% women) had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 33.2+/-5.7 kg/m2 (range, 25.1-60.8 kg/m2) and a mean age of 52.7+/-12.4 years (range, 20.4-89.8 y). Participants completed a questionnaire about diet and physical activity and a standardized self-report Rome II questionnaire assessing IBS status and GI symptoms. RESULTS: In bivariate analyses BMI was associated positively with abdominal pain and diarrhea whereas healthier diet (lower fat and higher fruit/fiber intake) and higher physical activity were associated with fewer GI symptoms. In multivariate models BMI was not associated with GI symptoms; physical activity remained a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: Although physiologic mechanisms still need to be explored, associations between GI symptoms and diet and exercise behaviors may have implications for the treatment of both obesity and GI symptoms.},

Diagnosis of a functional bowel disorder (FBD) requires characteristic symptoms during the last 3 months and onset > or =6 months ago. Alarm symptoms suggest the possibility of structural disease, but do not necessarily negate a diagnosis of an FBD. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional bloating, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea are best identified by symptom-based approaches. Subtyping of IBS is controversial, and we suggest it be based on stool form, which can be aided by use of the Bristol Stool Form Scale. Diagnostic testing should be guided by the patient's age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. Treatment of FBDs is based on an individualized evaluation, explanation, and reassurance. Alterations in diet, drug treatment aimed at predominant symptoms, and psychotherapy may be beneficial.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates that alter the composition, or metabolism, of the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner. It is therefore expected that prebiotics will improve health in a way similar to probiotics, whilst at the same time being cheaper, and carrying less risk and being easier to incorporate into the diet than probiotics. AIM: To review published evidence for prebiotic effects on gut function and human health. METHODS: We searched the Science Citation Index with the terms prebiotic, microbiota, gut bacteria, large intestine, mucosa, bowel habit, constipation, diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, calcium and cancer, focussing principally on studies in humans and reports in the English language. Search of the Cochrane Library did not identify any clinical study or meta-analysis on this topic. RESULTS: Three prebiotics, oligofructose, galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose, clearly alter the balance of the large bowel microbiota by increasing bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus numbers. These carbohydrates are fermented and give rise to short-chain fatty acid and intestinal gas; however, effects on bowel habit are relatively small. Randomized-controlled trials of their effect in a clinical context are few, although animal studies show anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel disease, while calcium absorption is increased. CONCLUSIONS: It is still early days for prebiotics, but they offer the potential to modify the gut microbial balance in such a way as to bring direct health benefits cheaply and safely.},

   abstract = {Following the application of simple serological tests for the diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) in the 1980s, it gradually became clear that the prevalence of CD in different countries in the Middle East, North Africa and India is almost the same as that in Western countries. The prevalence of CD in at-risk populations in these regions is reported to range between 3 and 20% and the prevalence in people with type 1 diabetes is approximately 3-5%. Clinical manifestations of CD vary markedly with age, the duration and the extent of disease. Clinical studies showed that presentation with non-specific symptoms or no symptoms is as common in the Middle East as it is in Europe. Wheat has been the major staple food in these regions for many centuries and it is possible that the continuous and high level of exposure to wheat proteins has induced some degree of immune tolerance, leading to milder symptoms, which are misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome or unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. A high index of suspicion for CD should be maintained in all developing countries for patients who present with chronic diarrhoea or iron deficiency anaemia. The best method for diagnosing CD in patients with diarrhoea is the panel of coeliac serological tests followed by small-bowel biopsy. In the absence of supplies for a gluten-free diet in Middle Eastern countries, maintaining this diet represents a real challenge to both patients and clinicians.},

   abstract = {Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common multifactorial intestinal disorder for which the aetiology remains largely undefined. Here, we have used a Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis)-induced model of post-infective IBS, and the effects of probiotic bacteria on gut dysfunction have been investigated using a metabonomic strategy. A total of 44 mice were divided into four groups: an uninfected control group and three T. spiralis-infected groups, one as infected control and the two other groups subsequently treated with either Lactobacillus paracasei (L. paracasei) NCC2461 in spent culture medium (SCM) or with L. paracasei-free SCM. Plasma, jejunal wall and longitudinal myenteric muscle samples were collected at day 21 post-infection. An NMR-based metabonomic approach characterized that the plasma metabolic profile of T. spiralis-infected mice showed an increased energy metabolism (lactate, citrate, alanine), fat mobilization (acetoacetate, 3-D-hydroxybutyrate, lipoproteins) and a disruption of amino acid metabolism due to increased protein breakdown, which were related to the intestinal hypercontractility. Increased levels of taurine, creatine and glycerophosphorylcholine in the jejunal muscles were associated with the muscular hypertrophy and disrupted jejunal functions. L. paracasei treatment normalized the muscular activity and the disturbed energy metabolism as evidenced by decreased glycogenesis and elevated lipid breakdown in comparison with untreated T. spiralis-infected mice. Changes in the levels of plasma metabolites (glutamine, lysine, methionine) that might relate to a modulation of immunological responses were also observed in the presence of the probiotic treatment. The work presented here suggests that probiotics may be beneficial in patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Excess cholesterol in bile and in blood is a major risk factor for the respective development of gallbladder disease and atherosclerosis. This lipid in excess negatively impacts the functioning of other smooth muscles, including the intestine. Serotonin is an important mediator of the contractile responses of the small intestine. Drugs targeting the serotonin receptor are used as prokinetic agents to manage intestinal motor disorders, in particular irritable bowel syndrome. Thus, tegaserod, acting on 5-HT4 receptor, ideally should obviate detrimental effects of excessive cholesterol on gastrointestinal smooth muscle. In this study we examined the effect of tegaserod on cholesterol-induced changes in the contractile responses of intestinal smooth muscle. METHODS: The effects of a high cholesterol (1%) diet on the in vitro contractile responses of jejunal longitudinal smooth muscle from Richardson ground squirrels to the cholinergic agonist carbachol were examined in the presence or absence of tetrodrodotoxin (TTX). Two groups of animals, fed either low (0.03%) or high cholesterol rat chow diet, were further divided into two subgroups and treated for 28 days with either vehicle or tegaserod. RESULTS: The high cholesterol diet increased, by nearly 2-fold, contractions of the jejunal longitudinal smooth muscle elicited by carbachol. These cholinergic contractions were mediated by muscarinic receptors since they were blocked by scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, but not by the nicotinic receptor antagonist, hexamethonium. Tegaserod treatment, which did not affect cholinergic contractions of tissues from low cholesterol fed animals, abrogated the increase caused by the high cholesterol diet. With low cholesterol diet TTX enhanced carbachol-evoked contractions, whereas this action potential blocker did not affect the augmented cholinergic contractions seen with tissues from animals on the high cholesterol diet. Tegaserod-treatment removed the effects of a high cholesterol diet on neuronal muscarinic receptors, as the potentiating effect of TTX on carbachol-elicited contractions was maintained in these animals. CONCLUSION: A high cholesterol diet causes significant changes to cholinergic neurotransmission in the enteric nerves of the jejunum. The mechanisms by which these effects of cholesterol are reversed by tegaserod are unknown, but relate to removal of an inhibitory effect of cholesterol on enteric nerves.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tegaserod is effective in treating IBS patients with constipation, and does not alter gallbladder motility in healthy individuals or in patients with IBS. However, it is not known if tegaserod affects the biliary tract in gallstone disease, so to this end the effects of tegaserod on bile composition and hepatic secretion of Richardson ground squirrels maintained on an enriched cholesterol diet were examined. RESULTS: Animals were fed either a control (0.03%) or enriched (1%) cholesterol diet for 28 days, and treated s.c. with tegaserod (0.1 mg/kg BID) or vehicle. Bile flow, bile acid, phospholipids and cholesterol secretion were measured with standard methods. Tegaserod treatment or enriched cholesterol diet, alone or combination, did not alter body or liver weights. The enriched cholesterol diet increased cholesterol saturation index (CSI), cholesterol concentrations in gallbladder and hepatic duct bile by approximately 50% and decreased bile acids in gallbladder bile by 17%. Tegaserod treatment reversed these cholesterol-induced changes. None of the treatments, drug or diet, altered fasting gallbladder volume, bile flow and bile salts or phospholipid secretion in normal diet and cholesterol-fed animals. However, tegaserod treatment prevented the decreases in bile acid pool size and cycling frequency caused by the enriched cholesterol diet, consequent to re-establishing normal bile acid to concentrations in the gall bladder. Tegaserod had no effect on these parameters with normal diet animals. CONCLUSION: Tegaserod treatment results in increased enterohepatic cycling and lowers cholesterol saturation in the bile of cholesterol-fed animals. These effects would decrease conditions favorable to cholesterol gallstone formation.},

   abstract = {Intolerance to certain foods can cause a range of gut and systemic symptoms. The possibility that these can be caused by lactose has been missed because of "hidden" lactose added to many foods and drinks inadequately labelled, confusing diagnosis based on dietary removal of dairy foods. Two polymorphisms, C/T13910 and G/A22018, linked to hypolactasia, correlate with breath hydrogen and symptoms after lactose. This, with a 48 hour record of gut and systemic symptoms and a six hour breath hydrogen test, provides a new approach to the clinical management of lactose intolerance. The key is the prolonged effect of dietary removal of lactose. Patients diagnosed as lactose intolerant must be advised of "risk" foods, inadequately labelled, including processed meats, bread, cake mixes, soft drinks, and lagers. This review highlights the wide range of systemic symptoms caused by lactose intolerance. This has important implications for the management of irritable bowel syndrome, and for doctors of many specialties.},

   abstract = {Functional digestive disorders constitute one of the main causes of consultation in gastroenterology and primary health care. Is still unclear whether therapy has to be aimed to the gut, to the neural pathways controlling bowel motility and perception, or to the processing mechanisms of symptoms and disease behaviour. It is conceivable that in the next future better understanding of functional bowel disorders pathophysiology will help us to tailor treatment for different patients. At the moment, subclassification of the diverse patterns of symptomatology allows to adjust new treatments for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) according to the clinical predominance for each patient. The knowledge of motor and sensorial response to different stimuli in IBS patients and the pathways to the central nervous system is an important source of information for the development of new molecules. Fiber-enriched diet is frequently given for constipation-predominant IBS. Loperamide, antispasmodic drugs and tricyclic antidepressants are nowadays the basis for pharmacological treatment of diarrhea- predominant IBS. The scientific evidence supporting this therapeutical approach is however limited. Visceral analgesics and serotonin agonists and antagonists may play an important therapeutical role in the near future. However, it is not likely that one single treatment will help every functional bowel disorder patient and many of them will need a more complex approach with a multidisciplinary therapy (diet, psychotherapy, medications).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain that is associated with disturbed defecation. Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD appears to result from dysregulated immune response with contributions from genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Among environmental factors the enteric microflora and the components of food (eg. antigens) may play important role in the pathogenesis of IBD. The aim of the authors' study was to detect IgE type antibodies against the most frequent food allergens in patients with IBD and IBS. METHODS: Antibodies against food allergens (IgE type) with ELISA method in patients with CD, UC and IBS were quantitatively measured. The figures were compared to the result of a healthy control group contains the same number of participants, and the frequency of food allergy in these patient groups were determined. RESULTS: On the basis of the study the presence of increased IgE type immune response against any food allergens was 34.5% (p = 0.01) in the group of IBS. In patients with CD or UC the immune response against food allergens was also more frequent than in the control group. The order of frequency of food allergens in IBS was the following: milk protein, soybean, tomato, peanut, egg white. CONCLUSION: As the occurrence of food allergens was significantly higher in IBS group than in the control group, the role of food allergy in the symptoms of IBS can be come up. The frequency of food allergy in patients with diagnosis of IBS, and the similarity of symptoms of this two diseases give an obvious opportunity for the patients with IBS to use a diet avoiding the most frequent food allergens, or take e.g. Na-cromoglycate which is useful therapy in food allergy.},

However, it is unknown if this also happens in primary-care or whether a better response to bran occurs, leading to bran failures being selected for referral to the specialist. AIMS: To assess the response to bran in primary-care irritable bowel syndrome comparing it to that obtained in secondary-care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive primary-care irritable bowel syndrome patients were asked how bran or soluble fibre products affected their symptoms. RESULTS: Bran improved symptoms in 27% of primary-care and 10% of secondary-care patients (p<0.01) and exacerbated symptoms in 22% of primary-care and 55% of secondary-care patients (p<0.001). Fifty-one percent of primary-care and 33% of secondary-care patients reported no change with bran. In primary-care, proprietary fibre led to improvement in 25%, deterioration in 19% and no change in 56% which was not significantly different to secondary-care. CONCLUSION: Although not especially effective in primary-care irritable bowel syndrome patients, bran does not cause so many problems and is more helpful than in secondary-care. The effects of soluble fibre are similar in both primary-care and secondary-care. This study highlights the problem of extrapolating the response to treatment in irritable bowel syndrome from different care settings.},

In spite of its benign nature, we should pay much attention to IBS because of its huge negative impacts on 'quality of life', not only for mental or physical pain and medical expenses but also for significant social and job-related consequences. The treatment of IBS is based on the guidelines of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan, with a proper physician-patient rapport. At the first step in these guidelines, physicians should advise IBS patients about their diet and lifestyle according to their main symptoms. It is also essential for the physicians to educate the patients properly, which relieves the symptoms in many cases without any cost involvement and untoward side effects.},

Current pathogenetic concepts propose central or peripheral alterations that cause disturbed gastrointestinal function (motility, visceral sensitivity) and subsequent symptoms. These alterations are possibly related to psychological (stress, depression, anxiety) and biological (post-infectious residuals, micro-inflammation) influences. Since no universally effective medical treatment is available to treat the causes of the disease, standard medical therapy is symptom directed (especially for pain, constipation and diarrhoea). In addition to well established drugs (like spasmolytics, opioids and laxatives), newly developed compounds including those with other primarily indications (e.g. antidepressants) are available for highly differentiated individualized therapies. New medical approaches which are currently undergoing evaluation, promise further progress in the treatment of IBS.},

AIM: To evaluate the effect of the general therapeutic approach for irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: Subjects with irritable bowel syndrome identified in a public screening were included. Scores for abdominal symptom (range 0-12), musculoskeletal pain and mood disorders were calculated. After exclusion of other disorders, a doctor presented irritable bowel syndrome as a positive diagnosis, gave information, reassurance and lifestyle advice, but no pharmacotherapy. A dietician gave dietary advice. There was a follow-up after 6 months. RESULTS: Sixty-five persons (females/males: 44/21) with mean age 49 years (range 31-76) were included, 31 (48%) were recommended dietary changes. Twenty subjects (31%) had satisfactory relief of symptoms after 6 months. The scores for abdominal symptom was reduced from 3.1 to 2.2 (P = 0.007), the reduction was 2.2 in the diarrhoea-predominant group given advice compared with 0.4 in the other subjects (P = 0.035). Previous consultations for the complaints, visits for psychiatric disorders, and presence of mood disorders were predictors of persistent complaints. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant relief of symptoms after 6 months, those with psychological co-morbidity responded less well. The effect of dietary advice was only seen in those with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: National health survey. SUBJECTS: A selection of the population (n=11,078) in Oppland county, Norway, was invited to a health screening, and a sample of subjects with IBS were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: A medical history of food intolerance, musculoskeletal pain, mood disorders and abdominal complaints was taken, and tests were performed for food allergy and malabsorption. A dietician evaluated the dietary habits of the subjects. RESULTS: Out of 4,622 subjects with adequately filled-in questionnaires, 84 were included in the study, 59 (70%) had symptoms related to intake of food, 62% limited or excluded food items from the diet and 12% had an inadequate diet. The mean numbers of food items related to symptoms and the number of foods limited or excluded from the diet were 4.8 and 2.5, respectively. There were no associations between the tests for food allergy and malabsorption and perceived food intolerance. Perceived food intolerance was unrelated to musculoskeletal pain and mood disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived food intolerance is a common problem with significant nutritional consequences in a population with IBS. The uselessness of current antibody tests and tests for malabsorption and the lack of correlation to psychiatric co-morbidity make the etiology obscure.},

   abstract = {A significant proportion of adults believe they suffer from food allergy, and 20-65% of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) attribute their symptoms to something in food that activates an abnormal response. This systematic review evaluates the role of food allergy in aetiology and management of these disorders. Activation of gastrointestinal mucosal immune system may be one of the causative factors in the pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia and IBS. This activation may result from effects of bacterial infection or other luminal factors including commensal microbial flora and food antigens. Some studies have reported on the role of food allergy in IBS; only one epidemiological study on functional dyspepsia and food allergy has been published. The mechanism by which food activates mucosal immune system is uncertain, but food specific IgE and IgG4 appeared to mediate the hypersensitivity reaction in a subgroup of IBS patients. Exclusion diets based on skin prick test, RAST for IgE or IgG4, hypoallergic diet and clinical trials with oral disodium cromoglycate have been conducted, and some success has been reported in a subset of IBS patients. Further well-controlled studies are needed to establish whether food allergy plays a role in the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia and IBS.},

   abstract = {Colonic diverticulosis is the most frequent structural abnormality of the large bowel, although it was a rarity before the 20th century. Lifestyle changes in westernized societies with reduced fiber diet are supposed to be the main cause for its high prevalence nowadays. In African countries, where staple diet is rich in fiber, diverticulosis remains very infrequent. Prevalence increases with ageing too. A fiber-deficient diet and subsequent reduction in bowel content volume would lead to increased intraluminal pressures and colonic segmentation, thus promoting diverticula formation. Animal and human studies have shown increased intracolonic pressures in patients with diverticulosis. Alterations in colonic muscle properties, collagen metabolism and in the interactions of the extracellular matrix components may play a role in remodelling the gut wall in diverticular disease. At least one fourth of patients with diverticulosis will develop symptoms, sometimes overlapping with irritable bowel syndrome, but 10-25% will suffer diverticulitis and 3-5% diverticular bleeding. Conservative medical management is usually sufficient in the first episode of diverticulitis, but surgical treatment is generally advocated in recurrences. Diverticular bleeding is a major cause of lower digestive haemorrhage, but generally self-limited. With the application of therapeutic endoscopic and angiographic methods, emergency surgery can often be avoided.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common health problem, often presenting in primary care as well as in internal medicine and gastroenterology outpatient clinics. Therapeutic options are dominated by drug therapies but there is uncertainty about their effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of bulking agents, antispasmodic and antidepressant medication for the treatment of IBS. SEARCH STRATEGY: A computer assisted search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo and the Cochrane Library was performed for the years 1966-2001; local and national databases were searched in 10 European countries. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing bulking agents, antispasmodic or antidepressant medications with a placebo, in IBS patients over 12 years of age. Only studies published as a full paper were included. No language criterion was applied. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The search identified 687 studies, 66 of which fulfilled all eligibility criteria. After removal of cross-over studies that did not report separately on the first phase, data from 40 studies remained for analysis. Relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) along with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all subgroups. The number needed to treat (NNT) was also calculated where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-one study reports from 40 studies, comprising 78 comparisons, were analysed. These included 11 reports on bulking agents, 6 on antidepressants, and 24 on spasmolytics.BULKING AGENTS: Three studies comprising 159 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for relief of abdominal pain. The pooled RR using a random effects model was 1.22 (95% CI 0.86 - 1.73). Three studies comprising 128 patients reported a continuous outcome for relief of abdominal pain. Using the random effects model, the SMD was 0.68 (95% CI -0.86 - 2.33). Nine studies comprising 482 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for global assessment of improvement. The pooled RR was 1.09 (95% CI 0.78 - 1.50). Five studies comprising 253 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for improvement of symptom score. The pooled RR using a random effects model was 0.93 (95% CI 0.56 - 1.54). Two studies comprising 70 patients reported a continuous outcome for improvement of symptom score; the SMD using a fixed effects model was -0.44 (95% CI -1.20 - 0.31). SPASMOLYTIC AGENTS: Eleven studies comprising 1260 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for relief of abdominal pain. The pooled RR using a random effects model was 1.34 (95% CI 1.13 - 1.59; RD=0.17, 95% CI 0.06 -0.28; NNT=6, 95% CI 4 - 15). Seven studies comprising 467 patients reported a continuous outcome for relief of abdominal pain. Using a fixed effects model the pooled SMD was -0.65 (95% CI -0.94 to -0.35). Sixteen studies comprising 1236 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for global assessment of improvement. The pooled RR using a random effects model was 1.42 (95% CI 1.17 - 1.72; RD=0.20, 95% CI 0.09 -0.30; NNT=5, 95% CI 3 - 11). One study comprising 34 patients reported a dichotomous variable for improvement of symptom score. The RR was 1.33 (95% CI 0.96 - 1.85). Three studies reported a continuous outcome for improvement of symptom score; two studies comprising 66 patients could be pooled. Using a fixed effects model, the SMD was -0.37 (95% CI -0.85 - 0.12). ANTIDEPRESSANTS: Two studies comprising 81 patients reported a dichotomous outcome for relief of abdominal pain. Using the random effects model, the pooled RR was 0.83 (95% CI 0.33 - 2.12). Two studies comprising 101 patients reported a continuous outcome for relief of abdominal pain. The SMD using a random effects model was -0.53 (95% CI -2.29 - 1.23). Four studies comprising 241 patients reported a dichotomous variable for global assessment of improvement. The pooled RR was 1.16 (95% CI 0.78 - 1.73). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for efficacy of drug therapies for IBS is weak. Although there is evidence of benefit for antispasmodic drugs for abdominal pain and global assessment of symptoms; it is unclear whether anti-spasmodic subgroups are individually effective. There is no clear evidence of benefit for antidepressants or bulking agents. The physician should be aware that global assessment is a construct containing various dimensions. For each individual, these will have a different weighting and treatment should be aimed at the most debilitating symptom. Stool problems are by definition part of the IBS symptom complex. Bulking agents may improve constipation and can be used empirically, but should be evaluated at an early stage for individual benefit. Future research should pay attention to study methodology and the use of valid outcome measures.},

   abstract = {Salicylate intolerance is defined as a nonspecific antigen-induced pseudo-allergic hypersensitivity reaction which can occur upon contact of an organism with salicylic acid, its derivatives or other related organic or inorganic acids of similar chemical structure. Since the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) intolerance are by no means always severe or life-endangering but may just as well present as oligosymptomatic or local disorders (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhea, we decided to evaluate the characteristics of patients with salicylate intolerance on the basis of gastroenterological case material of Medical Department I of Erlangen University. On the basis of the findings from the Erlangen interdisciplinary data register of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, the signs and symptoms of NSAID intolerance were found to constitute a diagnosis of great practical import to clinical medicine (allergology, dermatology, immunology, other disorders etc.) including gastroenterology. For approx. 2-7% of all patients with inflammatory bowel syndrome and food allergies this poses a new diagnostic and therapeutic challenge which may concern physicians from any of the disciplines involved. When presented with patients with chronic active disease who are suffering from these symptoms one should, therefore, in future give greater thought to the possibility of salicylate intolerance, all the more as there are meaningful dietetic, diagnostic and therapeutic options available for these persons.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the clinical features at presentation as well as the associated disorders, family history, and evaluation of compliance with a gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease from across Canada. STUDY DESIGN: All members (n = 5240) of the Canadian Celiac Association were surveyed with a questionnaire. Of the 2849 respondents with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease, 168 who were < 16 years old provided the data reported here. RESULTS: The mean age when surveyed was 9.1 +/- 4.1 years, and 58% were female. Median age at diagnosis was 3.0 years with a range of 1 to 15 years. Presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (90%), weight loss (71%), diarrhea (65%), weakness (64%), nausea/vomiting (53%), anemia (40%), mood swings (37%), and constipation (30%). Almost one third of families consulted > or = 2 pediatricians before confirmation of the diagnosis. Before the recognition of celiac disease, other diagnoses received by these children included anemia (15%), irritable bowel syndrome (11%), gastroesophageal reflux (8%), stress (8%), and peptic ulcer disease (4%). A serological test was performed to screen for celiac disease in 70% of those in this population. Eight percent had either type 1 diabetes mellitus or a first-degree relative with celiac disease. Almost all respondents (95%) reported strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, and 89% noted improved health. Reactions after accidental gluten ingestion developed in 54% of the children between 0.5 and 60 hours after ingestion with a median of 2.0 hours. Reactions included abdominal discomfort (87%), diarrhea (64%), bloating (57%), fatigue (37%), headache (24%), and constipation (8%), and most displayed > 1 symptom. Although most adjusted well to their disease and diet, 10% to 20% reported major disruptions in lifestyle. Twenty-three percent felt angry all or most of the time about following a gluten-free diet. Only 15% avoided traveling all or most of the time, and during travel, 83% brought gluten-free food with them all of the time. More than half of the families avoided restaurants all or most of the time. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents found it extremely difficult to locate stores with gluten-free foods, and 27% reported extreme difficulty in finding gluten-free foods or determining if foods were free of gluten. Sixty-three percent of the respondents felt that the information supplied by the Canadian Celiac Association was excellent. Gastroenterologists provided excellent information to 44%, dietitians to 36%, and the family physician to 11.5%. When asked to select 2 items that would improve their quality of life, better labeling of gluten-containing ingredients was selected by 63%, more gluten-free foods in the supermarket by 49%, gluten-free choices on restaurant menus by 49%, earlier diagnosis of celiac disease by 34%, and better dietary counseling by 7%. CONCLUSIONS: In Canada, children with celiac disease present at all ages with a variety of symptoms and associated conditions. Delays in diagnosis are common. Most children are compliant with a gluten-free diet. A minority of these children experience difficulties in modifying their lifestyles, and gluten-free foods remain difficult to obtain.},

A longitudinal, prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken. The duration of treatment was eight to 12 weeks and this consisted of 10-20 g/day of coarse wheat bran or a low fibre placebo taken in addition to the normal diet. Twenty-eight outpatients fulfilling the Rome criteria for constipation-predominant IBS were recruited to the trial (14 in the treatment group; 14 in the placebo group). Twelve people completed the trial in the treatment group and ten in the placebo group. The main outcome measures included changes in symptoms recorded in a diary, changes in objective measurements of bowel function and subjective overall feelings of improvement. The bran group significantly increased their non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) intake over that of the placebo group (p < 0.05). Mean stool wet weight increased significantly more in the bran group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05), but other bowel function measurements and all recorded symptoms were not different. Many patients reported changes in bowel habit that were not reflected in the objective measurements. The addition of coarse wheat bran to the diet increased NSP ingestion and stool wet weight in this group of IBS patients, but no evidence was obtained that such treatment was of benefit to these patients, other than a placebo effect on symptoms.},

   abstract = {Constipation is a common gastrointestinal symptom and affects about 20% of the general population. This symptom can reflect a vast array of problems, from inadequate fiber intake to colonic dismotility function. Identifying chronic constipation subtypes on underlying physiology guides the therapeutic choices. Chronic constipation subtypes includes: slow-transit constipation, functional constipation, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation predominance and pelvic floor dysfunction. The most useful tests for the evaluation of those patients are the colonic transit time with radiopaque markers and anorrectal manometry with balloon expulsion test. Patients with both normal tests have either functional constipation or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. Subjects with a delayed colonic transit and normal anorectal manometry maybe classified as colonic inertia. Pelvic floor dysfunction maybe suspected if the patient had an abnormal manometry with failure to expulse de balloon. Initial treatments of chronic constipation are dietary fiber and medicinal bulk. Subsequent treatments if fiber is not successful or tolerated would include saline osmotic laxatives such as lactulose and polyethylene glycol, or stimulants like senna or bisacodyl. For patients with pelvic floor dyssynergia biofeedback therapy is the first therapeutic option. In this article we present an overview of current diagnostic tools for patients with chronic constipation.},

   abstract = {Functional dyspepsia represents a heterogeneous group of gastrointestinal disorders marked by the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort. Although its precise definition has evolved over the last several decades, this disorder remains shrouded in controversy. The symptoms of functional dyspepsia may overlap with those of other functional bowel disorders including irritable bowel syndrome and non-erosive reflux disease. There may be coexistent psychological distress or disease complicating its presentation and response to therapy. Given the prevalence and chronicity of functional dyspepsia, it remains a great burden to society. Suspected physiological mechanisms underlying functional dyspepsia include altered motility, altered visceral sensation, inflammation, nervous system dysregulation and psychological distress. Yet the exact pathophysiological mechanisms that cause symptoms in an individual patient remain difficult to delineate. Numerous treatment modalities have been employed including dietary modifications, pharmacological agents directed at various targets within the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system, psychological therapies and more recently, complementary and alternative treatments. Unfortunately, to date, all of these therapies have yielded only marginal results. A variety of emerging therapies are being developed for functional dyspepsia. Most of these therapies are intended to normalize pain perception and gastrointestinal motor and reflex function in this group of patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet has been implicated to play a role in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in clinic-based studies. No population-based data comparing food and nutrient consumption between individuals with FGID and without gastrointestinal symptoms are available. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the dietary consumption of specific food items and nutrients between individuals with FGID and without symptoms in a population-based sample. METHODS: A validated self-report Bowel Disease Questionnaire was mailed to an age- and gender-stratified random sample of participants aged 20-50 yr from Olmsted County, Minnesota. All patients who reported either FGID symptoms (irritable bowel or dyspepsia) or no gastrointestinal symptoms were invited to undergo a blinded physician interview and physical exam and to complete a validated Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In total, 222 of the 260 eligible (85%) subjects participated and 218 provided diet data: 99 were FGID cases and 119 were healthy controls. Cases and controls consumed similar number of servings per week of wheat-containing foods, lactose-containing foods, caffeinated drinks, and fructose-sweetened beverages. Cases were slightly more likely to consume >or=7 servings per week of norepinephrine- and epinephrine-containing foods (57%vs 45%, p= 0.10), but not serotonin- or tryptophan-containing foods. No differences were observed for amount of intake of calories, fiber, protein, iron, calcium, niacin, and vitamins C, D, E, niacin, B(1), B(2), B(6), and B(12). Cases reported consuming more fat (median, 33%vs 31%) and less carbohydrates (median, 49%vs 52%) than controls. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were seen in the consumption of frequently suspected "culprit" foods between community residents with and without FGID symptoms. While symptoms may be due to food sensitivity rather than altered diet composition, the role of fat and perhaps norepinephrine and epinephrine in foods in gut symptoms needs to be studied further.},

   abstract = {The human intestine is colonized by a large number of microorganisms, collectively termed microbiota, which support a variety of physiological functions. As the major part of the microbiota has not yet been cultured, molecular methods are required to determine microbial composition and the impact of specific dietary components including probiotics. Probiotics are viable microbial food supplements, which have a beneficial impact on human health. Health-promoting properties have been demonstrated for specific probiotic products. The most significant demonstrations for probiotic efficacy include prevention and treatment of antibiotic associated diarrhea, rotavirus diarrhea and allergy prevention. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (=ATCC 53103) and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 are the among the best-characterized and most studied probiotic strains with demonstrated impact on human health. New complex targets for probiotics include irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori infection. For future probiotics the most important target is a demonstrated clinical benefit supported by knowledge on the mechanistic actions in the microbiota of the target population. Molecular and genomics-based knowledge of the composition and functions of the microbiota, as well as deviations from the balanced microbiota, will advance the selection of new and specific probiotics. Potential combinations of specific probiotics may prove to be the next step to reduce the risk on intestinal diseases and reconstruct specific microbial deviations.},

These symptoms are similar to other symptom complexes like chronic fatigue and the so-called 'candida syndrome', and many seek help from alternative medicine. The possible role of Candida and yeasts in non-immune compromised individuals is disputed and is the subject of this review. Even if the involvement of yeasts in the aetiology of IBS still remains unclear, there is increasing evidence for yeasts being able to cause IBS-symptoms in sensitized patients via Candida products, antigens and cross-antigens. But more research is needed before antifungal treatment can be recommended as a first line treatment for IBS.},

One of the challenges in generalizing health effects of probiotics is that different strains exert disparate effects on human health. As a result, the efficacy of one strain or species cannot necessarily be inferred from another. The objective of this review is to examine the current scientific literature that could be used as the basis for potential health claims. More specifically, this paper will review existing evidence of different probiotic strains to prevent and treat diarrhea, treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), treat inflammatory bowel disease, and prevent colon cancer. The strongest evidence is related to the use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in the prevention and treatment of rotavirus-associated diarrhea. Further examination of the literature also shows promise in the treatment of some forms of IBS with probiotics. Future studies that use consistent supplementation regimes will allow more definitive conclusions to be drawn on the effects of probiotics on IBS, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer.},

The objective was to retrospectively evaluate a potentially successful diet therapy in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and fructose malabsorption. Tables detailing the content of fructose and fructans in foods were constructed. A dietary strategy comprising avoidance of foods containing substantial free fructose and short-chain fructans, limitation of the total dietary fructose load, encouragement of foods in which glucose was balanced with fructose, and co-ingestion of free glucose to balance excess free fructose was devised. Sixty-two consecutively referred patients with irritable bowel syndrome and fructose malabsorption on breath hydrogen testing underwent dietary instruction. Dietary adherence and effect on abdominal symptoms were evaluated via telephone interview 2 to 40 months (median 14 months) later. Response to the diet was defined as improvement of all symptoms by at least 5 points on a -10- to 10-point scale. Forty-eight patients (77%) adhered to the diet always or frequently. Forty-six (74%) of all patients responded positively in all abdominal symptoms. Positive response overall was significantly better in those adherent than nonadherent (85% vs 36%; P<0.01), as was improvement in individual symptoms (P<0.01 for all symptoms). This comprehensive fructose malabsorption dietary therapy achieves a high level of sustained adherence and good symptomatic response.},

Moreover, foods are thought to often play a role in the diarrhea type IBS particularly in patients with atopic dermatitis. More than 50% of diarrhea type IBS patients have a history of allergies to some food and positive skin prick tests. Surveys indicate that as many as 20-30 % of adults have some problems to foods, however, careful studies have suggested a range from <1% to 7.5%. A systematic review of the literature concluded that it is still unclear whether diet is a key factor in exacerbating IBS symptoms and whether dietary manipulation is a valid treatment. The further studies are needed to evaluate the association between IBS and allergic disorders.},

Whether this is affected by bowel habit, psychologic factors, or sex is unknown. METHODS: We included 61 patients with IBS (50 women, 11 men), 25 with diarrhea-predominant IBS, 17 with constipation-predominant IBS, 19 with alternating-type IBS, and 20 healthy controls (15 women, 5 men). A colonic distension trial was performed with a barostat before and after a 1-hour duodenal lipid infusion (3 kcal/min). Colonic thresholds, colonic tone, and the viscerosomatic referral pattern were assessed and compared between groups. Patients also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. RESULTS: The reduction in colonic pressure thresholds after vs before duodenal lipids was greater in patients than in controls for discomfort (P = .006) and pain (P < .0001). An increased viscerosomatic referral area for pain and discomfort during colonic distensions after vs before duodenal lipids was observed in patients but not in controls. The response was similar in IBS subgroups based on the predominant bowel habit, in patients with vs without anxiety and/or depression, and in women and men with IBS. The colonic tone response during lipid infusion was similar in IBS patients and controls, and in the different IBS subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: IBS patients show increased colonic sensitivity and altered viscerosomatic referral pattern after duodenal lipids. This response is largely unaffected by the predominant bowel habit, psychologic factors, or sex, but seems to be related to IBS per se.},

There is also an extensive use of these tests in clinical practice with difficulties regarding interpretation of the tests and sometimes erroneous conclusions. The limitations and pitfalls of these tests will be reviewed in this article, and hopefully the occasional abuse of these tests can be turned into proper clinical and scientific use instead in the future.},

Predictors of good prognosis include a short history, acute onset(possibly postinfective origin), absence of psychological disorders, and resolution of chronic life stressors. Possible-disease modifying treatments with long-lasting effects include diet and anti-inflammatory and psychological treatments. Dietary modifications, which often involve excluding dairy and wheat products, are successful in some patients. Anti-inflammatory treatments have been subjected to one RCT in postinfective IBS without benefit. Probiotics may have benefit in altering bacterial flora and as anti-inflammatory agents, but further trials are needed before they can be recommended. Psychological treatments may produce long-lasting responses. Relaxation therapy appears to have a nonspecific benefit. Psychotherapy has been shown to have long-term benefit and is particularly acceptable to, and effective for, those with overt psychological distress. Hypnotherapy has been shown to be effective in randomized placebo controlled trials and has a sustained effect.},

Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is common, as is symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease. Peptic ulcer disease occurs less frequently and with fewer complications. Gastroenterologists and obstetricians should be familiar with safe treatment options for these conditions, because they can profoundly impair the quality of life of pregnant women. During pregnancy, constipation can develop de novo, or chronic constipation can increase in severity. Given the array of therapies for constipation, physicians must apprise themselves of drugs that are safe for both mother and fetus. Management of acute, self-limited diarrhea should focus on supportive therapy, dietary changes and maintenance of hydration. Treatment of chronic diarrhea should be considered in the context of therapy for the underlying disorder. Inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome present a unique therapeutic challenge--to control the disease while minimizing toxicity to the fetus and mother. Initiation and alteration of medical therapy for gastrointestinal disorders during pregnancy must be undertaken after discussion with the patient's obstetrician.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder with a wide variety of presentations that may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or alternating bowel habits. Symptom-based criteria and a limited medical evaluation are used for diagnosis. The heterogeneity of IBS presenting symptoms, together with the pathophysiology of the disorder, is unclear, making treatment challenging. Treatment strategies are focused on specific symptoms, potential underlying disorders in stress responsiveness, and predisposing psychological features. Although only two medications, tegaserod for constipation-predominant IBS and alosetron for diarrhea-predominant IBS, are specifically indicated, a wide variety of treatment options are available and are discussed in this review.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Cholecystokinin regulates gut motility and visceral sensation. The aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic value of plasma cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) concentration in children with functional abdominal pain (FAP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-two children (33 girls and 19 boys) aged 6-17 years with chronic abdominal pain were included in this study. On the basis of clinical data, results of endoscopy and Criteria for Functional Disorders the patients were divided into three groups: group 1--functional dyspepsia (FD), group 2--irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), group 3--non-specific FAP. The control group consisted of children without abdominal pain in anamnesis. CCK-8 concentrations in plasma were measured with radio immunoassay technique, after plasma extraction. In study protocol we analysed CCK-8 levels in fasting state and 15, 30, 60 minutes after a standard test meal. RESULTS: In the fasting state plasma levels of CCK-8 were similar in each group and in controls. In the IBS patients CCK-8 levels were not increased after meal. In groups 1, 3 and controls postprandial levels were higher when compared to fasting state (p<0.05). Area under curve of CCK-8 plasma concentration was the lowest in group 2, but not significant compared to controls and other groups. No correlation was found between main symptoms of FD and IBS and CCK-8 concentration in plasma. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that gut dysmotility and symptoms of functional abdominal pain in children are not concerned with alteration of plasma CCK-8 levels before and after meal.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sensory and motor dysfunctions of the gut are both important characteristics of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Several gut peptides contribute to the regulation of gastrointestinal function but little is known about gut hormone secretion in IBS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated perceptual thresholds and fasting and postprandial plasma levels of proximal (cholecystokinin (CCK), motilin) and distal (peptide YY) gut peptides up to 1 h after ingestion of a high caloric meal in 99 IBS patients and 40 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Fasting plasma CCK levels were significantly elevated in patients (1.2+/-0.8 pM) compared with those in controls (0.8+/-0.7 pM, p=0.006), as was the incremental postprandial CCK response (72+/-73 versus 40+/-42 pM.60 min, respectively; p=0.003). No differences in fasting and postprandial motilin or PYY levels were found. The postprandial PYY response was significantly increased in hypersensitive compared to normosensitive patients (215+/-135 versus 162+/-169 pM, p=0.048). Patients with a diarrhoea predominant bowel habit had higher fasting motilin levels compared to constipated patients or alternating type IBS patients (82.1+/-36.5 versus 60.8+/-25.1 versus 57.5+/-23.9 pM, one-way ANOVA p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: IBS patients have increased fasting and postprandial plasma levels of CCK. Changes in plasma levels of motilin and PYY may contribute to the clinical expression of IBS, such as the presence of visceral hypersensitivity or a predominant bowel habit.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study examined whether intensive cholesterol-lowering therapy with statins in nonhypercholesterolemic patients is effective in improving echolucency of vulnerable plaques assessed by ultrasound with integrated backscatter (IBS) analysis. BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic plaque stabilization is a promising clinical strategy to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). There is a correlation between coronary and carotid plaque instability, and echolucent plaques are recognized as vulnerable plaques. METHODS: Consecutive nonhypercholesterolemic patients with CAD were randomly assigned Adult Treatment Panel-III diet therapy (diet group; n = 30) or pravastatin (statin group; n = 30). Echolucent carotid plaques were monitored by measuring intima-media thickness (IMT) and echogenicity by IBS for six months. RESULTS: Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were significantly decreased in the statin group (from 197 +/- 15 mg/dl to 170 +/- 18 mg/dl [p < 0.001]; from 131 +/- 14 mg/dl to 99 +/- 14 mg/dl [p < 0.001]; and from 0.11 [0.04 to 0.22] mg/dl to 0.06 [0.04 to 0.11] mg/dl [p < 0.05]; respectively), whereas only total cholesterol was moderately reduced (from 193 +/- 24 mg/dl to 185 +/- 22 mg/dl [p < 0.05]) and LDL-C and triglycerides insignificantly reduced in the diet group. Significant increases of echogenicity of carotid plaques were noted in the statin group but not in the diet group (from -18.5 +/- 4.1 dB to -15.9 +/- 3.7 dB [p < 0.001] and from -18.2 +/- 4.0 dB to -18.9 +/- 3.5 dB [p = 0.13]; respectively) without significant regression of plaque-IMT values in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Statin therapy is rapidly effective in increasing echogenicity of vulnerable plaques without regression of plaque size in nonhypercholesterolemic patients with CAD. Quantitative assessment of carotid plaque quality by ultrasound with IBS is clinically useful for monitoring atherosclerotic lesions by evaluating vulnerability of atheroma.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Food hypersensitivity is a common perception among irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Data from dietary elimination and food challenge studies support an etiopathological role of diet in IBS, but there are no well-established tests to identify food hypersensitivity. AIM: To compare IgG4 and IgE titers to common food antigens in IBS and controls. METHOD: One hundred and eight IBS [52 diarrhea-predominant (D-IBS); 32 constipation-predominant (C-IBS); 24 alternating (Alt-IBS)], and 43 controls were included in the study. IgG4 and IgE titers and skin prick testing (SPT) to 16 common foods including milk, eggs, cheese, wheat, rice, potatoes, chicken, beef, pork, lamb, fish, shrimps, soya bean, yeast, tomatoes, and peanuts were measured. RESULTS: IBS had significantly higher IgG4 titers (mug/L) to wheat (395 IQR +/- 1,011 vs 0 IQR +/- 285, p < 0.001), beef (1,079 IQR +/- 930 vs 617 IQR +/- 435, p < 0.001), pork (481 IQR +/- 379 vs 258 IQR +/- 496, p < 0.001), and lamb (241 IQR +/- 460 vs 167 IQR +/- 232, p= 0.009) compared to controls. These differences were maintained across all three subgroups. The antibody titers to potatoes, rice, fish, chicken, yeast, tomato, and shrimps were not significantly different. No significant difference in IgE titers was observed between IBS and controls. SPT was positive for only a single antigen in 5 of 56 patients tested with the same panel of foods. No correlation was seen between the pattern of elevated IgG4 antibody titers and patients' symptoms. CONCLUSION: Serum IgG4 antibodies to common foods like wheat, beef, pork, and lamb are elevated in IBS patients. In keeping with the observation in other atopic conditions, this finding suggests the possibility of a similar pathophysiological role for IgG4 antibodies in IBS.},

IgG4 antibodies to common food antigens are elevated in IBS. The aim of this article was to evaluate the effect of exclusion diet based on IgG4 titres on IBS symptoms and rectal sensitivity and compliance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study comprised 25 patients with IBS (3 M, 22 F, mean age 43 years, Rome II criteria). IgG4 titres to 16 foods (milk, eggs, cheese, wheat, rice, potatoes, chicken, beef, pork, lamb, soya bean, fish, shrimps, yeast, tomatoes and peanuts) were measured. Foods with titres >250 microg/l were excluded for 6 months. Symptom severity was assessed with a previously validated questionnaire at baseline, at 3 months and at 6 months. Rectal compliance and sensitivity were measured in 12 patients at baseline and at 6 months. RESULTS: IgG4 antibodies to milk, eggs, wheat, beef, pork and lamb were commonly elevated. Significant improvement was reported in pain severity (p < 0.001), pain frequency (p = 0.034), bloating severity (p = 0.001), satisfaction with bowel habits (p = 0.004) and effect of IBS on life in general (p = 0.008) at 3 months. Symptom improvement was maintained at 6 months. Rectal compliance was significantly increased (p = 0.011) at 6 months but the thresholds for urge to defecate/discomfort were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Food-specific IgG4 antibody-guided exclusion diet improves symptoms in IBS and is associated with an improvement in rectal compliance.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome is a common clinical condition that often presents a therapeutic challenge. There is no standard therapy and a multilevel approach is recommended. A high-fiber diet is often one of these components. Many investigators have studied the effectiveness of either fiber supplementation or bulking agents in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature on the use of fiber in irritable bowel syndrome and to provide some specific recommendations. Systematic reviews of these trials have generally not found fiber to be significantly more effective than placebo at relieving global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. There may be differences between results obtained with soluble and insoluble fiber. Adverse effects of fiber use may include abdominal discomfort and bloating. Although dietary fiber or bulking agents do not appear to be useful as sole treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, they may have a limited role in empiric therapy depending upon the patient's symptom complex, especially if constipation is the most significant symptom. The basic principles for using fiber therapy are to start with a low dose and increase slowly, to give an adequate trial and to evaluate the results early and periodically.},
