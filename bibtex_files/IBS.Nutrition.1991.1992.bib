   abstract = {The plasma lipid levels were investigated in 45 celiac children under 3 years of age and 49 over this age at diagnosis (untreated groups), after gluten-free diet and in comparison with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) groups matched for size, gender, and age. Total and HDL cholesterol levels were significantly lower and triglycerides higher in celiac untreated children than in IBS control children in both age groups. HDL cholesterol significantly increased in both age groups after some months of gluten-free diet. Total and LDL cholesterol significantly increased and triglycerides decreased in the younger group of subjects after the period of gluten-free diet. These results may be useful for diagnostic purposes and to motivate a strict gluten-free diet in celiac children.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine serum retinol levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and to attempt to elucidate the mechanism of changes in vitamin A metabolism in these disorders. It was found that in 15 patients with active ulcerative colitis, 14 patients with active Crohn's disease and in 3 operated patients with recurrent Crohn's disease serum retinol levels and retinol-binding protein were significantly lower than in controls. Concentrations of vitamin A did not depend on the localization of inflammatory bowel disease, previous ileal resections, duration of the disease or age and sex of the patients. During successful treatment of active ulcerative colitis normalization of serum retinol levels without substitution of vitamin A was observed. Repeated determinations in patients with Crohn's disease who had low serum retinol levels in an active phase of disease revealed normal vitamin A levels in an inactive phase. The absorption of vitamins A and E in patients with inflammatory bowel disease was normal. The normal serum retinol concentrations in patients with diarrhea due to irritable bowel syndrome, and in those with anorexia nervosa exclude the influence of diarrhea and body weight itself on vitamin A levels. The results of this study indicate that serum retinol levels in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease are secondary to the decreased serum retinol-binding protein concentrations, and probably depend on the increased protein catabolism in these disorders.},

   abstract = {The symptoms of 72 patients with irritable bowel syndrome were assessed by questionnaire before and 6 months after a high-fibre diet had been prescribed, to find whether those who achieved the highest fibre intake did any better than those with smaller intakes. Dietary fibre intakes were measured after 6 months by a 7-day weighed food inventory. There was a significant inverse association between the presence of symptoms and fibre intake for: incomplete defaecation, urgency and hard stools with total fibre intake; urgency and hard stools with cereal fibre intake; and borborygmi with fibre intake at breakfast. All patients with constipation, mucus, urgency or watery stools at the beginning of the study, and who were consuming more than 30 g fibre by the end, reported an improvement in these symptoms. Increasing intakes of fibre were not related in any way to abdominal distension, diarrhoea, flatulence or patient's feelings about the working of their bowels. Therefore, this study suggests that the symptoms which benefit most from the prescription of a high-fibre diet are hard stools, constipation and urgency.},

Patients with constipation are recommended to take dietary fiber positively, while those with diarrhea should consume sparingly food which may cool their body. Both should avoid overeating and overdrinking, and have regular dietary habits. In order to improve the functional disorder of the bowel, it is necessary for those patients (1) to be careful not to take often refined cereals or manufactured foods, (2) to eat green and yellow vegetables and seaweeds positively, as well as, protein and fat in proper quantity, and (3) to take care of the well-balanced intake of various kinds of vitamins, minerals and other nutriments.},

   abstract = {Some women with irritable bowel syndrome date the onset of symptoms to previous hysterectomy. To assess prospectively the incidence of gastrointestinal symptomatology arising de novo after hysterectomy, and to study the effect of surgery on pre-existing symptoms, 205 women completed a symptom questionnaire before and six weeks and six months after surgery. Beforehand, symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome occurred in 22% of patients. At six months after operation, 60% of these had improved or were symptom free while 20% had increased symptomatology. New gastrointestinal symptoms were present more than once per week in 10% of previously asymptomatic women. Constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome was the commonest symptom complex seen de novo, occurring more than once per week in 5% of the group. No relation was found between new symptomatology and the type of hysterectomy, oophorectomy, or the administration of perioperative antibiotics. This study suggests that many women with pre-existing gastrointestinal symptomatology improve after hysterectomy. However, symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome do arise de novo in 10%. As hysterectomy is common, gastroenterologists can expect to see women presenting with post-hysterectomy problems.},

   abstract = {Because infants with colic appear to have abdominal pain similar to that of adults with irritable bowel syndrome, who may benefit from the addition of fiber to their diet, we tested whether fiber added to infant formula would alleviate colic. Twenty-seven normal, term infants (aged 2 to 8 weeks; 14 girls) with colic, defined as crying plus fussing for more than 3 hours a day for at least 3 days of a 6-day baseline period, were enrolled. Infants were randomly assigned in 9-day periods to a sequence of placebo (Isomil formula) followed by fiber-supplemented formula (Isomil plus soy polysaccharide) (n = 12) or the reverse (n = 15). Daily diaries of crying, fussing, sleeping, formula, intake, and stooling were kept. Twenty-two infants completed three lactulose breath hydrogen tests at the end of the baseline period and after each study period. The crossover trial was followed by 30 to 35 days of use of the study formula chosen by the parents as most beneficial but unknown to the investigators. Growth was monitored throughout. Serum cholesterol, calcium, phosphate, albumin, iron, and zinc concentrations were measured at the conclusion. There were no significant differences in average daily time spent by the infants in fussing and crying during ingestion of the fiber-supplemented formula. However, parents of 18 of 27 infants chose fiber-supplemented formula as most beneficial in ameliorating symptoms of colic. While the infants were consuming fiber-supplemented formula, stool frequency increased, and breath hydrogen excretion increased significantly, in response to lactulose. Growth and serum biochemical measurements were normal in all infants. Supplementation of infant formula with the level of soy polysaccharide used in this study may have reduced crying and fussing in some infants but did not affect colicky behavior in the majority of infants, who continued to cry and fuss excessively.},
