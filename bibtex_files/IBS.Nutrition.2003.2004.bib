   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to evaluate the oral dietary intake of a group of patients with irritable bowel syndrome and to compare with international recommendations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 53 patients with irritable bowel syndrome was enrolled in a non-propabilistic sample. Patients were diagnose with Roma II criteria. In all patients were determined, weight, height, body mass index, dietary intake of 3 days and a symptoms scoring system. RESULTS: The average age of 53 patients was 45.67+/-13.6 years with a distribution of sex (22 males/31 females). Caloric intakes was right in absolute terms and corrected by weight. Distribution of calories was 41.5% of carbohydrates, a 19.8% of proteins, and a 38.7% of lipids, showing a high intake of lipids and low of carbohydrates. A low intake of vitamin A and D was detected. High intake of vitamin B12, vitamin C and niacine was observed. A low intake of calcium, magnesium, yodo and zinc was detected. Intake of soluble fiber was lower than insoluble fiber (1.46+/-0.74 g/day) (19%) vs 6.21+/-2.67 g/day (71%). Intake of fiber corrected by calories was low 4.5+/-1.2 g/1000 calories. In correlation analysis, insoluble fiber (r=0.46; p < 0.05) and soluble fiber (r=0.42; p < 0.05) were inverse correlated with general symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome showed a deviation of mineral and vitamin dietary. Fiber intake is low, a correlation between fiber intake and general symptoms was detected.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of dietary fiber on symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: A single-blind randomized clinical trial was designed. Fifty-six subjects with irritable bowel syndrome were prospectively and randomly assigned to one of two groups: group 1 received a diet containing 10.4 g/d of fiber and group 2 received a diet containing 30.5 g/d of fiber. Patients' body weights, nutritional intakes as assessed with 3-d written food records, and symptom scores were assessed at baseline and at 3 mo. RESULTS: There were no dropouts during the study. Total energy intake and the distribution of macronutrients were not significantly different between groups. Total dietary fiber intake did not reach recommended levels in either group but was higher in group 2 than in group 1 (25.95 +/- 2.12 g/d versus 6.06 +/- 2.7 g/d, P < 0.05). Initial fiber intake did not differ significantly between groups. Pain scores, bowel scores, and general scores improved in both groups (from baseline to 3 mo), and no significant differences were detected between groups. CONCLUSIONS: A modest fiber intake in patients with irritable bowel syndrome relieved symptoms, but this therapeutic benefit of fiber may have been due to a placebo effect because the results were similar in the low-fiber group.},

The lack of consensus diagnostic criteria and pathophysiologic understanding has hampered clinical progress in diagnosing and treating this disorder. The recent development of the Rome diagnostic criteria, mapping of brain-gut pathways using neuroimaging, and serotonergic pharmacology have greatly advanced the field. Chronic and acute life stress, especially during childhood, has been recognized as central to the initiation of the disorder and the induction of acute symptoms. We propose a developmental continuum whereby the clinical presentation of irritable bowel syndrome changes with age from irritability during infancy, to diarrhea in toddlers, to recurring abdominal pain during school age, and to pain and altered bowel habits during later adolescence and adulthood.},

Medical conditions that have been reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive, hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary tract infections, and others.

DESIGN: Partially blinded, randomized, two-dose, pilot study. SUBJECTS: Five hundred (500) volunteers were screened for IBS using the Rome II criteria. Two hundred and seven (207) suitable volunteers were randomized. INTERVENTIONS: One or two tablets of a standardized turmeric extract taken daily for 8 weeks. OUTCOMES MEASURES: IBS prevalence, symptom-related quality of life (IBSQOL) and self-reported effectiveness. RESULTS: IBS prevalence decreased significantly in both groups between screening and baseline (41% and 57%), with a further significant drop of 53% and 60% between baseline and after treatment, in the one- and two-tablet groups respectively (p < 0.001). A post-study analysis revealed abdominal pain/discomfort score reduced significantly by 22% and 25% in the one- and two-tablet group respectively, the difference tending toward significance (p = 0.071). There were significant improvements in all bar one of the IBSQOL scales of between 5% and 36% in both groups, approximately two thirds of all subjects reported an improvement in symptoms after treatment, and there was a favorable shift in self-reported bowel pattern. There were no significant differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Turmeric may help reduce IBS symptomology. Placebo controlled trials are now warranted to confirm these findings.},

METHODS: A subset analysis of a previous dose-ranging, open, postal study, in adults suffering dyspepsia. Two hundred and eight (208) adults were identified post hoc as suffering with IBS. IBS incidence, self-reported usual bowel pattern, and the Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI) were compared before and after a 2-month intervention period. RESULTS: There was a significant fall in IBS incidence of 26.4% (p < 0.001) after treatment. A significant shift in self-reported usual bowel pattern away from "alternating constipation/diarrhea" toward "normal" (p < 0.001) was observed. NDI total symptom score significantly decreased by 41% (p < 0.001) after treatment. Similarly, there was a significant 20% improvement in the NDI total quality-of-life (QOL) score in the subset after treatment. CONCLUSION: This report supports previous findings that ALE ameliorates symptoms of IBS, plus improves health-related QOL.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The goal was to investigate the neuroimmune axis in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by analyzing the neuroendocrine and cellular immune responses to nutrient load. METHODS: In the fasting state and 20, 40, 70, and 100 min following nutrient load, blood samples were collected and cardiovascular recordings were accomplished in 15 female IBS patients and 15 healthy women. Plasma norepinephrine, prolactin, cortisol, and growth hormone were analyzed, and blood pressure and heart rate responses were measured. The distribution of peripheral leukocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations and the in vitro production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) after whole blood stimulation with in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were analyzed. RESULTS: IBS patients demonstrated significantly greater postprandial increases in plasma norepinephrine and systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05), but no cortisol response. A postprandial redistribution of circulating leukocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations was observed in both groups, including significant increases in the numbers of leukocytes and granulocytes and significant decreases in the numbers of monocytes, T-cells, and natural killer (NK) cells (all p < 0.05). However, IBS patients demonstrated significantly greater postprandial increases in leukocytes and granulocytes, while changes in the numbers of monocytes and NK cells were significantly diminished (all p < 0.05). Patients also failed to show the postprandial decrease in the in vitro TNF-alpha production observed in controls. Postprandial norepinephrine concentrations were negatively correlated with NK cell numbers in IBS patients (r= 0.58, p < 0.05) but not controls. CONCLUSIONS: IBS may involve an autonomic hyper-responsiveness to visceral stimuli, which occurs throughout the entire gut, is independent of acutely perceived GI symptoms, and does not necessarily involve HPA axis activation. Women with IBS show altered cellular immune responses to food intake, which may at least in part be mediated by adrenergic mechanisms. Thus, autonomic disturbances may have implications for cellular immune function along the neuroendocrine-immune axis in patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Stressful life events are supposed to be involved in various diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome. Impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier function is a suspected consequence of stress, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the mechanisms through which stress modulates the colonic epithelial barrier. METHODS: Cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was evaluated in murine colon, liver, and spleen by competitive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction after 1-4 days of daily 2-hour stress sessions. Colonic paracellular permeability was measured as the in vivo lumen-to-blood ratio of (51)Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The effect of a myosin light chain (MLC) kinase inhibitor (ML-7) was assessed on stress-induced interferon (IFN)-gamma mRNA expression and colonic epithelial barrier impairment, and MLC phosphorylation was determined by immunoblot. Finally, the incidence of repeated stress sessions on bacterial translocation was determined. RESULTS: Repeated stress induced an overexpression of colonic IFN-gamma. In the liver, higher levels of IFN-gamma, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-10 mRNAs were detected and were associated with bacterial translocation, inflammation, and apoptosis. Stress increased colonic permeability of control mice, but not of SCID and IFN-gamma-deficient mice. ML-7 inhibited the stress-induced increased permeability, bacterial translocation, and cytokine overexpression in the liver and restored a normal histology. Larger amounts of phosphorylated MLC were detected in stressed animals. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated stress sessions drive organ-specific cytokine expression patterns and alter colonic mucosal barrier functions associated with bacterial translocation. This effect depends on the presence of CD4(+) T cells and requires IFN-gamma production and MLC phosphorylation.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is multifactorial. Recent investigations have associated episodes of infectious gastroenteritis with development of IBS. This condition is named post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS). The role of inflammation-infection in IBS pathogenesis is not well understood. AIM: To review published scientific evidence on PI-IBS regarding risk factors, causal agents, histopathological changes, and treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search in MEDLINE and abstracts presented at national and international GI meetings was performed, looking for information published in the past 50 years including animal studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, and series of cases and case reports, using the key words post-infectious enteritis, post-dysenteric or post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS), and post-infectious colitis. RESULTS: Fifty one papers were included. These studies were classified according to pathophysiologic mechanisms, infectious agents involved, animal or human studies, and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence shows a strong association between colonic infection and inflammation with development of IBS. Approximately 25% of patients with IBS have a history of infectious enteritis. Microbial agents related with PI-IBS include bacteria (Campylobacter, Salmonella) and parasites (Trichinella spiralis). Increased number of enteroendocrine cells, CD3 lymphocytes and mast cells within the colonic muscle wall, release of pro-inflammatory substances, and increased number of inflammatory cells with intestinal nervous endings are the most common histopathologic findings. Patients developing PI-IBS have a higher frequency of psychological disorders and stressful events prior to the gastroenteritis episode. Therapeutic interventions with steroids, COX-2 inhibitors, antibiotics and probiotics require further investigation.},

   abstract = {In oogamous reproduction of multicellular organisms, a striking phenomenon is the prevailing synchronous development of male germ cells connected by wide intercellular bridges (IBs, 0.1-2 microm), which is well conserved in both animal and plant species ranging from algae to human. In the literature, IBs are believed either to allow genetically segregated haploid spermatids to share diploid gene products after meiosis, or to mediate rapid transfer of some vital signals or nutrients. Although intercellular sharing of gene transcripts has experimental evidences, these hypotheses are still not satisfactory. To explore the unknown roles of IB, we assume that developing male germ cells may be especially sensitive to stochastic gene expression to become heterogeneous. To achieve best gamete quality, such heterogeneity must be eliminated so that relatively uniform gametes with normal functions can be produced. Development within a common syncytium may be the only way for this purpose. The process may require not only the intercellular exchange of a few molecular signals but also the mixing of protoplasm between the connected cells so that they have similar levels/states of mRNAs, proteins and organelles, which can be achieved only through wide IBs. This hypothesis can explain some quite intriguing aspects of male gametogenesis and provide unique predictions that can be tested experimentally.},

Abdominal symptoms were assessed using the bowel disease questionnaire (BDQ) and, in addition, the most bothersome symptom complex identified (dysmotility-type, ulcer-type dyspepsia, or IBS). Gastric emptying time (GET (t(1/2), min)) was measured by (13)C-octanoic breath test and a nutrient challenge performed. Twenty randomly selected asymptomatic blood donors, 48 symptomatic blood donors (30 FD, 18 IBS), and 40 patients (23 FD, 17 IBS) had additional function testing. RESULTS: GET (t(1/2)) was significantly (p<0.05) longer in blood donors with FD symptoms (99 (6) min) and FD patients (110 (12) min) compared with asymptomatic controls (76.7 (7) min), but was not significant in IBS blood donors or patients. Overall, 25 of 48 blood donors with symptoms and 18 of 40 patients had slow gastric emptying. GET was most delayed in subjects with predominantly dysmotility-type symptoms (167 (36) min v controls; p<0.01). Symptom intensities after a nutrient challenge were significantly higher in FD patients and symptomatic blood donors compared with asymptomatic controls; 14 of 48 blood donors with symptoms and 16 of 40 patients had a symptom response to the nutrient challenge exceeding the response (mean (2SD)) of healthy asymptomatic controls. CONCLUSION: Gastric emptying and the global symptom response to a standardised nutrient challenge are abnormal in population based (non-health care seeking) subjects with dyspepsia.},

   abstract = {Zinc is known to be essential for all highly proliferating cells in the human body, especially the immune system. A variety of in vivo and in vitro effects of zinc on immune cells mainly depend on the zinc concentration. All kinds of immune cells show decreased function after zinc depletion. In monocytes, all functions are impaired, whereas in natural killer cells, cytotoxicity is decreased, and in neutrophil granulocytes, phagocytosis is reduced. The normal functions of T cells are impaired, but autoreactivity and alloreactivity are increased. B cells undergo apoptosis. Impaired immune functions due to zinc deficiency are shown to be reversed by an adequate zinc supplementation, which must be adapted to the actual requirements of the patient. High dosages of zinc evoke negative effects on immune cells and show alterations that are similar to those observed with zinc deficiency. Furthermore, when peripheral blood mononuclear cells are incubated with zinc in vitro, the release of cytokines such as interleukins (IL)-1 and -6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, soluble IL-2R and interferon-gamma is induced. In a concentration of 100 micro mol/L, zinc suppresses natural killer cell killing and T-cell functions whereas monocytes are activated directly, and in a concentration of 500 micro mol/L, zinc evokes a direct chemotactic activation of neutrophil granulocytes. All of these effects are discussed in this short overview.},

   abstract = {RAP is a common and challenging clinical presentation in general pediatrics and pediatric gastroenterology. The differential diagnosis is extensive and growing but dominated by functional disorders for which there are new diagnostic criteria despite the lack of specific confirmatory laboratory markers. Because FRAP, dyspepsia, and IBS are common and defined by clinical criteria, it is now prudent to initiate empiric therapy for suspected functional disorders while performing limited laboratory screening to exclude organic disorders. Using this approach, one is no longer bound to undertake extensive testing in all children with undifferentiated RAP. Alarm symptoms help identify children at greater risk for a specific underlying organic cause to their symptoms and can narrow the focus for diagnostic evaluation. Because of altered family dynamics, interaction with psychological comorbidities, and the child's disabled status, the role of the psychologist is critical in many cases. IBS is the most common single diagnosis in undifferentiated RAP and can be readily identified using the current Rome II criteria. The clinical patterns in children--pain plus altered bowel habits--help differentiate patients into diarrhea-predominant and constipation-predominant subtypes. Although the pathophysiology of IBS is unknown, specific approaches to identify and reduce triggers, pharmacologically reduce bowel spasm, and attenuate neural-pain processing are now commonly used and effective strategies.},

Seventy-six adult celiac patients were analyzed according to nutritional status and 18 children/adolescents to gluten-free diet adherence. As controls, 84 adults and 22 adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome were used The significant findings were observed as follow: adult celiac patients, irrespective of the nutritional status, were younger than controls, presented delayed menarche, secondary amenorrhea, a higher percentage of spontaneous abortions, anemia and hypoalbuminemia. No differences were observed regarding the number of pregnancies, age at menopause and duration of the reproductive period. After treatment, patients presented with normal pregnancies and one patient presented spontaneous abortion. The adolescents who were not adherent to gluten-free diet presented delayed menarche and secondary amenorrhea. In conclusion, gluten per se could explain the disturbances and malnutrition would worsen the disease in a consequent vicious cycle. Therefore, celiac disease should be included in the screening of reproductive disorders.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A major health care trend in the last decade has been the increased use of complementary and alternative medicine and nutritional supplements. Indeed, we now have Physician's Desk References for both herbal therapies and dietary supplements. A large amount of out-of-pocket dollars are spent on complementary and alternative medicine each year in the United States, and complementary and alternative medicine users believe strongly in the efficacy of their treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: In the area of inflammatory bowel disease, probiotics appear to be a highly promising form of therapy. In acute pancreatitis, enteral nutrition has been shown to be safe and effective. Peppermint oil is one of the most widely used complementary and alternative medicine therapies for irritable bowel syndrome. Antioxidants are increasingly used in liver disease, especially agents involved in methionine metabolism. Both S-adenosylmethionine and betaine have shown efficacy in animal models of alcoholic liver disease, and "knockout" mice that develop S-adenosylmethionine deficiency also develop steatohepatitis. Thus, there is great interest in these complementary and alternative medicine agents in both alcoholic liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. There are also important safety issues related to complementary and alternative medicine. Deaths of well-known athletes have highlighted the risks of ephedra, and some research suggests that complementary and alternative medicine agents are a major cause of fulminant liver failure necessitating liver transplantation. SUMMARY: Thus, physicians must be aware not only of the potential therapeutic benefits of complementary and alternative medicine agents and nutritional supplements, but also their potential risks, including toxicity and drug interactions.},

   abstract = {Probiotic products have been widely used in Japan and Europe for years. Probiotics are now emerging as an important category of food supplement in the United States. Questions about the biologic nature, available products, claimed health benefits, and safety and regulation of probiotics are important for both consumers and nutrition professionals. Probiotics can be considered functional foods because they provide health benefits beyond the traditional nutrition function. With few exceptions, most probiotic products currently available contain lactic-acid-producing bacteria, which mainly belong to the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. We reviewed the scientific papers published in major nutrition journals and abstracts available on the PubMed website regarding probiotics. Evidence suggests the following beneficial effects of probiotics: normalization of the intestinal microflora, ability to block the invasion of potential pathogens in the gut, prophylactic or therapeutic treatment for several types of diarrhea, relief of symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, amelioration of lactose intolerance, prevention of colon cancer, modulation of immune function, inhibition of Helicobacter pylori, and possible enhancement of calcium absorption and reduction of blood cholesterol levels. Mechanisms for the above benefits have been proposed, but none has been proven. An adequate level of viable bacteria in a probiotic product and an appropriate daily dose are critical to achieve a health benefit. Because probiotics are not known to be pathogenic and their upper tolerable level is high, they could be promoted as a beneficial food supplement. Currently, no disease-prevention or therapeutic claim for probiotics is legally allowed.},

In this study, we evaluate the ability of an elemental diet to normalize the lactulose breath test (LBT) in IBS subjects with abnormal breath test findings. Consecutive subjects with IBS and abnormal LBT suggesting the presence of bacterial overgrowth underwent a 2-week exclusive elemental diet. The diet consisted of Vivonex Plus (Novartis Nutrition Corp., Minneapolis, MN) in a quantity based on individual caloric requirement. On day 15 (prior to solid food), subjects returned for a follow-up breath test and those with an abnormal LBT were continued on the diet for an additional 7 days. The ability of an elemental diet to normalize the LBT was determined for days 15 and 21. A chart review was then conducted to evaluate any clinical benefit 1 month later. Of the 93 subjects available for analysis, 74 (80%) had a normal LBT on day 15 of the elemental diet. When those who continued to day 21 were included, five additional patients normalized the breath test (85%). On chart review, subjects who successfully normalized their breath test had a 66.4 +/- 36.1% improvement in bowel symptoms, compared to 11.9 +/- 22.0% in those who failed to normalize (P < 0.001). An elemental diet is highly effective in normalizing an abnormal LBT in IBS subjects, with a concomitant improvement in clinical symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: Many studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this 24-month prospective study was to evaluate the prevalence of IBS in asthmatic patients. METHODS: We analyzed 623 asthmatic patients that were evaluated for body mass index, sex, and age before undergoing both a methacholine challenge test (MCHt) and skin prick tests. RESULTS: We found that 276 asthmatic patients (44.3%) were positive on the MCHt, while 347 (55.7%) were negative. We also found that 27 (9.7%) of the 276 patients with a positive MCHt and 44 (12.7%) of the 347 patients with a negative MCHt were affected by IBS. Therefore, there was no statistically significant difference between positive MCHt tests and IBS. The PC(20) (mean provocation concentration of methacholine producing a 20% reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 s < or =16 mg/ml) in all patients tested was 8.64 +/- 2.58 mg/ml, being 8.75 +/- 2.52 and 8.55 +/- 2.32 mg/ml for males and females, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not demonstrate a relationship between MCHt and IBS. However, a relationship might still exist in a subpopulation of patients whose symptoms worsen by stress.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have reduced pain thresholds for rectal distension. In addition, the prevalence of sexual/physical abuse in referred IBS patients is high and is associated with greater pain reporting, poorer health status, and poorer outcome. This lead to a hypothesis that abuse history may sensitise patients to report pain at a lower threshold. AIM: To compare rectal pain thresholds in women with IBS who had a history of severe abuse to IBS women with no history of abuse. METHODS: We studied 74 IBS patients with a history of severe physical and/or sexual abuse and 85 patients with no history of abuse. Abuse history was assessed by a previously validated self-report abuse screening questionnaire. Rectal sensory thresholds were assessed using an electronic barostat and determined by the ascending method of limit (AML) and by the tracking technique. RESULTS: IBS patients with a history of severe abuse had significantly higher rectal pain thresholds, as measured by AML (F (1, 111) = 6.06; p = 0.015) and the tracking technique (F (1, 109) = 5.21; p = 0.024). Patients with a history of severe abuse also reported a significantly higher threshold for urgency to defecate (F (1, 113) = 11.23; p =.001). CONCLUSION: Severe sexual/physical abuse is associated with higher urge and pain thresholds for rectal distension in IBS patients. This suggests that the greater pain reporting and poorer health status in IBS patients with abuse history are not related to increased rectal pain sensitivity. Further studies are needed to determine the causes of these findings.},

   abstract = {At the outset of the research programme into irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) it was perceived that there was a need to develop a symptom-based classification for the patients. Four groups of patients were identified, those with spastic colon syndrome, diarrhoea-predominant spastic colon syndrome, functional diarrhoea and midgut dysmotility. While working with outpatients with IBS it was noted how some of them had suffered symptoms for many years; specifically, a group of patients satisfying the criteria for midgut dysmotility had also suffered from particularly severe and intractable intestinal symptoms. These patients underwent 24 h ambulatory studies of small intestinal motility and the majority were found to have manometric features of chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIIP). To characterise the cause, laparoscopic full-thickness small intestine and colonic biopsies have been obtained in forty-five of the latter group of patients. Of these patients 58% have been found to have complete or partial deficiency of alpha-actin epitope staining in the inner circular layer of small intestinal smooth muscle. This deficiency is believed to represent an important biomarker rather than the cause of CIIP, since alpha-actin epitope deficiency has been observed in association with enteric neuropathy and myopathies. In relation to the management of CIIP patients, a multidisciplinary model is proposed incorporating management of co-morbid psychological and psychiatric pathology, abdominal and musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, urological symptoms and nutrition. A six-stage nutritional management plan for these patients is presented.},

METHODS: All relevant papers published on partially hydrolyzed guar gum were reviewed and the results summarized. RESULTS: Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a water-soluble dietary fiber with a wide range of uses in clinical nutrition. Its low viscosity allows its use in enteral products and beverages. PHGG can be added to enteral formulas and food products as a dietary fiber source. PHGG provides the benefits associated with dietary fiber ingestion. Addition of PHGG to the diet reduced laxative dependence in a nursing home population. PHGG also reduced the incidence of diarrhea in septic patients receiving total enteral nutrition and reduced symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. PHGG also increased production of Bifidobacterium in the gut. CONCLUSION: The ease of use of PHGG and its clinical effectiveness make it a good choice in clinical nutrition practice.},

There is growing evidence that these food ingredients may improve and in some cases treat certain conditions that are implicated in women's health. The use of probiotics (live, beneficial bacteria) in improving gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal tract conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, candidiasis and other female urogenital tract conditions are reviewed. Emphasis is also given to the importance of prebiotics (non-digestible food ingredients) in osteoporosis management and alleviation of menopausal symptoms and reducing the onset of cancer.},

   abstract = {Lactose in dairy products is maldigested by up to 70% to 75% of the world's population and many people may therefore suffer symptoms reminiscent of irritable bowel syndrome. As a result, most research to date has concentrated on ways of improving lactose tolerance to enhance dairy as a source of nutrition. However, research on other possible benefits of lactose and its maldigestion has lagged. In view of an exponential growth in the understanding of intestinal microfloral host interactions and the expanding therapeutical potential of probiotics, a reassessment of the role of lactose as a potential prebiotic in lactase nonpersistent subjects is required. Gibson and Roberfroid introduced the concept of prebiotics and outlined definitive requirements for such a compound. The present article examines scientific and clinical knowledge about the properties of lactose and argues that in lactase nonpersistent subjects, lactose qualifies as a prebiotic.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There has been an explosion in knowledge about celiac disease (CD) in the last decade based on the availability of serologic screening tests and the elucidation of some of the important disease susceptibility genes. What has been discovered is that CD is among the most common inherited diseases with a worldwide prevalence of almost 1% of the population. Also, there has been a tremendous expansion of the possible clinical presentations in patients with CD, many of them predominantly or even exclusively extraintestinal. Over the last year, both the North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and the NIH, through the mechanism of a consensus development conference held in May 2004, have published guidelines outlining the current state of knowledge and the areas where more research is needed. RECENT FINDINGS: This review will stress the most recent findings in CD in the areas of genetics, pathogenesis, epidemiology, screening and diagnosis, and natural history. It will stress the importance of HLA DQ2 and DQ8 as disease susceptibility genes, and the interaction of the environmental triggers (gliadins and glutenins) with these gene products to trigger the immunologic response in the gut that is responsible for the pattern of injury. Recent reports that stress the importance of screening high-risk groups (i.e. siblings of index cases and first degree relatives, patients with Type I diabetes, patients with Downs syndrome, patients with IgA deficiency) will be highlighted. The identification of the most sensitive and specific screening tests will be summarized with an explanation of special situations that affect the interpretation of these tests. Finally, the long-term morbidities associated with CD will be characterized supporting the case for early diagnosis and treatment. SUMMARY: The implications of these recent findings are of tremendous importance for both pediatricians and internists. Screening of high-risk groups, and of patients with the common symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, iron deficiency anemia, unexplained arthritis, and even chronic elevations of aminotransferases is becoming the accepted standard of practice. Much research remains to be done to further refine our understanding of CD, and to devise more effective strategies for treatment, compliance, and prevention of long-term complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between hydrogen and methane production is a possible confounding factor in the interpretation of H(2) breath tests (HBT), but is usually disregarded for the interpretation of HBT and, in most instances, only H(2) excretion is measured. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of predominant fasting methane CH(4) or H(2) production on the outcome of lactose HBT, in a large, homogeneous series of adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A lactose HBT was performed in 237 IBS patients with predominant fasting methane production (CH(4)>H(2)), recording the outcome of the test, amount of gas excreted and occurrence of clinical symptoms. Data were compared to those of 237 age- and sex-matched IBS patients with low fasting CH(4) excretion. RESULTS: The test was positive in 124 predominant CH(4) producers (52.3%) (PMP), as compared to 201 (84.8%) low methane producers (LMP) (P<0.0001). Peak hydrogen concentration and area under the curve of H(2) were significantly (P<0.001) lower, and the occurrence of symptoms during the test less frequent, in PMP vs LMP patients. During the test, CH(4) excretion doubled in 57/113 (50.4%) patients with negative HBT, and in 49/124 (39.5%) with positive HBT. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with predominant fasting methane production excrete less H(2) than LMP, after an oral load of lactose. The lower prevalence of severe lactose intolerance in PMP, as well as lower incidence of symptoms during the test, is, indeed, related to lower and slower H(2) excretion. The assumption that H(2) excretion is an effective means of quantifying the amount of malabsorbed carbohydrates is questionable in PMP. Methane-producing patients likely have a higher 'false negative' rate as compared to LMP after an oral load of lactose. Nonetheless, as symptoms are related to the amount of gas produced in the colon, HBT identifies patients with 'lactose intolerance', irrespective of the presence of lactose malabsorption, and helps in predicting the effect of lactose-restricted diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The real importance of lactose malabsorption in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is still controversial. The aim is to define the relationship between patient perception of milk tolerance/intolerance, lactose malabsorption and abdominal symptoms in IBS. METHODS: A hydrogen breath test (HBT) after an oral load of lactose was carried out in 475 consecutive IBS patients, diagnosed according to the Rome criteria. Data were analyzed in 201 age- and sex-matched pairs of IBS patients, classified according to self-reported milk tolerance/intolerance. Hydrogen peak and excretion, predominant presenting symptom and the occurrence of symptoms during the test, were evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of positive HBT and the occurrence of symptoms during the test was similar in milk "tolerant" (68.6%, 40.7% respectively) and "intolerant" patients (75.6%, 42.7% respectively), as well as peak (76.4 vs 75.2 ppm) and amount of H2 excreted (57.8 vs. 53.2 ppm/h). The positive predictive value for self-reported milk intolerance was 0.75, and the negative predictive value in regular milk users was 0.31, reflecting the prevalence of lactose malabsorption in the general population more than the awareness of milk tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: In IBS patients, self-reported milk intolerance does not help in identifying lactose malabsorbers. The opposite does not rule out the occurrence of symptoms after a lactose load. Lactose is, indeed, responsible for symptoms in some IBS patients, however, these patients can only be identified by the occurrence of symptoms during the test, and not on the individual perception of milk intolerance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is a common childhood complaint rarely associated with organic disease. Recently, the Pediatric Rome Criteria were developed to standardize the classification of pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) using a symptom-based approach. The authors tested the hypothesis that most patients with childhood RAP could be classified into one or more of the symptom subtypes defined by the Pediatric Rome Criteria. METHODS: Using a prospective longitudinal design, new patients with RAP (n = 114) were studied at a tertiary care children's medical center. Before the medical evaluation, parents completed a questionnaire about their child, assessing symptoms defined by the Pediatric Rome Criteria. RESULTS: Of the 107 children for whom medical evaluation revealed no organic etiology for pain, 73% had symptom profiles consistent with the Pediatric Rome Criteria for one of the FGIDs associated with abdominal pain (irritable bowel syndrome, 44.9%; functional dyspepsia,15.9%; functional abdominal pain, 7.5%; abdominal migraine, 4.7%) CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first systematic empirical evidence that RAP, originally defined by Apley, includes children whose symptoms are consistent with the symptom criteria for several FGIDs defined by the Rome criteria. The pediatric Rome criteria may be useful in clinical research to (1) describe the symptom characteristics of research participants who meet Apley's broad criteria for RAP, and (2) select patients with particular symptom profiles for investigation of potential biologic and psychosocial mechanisms associated with pediatric FGIDs.},

   abstract = {Left-sided diverticulosis coli is a common condition in western communities, with 30% to 50% of adults over the age of 60 being affected. It predominantly involves the sigmoid colon. The diverticula (pseudodiverticula) are pockets of mucosa bounded by muscularis mucosae and invested with a thin layer of submucosa, that are forced out through weak points in the muscularis propria, the tips ending in the colonic subserosa. The weak points in the muscle coat are the sites of entry of the nutrient vessels of the colonic mucosa. Diverticulosis is attributed to increased colonic intraluminal pressure while straining at stool in individuals who eat low-fiber diets. Muscular hypertrophy, shortening of the bowel, and thickened mucosal folds due to mucosal redundancy are characteristic of this condition. Complications of diverticulosis include bleeding, diverticulitis, peridiverticular abscess, perforation, stricture, and fistula formation. However, most individuals with diverticulosis are asymptomatic, without evidence of complications. Mucosal changes in the diverticula in uncomplicated diverticulosis include an increased lymphoid infiltrate, development of lymphoglandular complexes, mucin depletion, mild cryptitis, architectural distortion, Paneth cell metaplasia, and ulceration. The mucosa of the remainder of the sigmoid colon (ie, the nondiverticular mucosa) is usually normal, but in about 1% of cases it has features that are indistinguishable from ulcerative colitis or from Crohn's disease (segmental colitis associated with diverticular disease, SCAD). Such cases pose a difficult diagnostic challenge as patients with SCAD respond to medical or surgical therapy for diverticular disease, whereas those with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease will develop other manifestations of their disease in time and require different treatment. In SCAD, the mucosal changes are confined to the area of diverticulosis; therefore, histologic evaluation of the rectum (which is unaffected by diverticulosis) and more proximal bowel can be helpful in the differential diagnosis.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A recent study has shown that health related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is affected by the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms (GI). It is unknown if this is reproducible among Latin patients with DM. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of GI symptoms on HRQOL of Latin patients with type 2 DM. METHODS: Between March and June 2001, consecutive patients with type 2 DM from a referral center were studied, excluding those with a history of DM related chronic complications or using insulin. A Bowel Symptom Questionnaire identified 47 patients with GI symptoms (A) and they were compared with 46 consecutive patients without GI symptoms (B). All patients answered the HRQOL questionnaire, SF-36 Spanish-Mexico. Results of the SF-36 were expressed in means +/- SD and analyzed by ANOVA and Bonferroni. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The frequency of GI symptoms in A were: 41.6% gastroesophageal reflux, 14.6% dyspepsia, 21.3% IBS, 20.8% fecal incontinence and 2.2% combinations. Compared to A, B showed lower scores in all the SF-36 scales (Physical function: p = 0.001, role limitations-physical: p = 0.003, bodily pain: p = 0.001, general health: p = 0.016, energy/fatigue: p = 0.003, social functioning: p = 0.013, emotional well-being: p = 0.004) except in role limitations-emotional. Also A had lower scores in the physical component summary (p = 0.001) but no difference in the mental component. CONCLUSIONS: In Latin patients with type 2 DM the presence of GI symptoms has a negative impact mainly on the physical components of HRQOL, compared to those without GI symptoms.},
