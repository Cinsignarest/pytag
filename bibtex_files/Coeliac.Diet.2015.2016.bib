   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence and factors associated with transaminasemia in celiac disease are poorly known. AIMS: To investigate these issues in paediatric celiac patients and controls. METHODS: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was studied in 150 children with untreated celiac disease, 161 disease controls and 500 population-based controls. The association between ALT and clinical and histological variables and the effect of a gluten-free diet were investigated in celiac patients. RESULTS: ALT was >30U/l: celiac disease 14.7%, ulcerative colitis 37.2%, Crohn's disease 16.7%, reflux disease 16.2%, functional gastrointestinal symptoms 8.9%, and controls 3.6%. Factors associated with increased ALT were poor growth (45.5% vs 24.2%, P=0.039) and severe villous atrophy (median 23.0U/l vs partial atrophy 19.0U/l, P=0.008), but not age, sex, body-mass index, type or severity of symptoms and co-morbidities. ALT had a moderate correlation with endomysial (r=0.334, P<0.001) and transglutaminase antibodies (r=0.264, P=0.002) and ferritin (r=-0.225, P=0.03), but not with other laboratory values. On gluten-free diet median ALT decreased from 22.0U/l to 18.0U/l (P=0.002) and 80% of the high values normalized. CONCLUSION: Increased ALT is associated with more advanced serological and histological celiac disease. Adherence to a gluten-free diet appears to result in normalization or reduction of ALT levels.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated gluten dependent enteropathy induced by ingestion of gluten, characterized by intestinal malabsorption and subtotals or total atrophy of intestinal villi. The predominant consequence of CD in untreated patients, is malnutrition as a result of malabsorption. Moreover, several and increasing extra-intestinal clinical manifestations have been described in the CD patients. Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) improves nutritional status, inducing an increase in fat and bone compartments, but does not completely normalize body composition and nutritional deficiencies. An early and accurate evaluation of nutritional status can be of the pivotal step in the clinical management of the adult CD patients. The aim of this review is to present the most important and recent data on nutritional and metabolic features in the CD adult patients, the related implications and the effects of the GFD on these conditions.},

As in celiac disease, the pathologic findings are villous atrophy and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. Clinical presentation of olmesartan-induced enteropathy includes diarrhea, weight loss, and nausea. In contrast to celiac disease, tissue transglutaminase is not elevated and there is no response to a gluten-free diet. Including this entity in the differential diagnosis of sprue-like enteropathy is critical for its early diagnosis since replacing olmesartan with an alternative antihypertensive drug can simplify the diagnostic workup and provide both clinical and histologic improvement.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Response to gluten challenge (GC) is a key feature in diagnostic algorithms and research trials in celiac disease (CD). Currently, autoantibody titers, late responders to GC, and invasive duodenal biopsies are used to evaluate gluten responsiveness. This study investigated the accuracy of serum intestinal-fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), a marker for intestinal epithelial damage, to predict intestinal damage during GC in patients with CD. METHODS: Twenty adult CD patients in remission underwent a two-week GC with 3 or 7.5 g of gluten daily. Study visits occurred at day -14, 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Serum I-FABP, antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA), deamidated gliadin peptides (IgA-DGP), and anti-actin (AAA-IgA) were assessed at each visit. Villous-height to crypt-depth ratio (Vh:Cd) and intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) count were evaluated at day -14, 3, and 14. Forty-three CD-serology negative individuals were included to compare serum I-FABP levels in CD patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) with those in healthy subjects. RESULTS: Serum I-FABP levels increased significantly during a two-week GC. In contrast, the most pronounced autoantibody increase was found at day 28, when patients had already returned to a GFD for two weeks. IgA-AAA titers were only significantly elevated at day 28. I-FABP levels and IEL count correlated at baseline (r=0.458, P=0.042) and at day 14 (r=0.654, P=0.002) of GC. Neither gluten dose nor time on a GFD influenced I-FABP change during GC. CONCLUSIONS: Serum I-FABP levels increased significantly during a two-week GC in adult CD patients and correlated with IEL count. The data suggest that serum I-FABP is an early marker of gluten-induced enteropathy in celiac patients and may be of use in both clinical and research settings.},

   abstract = {Celiac Disease is an autoimmune enteropathy with increasing incidence worldwide in both adults and children. It occurs as an inflammatory condition with destruction of the normal architecture of villi on consumption of gluten and related protein products found in wheat, barley and rye. However, the exact pathogenesis is not yet fully understood. A gluten-free diet remains the main modality of therapy to date. While some patients continue to have symptoms even on a gluten-free diet, adherence to this diet is also difficult, especially for the children. Hence, there is continued interest in novel methods of therapy and the current research focus is on the promising novel non-dietary modalities of treatment. Here, we critically reviewed the existing literature regarding the pathogenesis of celiac disease in children including the role of in-utero exposure leading to neonatal and infant sensitization and its application for the development of new therapeutic approaches for these patients.},

The objective of this paper was to evaluate the quality of gluten-free bread formulated with different tiger nut-derived products in order to substitute soya flour (which is an allergen ingredient) and, at the same time, increase the use of tiger nut-derived products. Four gluten-free formulations based on corn starch and containing tiger nut milk, tiger nut milk by-product, tiger nut flour, or soya flour (as reference formulation) were studied. Tiger nut milk increased G' of gluten-free batter and rendered breads with the softest crumb (502.46 g +/- 102.05), the highest loaf-specific volume (3.35 cm(3)/g +/- 0.25), and it was mostly preferred by consumers (61.02%). Breads elaborated with tiger nut flour had similar characteristics than soya flour breads (except in color and crumb structure). The addition of tiger nut milk by-product resulted in a hard (1047.64 g +/- 145.74) and dark (L(*) = 70.02 +/- 3.38) crumb bread, which was the least preferred by consumers. Results showed that tiger nut is a promising ingredient to formulate gluten-free baked products.},

Therefore, experts support screening for CD in T1DM patients, though there is no consensus as to the recommended frequency of screening. When stratified by time since CD diagnosis, longer follow-up and coexistence of CD are associated with significant increased risk of diabetic associated morbidity and mortality. Early CD diagnosis and treatment with a gluten-free diet are essential.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to translate, adapt and validate the Celiac Disease Questionnaire (CDQ), which was developed in Germany, for use in Turkey. METHODS: The questionnaire was translated by a forward-backward translation method. Total CDQ score and four subscores (emotional state, gastrointestinal symptoms, worries, social problems) were calculated and their reliability assessed by internal consistency. Reliability of scales was evaluated by internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was assessed by means of a retest after 15 days. Face validity was assessed by patient volunteers and physicians and construct validity was assessed by means of confirmatory factor analysis. Convergent validity was determined by comparing responses to the CDQ with similar subscale scores of the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey. Discriminative concurrent criterion validity was determined by comparing the CDQ scores of patients with celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD) with CD patients not on a GFD. RESULTS: The Turkish version of the CDQ was completed by 205 patients with celiac disease (Female 146, mean age 31.1 year, +/- 10.61). The Cronbach-alpha coefficent of the subscores ranged between 0.73 and 0.93. Test-retest reliability was 0.99 for all subscores. 42 patients with CD and five gastroenterologists assessed the items of the CDQ to be comprehensible and relevant to the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of CD patients. The confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated acceptable fit indices for the original four subscales of the CDQ. The correlations between the scales of the CDQ and the instrument for validation covering similar dimensions of the HRQOL ranged between 0.61 and 0.93. In all subscores and in the total score, patients not on a GFD showed a significantly reduced HRQOL (all p < 0.05) compared to patients on a GFD. CONCLUSION: The Turkish version of the CDQ proved to be a reliable and valid instrument for measuring HRQOL in Turkish patients with celiac disease.},

AIM: To evaluate predictive factors of celiac hepatitis at celiac disease diagnosis. METHODS: Retrospective study including 46 adult patients with the diagnosis of celiac disease. RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent were women, with a mean age of 33 +/- 11 years, 87% had a Marsh 3 and 46% (n = 21) had celiac hepatitis. These patients had a median Immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (TTG-IgA) level of 208.0 U/ml (p25-p75: 89-1316 U/ml), a mean aspartate aminotransferase of 42 +/- 24 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 50 +/- 28 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 111 +/- 64 U/L, at the time of diagnosis. Median TTG-IgA one year after diagnosis was 9U/ml (p25-p75: 4.5-30.5 U/ml) and 33% of the patients had normal values. At diagnosis, patients without celiac hepatitis had a median TTG-IgA of 77U/ml (p25-p75: 24-288 U/ml), mean aspartate aminotransferase of 23 +/- 4 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 20 +/- 6 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 69 +/- 17 U/L. Median of TTG-IgA one year after diagnosis was 6 U/ml (p25-p75: 3-19 U/ml) and 48% had normal values. The celiac hepatitis group patients had higher values of TTG-IgA (p = 0.007) at diagnosis. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between TTG-IgA and alanine aminotransferase (r = 0.324, p = 0.028) at diagnosis. The odds of having celiac hepatitis was almost 5-fold higher in patients with a TTG-IgA level higher than 310 U/ml (OR = 4.8, 95%CI = 1.213-18.781, p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Higher TTG-IgA levels are a predictive factor for celiac hepatitis in adult patients with celiac disease at diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated inflammation of the small intestine caused by sensitivity to dietary gluten in genetically sensitive individuals. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the predictive value of tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies for the diagnosis of celiac disease in a pediatric population in order to determine if duodenal biopsy can be avoided. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The subjects were selected among individuals with probable celiac disease, referring to a gastrointestinal clinic. After physical examinations and performing tissue transglutaminase-immunoglobulin A (tTG-IgA) tests, upper endoscopy was performed if serological titer was higher than 18 IU/mL. Therapy started according to pathologic results. RESULTS: The sample size was calculated to be 121 subjects (69 female and 52 male subjects); the average age of subjects was 8.4 years. A significant association was found between serological titer and pathologic results; in other words, subjects with high serological titer had more positive pathologic results for celiac disease, compared to others (P < 0.001). Maximum sensitivity (65%) and specificity (65.4%) were achieved at a serological titer of 81.95 IU/ml; the calculated accuracy was lower in comparison with other studies. As the results indicated, lower antibody titer was observed in patients with failure to gain weight and higher antibody titer was reported in diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: As the results indicated, a single serological test (tTg-IgA test) was not sufficient for avoiding intestinal biopsy.},

   abstract = {Gluten is a protein complex found in the endosperm portion of wheat, rye, and barley. "Gluten-related disorder" is a term used to describe conditions related to ingestion of gluten-containing foods. Gluten has been implicated as the cause of a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) and extraintestinal symptoms. These symptoms are often non-specific and variable, making it difficult for the primary care provider to diagnose the cause and develop a management plan. Recently, gluten-related disorders have received much attention in the popular press, and the sale of gluten-free foods has become a multi-billion dollar business. It is important for pediatric primary care providers to understand the potential role of gluten in GI health and symptomatology so appropriate screening, diagnostic testing, and management can be provided.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the small intestine triggered by gluten ingestion. The objective of this study is to describe our experience with CD children in Kuwait. METHODS: The records of children with CD seen in the pediatric gastroenterology unit between February 1998 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were referred because of symptoms or positive CD antibody screening of a high-risk group (type 1 diabetes and Down syndrome). RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were diagnosed: 53% were symptomatic and 47% were identified by screening. The median age at diagnosis was 66 (range 7-189) months. All cases were biopsy-proven except one. The symptomatic patients were significantly younger than those identified following screening (P<0.004). In the whole group, 66% were females and 77% were Kuwaitis; 9% had a positive family history of CD. The estimated cumulative incidence was 6.9/10(5). The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 8.5 (range 2-54) months. Failure to thrive was the most common presenting complaint (72%) followed by diarrhea (64%) and abdominal distension (56%). Atypical manifestations were seen in 60% of patients. Underweight and short stature were confirmed in 19% and 17% of patients, respectively. Overweight and obesity were detected in 14% and 6%, respectively. CD serology was based on a combination of antiendomysial and antigliadin antibodies. The median follow up was 24 (range 12-144) months. All patients were commenced on a gluten free diet, but good compliance was only achieved in 78%. CONCLUSION: The low frequency of childhood CD in Kuwait could probably be attributed to either an underestimation of the atypical presentations or failure of proper screening. Also, adherence to a gluten free diet is a major problem in our population.},

   abstract = {Buckwheat is one of the most valuable pseudo-cereals in terms of its nutritional composition, and it is suitable for celiac patients because of its gluten-free characteristic. However, gluten is the main structure-forming protein responsible for the development of structure in baked products. Therefore, it is a challenge to produce high-quality gluten-free products. Transglutaminase addition is a relatively common application used in the production of gluten-free baked goods. The objective of this study was to investigate the combination of buckwheat flour with rice and corn flour at different levels in gluten-free cookie formulations and the impact of transglutaminase on the quality of cookies. Quality parameters evaluated were proximal chemical composition, spread ratio, color, and textural parameters (hardness and fracturability). Spread ratio, protein, crude fiber, ash content, and also b* and hardness values were significantly (p < 0.05) affected by flour combinations. Further, addition of transglutaminase resulted in increased moisture content, spread ratio, and fracturability but decreased hardness values.},

A culture medium, in which gliadins were the sole source of nitrogen, was developed for screening for microorganisms with gliadinase activity. The problem of gliadin insolubility was solved by mild acid treatment, which renders an acid-hydrolysed gliadin/peptide mixture (AHG). This medium provided a sensitive and reliable means of detecting proteases, compared to the classical spectrophotometric method involving azocasein. When a sample of fermented wheat (a source of bacteria) was plated on an AHG-based culture medium, strains with gliadinase activity were isolated. These strains' gliadinase profiles were determined using an AHG-based substrate in zymographic analyses.},

   abstract = {Weaning (or introduction of complementary feeding) is a special and important moment in the growth of a child, both for the family and the infant itself, and it can play a major role in the child's future health. Throughout the years, various weaning modes have come in succession, the latest being baby-led weaning; the timing for introducing foods and the requirements of which sort of nutrient for weaning have also changed over time. Furthermore, the role played by nutrition, especially in the early stages of life, for the onset of later non-communicable disorders, such as diabetes, obesity or coeliac disease has also been increasingly highlighted.Members of Italian Society of Gastroenterology, Hepathology and Pediatric Nutrition (SIGENP) and the Italian Society of Allergology and Pediatric Immunology (SIAIP) Emilia Romagna here propose a practical approach for pediatricians to deal with daily practice. The four main areas for discussion were weaning in relation with the onset of allergic diseases, coeliac disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, the nutrition requirements to take into account for assessing the diet of infants under one year of age and about the practice of baby-led weaning focusing on limits and benefits, respectively.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Little is known regarding nutritional adequacy of the gluten free diet (GFD) in children and adolescents with celiac disease (CD). The study aim was to examine macro- and micronutrient intake in children with CD. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in children and adolescents (4-18 years of age) with CD (n = 32) and healthy controls (n = 32). Macro- and micronutrient intake, and glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) intake was assessed using validated measures. Diet quality was assessed using the Canadian Healthy Eating Index (HEI-C) and the Alberta Nutrition Guidelines. Values are shown as mean +/- SE. RESULTS: Age (10.4 +/- 0.7 years vs 8.7 +/- 0.7 years; P = 0.06), weight-for-age z score (P = 0.27), and height-for-age z score (P = 0.23) were not different between groups. CD children consumed more fibre (15.9 +/- 1.2 g per day(CD) vs 10.8 +/- 0.8 g per day (controls); P < 0.001), had higher GI (CD: 54 +/- 2 vs 48 +/- 1; P < 0.01) and GL (CD: 118 +/- 8 vs 93 +/- 7; P = 0.02), and lower folate (146.7 +/- 15.3 (CD) vs 245.4 +/- 21.8 microg per day (controls); P < 0.001) than controls. No differences in HEI-C scores (</= and > 80) were observed between groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Children with CD had high intakes of fibre, GI, and GL and lower intakes of folate. This has implications for dietary counselling in this population.},

Here we describe the first case of a patient with severe asymptomatic hypogammaglobulinemia where the underlying cause was undiagnosed celiac disease. A strict gluten free diet resulted in resolution of her mild long-standing abdominal symptoms and correction of her hypogammaglobulinemia. There was corresponding improvement in her duodenal histology and normalisation of her celiac serology. Protein losing enteropathy was unlikely to have been the mechanism of her profound hypogammaglobulinemia, as her albumin was within the normal range and she had a normal fecal alpha 1 antitrypsin level. Application of the Ameratunga et al. (2013) diagnostic criteria was helpful in confirming this patient did not have Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorder (CVID). Celiac disease must now be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe hypogammaglobulinemia. There should be a low threshold for undertaking celiac serology in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, even if they have minimal symptoms attributable to gut disease.},

   abstract = {Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), sometimes known as non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS), has recently received much attention, both scientific as well as from the alternative medical community. Over the past 5 years, there are over 200 publications on NCGS indexed on the PubMed database, the gluten-free market has been growing bigger, and it is clear that the number of consumers who are on a gluten-free diet (GFD) possibly because of a suspicion for NCGS appears to grow even faster. Nevertheless, despite these three rising events, many questions about NCGS remain unresolved. It is likely that NCGS represents a heterogeneous group of disorders linked by a common response to a GFD. It is still not fully understood how gluten, and likely other wheat proteins and components, could activate and drive the pathophysiology of NCGS. As a result, there are still no clear biomarkers, no robust clinical diagnostic criteria, nor a conclusive definition for NCGS. This heterogeneity can be approached by reducing the variables, in particular those of human behaviour and placebo effect, by studying animal models to address specific biological effects of wheat and/or gluten-related proteins. Herein we review the animal models and their potential to be used to advance our understanding of these disorders and potentially address their prevention and treatment.},

It is a common chronic disorder, with a prevalence of 1% in Europe and North America. Although the disease primarily affects the gut, the clinical spectrum of CD is remarkably varied, and the disease can affect many extraintestinal organs and systems, including the liver. The hepatic dysfunction presenting in CD ranges from asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations or nonspecific reactive hepatitis (cryptogenic liver disorders), to chronic liver disease. In this article, we review the clinical presentations and possible mechanisms of CD-related liver injury to identify strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders in childhood.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Early nutrition may affect the risk of celiac disease. We investigated whether amount of gluten in diet until 2 years of age increases risk for celiac disease. METHODS: We performed a 1-to-3 nested case-control study of 146 cases, resulting in 436 case-control pairs matched for sex, birth year, and HLA genotype generated from Swedish children at genetic risk for celiac disease. Newborns were annually screened for tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA). If tested tTGA positive, time point of seroconversion was determined from frozen serum samples taken every 3 months. Celiac disease was confirmed by intestinal biopsies. Gluten intake was calculated from 3-day food records collected at ages 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated through conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Breastfeeding duration (median, 32 wk) and age at first introduction to gluten (median, 22 wk) did not differ between cases and tTGA-negative controls. At the visit before tTGA seroconversion, cases reported a larger intake of gluten than controls (OR, 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.46; P = .0002). More cases than controls were found in the upper third tertile (ie, >5.0 g/d) before they tested positive for tTGA seroconversion than controls (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.70-4.13; P < .0001). This finding was similar in children homozygous for DR3-DQ2 (OR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.61-6.30; P = .001), heterozygous for DR3-DQ2 (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.08-4.62; P = .030), and for children not carrying DR3-DQ2 (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 0.90-6.54; P = .079). CONCLUSIONS: The amount of gluten consumed until 2 years of age increases the risk of celiac disease at least 2-fold in genetically susceptible children. These findings may be taken into account for future infant feeding recommendations.},

According to several evidences, DH is considered the specific cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease, and the most recent guidelines of celiac disease have stated that, in celiac patients with a proven DH, a duodenal biopsy is unnecessary for the diagnosis. In this review, the most recent data about the diagnosis and the management of DH have been reported and discussed. In particular, in patients with clinical and/or histopathological findings suggestive for DH, the finding of granular IgA deposits along the dermal-epidermal junction or at the papillary tips by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) assay, together with positive results for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody testing, allows the diagnosis. Thereafter, a gluten-free diet should be started in association with drugs, such as dapsone, that are able to control the skin manifestations during the first phases of the diet. In conclusion, although DH is a rare autoimmune disease with specific immunopathological alterations at the skin level, its importance goes beyond the skin itself and may have a big impact on the general health status and the quality of life of the patients.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is a systemic autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten consumption in genetically susceptible individuals. It exhibits several clinical features, such as blood auto-antibodies (anti-endomysial antibodies EMA, anti-transglutaminase antibodies tTG, anti-deamidated gliadin peptides PGD), plus variable degrees of damage in the small intestinal mucosa. In Chile, tTG is positive in 0.76% in individuals >15 years, with the prevalence of CD being estimated at 0.6%. Approximately17% of first-degree relatives of coeliac patients have been reported tTG positive. To date, the gluten free diet (GFD) is the only known treatment for CD. To be effective, this must be lifelong, permanent, and strict. Gluten content in the GFD is not zero, but is limited to a cut-off of 3ppm (ormg/kg of product) in Chile. Mortality higher than that of the general population has been reported among coeliac patients, and poor adherence to GFD is associated with complications (mainly autoimmune processes and cancer). GFD is difficult to maintain strictly and poor adherence is by far the main cause of lack of response to treatment. Follow-up of adherence is also difficult because there are no objective measurements to assess it. In clinical practice determination of serum EMA, tTG and PGD is routinely used for these purposes, although more recently, the interview by an expert dietitian, validated questionnaires and measurement of faecal 33-mer peptide are being assessed as alternatives or complements to measure adherence to GFD. A review is presented with the current concepts on the available tools to follow up patients on GFD, emphasising those available in Chilel.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Innate immunity contributes to the pathogenesis of CD, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Although previous in vitro work suggests that gliadin peptide p31-43 acts as an innate immune trigger, the underlying pathways are unclear and have not been explored in vivo. Here we show that intraluminal delivery of p31-43 induces morphological changes in the small intestinal mucosa of normal mice consistent with those seen in CD, including increased cell death and expression of inflammatory mediators. The effects of p31-43 were dependent on MyD88 and type I IFNs, but not Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and were enhanced by coadministration of the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid. Together, these results indicate that gliadin peptide p31-43 activates the innate immune pathways in vivo, such as IFN-dependent inflammation, relevant to CD. Our findings also suggest a common mechanism for the potential interaction between dietary gluten and viral infections in the pathogenesis of CD.},

Given the requirements and intricacies inherent to each condition, we describe the rationale and design a dietary curriculum specifically addressing the educational requirements for children and adults with CD and diabetes as part of the CD-DIET Study. METHODS AND DESIGN: The CD-DIET Study (Celiac Disease and Diabetes - Dietary Intervention and Evaluation Trial) is a multicenter randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of a GFD in patients with asymptomatic celiac disease and T1D on key diabetes and patient-centered outcomes. DISCUSSION: Key dietary components of the trial include a description and evaluation of food consumption patterns including glycemic index and glycemic load, novel assessments of gluten quantification, and objective and subjective measures of GFD adherence. This dietary curriculum will establish rigorous guidelines to assess adherence and facilitate evaluation of a GFD on metabolic control, bone health and patient quality of life in patients with CD and diabetes.

Classical symptoms like chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss and growth retardation are nowadays relatively uncommon. Diagnostic workup includes serological tests for IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase 2 (anti-TG2-IgA) and total IgA and histology of duodenal biopsies. Histomorphological classification should be done according to the modified Marsh-Oberhuber classification. Diagnosis of celiac disease should be based on serological, clinical, and histological findings. The only treatment is a life-long gluten-free diet. Unchanged or recurrent symptoms under gluten-free diet may indicate refractory celiac disease. Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and adenocarcinomas of the small intestine are known complications of celiac disease.},

Copper deficiency can produce multiple neurologic manifestations. Myeloneuropathy is the most common neurologic syndrome and it is often irreversible, despite copper replacement. We report the case of a 55-year-old man who presented with progressive proximal limb weakness and weight loss in the setting of untreated celiac disease without gastrointestinal symptoms. He had anemia, neutropenia, and severe hypocupremia. The pattern of weakness raised the suspicion that there was an underlying myopathy, although this was not confirmed by electrodiagnostic studies. Weakness and hematologic abnormalities resolved completely within 1 month of total parenteral nutrition with copper supplementation and a gluten-free diet. Myopathy can rarely occur in patients with celiac disease, but the mechanism is unclear. Pure proximal limb weakness has not been previously reported in copper deficiency. We propose that this may represent a novel manifestation of hypocupremia and recommend considering copper deficiency and gluten sensitivity in patients presenting with proximal limb weakness.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity and the associated use of a gluten-free diet (GFD) are perceived to belong to the spectrum of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, recent reports suggest substantial use of a GFD in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We assessed the bidirectional relationship between IBD and self-reported non-celiac gluten sensitivity (SR-NCGS). METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire screened for SR-NCGS and the use of a GFD in 4 groups: ulcerative colitis (n = 75), Crohn's disease (n = 70), IBS (n = 59), and dyspeptic controls (n = 109). We also assessed diagnostic outcomes for IBD in 200 patients presenting with SR-NCGS. RESULTS: The prevalence of SR-NCGS was 42.4% (n = 25/59) for IBS, followed by 27.6% (n = 40/145) for IBD, and least among dyspeptic controls at 17.4% (n = 19/109); P = 0.015. The current use of a GFD was 11.9% (n = 7/59) for IBS, 6.2% (n = 9/145) for IBD, and 0.9% (1/109) for dyspeptic controls; P = 0.02. No differences were established between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. However, Crohn's disease patients with SR-NCGS were significantly more likely to have stricturing disease (40.9% versus 18.9%, P = 0.046), and higher mean Crohn's Disease Activity Index score (228.1 versus 133.3, P = 0.002), than those without SR-NCGS. Analysis of 200 cases presenting with SR-NCGS suggested that 98.5% (n = 197) could be dietary-related IBS. However, 1.5% (n = 3) were found to have IBD; such patients had associated alarm symptoms, and/or abnormal blood parameters, prompting colonic investigations. CONCLUSIONS: SR-NCGS is not only exclusive to IBS but also associated with IBD, where its presence may be reflecting severe or stricturing disease. Randomized studies are required to further delineate the nature of this relationship and clarify whether a GFD is a valuable dietetic intervention in selected IBD patients.},

   abstract = {Mankind has existed for 2.5 million years but only in the last 10,000 years have we been exposed to wheat. Wheat was first cultivated in the Fertile Crescent (South Western Asia) with a farming expansion that lasted from about 9000BC to 4000BC. Thus it could be considered that wheat (and gluten) is a novel introduction to man's diet! Prior to 1939 the rationing system had already been devised. This led to an imperative to try to increase agricultural production. Thus it was agreed in 1941 that there was a need to establish a Nutrition Society. The very roots of the society were geared towards necessarily increasing the production of wheat. This goal was achieved and by the end of the 20th century, global wheat output had expanded 5-fold. Perhaps as a result the epidemiology of coeliac disease (CD) or gluten sensitive enteropathy has changed. CD is a state of heightened immunological responsiveness to ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. CD now affects 1 % or more of all adults, for which the treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. However, there is a growing body of evidence to show that a far greater proportion of individuals without coeliac disease are taking a gluten-free diet of their own volition. This clinical entity has been termed non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), although the condition is fraught with complexities due to overlap with other gluten-based constituents that can also trigger similar clinical symptoms. This review will explore the relationship between gluten, the rising prevalence of modern coeliac disease, and the new entity of NCGS along with its associated uncertainties.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gluten-free diets (GFDs) have seen a disproportional rise in use and popularity relative to the prevalence of established gluten-related disorders such as coeliac disease or immunoglobulin E wheat allergy. This entity has been termed noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). This review aims to provide a current perspective on the emerging evidence for and against NCGS, along with the associated need for a GFD. RECENT FINDINGS: NCGS and the benefits of a GFD are reported amongst patients with irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and nonintestinal disorders such as neuropsychiatric diseases and fibromyalgia. However, no reliable biomarkers currently exist to diagnose NCGS and hence confirmatory testing can only be performed using double-blind placebo-controlled gluten-based challenges. Unfortunately, such tests are not available in routine clinical practice. Furthermore, recent novel studies have highlighted the role of other gluten-based components in contributing to the symptoms of self-reported NCGS. These include fermentable oligo, di, mono-saccharides and polyols, amylase trypsin inhibitors, and wheat germ agglutinins. Therefore, NCGS is now seen as a spectrum encompassing several biological responses and terms such as 'noncoeliac wheat sensitivity' have been suggested as a wider label to define the condition. SUMMARY: Despite the rising use of a GFD further studies are required to clearly establish the extent and exclusivity of gluten in NCGS.},

   abstract = {The past 5 years have seen an increase in the use of a gluten-free diet outside a diagnosis of coeliac disease or IgE-mediated wheat allergy. This trend has led to the identification of a new clinical entity termed noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). In this Review, we discuss the evidence for NCGS as demonstrated by the results of double-blind, placebo-controlled dietary rechallenge studies. Furthermore, the characteristic phenotype of individuals with NCGS is described as well as the symptom manifestations commonly reported after gluten exposure, which include intestinal symptoms consistent with IBS, and extraintestinal symptoms such as neurological dysfunction, psychological disturbances, fibromyalgia and skin rash. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that NCGS can be associated with organic gastrointestinal pathologies, such as IBD, in which its presence might be a reflection of severe or stricturing disease. However, NCGS is not without its controversies and uncertainties, in particular pertaining to whether it is gluten or nongluten components of the grain evoking symptoms; evidence suggests that fermentable carbohydrates, amylase trypsin inhibitors and wheat-germ agglutinin can also be responsible culprits. Finally, we discuss the novel techniques that might help diagnose NCGS in the future.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytosis (D-IEL) is an early marker for celiac disease (CD). However, the majority of cases are due to non-CD-related conditions. GOALS: To identify the predictors of CD when presented with D-IEL. METHODS: A total of 215 adult patients with D-IEL had undergone prospective and systematic evaluation for CD and other recognized associations.The gold-standard diagnosis of CD was based upon the presence of HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8, persistence or progression of D-IEL following a gluten challenge, followed by symptomatic improvement on a gluten-free diet.Binary logistic regression models, adjusting for age and sex, were subsequently performed to compare presenting variables between CD and non-CD cases, and to determine their sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS: CD was diagnosed in 48 cases (22%) and non-CD in 167 cases (78%). There was no statistical difference in baseline demographics, clinical symptoms (ie, diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain), anemia, or hematinics between the CD and non-CD group.Patients with CD, in comparison with non-CD, were significantly more likely to have a positive family history of CD (21% vs. 3.6%, OR 6.73; PPV 62.5%, NPV 81%, specificity 96.4%), positive HLA-DQ status (100% vs. 49.1%; PPV 36.4%, NPV 100%, specificity 50.9%), and presence of endomysial antibody (EMA) (48% vs. 0%; PPV 100%, NPV 87%, specificity 100%); all P</=0.001.A normal tissue transglutaminase antibody (TTG) level was seen in 29.2% CD and 83.2% non-CD cases (OR 0.084, P<0.001; PPV 9.2%). There was no difference in the prevalence of TTG levels 1 to 2xupper limit of normal (ULN) between the groups (29.2% CD vs. 14.4% non-CD; PPV 33% to 38%). However, TTG levels between 3 and 20xULN were significantly more prevalent in the CD group (33.3% vs. 2.4%, PPV 66.6% to 89%), whereas a TTG>20xULN was exclusive to CD (8.3%, P<0.001, PPV 100%). CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of D-IEL, only the presence of a positive EMA or TTG>20xULN at the outset can be used to make an immediate diagnosis of CD. Gastrointestinal symptoms, family history, anemia, or other celiac serology results do not reliably distinguish CD from non-CD without further investigations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Seronegative villous atrophy (SNVA) is commonly attributed to coeliac disease (CD). However, there are other causes of SNVA. More recently angiotensin-2-receptor-blockers (A2RBs) have been reported as an association but data on SNVA have been limited to centres evaluating complex case referrals and not SNVA in general. OBJECTIVES: To provide clinical outcomes and associations in a large prospective study overseeing all newcomers with SNVA. DESIGN: Over a 15-year period (2000-2015) we evaluated 200 adult patients with SNVA at a UK centre. A diagnosis of either seronegative CD (SNCD) or seronegative non-CD (SN-non-CD) was reached. Baseline comparisons were made between the groups, with 343 seropositive CD subjects serving as controls. RESULTS: Of the 200 SNVA cases, SNCD represented 31% (n=62) and SN-non-CD 69% (n=138). The human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and/or DQ8 genotype was present in 61%, with a 51% positive predictive value for SNCD. The breakdown of identifiable causes in the SN-non-CD group comprised infections (27%, n=54), inflammatory/immune-mediated disorders (17.5%, n=35) and drugs (6.5%, n=13; two cases related to A2RBs). However, no cause was found in 18% (n=36) and of these 72% (n=26/36) spontaneously normalised duodenal histology while consuming a gluten-enriched diet. Following multivariable logistic regression analysis an independent factor associated with SN-non-CD was non-white ethnicity (OR 10.8, 95% CI 2.2 to 52.8); in fact, 66% of non-whites had GI infections. On immunohistochemistry all groups stained positive for CD8-T-cytotoxic intraepithelial lymphocytes. However, additional CD4-T helper intraepithelial lymphocytes were occasionally seen in SN-non-CD mimicking the changes associated with refractory CD. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with SNVA do not have CD, in particular those who are not white. Furthermore, a subgroup with no obvious aetiology will show spontaneous histological resolution while consuming gluten. These findings suggest caution in empirically prescribing a gluten-free diet without investigation.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is the most common autoimmune inherited disorder in the United States, affecting approximately 1% of the population. Little research exists on the impact of family processes on adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), the only treatment for celiac disease. The objective of this qualitative study was to examine the barriers that families with a celiac child face and the strategies they use to adhere to the recommended diet. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 families with a child between the ages of 6 and 12 diagnosed with celiac disease. Grounded theory and narrative analysis were used to analyze interview transcripts. Social isolation and misunderstandings about celiac disease and the GFD emerged as the most significant barriers to diet adherence including the reproduction of traditional gender relations among parents. Diet adherence facilitators included various types of institutional and societal support and idiosyncratic family arrangements. Successful diet adherence strategies used by families included planning ahead and taking their own food to social functions. Family processes play a critical role in GFD adherence. Implications for health care clinicians working with families with a child with celiac disease are discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Advanced glycation end (AGE) products play a role in the progression of diabetic complications. Gluten-free diet (GFD) might affect AGE levels in patients who adhere to a GFD because of coeliac disease (CD). The aim of our study was to compare skin AGE levels and soluble receptor AGE levels (sRAGE) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) with (T1DM + CD) and without CD (T1DM - CD) and healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: We recruited 25 T1DM + CD and 25 T1DM - CD patients, matched for age, gender, diabetes duration, and glycaemic control alongside 25 healthy controls. We collected demographic, clinical and biochemical characteristics, including skin autofluorescence (AF), sRAGE and hs-CRP levels. The duration of T1DM in patients was 30 +/- 14 (+CD) and 29 +/- 14 years (-CD), whereas CD duration in T1DM + CD patients was 14 +/- 10 years. Skin AF levels in T1DM patients were higher compared to healthy controls (2.5 +/- 0.6 versus 1.9 +/- 0.4, p < 0.01) and skin AF was independently associated with age (r = 0.72, p < 0.01). sRAGE levels were higher in T1DM - CD patients compared to healthy controls (1554 +/- 449 versus 1309 +/- 400, p = 0.049) and independently associated with creatinine levels (r = 0.32, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that skin AGE and sRAGE levels are elevated in T1DM patients compared with healthy controls. No difference in skin AF or sRAGE levels between T1DM patients with or without CD were observed. The present study suggests that differences in microvascular complications between T1DM and T1DM + CD patients are not due to differences in skin AF or sRAGE levels.},

   abstract = {Theterm gluten intolerance may refer to three types of human disorders: autoimmune celiac disease (CD), allergy to wheat and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Gluten is a mixture of prolamin proteins present mostly in wheat, but also in barley, rye and oat. Gluten can be subdivided into three major groups: S-rich, S-poor and high molecular weight proteins. Prolamins within the groups possess similar structures and properties. All gluten proteins are evolutionarily connected and share the same ancestral origin. Gluten proteins are highly resistant to hydrolysis mediated by proteases of the human gastrointestinal tract. It results in emergence of pathogenic peptides, which cause CD and allergy in genetically predisposed people. There is a hierarchy of peptide toxicity and peptide recognition by T cells. Nowadays, there are several ways to detoxify gluten peptides: the most common is gluten-free diet (GFD), which has proved its effectiveness; prevention programs, enzymatic therapy, correction of gluten pathogenicity pathways and genetically modified grains with reduced immunotoxicity. A deep understanding of gluten intolerance underlying mechanisms and detailed knowledge of gluten properties may lead to the emergence of novel effective approaches for treatment of gluten-related disorders.},

   abstract = {This study was planned to investigate the amount and content of foods consumed by child patients with celiac disease on a long-term gluten-free diet. Children aged 3-18 years who were diagnosed with celiac disease according to ESPGHAN criteria and were compliant to the gluten-free diet for at least one year were included. Age and gender matched healthy children were included as the control group. Food consumption records including the amount and content of the foods consumed for a total of three days were obtained. Once the records had been completed on the food consumption form, quantity analysis was again performed by the same dietician. Energy and other nutritional elements taken in through foodstuffs consumed by the patient and control groups were calculated using the Nutrition Data System for Research Package; these results were shown as mean +/- standard deviation (x +/-SD) and the values compared. The study consisted of 28 patients with a mean age of 10.3 +/- 4.6 and 25 healthy controls with a mean age of 9.5 +/- 3.4. Average age at diagnosis in the patient group was 6.7 +/- 4.3 and mean duration of gluten-free diet was 4.0 +/- 3.3 years. Children with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet had significantly lower daily energy intake levels compared to the healthy controls (p<0.05). The proportional fat consumption was significantly higher in the patient group compared to the controls (p<0.05). Moreover, proportional carbohydrate and protein, vitamin E and vitamin B1, and microelements such as magnesium, phosphorus and zinc consumptions were significantly lower in celiac group with respect to v-control group. Solely determining compliance to the gluten free diet might be inadequate in the follow-up of children with celiac disease, adequacy of the nutritional content in terms of macro and micronutrients of celiac disease patients is also important.},

However, its definition, prevalence, diagnosis, pathogenesis, treatment, and follow up are still controversial. The purpose of the review is to summarize the evidence and problems emerging from the current literature. RECENT FINDINGS: Direct implication of gluten in the onset of symptoms is often unproved as a low fermentable oligo-, di- and mono-saccharides and polyols diet or other components of cereals as wheat amylase trypsin inhibitor could be similarly involved. To date, no specific biomarkers or histological abnormalities confirm diagnosis, and only the self-reported response to gluten-free diet as well as a positive double blind placebo-gluten challenge characterizes these non-celiac, non-wheat allergic patients. Critical revision of published studies can offer practical indications in approaching this clinical topic and useful suggestions to standardize scientific researches.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy sustained by dietary gluten in susceptible individuals, and characterized by a complex interplay between adaptive and innate responses against gluten peptides (PTG). In a recent contribution we have demonstrated that the treatment with PTG induces the expression and activity of arginase in both murine macrophages and human monocytes from healthy subjects, thus suggesting a role for arginine and its metabolites in gluten-triggered response of these cells. Here we further explore this field, by addressing the effects of PTG on polyamine synthesis and release in murine RAW264.7 macrophages, and how they affect epithelial permeability of Caco-2 monolayers. Results obtained show a massive production and release of putrescine by macrophages upon incubation with gluten peptides; this, in turn, causes a decrease in TEER in epithelial cells, indicating that PTG-driven secretion of polyamines by macrophages has a role in the modulation of intestinal permeability in vitro. At a molecular level, putrescine production appears referable to the activation of C/EBPbeta transcription factor, which is known to be responsible for arginase induction in activated macrophages and is a crucial mediator of inflammation. Whether these pathways are stimulated also in vivo deserves to be further investigated, as well as their role in gluten-driven cellular and intestinal defects typical of CD patients.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common but therapies are unsatisfactory. Food is often suspected as cause by patients, but diagnostic procedures, apart from allergy testing, are limited. Based on the hypothesis of non-celiac wheat sensitivity (WS) in a subgroup of IBS patients, we tested the long-term response to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and investigated HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 expression as a diagnostic marker for WS in diarrhea-dominant (IBS-D) and mixed-type IBS (IBS-M). METHODS: The response to a GFD served as reference test for WS and HLA-DQ2/8 expression was determined as index test. Patients were classified as responders if they reported complete or considerable relief of IBS symptoms on at least 75 % of weeks over a 4-month period of gluten-free diet. Established questionnaires (IBS-Quality of Life (IBS-QoL), IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS), European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)) were used for secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients finished the study. Of these, 12 (34 %) were responders and classified as having WS (95 % CI 21-51 %). HLA-DQ2/8 expression had a specificity of 52 % (95 % CI 33-71 %) and sensitivity of 25 % (95 % CI 8-54 %) for WS. Responders showed improvement in quality of life and symptom scores. At 1-year follow-up, all responders and 55 % of non-responders were still on GFD and reported symptom relief. CONCLUSION: Using strict criteria as recommended for IBS studies, about one third of patients with IBS-D or IBS-M are wheat sensitive, with a similar proportion in both IBS types. Expression of HLA-DQ2/8 is not useful as diagnostic marker for WS. Long-term adherence to a GFD is high and can sustain symptomatic improvement.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: There are conflicting data on the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on the nutritional status of celiac patients. In the present study, we evaluated, in adult celiac patients, the influence of a long-term, strictly GFD on their nutritional status and compared it with matched healthy volunteers. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Our study included 39 celiac patients and 39 healthy volunteers. The body mass index (BMI) of patients and controls was evaluated at enrollment, while the patients' BMI before the GFD was retrieved from clinical records. In addition, at enrollment, in both groups, we compared BMI, fat mass (FM), bone mineral density (BMD), as well as their dietary intake, recorded on a 7-day diary. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis, the majority of celiac patients (82.0%) had a normal BMI or were overweight, while 10.3% were malnourished. After the GFD, patients with a normal BMI showed a significant weight increase (P=0.002), but none of them switched in the overweight or obese category. Two (50%) of the four malnourished patients achieved a normal BMI. Controls and patients on a GFD had a similar BMI, FM, BMD and total calorie intake, but the amount of lipids and fiber intake was significantly different in the two groups (P=0.003 and P<0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that a GFD is able to improve the nutritional status of celiac patients without inducing overweight or obesity. Our findings are related to a celiac population adopting a GFD based on a Mediterranean-type diet.},

   abstract = {Gluten proteins are responsible for the viscoelastic properties of wheat flour but also for triggering pathologies in susceptible individuals, of which coeliac disease (CD) and noncoeliac gluten sensitivity may affect up to 8% of the population. The only effective treatment for affected persons is a strict gluten-free diet. Here, we report the effectiveness of seven plasmid combinations, encompassing RNAi fragments from alpha-, gamma-, omega-gliadins, and LMW glutenin subunits, for silencing the expression of different prolamin fractions. Silencing patterns of transgenic lines were analysed by gel electrophoresis, RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), whereas gluten immunogenicity was assayed by an anti-gliadin 33-mer monoclonal antibody (moAb). Plasmid combinations 1 and 2 downregulated only gamma- and alpha-gliadins, respectively. Four plasmid combinations were highly effective in the silencing of omega-gliadins and gamma-gliadins, and three of these also silenced alpha-gliadins. HMW glutenins were upregulated in all but one plasmid combination, while LMW glutenins were downregulated in three plasmid combinations. Total protein and starch contents were unaffected regardless of the plasmid combination used. Six plasmid combinations provided strong reduction in the gluten content as measured by moAb and for two combinations, this reduction was higher than 90% in comparison with the wild type. CD epitope analysis in peptides identified in LC-MS/MS showed that lines from three plasmid combinations were totally devoid of CD epitopes from the highly immunogenic alpha- and omega-gliadins. Our findings raise the prospect of breeding wheat species with low levels of harmful gluten, and of achieving the important goal of developing nontoxic wheat cultivars.},

The exams were all normal, and after detailed research on the interactions of this family, we reached the conclusion that the malnutrition was due to abuse by starvation. The children spent approximately two months in the hospital, receiving a high-protein and high-calorie diet, with significant nutritional recovery. COMMENTS: Abuse by starvation, although rare, should always be considered of as one of the causes of child malnutrition and pediatrician should be aware of the child's development, as well as the family interactions, to prevent more severe nutritional and emotional consequences in the future.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The only effective and safe treatment of celiac disease (CD) continues being strict exclusion of gluten for life, the so-called gluten-free diet (GFD). Although this treatment is highly successful, following strict GFD poses difficulties to patients in family, social and working contexts, deteriorating his/her quality of life. We aimed to review main characteristics of GFD with special emphasis on factors that may interfere with adherence to it. METHODS: We conducted a search of various databases, such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scielo, with focus on key words such as "gluten-free diet", "celiac disease", "gluten" and "gluten-free diet adherence". Available literature has not reached definitive conclusions on the exact amount of gluten that is harmless to celiac patients, although international agreements establish cutoff points for gluten-free products and advise the use of clinical assessment to tailor the diet according to individual needs. Following GFD must include eliminating gluten as ingredient as well as hidden component and potential cross contamination in foods. There are numerous grains to substitute wheat but composition of most gluten-free products tends to include only a small number of them, especially rice. The diet must be not only free of gluten but also healthy to avoid nutrient, vitamins and minerals deficiencies or excess. Overweight/obesity frequency has increased among celiac patients so weight gain deserves attention during follow up. Nutritional education by a trained nutritionist is of great relevance to achieve long-term satisfactory health status and good compliance. CONCLUSIONS: A balanced GFD should be based on a combination of naturally gluten-free foods and certified processed gluten-free products. How to measure and improve adherence to GFD is still controversial and deserves further study.},

Although CD primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract, patients may be asymptomatic or have extra intestinal symptoms. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we assessed the prevalence of CD in patients with epilepsy and the effect of a gluten-free diet on seizure control in these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with epilepsy in Imam Reza and Farabi Hospitals, Kermanshah, Iran, were studied. At first, the patients were screened by means of measuring the immunoglobulin A antiendomysial (IgA) antibodies. In the patients testing positive for IgA antibodies, 2-3 endoscopic small bowel biopsies were taken from the distal duodenum to confirm CD changes. People with CD received a gluten-free diet for 5 months and their seizure activity was recorded. RESULTS: During the study period, we studied 113 patients with epilepsy. Seven patients (6%) were diagnosed with CD. After 5 months of instituting a gluten-free diet, in 6 patients seizures were completely under control and antiepileptic drugs were discontinued. In one case, anticonvulsant drugs were reduced by half and seizures were controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that about 6% of epileptic patients were positive for CD. Institution of a glutenfree diet is useful for seizure control in these patients.},

The addition of the CGTase enzyme increased the specific volume and improved the texture of the breads. In the sensory analyses, the best score given by non-celiacs was for bread with pinion and rice flours and CGTase from B. firmus strain 37, while celiacs awarded the best score to the bread with rice flour only and same enzyme.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Severe sprue-like enteropathy associated with olmesartan has been reported, but there has been no demonstration of an increased risk by epidemiological studies. AIM: To assess, in a nationwide patient cohort, the risk of hospitalisation for intestinal malabsorption associated with olmesartan compared with other angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and ACE inhibitors (ACEIs). DESIGN: From the French National Health Insurance claim database, all adult patients initiating ARB or ACEI between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2012 with no prior hospitalisation for intestinal malabsorption, no serology testing for coeliac disease and no prescription for a gluten-free diet product were included. Incidence of hospitalisation with a discharge diagnosis of intestinal malabsorption was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: 4 546 680 patients (9 010 303 person-years) were included, and 218 events observed. Compared with ACEI, the adjusted rate ratio of hospitalisation with a discharge diagnosis of intestinal malabsorption was 2.49 (95% CI 1.73 to 3.57, p<0.0001) in olmesartan users. This adjusted rate ratio was 0.76 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.49, p=0.43) for treatment duration shorter than 1 year, 3.66 (95% CI 1.84 to 7.29, p<0.001) between 1 and 2 years and 10.65 (95% CI 5.05 to 22.46, p<0.0001) beyond 2 years of exposure. Median length of hospital stay for intestinal malabsorption was longer in the olmesartan group than in the other groups (p=0.02). Compared with ACEI, the adjusted rate ratio of hospitalisation for coeliac disease was 4.39 (95% CI 2.77 to 6.96, p<0.0001) in olmesartan users and increased with treatment duration. CONCLUSIONS: Olmesartan is associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation for intestinal malabsorption and coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder induced by dietary gluten intake by individuals who are genetically sensitive. Many studies report an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases in such patients. The aim of this study is to assess aortic elasticity properties in patients with CD that may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighty-one patients diagnosed with CD by antibody test and biopsy and 63 healthy volunteers were included in this prospective study. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examinations were performed. RESULTS: The CD group did not have any differences in the conventional echocardiographic parameters compared to the healthy individuals. However, patients in the CD group had an increased aortic stiffness beta index (4.3+/-2.3 vs. 3.6+/-1.6, p=0.010), increased pressure strain elastic modulus (33.6+/-17.0 kPa vs. 28.5+/-16.7 kPa, p=0.037), decreased aortic distensibility (7.0+/-3.0x10(-6) cm(2)/dyn vs. 8.2+/-3.6x10(-6) cm(2)/dyn, p=0.037), and similar aortic strain (17.9+/-7.7 vs. 16.0+/-5.5, p=0.070) compared to the control group. Patients with CD were found to have an elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio compared to the control group (2.54+/-0.63 vs. 2.24+/-0.63, p=0.012). However, gluten-free diet and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were not found to be associated with aortic elasticity. CONCLUSION: Patients with CD had increased aortic stiffness and decreased aortic distensibility. Gluten-free diet enabled the patients with CD to have a reduction in the inflammatory parameters whereas the absence of a significant difference in the elastic properties of the aorta may suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease persists in this patient group despite a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active search of celiac disease (CD) among risk groups has significantly increased the scope of known clinical variants. AIM: To measure the frequency and clinical characteristics of CD among first degree relatives (FDR) of known celiac cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 2012-August 2013, 37 patients with celiac disease brought 113 FDR for assessment. Their clinical data was recorded and a blood sample was obtained to measure serum Immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels, anti-transglutaminase (tTG) and anti-endomisial (EMA) antibodies. Cases with positive serology were advised to have an intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: Fourteen relatives (12.4%) had positive serological results and none had IgA deficiency. Among IgA-tTG (-) cases, measurement of IgA/IgG-tTG identified an additional case. Two of the 14 relatives were EMA positive. All 14 cases were advised to have an intestinal biopsy, but only 6 accepted the procedure. In two, the intestinal lesion was classified Marsh >/= 2 and active CD was diagnosed. Histology in the remaining four was Marsh 0/1 and were diagnosed potential CD, remaining under control, without gluten free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Serological prevalence of CD among first degree relatives of known celiac cases was 15 fold greater than in THE general Chilean population, strongly supporting the idea of implementing active search to customary clinical practice. Determination of IgA/IgG-tTG may be useful to improve the yield of active search. Intestinal biopsies were crucial to differentiate active classic CD from potential CD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: An imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic excitability was observed in de novo patients with celiac disease (CD) in a previous study with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), suggesting a subclinical involvement of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in asymptomatic patients. The aim of this investigation was to monitor the eventual changes in the same cohort of patients, evaluated after a period of gluten-free diet. METHODS: Patients were re-evaluated after a median period of 16 months during which an adequate gluten-free diet was maintained. Clinical, cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessment was repeated, as well as cortical excitability by means of single- and paired-pulse TMS from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the dominant hand. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, patients showed a significant decrease of the median resting motor threshold (from 35% to 33%, p<0.01). The other single-pulse (cortical silent period, motor evoked potentials latency and amplitude, central motor conduction time) and paired-pulse TMS measures (intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation) did not change significantly after the follow-up period. Antibodies were still present in 7 subjects. DISCUSSION: In patients under a gluten-free diet, a global increase of cortical excitability was observed, suggesting a glutamate-mediated functional reorganization compensating for disease progression. We hypothesize that glutamate receptor activation, probably triggered by CD-related immune system dysregulation, might result in a long-lasting motor cortex hyperexcitability with increased excitatory post-synaptic potentials, probably related to phenomena of long-term plasticity. The impact of the gluten-free diet on subclinical neurological abnormalities needs to be further explored.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the consequences of the last European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (BSPGHAN) guidelines for the diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) by means of a prospective study. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Institute for Maternal and Child Health IRCCS Burlo Garofolo (Trieste, Italy). PATIENTS: Children diagnosed with CD without a duodenal biopsy (group 1), following the last ESPGHAN and BSPGHAN guidelines, and children diagnosed with a duodenal biopsy, matched for sex, age and year of diagnosis (group 2), were prospectively enrolled over a 3-year period. All patients were put on a gluten-free diet (GFD) and were followed up for clinical conditions and laboratory testing at 6 months every year since diagnosis (median follow up: 1.9 years). OUTCOME MEASURES: Resolution of symptoms, body mass index, laboratory testing (haemoglobin, anti-transglutaminase IgA), adherence to a GFD, quality of life, and supplementary post-diagnosis medical consultations. RESULTS: 51 out of 468 (11%) patients were diagnosed without a duodenal biopsy (group 1; median age 2.1 years) and matched to 92 patients diagnosed with a biopsy (group 2; median age 2.4 years). At the end of follow-up the two groups were statistically comparable in terms of clinical and nutritional status, anti-transglutaminase IgA antibody titres, quality of life, adherence to a GFD, and number of supplementary medical consultations. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this prospective study, diagnosis of CD can be reliably performed without a duodenal biopsy in approximately 11% of cases. At least during a medium-term follow-up, this approach has no negative consequences relating to clinical remission, adherence to diet, and quality of life of children with CD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The beneficial effects of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) mixture (cis9, trans11, c9; trans10, cis12, t10) against gliadin-induced toxicity in HLA-DQ8-transgenic mice (DQ8) have been associated with improved duodenal cytoprotective mechanisms [nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2, Nrf2; acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH)/proteasome]. The present study was aimed at investigating the ability of individual CLA isomers to improve the efficacy of these defensive mechanisms and to protect against duodenal injury caused by the combined administration of gliadin and indomethacin (GI). METHODS: Gluten-mediated enteropathy was induced in DQ8 mice by three intra-gastric administration of gliadin (20 mg kg(-1)/bw) and indomethacin (15 mg L(-1)) in drinking water for 10 days (GI). C9 or t10 CLA (520 mg kg(-1)/bw/day) were orally administered for 2 weeks. Pro-oxidant and toxic effects associated with GI treatment, anti-oxidant/detoxifying ability of c9 or t10-CLA and the protective effect induced by c9 pre-treatment (c9 + GI) were evaluated in DQ8 mice duodenum by combining enzymatic, immunoblotting, histological evaluation and quantitative real-time PCR assays. RESULTS: GI treatment produces the time-dependent decline of the considered detoxifying mechanisms thus leading to pro-apoptotic and pro-oxidant effects. APEH/proteasome pathway was not markedly affected by individual CLA isomers, but duodenal redox status and activity/mRNA levels of Nrf2-activated enzymes were significantly improved by c9 administration. c9 pre-treatment protects against GI-mediated accumulation of oxidative stress markers, and histological examination reveals the increase of goblet cells number in mouse duodenum but induces only a partial recovery of APEH/proteasome activity. CONCLUSIONS: The activation of and adaptive response by low doses of c9 supplementation prevents distinct signs of gliadin-induced enteropathy in DQ8 mice.},

   abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare disorder of unknown cause characterised by haemoptysis, diffuse alveolar infiltrates and iron-deficiency anaemia. IPH predominantly affects children; it is rare in adults, in whom it usually manifests before 30 years. In adults, course is protracted with a better prognosis, in contrast to children. Even rarer is the Lane-Hamilton syndrome, a condition in which IPH is associated with celiac disease. Only 15 cases of Lane-Hamilton syndrome affecting adults are reported in literature. Treatment of IPH is based on anecdotal case reports and case series because of its rare occurrence. High-dose steroids reportedly reduce morbidity and mortality and delays or stops disease progression; more effectively in adults than children. In Lane-Hamilton syndrome, a gluten-free diet for the celiac disease in addition to steroids for IPH, is the mainstay of therapy. The optimal treatment duration of steroid therapy is not known but anecdotally a more prolonged course results in improved outcome. We report a case of a young woman who presented with exertional dyspnoea, intermittent haemoptysis, severe anaemia and lung infiltrates but no gastrointestinal complaints. After extensive work-up, she was diagnosed with Lane-Hamilton syndrome based on a diagnosis of IPH made from lung biopsy and concomitant celiac disease because of positive anti-gliadin antibody and endomyosial antibody and jejunal biopsy. She was treated with sustained low-dose steroid therapy for a year and a gluten-free diet with resolution of her symptoms, anaemia and lung infiltrates. At 4 years of follow-up, she remains stable, without recurrence.},

AIMS: To investigate the impact of the gluten-free diet on the psycho-physical well-being of celiac children. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we interviewed 76 celiac and 143 non-celiac children (2-18 years) by using a non-disease specific questionnaire (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Test) and we explored the impact of the diet on social life with an open-ended questionnaire. Scores were compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. A quantile regression analysis was used to evaluate the impact of celiac disease on score distribution. RESULTS: No significant differences in quality of life were found between the two groups (total score: 84.1 (81.1-87.2) vs 81.5 (79.7-83.4), median (95% CI), patients and controls respectively, p=0.4). Treatment positively affected quality of life in children that showed "intermediate" scores in the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Test. Lowest scores were observed in children reporting a higher number of diet difficulties or co-morbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Although celiac patients showed an overall good quality of life in comparison with a control group, by using appropriate analytical methods we elicited specific factors contributing to a lower quality of life in patients, such as co-morbidities and difficulties with the diet.},

While coeliac disease is well-established, much remains unknown about whether gluten can be a trigger of gastrointestinal and/or extra-intestinal symptoms in patients without coeliac disease. In this article, we discuss the latest scientific evidence and our current understanding for the possible mechanisms of this largely ambiguous group, termed 'non-coeliac gluten sensitive' (NCGS). We can conclude that NCGS should be regarded as an independent disease outside of coeliac disease and wheat allergy, and that the number of patients affected is likely to be limited. Many questions remain unanswered and it needs to be verified whether the elimination of dietary gluten alone is sufficient for the control of symptoms, and to understand the overlap with other components of wheat.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Law 123/2005 recognizes celiac disease as a social disease and so Ministry of Public Health annually allocates specific resources to Regions for managing gluten-free meals in school canteens. Therefore in 2009 Piedmont Region approved a specific project, in collaboration with Food Hygiene and Nutrition Department (SIAN) of several ASL (Local Health Authority), including ASL TO3 as regional leader, and the "Italian Celiac Association - Piedmont and Valle d'Aosta". This project was intended to facilitate the natural integration of celiac people in social life. A retrospective analysis of data has been carried out to assess the management of gluten- free meal of school food services in Piedmont Region in 2010. Furthermore the intervention efficacy has been evaluated comparing the critical points observed in 2010 and 2012. METHODS: The object of the study includes primary and secondary schools that have provided gluten-free food service in Piedmont Region. These school were examined by SIAN staff. (the examination included the check of hygienic aspects and qualitative assessment of the meal). The data were collected using the same checklist throughout the region. All data were included in the unified regional system ("Reteunitaria"). RESULTS: The results show that 29% of the sampled schools (277) are acceptable in all eight sections (supply, storage, process analysis, equipment check, packaging and transport, distribution of meals, self-control plan and qualitative assessment), whereas 71% are inadequate for at least one of the profiles (60% does not perform the qualitative valuation of service) and in 18% of schools three to seven insufficiencies are observed. Correlations between the number of total insufficiencies and the most critical sections of the check list were performed (with lower scores in "good") such as process analysis, distribution of meals, self-control plan and qualitative assessment. The analysis process has achieved a high score in the field of deficiency for at least 3 parameters. Schools with a good self-control plan have a significant correlation with schools suitable for the analysis process, instead schools appeared insufficient in the process analysis have an increased chance of being insufficient also in the distribution of meals. The schools that provide a transported meal (municipalities highly populated, generally) have many differences in distribution of meals respect schools that prepare food in the school kitchen. In fact, 88% of school that provide a transported meal achieved an appropriate score in distribution of meals section and collected fewer failures in overall assessment than the others. 120 structures are included in the indirect comparison between the checklist's sections with criticisms, during years 2010 and 2012: in 2010 32% of schools were recorded acceptable in all of the eight sections of the checklist and in 2012 this percentage rose to 54%. An improvement can be observed in all areas, but a statistical significant result do not turn out. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Data show that carry on the control activities of production of gluten free meal in school canteens would be appropriate. Actions focused on improving the methods of preparing meal without gluten were recommended, especially in under populated municipalities with school kitchen on site. The constant presence of ASL staff in school has promoted important changes: cultural change and about the management of allergy and food intolerance. An improvement can be observed: a transition from a suspicion about "special diet" management to an appropriate and responsible management of meals for children and young people suffering from this specific condition.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation localized to the small bowel, but less is known about systemic signs of inflammation. The aim was to measure cytokines of the T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) cell patterns in children with screening-detected coeliac disease before and after treatment with a gluten-free diet. Serum samples selected before and after the start of a gluten-free diet from 26 3-year-old children diagnosed with biopsy-proven coeliac disease and from 52 matched controls were assayed in an multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the 10 cytokines: interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Among Th1 cytokines, IFN-gamma and IL-12p70 were elevated significantly in children with coeliac disease compared to controls (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). Similar findings were demonstrated for the Th2 cytokines IL-5 (P < 0.001), IL-10 (P = 0.001) and IL-13 (P = 0.002). No difference in cytokine levels between the two groups was found for TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-8. After gluten-free diet, levels of IL-5, IL-12 and IL-10 decreased significantly (P < 0.001, P = 0.002 and P = 0.007) and IFN-gamma levels were reduced (P = 0.059). Young children with coeliac disease detected by screening demonstrate elevated levels of serum cytokines at time of diagnosis. A prolonged systemic inflammation may, in turn, contribute to long-term complications known to be associated with untreated coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate the potential association between mild duodenal damage and microscopic colitis (MC). METHODS: We retrospectively included 105 consecutive patients with type I Marsh-Oberhuber duodenal damage and negativity for immunoglobulin A anti-endomysium and anti-tissue transglutaminase. The following parameters were analyzed: Sex, age at execution of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, duodenal damage, and number of intraepithelial lymphocytes at biopsies, prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, age at execution of colonoscopy, macroscopic and microscopic features of colonoscopy, family history of gastrointestinal and autoimmune diseases, smoking habits, biochemical parameters of inflammation and autoimmunity, use of proton pump inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, adverse reactions to drugs or foods, pathologies known to be associated with celiac disease or MC, living on a gluten-free diet or on a gluten-low diet for at least 1 mo. RESULTS: Colonoscopy was performed in 59 patients, but only in 48 of them biopsies were taken in the entire colon. Considering the latter cohort, the diagnosis of MC was met in 25 (52.1%) patients while in 18 patients other pathologic findings were reported: 13 (27%) cases of nonspecific inflammatory bowel disease, 2 (4.2%) cases of Crohn's disease, 2 (4.2%) cases of eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and 1 (2.1%) case of autoimmune enteritis. Five (10.4%) patients had a normal colonoscopic result. Matching the groups by age, and considering only patients who underwent colonoscopy (42.7 +/- 15.5 years) vs those who did not undergo colonoscopy (36.9 +/- 10.6 years), a statistical difference was found (P = 0.039). Focusing on symptoms, diarrhea was statistically more prevalent in MC group than in patients who did not undergo colonoscopy (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Mild duodenal damage is associated with MC in more than half of the cases. This association supports the hypothesis of a link between these two entities.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dermatological manifestations associated with intestinal diseases are becoming more frequent, especially now when new clinical entities, such as Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS), are identified. The existence of this new entity is still debated. However, many patients with diagnosed NCGS that present intestinal manifestations have skin lesions that need appropriate characterization. METHODS: We involved 17 patients affected by NCGS with non-specific cutaneous manifestations who got much better after a gluten free diet. For a histopathological and immunopathological evaluation, two skin samples from each patient and their clinical data were collected. RESULTS: The median age of the 17 enrolled patients affected by NCGS was 36 years and 76% of them were females. On the extensor surfaces of upper and lower limbs in particular, they all presented very itchy dermatological manifestations morphologically similar to eczema, psoriasis or dermatitis herpetiformis. This similarity was also confirmed histologically, but the immunopathological analysis showed the prevalence of deposits of C3 along the dermo-epidermal junction with a microgranular/granular pattern (82%). CONCLUSIONS: The exact characterization of new clinical entities such as Cutaneous Gluten Sensitivity and NCGS is an important objective both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, since these are patients who actually benefit from a GFD (Gluten Free Diet) and who do not adopt it only for fashion.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the most commonly adopted special diet worldwide. It is an effective treatment for coeliac disease and is also often followed by individuals to alleviate gastrointestinal complaints. It is known there is an important link between diet and the gut microbiome, but it is largely unknown how a switch to a GFD affects the human gut microbiome. METHODS: We studied changes in the gut microbiomes of 21 healthy volunteers who followed a GFD for four weeks. We collected nine stool samples from each participant: one at baseline, four during the GFD period, and four when they returned to their habitual diet (HD), making a total of 189 samples. We determined microbiome profiles using 16S rRNA sequencing and then processed the samples for taxonomic and imputed functional composition. Additionally, in all 189 samples, six gut health-related biomarkers were measured. RESULTS: Inter-individual variation in the gut microbiota remained stable during this short-term GFD intervention. A number of taxon-specific differences were seen during the GFD: the most striking shift was seen for the family Veillonellaceae (class Clostridia), which was significantly reduced during the intervention (p = 2.81 x 10(-05)). Seven other taxa also showed significant changes; the majority of them are known to play a role in starch metabolism. We saw stronger differences in pathway activities: 21 predicted pathway activity scores showed significant association to the change in diet. We observed strong relations between the predicted activity of pathways and biomarker measurements. CONCLUSIONS: A GFD changes the gut microbiome composition and alters the activity of microbial pathways.},

Since a unique view on psychological consequences of a GFD still lacks, our aim was to assess the quality of life (QoL) and the depression state in symptomatic CD patients after GFD. Socio-demographic features were considered. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 210 adult CD patients were recruited and divided into 3 groups: 70 newly diagnosed patients (Group A),70 patients who have been on GFD for 6-12 months (Group B), and 70 patients who have been on GFD for more than 12 months (Group C). We recruited 210 healthy controls (Group D). Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaires were administered. Each group was evaluated according to age, gender and school ranking. RESULTS: Groups A and B showed lower PGWBI scores compared with both Group C and D (p <0.001 for each comparison). Moreover, Groups A and B showed higher BDI scores compared with both Group C and D (p <0.001 for each comparison).Women, the elderly and the poorly educated seemed to suffer more psychological stress. CONCLUSION: GFD induces an improvement of well-being and a decrease of depression state after 12 months of strict GFD. Negative psychological implications were observed only in specific risk categories. (Acta gastroenterol. belg., 2016, 79, 447-453).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten, and possible relationships between coeliac disease and dental pathogenic conditions during childhood have been poorly investigated. AIM: The dental pulp plays a pivotal role in the immune defence against possible entry of pathogens from teeth, and the aim of this work was to investigate quantitative transcription levels of selected genes (IL-9, IL-11, IL-15, IL-18, IL-21, IL-27, MICA, IFN-gamma) coding for pro-inflammatory immune innate activities in the pulp of primary teeth from healthy children and children with coeliac disease. DESIGN: The pulp from primary teeth of 10 healthy children and 10 children with coeliac disease was used to extract RNA and prepare cDNA for quantitative PCR transcription analysis employing commercial nucleotide probes for selected genes. RESULTS: In children with coeliac disease, the genes coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-11, IL-18, and IL-21 were significantly overexpressed, suggesting the possible importance of these cytokines in the relationships between coeliac disease and dental disorders. CONCLUSION: For the first time, we reported in dental pulp of children possible relationships between coeliac disease and modulation in transcription of cytokine-dependent inflammatory activities.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy that develops in genetically susceptible individuals following exposure to dietary gluten. Severe changes at the intestinal mucosa observed in untreated CD patients are linked to changes in the level and in the pattern of expression of different genes. Fully differentiated epithelial cells express two isoforms of fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs): intestinal and liver, IFABP and LFABP, respectively. These proteins bind and transport long chain fatty acids and also have other important biological roles in signaling pathways, particularly those related to PPARgamma and inflammatory processes. Herein, we analyze the serum levels of IFABP and characterize the expression of both FABPs at protein and mRNA level in small intestinal mucosa in severe enteropathy and normal tissue. As a result, we observed higher levels of circulating IFABP in untreated CD patients compared with controls and patients on gluten-free diet. In duodenal mucosa a differential FABPs expression pattern was observed with a reduction in mRNA levels compared to controls explained by the epithelium loss in severe enteropathy. In conclusion, we report changes in FABPs' expression pattern in severe enteropathy. Consequently, there might be alterations in lipid metabolism and the inflammatory process in the small intestinal mucosa.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease frequently associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The prevalence of CD in patients with T1D varies from 3 to 6%. The clinical manifestation of CD in patients with T1D is classified as asymptomatic in about half of cases. Our study aims to determine the frequency of anti-tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (IgA-tTG) and anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) in patients with type 1 diabetes in order to early recommend jejunal biopsy and establish a gluten-free diet before the onset of clinical signs and complications of celiac disease. Subjects included in this study were patients with T1D and untreated CD who showed no signs of this disease. The detection of IgG tTG, IgG IgA and IgG AAG was performed using Luminex technology. We enrolled 31 patients. The study involved 16 men and 15 women. IgA AAG were positive in 4(13%) patients and IgG were positive in 7(22,5%) patients. IgA tTG were positive in 3(10%) patients and IgG was positive in one (3%) patient. In our study the association of diabetes type 1 with biomarkers of CD is not uncommon hence the importance of systematic screening for type 1 diabetes. The diagnosis of this atypical and silent CD form is important given the risk of serious complications such as malabsorption and gastrointestinal cancers.},

The participants were 3 children and 2 adolescents. The data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews between January and September 2012 at the participant's residence or at the diabetic outpatient clinic of the Hospital das Clinicas, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The content analysis technique was used to process the data. Results The key aspect of the illness experience of the patients was their diet, but with different meanings. The children had difficulty following the diet, while the adolescents reported that they had greater difficulty coping with the social and affective aspects of their diet. Conclusion The results reinforce the importance of nurses who seek strategies, together with the patients and their families, that help minimize the difficulties of these patients, especially with regard to managing the diet imposed by both diseases.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has gained attention as an emerging clinical entity. Data regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management of NCGS are scattered in view of the diagnostic uncertainty surrounding the disorder. We aim to provide a current perspective of NCGS and its associated controversies. RECENT FINDINGS: NCGS consists of a spectrum of intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, yet in the absence of coeliac disease or wheat allergy. To date, no specific biomarker exists for NCGS, thereby leaving the diagnosis to be confirmed by dietary elimination followed by double-blind placebo-controlled gluten-based rechallenges. Unfortunately, this technique is cumbersome, not readily-available in routine clinical practise, and can still leave the diagnosis of NCGS open to debate as to whether the effects demonstrated can be specifically attributed to the gluten-protein per se or rather coexisting nongluten components, such as fermentable carbohydrates and amylase-trypsin inhibitors. SUMMARY: Physicians are increasingly being posed with the dilemma of patients presenting with self-reported NCGS. However, this appears to be the tip of the iceberg and future studies are in need of delineating which gluten-based component is responsible for each individual patient's complaint.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Nonceliac gluten sensitivity is syndrome characterized by symptoms disappearing after a gluten-free diet. Its existence is still argument of discussion among specialists. Our aim was to evaluate the knowledge about nonceliac gluten sensitivity among gastroenterology specialists. METHODS: During October 2013 a questionnaire was sent through a medical newsletter to Italian gastroenterologists. Twelve questions investigated their knowledge on nonceliac gluten sensitivity, including their diagnostic and therapeutic approach. RESULTS: A total of 212 gastroenterologists filled in the questionnaire. The 98.6% were aware of the existence of a syndrome called "nonceliac gluten sensitivity" and 77% believe in its existence. However, only 56% gave a correct definition of the term. The majority of specialists diagnosed gluten sensitive patients and the number of diagnoses was not statistically different from that of celiac disease. Moreover, a gluten-free diet was prescribed by 64% of the specialists and among them the 73% noted an increase of gluten sensitive patients attending their outpatient services. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that most of the specialists recognize nonceliac gluten sensitivity and prescribe gluten-free diet, although 44% of the specialists are not able to give its correct definition; underlining the necessity of medical education on this topic is needed.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is the most common autoimmune enteropathy in Western countries, and is usually associated with a good response to the gluten free diet and an excellent prognosis. However, a minority of patients develop complications of the disease, such as refractory celiac disease, ulcerative jejunoileitis and neoplastic complications such as adenocarcinoma of the small bowel and enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma. Neoplastic complications described in association with celiac disease have a high mortality rate, due to their aggressive behavior and to the usual advanced stage at the time of diagnosis. In recent years, the detection of small bowel lesions has dramatically improved thank to the availability of highly performing radiologic and endoscopic techniques. The diagnostic delay of malignant complications in patients with celiac disease may be improved by establishing a pragmatic flowchart for the identification and follow up of "at risk" patients. We performed a comprehensive review of the articles published on this issue in order to promote a roadmap to be applied when facing with celiac patients with suspected small bowel complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: Medical research is looking for alternative drug-based options to the gluten-free diet (GFD) for celiac disease. We aimed at evaluating the need for alternative therapies perceived by celiac patients. METHODS: During the 2013 meeting of the Lombardy section of the Italian Celiac Patients Association, adult subjects were invited to fill in a questionnaire investigating their clinical profile in relation to compliance to the diet, quality of life (QOL) as well as their opinion on alternative therapies. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy two patients (76 m, mean age 41.7 +/- 13.9 years) completed the questionnaire. Patients reported a significant improvement in health status (HS) and QOL after the diet was started (p < 0.001). The GFD was accepted by 88% patients, but the need for alternative therapies was reported by 65%. Subjects expressing the need for a drug-based therapy showed a lower increase in QOL (p = 0.003) and HS (p = 0.005) on GFD. The preferred option for an alternative therapy was the use of enzymes (145 subjects), followed by a vaccine (111 subjects). CONCLUSION: The GFD is favorably accepted by most celiac patients. Nevertheless, a proportion of patients pronounce themselves in favor of the development of alternative drugs.},

   abstract = {Perhaps because gastroenterology, immunology, toxicology, and the nutrition and agricultural sciences are outside of their competence and responsibility, psychologists and psychiatrists typically fail to appreciate the impact that food can have on their patients' condition. Here we attempt to help correct this situation by reviewing, in non-technical, plain English, how cereal grains-the world's most abundant food source-can affect human behavior and mental health. We present the implications for the psychological sciences of the findings that, in all of us, bread (1) makes the gut more permeable and can thus encourage the migration of food particles to sites where they are not expected, prompting the immune system to attack both these particles and brain-relevant substances that resemble them, and (2) releases opioid-like compounds, capable of causing mental derangement if they make it to the brain. A grain-free diet, although difficult to maintain (especially for those that need it the most), could improve the mental health of many and be a complete cure for others.},

   abstract = {Among the adverse reactions caused by wheat, celiac disease (CD) is the longest studied and best-known pathology. The more recently defined non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) presents with symptoms which are often indistinguishable from CD. Diagnosis of CD is based on serologic, molecular, and bioptic testing. The IgA anti-transglutaminase (tTG) test is considered highly important, as it shows high sensitivity and specificity and its levels correlate to the degree of intestinal damage. Small bowel biopsy can be avoided in symptomatic patients with IgA anti-tTG levels above 10x the manufacturer's cut-off. Recently, tests of anti-deamidated peptides of gliadin (DGP) have replaced classic anti-native gliadin (AGA) tests. DGP assays have a considerably higher diagnostic accuracy than AGA assays, especially in the IgG class, and can replace anti-tTG tests in patients with selective IgA deficiency. The combination of IgG anti-DGP plus IgA anti-tTG assays show greater sensitivity than a single test, with very high specificity. EMA tests have great diagnostic accuracy but are not recommended by all the latest guidelines because they are observer dependent. Biopsy must still be considered the gold standard for CD diagnosis. HLA-DQ genotyping can be used to screen asymptomatic children and in cases of histology/serology disagreement. About half of NCGS patients are DQ2 positive and have IgG AGA. To diagnose NCGS, first CD and wheat allergy must be excluded; then the wheat dependence of symptoms must be verified by a gluten-free diet and subsequent gluten challenge.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease, and both adaptive and innate immunity are involved in its development. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine whether the markers of intestinal mucosal inflammation in CD can be detected in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs), and whether the immune properties of PBMs change as the clinical signs and symptoms of CD improve after the introduction of a gluten-free diet (GFD). The focus was on changes in mRNA expression of selected toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4, TLR7), stress cytokine prolactin (PRL), and proand anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-12, IL-10) in PBMs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 20 CD patients diagnosed according to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition criteria and Marsh criteria: 10 recently-diagnosed cases (rCD) and 10 on a GFD for a minimum of one year. The control group comprised 10 ageand sex-matched healthy volunteers. PBMs from peripheral blood specimens were separated using immunomagnetic CD14+ beads. Total RNA was isolated using a standard commercial kit. Cytokine and TLR mRNA levels were quantified by relative qPCR with PGK1 as a reference gene. RESULTS: Significantly higher expression of TLR4 and TLR7 mRNA was observed in PBMs from rCD patients compared to the healthy controls (1.63 times higher; p < 0.05). TLR7 mRNA levels in rCDs were also significantly elevated in comparison to the CD-GFD patients (2.11 times higher; p < 0.01). TNF-alpha mRNA expression tended to be higher in both groups of patients; by contrast, in IL-6 mRNA, a trend to a fourfold decrease was detected in PBMs from the CD-GFD subjects. IL-10, IL-12 and PRL levels did not differ among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the inflammatory process in rCD intestinal mucosa and submucosa reflecting enterocyte damage can be detected in PBMs in peripheral blood. Further, the cytokine and TLR expression profile in PBMs alters after one year of GFD treatment.},

RESULTS: The investigated wheat cultivars exposed to water stress accumulated significantly lower amounts (P < 0.05) of gliadins and glutenins in grains. The composition of proteins accumulated in grains was also modified. Water shortage results in a decreased share of alphabeta and gamma fractions in total gliadins. Grains of wheat cultivated under water stress contain significantly higher (P < 0.05) levels of omega-gliadins by 4.5% and 43.3% for Nawra and Tonacja cultivars, respectively. Water stress promotes an increase in the share of P and Q/E residues in gliadins. In protein samples R5 antibodies recognized increased amounts of gliadins matching the QQPFP sequence. Wheat proteins also reacted with IgE antibodies isolated from subjects allergic to gluten. CONCLUSION: Cultivation of wheat under conditions of water stress results in the qualitative and quantitative changes of gliadins by increasing their immunoreactivity.

Currently, the treatment is dietary withdrawal of gluten, but commercial gluten-free bread presents some undesirable properties. The objective of this study has been to assess the ability of the enzyme caricain (from papaya latex) to detoxify gliadin in whole wheat flour and develop bread suitable for coeliacs and gluten intolerant individuals. Ion exchange chromatography was used to enrich the caricain in papaya latex and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test kit was used for the analysis of gliadin residues in the baked bread. The partially purified enzyme was found to be more effective in reducing gliadin content than the crude papain and the resultant loaves had acceptable crumb and crust characteristics. Caricain appears to be capable of detoxifying gliadin and has the potential to mitigate the problems confronting coeliacs.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total 411 sera of 91 IgA competent children with biopsy proven celiac disease were analyzed at diagnosis and during follow-up on a GFD. Ninety-eight children with normal duodenal histology served as controls. The tests (TheBindingSite, Euroimmun, Phadia, part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, INOVA) for detection of TG2-IgA, DGP-IgG and DGP-IgA were used according to the manufacturers' instructions. RESULTS: Sensitivity to diagnose CD was high for TG2-IgA (100 %) and DGP-IgG (90 - 100 %), but lower for DGP-IgA (67 - 86 %). Specificity was high for all tests (97 - 100 %). The frequency of TG2-IgA titers > 10 x upper limit of normal at diagnosis ranged from 47 - 90 %. Under a GFD DGP-IgA became negative more rapidly than DGP-IgG and TG2-IgA. Non-adherence to GFD was best indicated by positive TG2-IgA. CONCLUSIONS: Combined testing for TG2-IgA and DGP-IgG does not increase the detection rate of CD in IgA competent children compared to TG2-IgA only. There are significant differences with respect to proportions of celiac children with titers > 10 x ULN between the manufacturers. This calls for harmonization of tests. TG2-IgA showed the highest titer rise with non-adherence to the GFD, independent of the manufacturer.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Celiac disease is a hypersensitivity enteropathy that can have various presentations in adults. Rarely, patients can present with severe lab abnormalities, dehydration and weight loss caused by celiac disease - a celiac crisis. CASE REPORT A 46-year-old male with a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus, type 2 (DM2) and recently treated Bell's Palsy presented to the emergency room complaining of weakness, diarrhea and lightheadedness. On presentation, the patient had a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 60 mm Hg and a lactic acidosis with pH of 7.28. Infectious etiologies of diarrhea were ruled out. The patient had an EGD which showed erythema of the duodenal bulb. Serum anti-gliadin and anti-TTG IgA were both elevated suggesting Celiac disease. Biopsies showed histopathology consistent with celiac disease. The patient's diarrhea resolved after initiation of a gluten free diet. He gained 25 kilograms after discharge and did not require further hospitalizations for diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS Celiac crisis is a very rare presentation of celiac disease in adults but nonetheless should be considered in patients with marked metabolic derangements in the setting of osmotic diarrhea. Treatment consists of a gluten free diet and may require management with steroids and total parenteral nutrition (TPN).},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an intestinal disease which shows different symptoms and clinical manifestations among pediatric and adult patients. These variations could be imputable to age-related changes in gut architecture and intestinal immune system, which could be characterized by gene expression differences possibly regulated by miRNAs. We analyzed a panel of miRNAs and their target genes in duodenal biopsies of Marsh 3AB and 3C pediatric celiac patients, compared to controls. Moreover, to assess variation of expression in plasma samples, we evaluated circulating miRNA levels in controls and patients at diagnosis or on gluten-free diet. We detected a decreased miR-192-5p expression in celiac patients, but no variations in NOD2 and CXCL2, targets previously identified in adults. Conversely, we detected a significant increase in mRNA and protein levels of another target, MAD2L1, protein related to cell cycle control. miR-31-5p and miR-338-3p were down-regulated and their respective targets, FOXP3 and RUNX1, involved in Treg function, resulted up-regulated in celiac patients. Finally, we detected, in celiac patients, an increased expression of miR-21-5p, possibly caused by a regulatory loop with its putative target STAT3, which showed an increased activation in Marsh 3C patients. The analysis of plasma revealed a trend similar to that observed in biopsies, but in presence of gluten-free diet we could not detect circulating miRNAs values comparable to controls. miRNAs and their gene targets showed an altered expression in duodenal mucosa and plasma of celiac disease pediatric patients, and these alterations could be different from adult ones.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease (CD) is a lifelong condition requiring strict adherence to a gluten-free (GF) diet and good availability of GF foods is critical to this. Patients with CD from lower socioeconomic groups are recognised to have higher treatment burden and higher food costs may impact this. Therefore, we aimed to assess the availability and cost of GF food in supermarkets and via the internet. DESIGN: Supermarkets and internet shops delivering to homes in a single city (UK) were analysed between February and March 2014. Stores were identified with comprehensive internet searches. Ten commonly purchased items were analysed for cost and compared with standard non-GF alternatives. Direct measurement of the number of GF foods available was compared between stores which were categorised according to previously published work. SETTING: Supermarkets covering the whole of Sheffield, UK. RESULTS: None of the budget supermarkets surveyed stocked any GF foods. Quality and regular supermarkets stocked the greatest range, each stocking a median of 22 (IQR 39) items (p<0.0001). All GF foods were at least four times more expensive than non-GF alternatives (p<0.0001). GF products are prevalent online, but 5/10 of the surveyed products were significantly more expensive than equivalents in supermarkets. CONCLUSIONS: There is good availability of GF food in regular and quality supermarkets as well as online, but it remains significantly more expensive. Budget supermarkets which tend to be frequented by patients from lower socioeconomic classes stocked no GF foods. This poor availability and added cost is likely to impact on adherence in deprived groups.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gluten-free diet is the keystone of coeliac disease treatment. Despite adherence, some patients continue to suffer from symptoms that negatively influence health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Therefore we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of gluten-free diet on HRQoL in coeliac disease. We specifically sought for determinants that negatively influenced HRQoL. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library for studies assessing HRQoL in untreated or treated adults using validated HRQoL-questionnaires from 1960 to September 2015, comparing HRQoL: (1) before and after gluten-free diet initiation or (2) in patients and non-coeliac controls. RESULTS: We included eighteen studies and sixteen were suitable for meta-analysis. Gluten-free diet significantly improves HRQoL, for psychological general well-being (PGWB)-Total (mean difference (MD) 7.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.96; 12.72]; p = 0.008), SF-36 Mental Component Score (MCS) (MD 7.37, 95% CI [1.84; 12.90]; p = 0.009) and SF-36 Physical Component Score (PCS) (MD 5.72, 95% CI [1.50; 9.95]; p = 0.008). Treated patients had similar HRQoL compared with controls for PGWB-Total (MD -0.72, 95% CI [-2.71; 1.27]; p = 0.48), but significantly lower levels for SF-36 MCS (MD -4.09, 95% CI [-6.17; -2.01]; p = 0.0001) and PCS (MD -4.57, 95% CI [-6.97; -2.17]; p = 0.0002). Symptom-detected gluten-free diet adhering patients have lower HRQoL compared with screening-detected patients (MD -3.73, 95% CI [-6.77;-0.69]; p = 0.02) Strict adhering patients have better HRQoL compared with non-strict adhering patients for SF-36 MCS (MD 7.70, 95% CI [4.61; 10.79]; p < 0.00001) and for SF-36 PCS (MD 3.23, 95% CI [1.33; 5.14]; p = 0.0009). CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-free diet significantly improves but does not normalize HRQoL in adults with coeliac disease. Dietary adherence improves HRQoL. Better (self-reported) dietary adherence results in higher HRQoL.},

   abstract = {Lactose intolerance is the most prevalent intestinal malabsorption disorder. After presentation of its history, the author describes the emergence of lactose intolerance during the evolution of species, and the biochemistry of lactose as well as features of human and bacterial lactase enzymes are then described. The unequal distribution of lactose intolerance in different continents and population is discussed, followed by presentation of past and present prevalence data in Hungary. Adult-type hypolactasia is caused by a polymorphism of the MCM6 gene located upstream from the lactase gene on the long arm of the chromosome 2. It can be determined with the polymerase chain reaction. The intestinal symptoms of lactose intolerance are well known, but its extra-intestinal manifestations are less recognised. Invasive diagnostic methods (determination of lactase activity from small intestinal biopsies, lactose tolerance test), are accurate, but have been replaced by the non-invasive methods; their gold standard is the H2 breath test. Genetic testing is being used more and more frequently in Hungary too, and, presumably, the methane breath test will be also available in the near future. Lactose intolerance can be accompanied by inflammatory bowel diseases, coeliac disease and irritable bowel syndrome; it could be established whether this association is causal or not in order to start a correct diet and therapy.},

   abstract = {Background. Celiac disease seems to be rare in Colombians, but there are currently no data about the prevalence rates of symptomatic adverse reactions to gluten or adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) in this population. Aim. to evaluate the self-reported prevalence rates of adverse reactions to gluten, adherence to GFD, and gluten-related disorders at population level in Colombia. Methods. A self-administered questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted in a population from Northwest Colombia. Results. The estimated prevalence rates were (95% CI) 7.9% (6.5-9.6) and 5.3% (4.1-6.7) for adverse and recurrent adverse reactions to wheat/gluten, respectively, adherence to GFD 5.9% (4.7-7.4), wheat allergy 0.74% (0.3-1.4), and nonceliac gluten sensitivity 4.5% (3.5-5.8). There were no self-reported cases of celiac disease. Prevalence of self-reported physician-diagnosis of gluten-related disorders was 0.41% (0.17-0.96). Most respondents reported adherence to GFD without a physician-diagnosis of gluten-related disorders (97.2%). The proportion of gluten avoiders was 17.2% (15.2-19.5). Most of them did not report recurrent adverse reactions to wheat/gluten (87.0%). Conclusions. Nonceliac gluten sensitivity is rarely formally diagnosed in Colombia, but this population has the highest prevalence rate of adherence to GFD reported to date. Consequently, most respondents were avoiding wheat- and/or gluten-based products for reasons other than health-related symptoms.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy resulting from exposure to gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Gluten proteins are partially digested by human proteases generating immunogenic peptides that cause inflammation in patients carrying HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 genes. Although intestinal dysbiosis has been associated with patients with CD, bacterial metabolism of gluten has not been studied in depth thus far. The aim of this study was to analyse the metabolic activity of intestinal bacteria associated with gluten intake in healthy individuals, CD patients and first-degree relatives of CD patients. Faecal samples belonging to twenty-two untreated CD patients, twenty treated CD patients, sixteen healthy volunteers on normal diet, eleven healthy volunteers on gluten-free diet (GFD), seventy-one relatives of CD patients on normal diet and sixty-nine relatives on GFD were tested for several proteolytic activities, cultivable bacteria involved in gluten metabolism, SCFA and the amount of gluten in faeces. We detected faecal peptidasic activity against the gluten-derived peptide 33-mer. CD patients showed differences in faecal glutenasic activity (FGA), faecal tryptic activity (FTA), SCFA and faecal gluten content with respect to healthy volunteers. Alterations in specific bacterial groups metabolising gluten such as Clostridium or Lactobacillus were reported in CD patients. Relatives showed similar parameters to CD patients (SCFA) and healthy volunteers (FTA and FGA). Our data support the fact that commensal microbial activity is an important factor in the metabolism of gluten proteins and that this activity is altered in CD patients.},

   abstract = {The aim of the paper is to show the various neurological and psychiatric symptoms in coeliac disease (CD). CD is a T cell-mediated, tissue-specific autoimmune disease which affects genetically susceptible individuals after dietary exposure to proline- and glutamine-rich proteins contained in certain cereal grains. Genetics, environmental factors and different immune systems, together with the presence of auto-antigens, are taken into account when identifying the pathogenesis of CD. CD pathogenesis is related to immune dysregulation, which involves the gastrointestinal system, and the extra-intestinal systems such as the nervous system, whose neurological symptoms are evidenced in CD patients. A gluten-free diet (GFD) could avoid cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, neuropathies, migraine and mild cognitive impairment. Furthermore, untreated CD patients have more symptoms and psychiatric co-morbidities than those treated with a GFD. Common psychiatric symptoms in untreated CD adult patients include depression, apathy, anxiety, and irritability and schizophrenia is also common in untreated CD. Several studies show improvement in psychiatric symptoms after the start of a GFD. The present review discusses the state of the art regarding neurological and psychiatric complications in CD and highlights the evidence supporting a role for GFD in reducing neurological and psychiatric complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: New therapeutics are moving into phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of coeliac disease, a condition with no established therapies other than gluten-free diet. These trials will require a meaningful, validated and fit for purpose patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) to quantify the symptomatic improvement of patients. AIM: To evaluate existing PROMs for suitability in a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval trial for a coeliac disease therapeutic. METHOD: We performed a systematic search in five online databases (MedLine, EmBase, Web of Science, CENTRAL, CINAHL) for studies that enrolled patients with coeliac disease and used PROMs. Studies included in this review had to measure some PROM concept, be patient administered and based upon a previously validated instrument with published measurement properties. RESULTS: Our literature search identified 2706 unique records of which 199 ultimately qualified for abstraction. The majority of PROMs used in studies of coeliac disease was generic and did not measure numerous symptoms or concerns of interest to patients. Four PROMs were found to contain appropriate content for use in an FDA trial: the coeliac disease-specific modification of the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (CeD-GSRS), Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB), the Celiac Disease Symptom Diary (CDSD) and the Celiac Disease Patient Reported Outcome (CeD-PRO). The GSRS and PGWB are most often used together and are two of the most extensively used measures in coeliac disease. The CDSD and CeD-PRO were developed exclusively for trials in coeliac disease but have much less published information on their measurement properties. CONCLUSIONS: While we did not find PROMs that currently meet the stated expectations of the FDA for regulatory purposes, four PROMs (CeD-GSRS, PGWB, CDSD and CeD-PRO) appear to contain appropriate content and with modest additional validation work could meet scientific standards for valid and sensitive measures of disease and treatment outcome. Specifically, what is needed for these instruments is an understanding of how sensitive they are to real changes in-patient condition, how stable they are over a period of time when health status should not have changed (test-retest reliability) as well as how they correlate with other measures of patient functioning such as intestinal biopsy. All of these objectives could feasibly be accomplished over a short cohort study of patients with biopsy-defined coeliac disease undergoing gluten challenge.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a recently recognized disorder, characterized by the occurrence of symptoms following gluten ingestion. It is often self-diagnosed by the patient, but should be confirmed by the response to a gluten-free diet, followed by a gluten challenge. Celiac disease (CD) and wheat allergy (WA) must first be ruled out. AIMS: (1) to determine the frequency of visits performed for symptoms self-perceived as gluten-related; (2) to assess in this cohort, the proportion of patients satisfying the diagnostic criteria for NCGS. METHODS: A two-year prospective study including all consecutive patients complaining of gluten-related symptoms. NCGS was diagnosed on the basis of the disappearance of the symptoms within 6 months of a gluten-free diet, followed by their reappearance with the reintroduction of gluten in the diet for 1 month. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety two patients complaining of gluten-related symptoms were enrolled; 26 of these (6.63%) were affected by CD, 2 (0.51%) by WA and 27 were diagnosed with NCGS (6.88%). The remaining 337 patients (85.96%) did not experience any change of symptoms with a gluten-free diet. The PPV of the gluten-related symptom was found to be 7%. CONCLUSION: Eighty six percent of patients reporting gluten-related symptoms have neither NCGS, nor CD, nor WA. Self-perceived gluten-related symptoms are rarely indicative of the presence of NCGS.},

   abstract = {We describe the nutritional status of a cohort of celiac disease (CD) children at presentation and during follow-up on gluten-free diet (GFD). Two Italian centers (Rome and Bari) prospectively enrolled 445 biopsy-confirmed CD children, diagnosed between 2009 and 2013. Body Mass Index was used as a measure of nutritional status according to Italian growth charts of Cacciari. The overweight/obese subject was 7.8% at onset and did not significantly increase during follow-up (9.8% at final assessment). The prevalence of overweight/obesity was significantly higher among males than females. Furthermore, overweight/obesity children as compared with those with normal weight were significantly older and had significantly lower levels of tTG antibodies. This study shows that some CD children are obese/overweight at diagnosis; therefore, overweight/obesity can be considered a rare but a possible mode of CD presentation. Thus, CD diagnosis must be considered even in overweight/obese children where this diagnosis can be easily missed.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is an immuno-mediated small bowel disease characterized by chronic inflammation due to a permanent intolerance to gliadin. Several neurological complications have been described, including epilepsy, whose evolution might often improve by adopting gluten-free diet (GFD). We studied a population of adult patients affected by posterior drug-resistant epilepsy of unknown cause by performing an accurate screening for CD. In the selected patients presenting the association of epilepsy and CD, we characterized the related electro-clinical features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We consecutively identified 211 adult subjects affected by drug-resistant cryptogenic focal epilepsy with posterior seizures. All these patients underwent serological screening for CD. In 10 subjects positive serological tests allowed to perform a CD diagnosis (confirmed by duodenal biopsy). For each patient clinical and EEG data, neuroimaging studies, serological and histological findings were revised, as well as response to GFD, defined as an improvement in seizure outcome. RESULTS: A significant delay between diagnosis of epilepsy and CD was documented. Visual ictal manifestations were reported in half of subjects. In all cases, interictal EEG showed slow and epileptiform abnormalities over parietal-occipital and temporal regions; in three cases, FOS phenomenon was observed. Four patients had familiar history of CD and six cases showed clinical signs/symptoms of malabsorption. GFD led to a reduction of seizure frequency in half of patients. CONCLUSIONS: "Posterior" ictal semiology, peculiar EEG patterns and drug-resistance emerge as the most interesting characteristics. CD screening should be performed in epilepsy patients presenting such features.},

Our aim is to perform, as more as possible, a review about the most recent update on the topics in international literature. It is important to consider clinical neurological manifestations in celiac patients and to research these conditions also in the follow-up because they may start also one year after the start of gluten free diet (GFD) as peripheral neuropathy. The association with autism is analysed and possible new association with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are considered.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease (CrD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory condition of the gastro-intestinal tract. The prevalence of IBD in celiac patients has been reported as 5-10 times higher than in the general population. The possibility of the presence of CD in IBD should be considered in IBD patients with long-term iron deficiency anemia (IDA) not responsive to iron supplementation. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterized by intestinal and extra intestinal symptoms due to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in subject without CD and/or wheat allergy. Patients with Crohn's disease and SR-NCGS were more significantly affected by joint pains compared to UC patients (50% versus 11.1%). In Crohn's patients, a higher percentage of fatigue (50% versus 38.9%) and headache (27.3% versus 22.2%) was evident. For the association between NCGS and IBD new studies are warranted and, at this moment, a gluten free diet (GFD) may be useful more in CrD than in UC.},

Celiac disease should be researched in infertility, spontaneous and recurrent abortions, delayed menarche, amenorrhea, early menopause, and children with low birth-weight. Celiac disease is still little considered during the evaluation of infertility. Up to 50% of women with untreated CD refer an experience of miscarriage or an unfavorable outcome of pregnancy. Celiac patients taking a normal diet (with gluten) have a shorter reproductive period. Women with undiagnosed CD had a higher risk of small for gestation age infants very small for gestational age infants and pre-term birth when compared with women with noted CD.

   abstract = {The association between gluten related disorders and psychiatric diseases has been firmly demonstrated. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome diagnosed in patients responsive to gluten-free diet after ruling out celiac disease and wheat allergy. The pathogenesis of neuro-psychiatric disorders in NCGS is unclear. An association between gluten and schizophrenia was described for the first time in 1950 by Bender et al. In the 1950's, Dicke noted that gluten-free diet improved mood in celiac patients. In 1970, Goldberg et al., in a study of 80 celiac patients, found that 34% of them showed minor affective disorders. Bipolar disorder patients show an increase of blood anti gliadin deamidated antibodies (IgG). The effect of diet and nutrition on autistic spectrum disorders has been investigated in the last two decades, particularly focusing on the symptoms of hyperactivity and attention. Toxoplasma gondii and other neurotropic pathogens as Influenzavirus and Coronavirus may be associated with mood disorders, probably secondary to an increased intestinal permeability. Abnormalities of host-microbiota interactions or of gut-microbiota composition have been associated with central nervous system disorders, such as autism, anxiety, depression and the integrity of intestinal microbiota may be considered a potential therapeutic goal to treat these conditions.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) affects health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients suffering it. The exclusion of gluten from the diet (GFD) improves HRQOL, but involves difficulties in following the diet that could adversely affect HRQOL. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of adherence to the diet on HRQOL of adult CD patients. METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter study of CD patients treated with a GFD for longer than 1 year. Adherence to the GFD was measured using the Morisky scale, and health status using the specific CD-QOL questionnaire and the generic EuroQol-5D questionnaire. RESULTS: 366 patients from 7 hospitals were included: 71.5% of patients reported a perfect treatment adherence, 23.5% unintentional poor adherence and 5% intentional poor adherence. Good adherence to a GFD was related to a higher mean score onthe CD-QOL (75 vs. 68, respectively, p < 0.05) and EuroQol-5D (0.9 vs. 0.8, respectively, p < 0.05). Ease of adherence to a GFD was also related to a better HRQOL (total CD-QOL score of 82 vs. 67 in patients who consider the GFD difficult to follow, p < 0.05). Good symptom control was also related to a better HRQOL (total CD-QOL score of 78 vs. 67 in asymptomatic vs. symptomatic patients, p < 0.01). The worse scored dimension of CD-QOL was related to "inadequate treatment". CONCLUSIONS: In CD, good adherence to a GFD and adequate symptom control result in improved HRQOL. Many patients consider that the lack of therapeutic alternatives to diet worsens their quality of life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), elevated levels of antitissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody may spontaneously normalize, despite continued consumption of gluten. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of spontaneous normalization of anti-tTG levels and the existence of factors predictive for this outcome. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: All children referred from 2002 to 2012 were screened for celiac disease (CD) at diabetes onset and at specific intervals. In the presence of a high anti-tTG titer or clinical symptoms, children were offered endoscopy, and asymptomatic patients with a low anti-tTG titer were invited to a second serological test after 6 months of eating a gluten-containing diet. RESULTS: The study included 446 children. Of these, 65 (14.5%) became positive for celiac serology: 38 (58%) had a persistently elevated anti-tTG titer and 27 (41%) fluctuating anti-tTG titer; 18 (28%) became negative. The prevalence of positive CD autoimmunity and overt CD was 14.3% (95% CI 11-17) and 8.5% (95% CI 5-10), 15- and 8-times higher than the general pediatric population, respectively. Asymptomatic children older than 9.1 years at T1DM onset had the lowest risk to develop CD. CONCLUSIONS: Serum anti-tTG levels decreased spontaneously in 40% of children with T1DM and became negative in 20%, despite gluten consumption. This finding supports the hypothesis of a state of temporary positivity of celiac serology in children with diabetes. In absence of clinical symptoms or signs of CD, histological confirmation of the disease and the gluten-free diet should be postponed to avoid unnecessary procedures and reduce an additional psychological burden.},

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the quality of life of patients with celiac disease on a capital in Southern Brazil. METHODS: Patients older than 18 years were included, with confirmed celiac disease for at least 60 days in the period from June to October 2013. A validated questionnaire, with specific questions to assess the patient's quality of life celiac was applied. A total score ranged from 20 to 100 points; the higher the score, worse quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 103 questionnaires were evaluated, 96 (93.2%) female, with average score 56.6+/-12.35 (28 to 88 points). The comparison between the questionnaire scores and family income was not significant (P=0.139). Patients diagnosed less than 1 year have poorer quality of life than those with more than 10 years (P=0.063). Patients older than 60 years had better quality of life compared with the younger ones (P=0.04). CONCLUSION: There was no association between quality of life and factors such as family income, length of diet and age at diagnosis. Chronological age greater than 60 years has positively influenced the quality of life of celiac patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. In celiac disease, adaptive and innate immune activation results in intestinal damage and a wide range of clinical manifestations. In the past, celiac disease was thought to result in signs and symptoms solely related to the gastrointestinal tract. Now, more than half of the adult population presents with extra-intestinal manifestations that can also be expected to improve on a gluten-free diet. For this reason, it is recommended that physicians have a low threshold of suspicion for celiac disease. Current knowledge of the immune pathogenesis of this autoimmune disease has served as a catalyst for the development of novel diagnostic tools and therapeutics. Over the years, highly sensitive and specific serological assays, in addition to genetic markers, have been found to target specific steps in the cascade pathway of celiac disease. Also the advent of the gluten challenge has enabled experts to design diagnostic algorithms and monitor clinical responses in clinical trials. The gluten challenge has provided substantial benefit in the advance of novel therapeutics as an adjuvant treatment to the gluten free diet. Generally, a strict gluten-free diet is highly burdensome to patients and can be limited in its efficacy. Alternative therapies-including gluten modification, modulation of intestinal permeability and immune response-could be central to the future treatment of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Guidelines recommend routine screening of liver function tests (LFTs) in patients diagnosed with celiac disease (CD). However, little is known about the prevalence of liver disorders in CD outside of Europe. Our aims were to estimate the prevalence of LFT abnormalities in CD and to evaluate the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on LFTs. METHODS: Adult patients with biopsy-proven CD were identified from a prospectively maintained database and matched with healthy controls. LFT levels for women and men were defined as abnormal based on the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) criteria. Data on demographics, coexisting liver diseases, and laboratory work-ups including aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) values at the time of diagnosis and on a GFD were recorded. Subsequently, data from this cohort were compared with data from 7,789 individuals participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009-2010. Univariate logistic regression, Wilcoxon signed-ranks, Student's t-test, chi(2), and Fischer's exact test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In 463 CD patients with ALT or AST levels at the time of CD diagnosis, 40.6% had elevated LFTs compared with 24.2% of treated CD patients (P<0.001) and 16.6% of matched controls (P<0.001). Similarly, 36.7% of CD patients on the NHANES database had abnormal ALT values compared with 19.3% of non-celiac patients (P=0.03). Approximately, 78.6% of CD patients with elevated LFTs at diagnosis normalized LFTs on a GFD after a mean duration of 1.5+/-1.5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Forty percent of individuals will have elevated LFTs at CD diagnosis; however, the majority will normalize with standard CD therapy. LFTs should be checked in all patients with CD and coexisting liver disorder should be considered in patients whose LFTs have not improved within a year on a GFD.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records ofpatients with celiac disease who received a follow up examination at the Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic between June 2006 and June 2013 were retrospectively examined. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were included in the study. The mean age at diagnosis was 8.1 +/- 4.21 years and 59 patients (64.8%) were female. Thirty-two patients (35.2%) had hematologic signs at the time of diagnosis. Anemia (24.2%) was the most common hematologic sign, followed by thrombocytosis (16.5%) and leukopenia (4.4%). The tTG IgA titers were screened in 80 of the 91 patients during diagnosis. Follow-up examinations found that remission for anemia (P = 0.0 17), thrombocytosis (P = 0.039), and decreases in tTG IgA titers (P = 0.034) were more prominent in patients who had followed a strict gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: Approximately one-third of the celiac disease patients had hematologic manifestations at the time of diagnosis. Remission in hematologic signs and decrease in tTG IgA titers were more prominent in patients who had adhered to a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in subjects who are not affected by either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). The prevalence of NCGS is not clearly defined yet. Indirect evidence suggests that NCGS is slightly more common than CD, the latter affecting around 1% of the general population. NCGS has been mostly described in adults, particularly in females in the age group of 30-50 years; however, pediatric case series have also been reported. Since NCGS may be transient, gluten tolerance needs to be reassessed over time in patients with NCGS. NCGS is characterized by symptoms that usually occur soon after gluten ingestion, disappear with gluten withdrawal, and relapse following gluten challenge within hours/days. The 'classical' presentation of NCGS is a combination of irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, bowel habit abnormalities (either diarrhea or constipation), and systemic manifestations such as 'foggy mind', headache, fatigue, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, dermatitis (eczema or skin rash), depression, and anemia. In recent years, several studies explored the relationship between the ingestion of gluten-containing food and the appearance of neurological and psychiatric disorders/symptoms like ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, schizophrenia, autism, depression, anxiety, and hallucinations (so-called gluten psychosis). The diagnosis of NCGS should be considered in patients with persistent intestinal and/or extraintestinal complaints showing a normal result of the CD and WA serological markers on a gluten-containing diet, usually reporting worsening of symptoms after eating gluten-rich food. NCGS should not be an exclusion diagnosis only. Unfortunately, no biomarker is sensitive and specific enough for diagnostic purposes; therefore, the diagnosis of NCGS is currently based on establishing a clear-cut cause-effect relationship between the ingestion of gluten and the appearance of symptoms by a standardized double-blind, placebo-controlled gluten challenge.},

   abstract = {Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, in subjects that are not affected by either celiac disease or wheat allergy. Given the lack of a NCGS biomarker, there is the need for standardizing the procedure leading to the diagnosis confirmation. In this paper we report experts' recommendations on how the diagnostic protocol should be performed for the confirmation of NCGS. A full diagnostic procedure should assess the clinical response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) and measure the effect of a gluten challenge after a period of treatment with the GFD. The clinical evaluation is performed using a self-administered instrument incorporating a modified version of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. The patient identifies one to three main symptoms that are quantitatively assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale with a score ranging from 1 to 10. The double-blind placebo-controlled gluten challenge (8 g/day) includes a one-week challenge followed by a one-week washout of strict GFD and by the crossover to the second one-week challenge. The vehicle should contain cooked, homogeneously distributed gluten. At least a variation of 30% of one to three main symptoms between the gluten and the placebo challenge should be detected to discriminate a positive from a negative result. The guidelines provided in this paper will help the clinician to reach a firm and positive diagnosis of NCGS and facilitate the comparisons of different studies, if adopted internationally.},

Doctors are going to play a major role as they are being called on to adapt their practices to confront it. In particular, nutrition seems to be at the core of obesity in children. The ascending trend of this phenomenon in pediatric age, with inherent healthcare implications, was already reported in epidemiological studies of the mid '90s. Public health programs of primary prevention should be stimulated and recommended, with the aim of promoting diet and lifestyle changes in the general population. In addition, accurate anthropometric measurements should be performed for use by pediatricians, who should focus efforts on preventing obesity during infancy and childhood. Nutrition plays such a pivotal role that it may be considered a valuable treatment strategy for multiple pediatric conditions, including celiac disease, Crohn's disease, short bowel syndrome, galactosemia, congenital deficiency of urea cycle enzymes. In view of all this, it would be advisable that food science be given higher relevance in medical education.},

   abstract = {In Europe and the USA, the mean frequency of celiac disease (CD) in the general population is approximately 1%, with some regional differences, the reasons for which remain elusive. A similar disease prevalence has been found in other countries mostly populated by individuals of European origin, e.g. Australia and Argentina. In Western countries, a true rise in overall CD prevalence of CD has been documented. CD is a common disorder in North Africa, the Middle East and India; however, the diagnostic rate is low in these countries due to low availability of diagnostic facilities and poor disease awareness. The highest CD prevalence in the world (5.6%) has been described in an African population originally living in Western Sahara, the Saharawi, of Arab-Berber origin. The reasons for this high CD frequency are unclear but could be primarily related to recent dietary changes and genetic factors, given the high level of consanguinity of this population. Further studies are needed to quantify the incidence of the celiac condition in apparently 'celiac-free' areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa and the Far East. In many developing countries, the frequency of CD is likely to increase in the near future given the diffuse tendency to adopt Western, gluten-rich dietary patterns. As most cases currently escape diagnosis all over the world, an effort should be made to increase the awareness of CD polymorphism. A cost-effective case-finding policy and new strategies of mass CD screening could significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with untreated disease. The current high prevalence of CD is just the last link in a chain of events started about 10,000 years ago after wheat domestication and diffusion from the Middle East. We hypothesize different mechanisms to explain the so-called evolutionary celiac paradox of co-localization of gluten consumption and HLA CD-predisposing genotypes.},

METHODS: A total of 7305 sequential subjects of both sexes were screened, collecting clinical data through the FRAX questionnaire, and measuring heel bone stiffness by Quantitative Ultrasonography (QUS). The 10-year risk for hip and major osteoporotic fractures was calculated taking into account personal or family history of fragility fracture, smoking, alcohol abuse, rheumatoid arthritis, prolonged steroids assumption. Additional risk factors were evaluated, including early menopause, poor sunlight exposure, low dietary calcium intake, physical inactivity, number of pregnancies, months of lactation, tobacco cigarettes smoked per year, specific causes of secondary osteoporosis. Through a correlation study, the influence of each factor on the development of osteoporosis was analyzed. RESULTS: As many as 18 % of women suffer from osteoporosis, as defined by QUS T-score. The calculation of FRAX confirmed the weight of the already known risk factors. The correlation study revealed the significance of some additional factors, such as hyperthyroidism, nephrolithiasis, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, poor sun exposure, and oophorectomy before age 50. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of secondary osteoporosis in the Italian population clearly indicates the importance of additional risk factors not yet included in the FRAX algorithm, for which preventive measures should be considered. Screening campaigns may allow both early diagnosis and access to treatment.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Acquired copper deficiency represents a rare cause of progressive myelopathy presenting with sensory ataxia and spastic gait. The time interval from neurological symptoms onset to diagnosis of myelopathy ranges from 2 months to several years in almost all cases, mimicking the clinical course of subacute combined degeneration due to vitamin B12 deficiency. FINDINGS: A 60-year-old man, without any gastrointestinal symptoms, developed over the course of one week rapidly progressive gait imbalance, tingling and numbness in his feet and ascending lower limb weakness. Spine magnetic resonance imaging revealed hyperintensity involving cervical and dorsal posterior columns of spinal cord. Blood analysis revealed undetectable serum copper levels, low serum ceruloplasmin and positive serum Immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed revealing duodenal villous atrophy consistent with a malabsorption pattern. A gluten-free diet in association with intravenous then oral copper supplementation prompted sustained normalization of serum copper levels and progressive clinical improvement. CONCLUSION/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We report a rare case of myelopathy induced by copper deficiency secondary to undiagnosed celiac disease, peculiarly presenting with a subacute onset. This case expands the neurological presentation and clinical course of myelopathy due to acquired copper deficiency. We suggest investigation of copper deficiency in patients presenting with subacute or even acute sensory ataxia and spastic gait. Detection of hypocupremia in patients without a previous history of gastric surgery should lead to diagnostic testing for celiac disease even in the absence of any obvious gastrointestinal symptoms.},

   abstract = {Gut microbiota shapes the development of the mucosal immune system and may provide protection against immune-mediated diseases. Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition triggered by dietary gluten proteins, recently associated with gut microbiota alterations in cross-sectional studies comparing patients and controls. Whether or not these differences are causally related to the disease has yet to be elucidated, but evaluation of specific bacteria isolated from CD patients in experimental models suggests that they can promote an adverse response to dietary gluten, whereas other commensal bacteria can be protective. Genetic and environmental factors associated with increased CD risk have also been linked to shifts in the gut microbiota composition in infants early in life. Epigenetic mechanisms also seem to play an important role in modulating gut microbiota composition and function and, theoretically, could also influence CD risk. Here, we review the current knowledge on how host genetics, environmental factors, and epigenetic modifications could modulate gut microbiota functionality and how this may influence CD risk. Greater understanding of the role of this triad in CD onset and pathogenesis will be valuable in designing proof-of concept interventions in the gut ecosystem, with a view to improving CD management.},

   abstract = {It is widely recognized that the intestinal microbiota plays a role in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in numerous chronic conditions. Most studies report intestinal dysbiosis in celiac disease (CD) patients, untreated and treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD), compared to healthy controls. CD patients with gastrointestinal symptoms are also known to have a different microbiota compared to patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and controls, suggesting that the microbiota is involved in disease manifestation. Furthermore, a dysbiotic microbiota seems to be associated with persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in treated CD patients, suggesting its pathogenic implication in these particular cases. GFD per se influences gut microbiota composition, and thus constitutes an inevitable confounding factor in studies conducted in CD patients. To improve our understanding of whether intestinal dysbiosis is the cause or consequence of disease, prospective studies in healthy infants at family risk of CD are underway. These studies have revealed that the CD host genotype selects for the early colonizers of the infant's gut, which together with environmental factors (e.g., breast-feeding, antibiotics, etc.) could influence the development of oral tolerance to gluten. Indeed, some CD genes and/or their altered expression play a role in bacterial colonization and sensing. In turn, intestinal dysbiosis could promote an abnormal response to gluten or other environmental CD-promoting factors (e.g., infections) in predisposed individuals. Here, we review the current knowledge of host-microbe interactions and how host genetics/epigenetics and environmental factors shape gut microbiota and may influence disease risk. We also summarize the current knowledge about the potential mechanisms of action of the intestinal microbiota and specific components that affect CD pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {There are more than 50000 known edible plants in the world, yet two-thirds of global plant-derived food is provided by only three major cereals - maize (Zea mays), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa). The dominance of this triad, now considered truly global food commodities, has led to a decline in the number of crop species contributing to global food supplies. Our dependence on only a few crop species limits our capability to deal with challenges posed by the adverse effects of climate change and the consequences of dietary imbalance. Emerging evidence suggests that climate change will cause shifts in crop production and yield loss due to more unpredictable and hostile weather patterns. One solution to this problem is through the wider use of underutilised (also called orphan or minor) crops to diversify agricultural systems and food sources. In addition to being highly nutritious, underutilised crops are resilient in natural and agricultural conditions, making them a suitable surrogate to the major crops. One such crop is teff [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter], a warm-season annual cereal with the tiniest grain in the world. Native to Ethiopia and often the sustenance for local small farmers, teff thrives in both moisture-stressed and waterlogged soil conditions, making it a dependable staple within and beyond its current centre of origin. Today, teff is deemed a healthy wheat alternative in the West and is sought-after by health aficionados and those with coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity. The blooming market for healthy food is breathing new life into this underutilised crop, which has received relatively limited attention from mainstream research perhaps due to its 'orphan crop' status. This review presents the past, present and future of an ancient grain with a potential beyond its size.},

   abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 7% to 21% of the general population. It is a chronic condition that can substantially reduce quality of life and work productivity. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the existing evidence on epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of IBS and to provide practical treatment recommendations for generalists and specialists according to the best available evidence. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A search of Ovid (MEDLINE) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed for literature from 2000 to December 2014 for the terms pathophysiology, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, irritable bowel syndrome, and IBS. The range was expanded from 1946 to December 2014 for IBS, irritable bowel syndrome, diet, treatment, and therapy. FINDINGS: The database search yielded 1303 articles, of which 139 were selected for inclusion. IBS is not a single disease but rather a symptom cluster resulting from diverse pathologies. Factors important to the development of IBS include alterations in the gut microbiome, intestinal permeability, gut immune function, motility, visceral sensation, brain-gut interactions, and psychosocial status. The diagnosis of IBS relies on symptom-based criteria, exclusion of concerning features (symptom onset after age 50 years, unexplained weight loss, family history of selected organic gastrointestinal diseases, evidence of gastrointestinal blood loss, and unexplained iron-deficiency anemia), and the performance of selected tests (complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein or fecal calprotectin, serologic testing for celiac disease, and age-appropriate colorectal cancer screening) to exclude organic diseases that can mimic IBS. Determining the predominant symptom (IBS with diarrhea, IBS with constipation, or mixed IBS) plays an important role in selection of diagnostic tests and treatments. Various dietary, lifestyle, medical, and behavioral interventions have proven effective in randomized clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The diagnosis of IBS relies on the identification of characteristic symptoms and the exclusion of other organic diseases. Management of patients with IBS is optimized by an individualized, holistic approach that embraces dietary, lifestyle, medical, and behavioral interventions.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common digestive disorders caused by an abnormal immune reaction to gluten. So far there are no available therapies, the only solution is a strict gluten-free diet, which however could be very challenging as gluten can be hidden in many food products. Furthermore an additional problem is related to cross-contamination of nominal gluten-free foods with gluten-based ones during manufacturing. Here we propose a lab on chip platform as a powerful tool to help food manufacturers to evaluate the real amount of gluten in their products by an accurate in-situ control of the production chain and maybe to specify the real gluten content in packages labeling. Our portable gliadin-immunochips, based on an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy transduction method, were first calibrated and then validated for both liquid and solid food matrixes by analyzing different beers and flours. The high specificity of our assay was also demonstrated by performing control experiments on rice and potatoes flours containing prolamin-like proteins. We achieved limit of quantification of 0.5 ppm for gliadin that is 20 times lower than the worldwide limit established for gluten-free food while the method of analysis is faster and cheaper than currently employed ELISA-based methods. Moreover our results on food samples were validated through a mass spectrometry standard analysis.},

METHODS: Data collected from the charts incorporated patient demographics, laboratory results, past medical history, ophthalmic symptoms and dietary history. Outcome measures were (i) occurrence of VAD in our study population; (ii) presence of associated systemic effects and ocular manifestations in those diagnosed with VAD; and (iii) determination of whether children with VAD had an ophthalmology review. RESULTS: Fifty-two of the 146 children had VAD; their average age was 8.4 years (range 11 days to 18 years old). In this Australian cohort, the most common pre-existing medical conditions in those children whose vitamin A status was investigated were cystic fibrosis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, micronutrient deficiency and short gut syndrome. The most common medical conditions affecting children with measured VAD in this cohort include autism, coeliac disease and cystic fibrosis. A significant association was found between VAD and anaemia and serum iron levels. Of the 146 children, 28 had ophthalmology review, of whom 13 had VAD. The most common reason for ophthalmology review was retinopathy of prematurity; there was only one referral for review for xerophthalmia. There was one case of xerophthalmia referred due to microbial keratitis. CONCLUSION: Vitamin A deficiency and xerophthalmia do exist in children of developed country. The potential for xerophthalmia should be considered, and there should be a consideration of an ophthalmology review.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disorder caused by ingestion of gluten. When diagnosed, it should be treated with a lifelong, strict gluten-free diet. Early infant feeding practices have been suggested as a means of preventing CD. In the last few decades, observational data have suggested that breastfeeding, especially at the time of introducing gluten into the infant's diet, as well as the time and mode of gluten first being given to a child could prevent or delay the occurrence of CD. As a result, recommendations advised that it is prudent to avoid both early (<4 months) and late (>7 months) introduction of gluten, and to introduce gluten gradually while the infant is still being breastfed, as this may reduce the risk of celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and wheat allergy. Recently, the results of two large randomized trials have shown that breastfeeding in general, breastfeeding during gluten introduction, and early or delayed gluten introduction do not influence the total risk of CD in genetically predisposed individuals. Introducing gluten at 4 versus 6 months in very small amounts, or at 6 versus 12 months, resulted in similar rates of CD in these children. Thus, early feeding practices seem to have no impact on the risk of developing CD during childhood. In children without the genetic predisposition, the age and mode of gluten introduction do not influence the risk anyway.},

   abstract = {Because the Korean rice cake, Seolgitteok, is mainly prepared with rice flour containing no gluten-protein associated with celiac disease, it can be considered for inclusion in a gluten-free diet. However, Western consumers may be unlikely to enjoy the plain flavor and chewy texture of Seolgitteok. This study aimed to determine both sensory and nonsensory factors that might affect U.S. consumers' acceptability of Seolgitteok. A total of 119 U.S. consumers rated 5 Seolgitteok samples, differentiated by descriptive sensory analysis, with respect to hedonic impression and just-about-right aspects of sensory attributes. Nonsensory factors such as demographic profile, innovativeness, social representation, sensation-seeking, and personality traits were also assessed. Addition levels of brown rice flour (0% to 100%) and sugar (5% to 20%) not only enriched flavor, but also lessened chewiness of Seolgitteok, thereby increasing an overall hedonic impression. Moreover, consumer acceptability of Seolgitteok varied with respect to nonsensory factors. Seolgitteok was more appreciated by males, sensation seekers, and individuals constrained by social desirability than by other groups. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that U.S. consumers' acceptability of Seolgitteok varies not only by sensory attributes such as rice flavor, sweetness, and chewiness, but also by nonsensory factors such as gender, sensation-seeking characteristics, and personality traits.},

METHODS: This hospital based analytic, observational study was done at a tertiary care centre, from April 2013 through June 2014. Thirty six children (20 females) with untreated CD at diagnosis (Group A) and 36 age and sex matched children on gluten-free diet for at least one year (Group B) were studied. Serum measurements of biochemical bone health indices and BMD, assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry, were obtained. RESULTS: BMD Z-score was significantly low in newly diagnosed celiac patients. Patients on gluten free diet had higher BMD Z-score as compared to newly diagnosed patients (-2.02 vs. -0.65 respectively, p < 0.001). BMD Z-score was high in GI symptom patients as compared to non-GI symptom patients (-0.46+/-0.89 vs. - 0.88 = +/-0.94) in Group B. In female patients BMD Z-score was comparatively low as compared to male patients in both groups but difference was not significant. In Group A the mean serum calcium level was lower than the patients in Group B (8.72 + 0.73 vs. 9.34 + 0.65, p < 0.001). S. calcium levels were not correlated with bone mineral density (BMD) in both groups (P value >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CD are at risk for reduced BMD. Strict gluten-free diet significantly improves bone mineralization. Early diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease during childhood may protect CD patients from osteoporosis.},

We aimed to describe racial differences in the prevalence of CD and PWAG, and evaluate the trends of CD in the noninstitutionalized civilian adult population of the US between 1988 and 2012. METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 1988 to 1994, 1999 to 2004, and 2009 to 2012. Serum samples from the NHANES participants were tested for CD serology, which included IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG IgA) and, if findings were abnormal, for IgA endomysial antibodies. Information about adherence to a gluten-free diet was obtained by means of an interviewer-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: In NHANES 2009-2012, the adjusted prevalence of CD was significantly higher (P<0.0001) among non-Hispanic whites (1.0%) than among non-Hispanic blacks (0.2%) and Hispanics (0.3%), whereas the adjusted prevalence of PWAG was significantly higher (P=0.01) in blacks (1.2%) as compared with Hispanics (0.5%) and whites (0.7%). The seroprevalence of CD in adults aged 50 years and older increased from 0.17% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.33) in 1988-1994 to 0.44% (95% CI 0.24-0.81) in 2009-2012 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of CD increased between 1988 and 2012 and is significantly more common in whites. In addition, a higher proportion of individuals maintaining a gluten-free diet in the absence of a diagnosis of CD are blacks.},

RESULTS: In the US general population, the prevalence of CD did not change significantly from 0.7% (95% CI, 0.6%-0.8%) in 2009 to 2010 to 0.8% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.2%) in 2011 to 2012 to 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.0%) in 2013 to 2014. However, the prevalence of undiagnosed CD decreased from 0.6% in 2009 to 2010 to 0.3% in 2013 to 2014. In contrast, the prevalence of PWAG increased significantly from 0.5% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.9%) in 2009 to 2010 to 1.0% (95% CI, 0.6%-1.4%) in 2011 to 2012 to 1.7% (95% CI, 1.1%-2.4%) in 2013 to 2014 (P=.005 for trend). CONCLUSION: Although the overall prevalence of CD remained stable from 2009 to 2014, the proportion of individuals with CD that is hidden considerably decreased. Moreover, the proportion of individuals without CD but following a GFD increased markedly from 2009 to 2014. Long-term health consequences of a GFD warrant further investigation.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder that substantially affects patients' quality of life and is associated with a considerable drain of health-care resources and economic burden. But some IBS patients may have celiac disease that could be treated by gluten-free diet which will subsequently improve their quality of life. This study was done to see the prevalence of celiac disease among the IBS patients fulfilling Rome III criteria. The present cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Gastroenterology at BSMMU, Dhaka from July 2010 to September 2011. A total of 107 patients aged ranging between 16-60 years clinically labeled as IBS and fulfilled Rome III criteria were included as study sample. The test statistics used to analyze the data were descriptive statistics. The mean age of the patients was 31.5+/-10.3 years and male to female ratio was roughly 6:1. The mean duration of IBS was 32.0+/-2.1 months. All of the patients had abdominal discomfort or pain in the preceding 6 months and had a history of loose (mushy) or watery stool, 99.1% had pain or discomfort relieved with defaecation. The prevalence of diarrhoea was found in 78.5% and mixed 21.5% of the patients. About 5% of the patients had raised ESR and majority (86.9%) of the patients had normal level of hemoglobin. Ten (9%) of 107 patients were found positive for anti-t TG (IgA). These findings suggest that an around one-tenth of IBS especially diarrhoea predominant patients may have celiac disease who will respond to simple gluten-free diet thus minimizing the morbidity and mortality. So, all clinically diagnosed IBS patients especially diarrhoea predominant cases should be suggested for the screening for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an HLA-associated disorder characterized by a harmful T cell response to dietary gluten. It is not understood why most individuals who carry CD-associated HLA molecules, such as HLA-DQ2.5, do not develop CD despite continuous gluten exposure. In this study, we have used tetramers of HLA-DQ2.5 bound with immunodominant gluten epitopes to explore whether HLA-DQ2.5(+) healthy individuals mount a specific CD4(+) T cell response to gluten. We found that gluten tetramer-binding memory cells were rare in blood of healthy individuals. These cells showed lower tetramer-binding intensity and no signs of biased TCR usage compared with gluten tetramer-binding memory T cells from patients. After sorting and in vitro expansion, only 18% of the tetramer-binding memory cells from healthy subjects versus 79% in CD patients were gluten-reactive upon tetramer restaining. Further, T cell clones of tetramer-sorted memory cells of healthy individuals showed lower gluten-specific proliferative responses compared with those of CD patients, indicating that tetramer-binding memory cells in healthy control subjects may be cross-reactive T cells. In duodenal biopsy specimens of healthy control subjects, CD4(+) T cells were determined not to be gluten reactive. Finally, gluten tetramer-binding cells of healthy individuals did not coexpress regulatory T cell markers (Foxp3(+) CD25(+)) and cultured T cell clones did not express a cytokine profile that indicated immune-dampening properties. The results demonstrate that healthy HLA-DQ2.5(+) individuals do not mount a T cell response to immunodominant gluten epitopes of CD.},

Height, weight and body composition were measured. An analysis of energy consumption and of the macronutrient distribution of their diet was carried out. Their fulfillment of micronutrient intake recommendations was verified. Participants showed a Body Mass Index of 21.6 +/- 2.4 kg/m2. Energy Intake was slightly lower than the Dietary Reference Intakes. Excessive protein apart from over-consumption of fat was observed. More than three quarters of participants consumed meat in excess. Carbohydrate consumption along with that of fiber was below recommended levels. Vitamin D, iron, and iodine had a low percentage of recommendation compliance. In general, participants followed the recommendations of dairy products and fruit intake whereas vegetable consumption was not enough for the vast majority. We conclude that although the diet of celiac women does not differ much from the diet of general population, some considerations, such as reducing fat and protein consumption and increasing fiber intake, must be taken into account.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only available therapy for coeliac disease (CD). OBJECTIVES: We aim to review the literature on the GFD, the gluten content in naturally gluten-free (GF) and commercially available GF food, standards and legislation concerning the gluten content of foods, and the vitamins and mineral content of a GFD. METHODS: We carried out a PubMed search for the following terms: Gluten, GFD and food, education, vitamins, minerals, calcium, Codex wheat starch and oats. Relevant papers were reviewed and for each topic a consensus among the authors was obtained. CONCLUSION: Patients with CD should avoid gluten and maintain a balanced diet to ensure an adequate intake of nutrients, vitamins, fibre and calcium. A GFD improves symptoms in most patients with CD. The practicalities of this however, are difficult, as (i) many processed foods are contaminated with gluten, (ii) staple GF foods are not widely available, and (iii) the GF substitutes are often expensive. Furthermore, (iv) the restrictions of the diet may adversely affect social interactions and quality of life. The inclusion of oats and wheat starch in the diet remains controversial.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To improve diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease (CD), research efforts are being made in many different areas. However, the focus, trend, and direction of such efforts require clarity, so that future efforts and directions can be appropriately planned. METHOD: In this study, MEDLINE was used to search for trends in CD research. The keyword 'celiac disease' and its variants were searched in tandem with keywords commonly associated with CD. This search was done for each year from 1960 to 2013. Year of first instance of the associated keyword, linear regression coefficient, and trend in terms of the slope of the regression line were tabulated. For perspective, the same keywords were searched in tandem with 'inflammatory bowel disease' (IBD). RESULTS: CD appeared in the medical literature prior to 1960, and IBD first appeared in 1964. However, IBD overtook CD in terms of the number of research papers published per year, beginning in 1988. Keywords with strong positive trends (r(2)>0.7) in association with CD were: 'diagnosis', 'gluten', 'serology', 'autoimmune', 'treatment', 'gluten-free diet', 'endoscopy', 'villous atrophy', 'wasting', 'inflammation', and 'microbiome'. The keyword 'malabsorption' had the sole strong negative trend in association with CD. Keywords with strong positive trends (r(2)>0.7) in association with IBD also had strong positive association with CD: 'autoimmune', 'treatment, 'inflammation', and 'microbiome'. CONCLUSIONS: The MEDLINE search approach is helpful to show first instance, association, and trend of keywords that are affiliated with CD in published biomedical research, and to compare CD research trends with those of other diseases.},

   abstract = {Despite the growing understanding of its pathogenesis, the treatment of coeliac disease is still based on a lifelong gluten-free diet that, although efficacious, is troublesome for affected patients, and a definitive cure is still an unmet need. In this regard, the development of new chemical- and biological-derived agents has often resulted in unsatisfactory effects when tested in vivo, probably because of their ability to target only a single pathway, whilst the immunological cascade responsible for tissue injury is complex and redundant. The advent of cellular therapies, mainly based on the use of stem cells, is an emerging area of interest since it has the advantage of a multi-target strategy. Both haematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells have been employed in the treatment of refractory patients suffering from autoimmune diseases, with promising results. However, the lack of immunogenicity makes mesenchymal stem cells more suitable than their haematopoietic counterpart, since their transplantation may be performed in the absence of a myeloablative conditioning regimen. In addition, mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to harbour strong modulatory effects on almost all cells involved in immune response, together with a potent regenerative action. It is therefore conceivable that over the next few years their therapeutic use will increase as their biological interactions with injured tissues become clearer.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) and antibodies against gliadin (AGA) were measured in the sera from 56 OLP patients and 57 healthy controls, who also underwent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. The duodenal biopsy was performed in patients with positive serology, and a gluten-free diet was recommended if CD was confirmed. RESULTS: CD was diagnosed in eight OLP patients (14.29 %). Six OLP patients (10.71 %) were positive for immunoglobulin A (IgA) tTG. A statistically significant difference among the forms of oral lichen was observed for the IgA tTG (p = 0.03) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) tTG (p = 0.01). Higher frequencies of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 were found in OLP patients compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CD was higher in patients with OLP than in the control group. Therefore, increased efforts aimed at the early detection and dietary treatment of CD, among antibody-positive OLP patients, are advisable. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our study confirmed the increased frequency of CD among OLP patients. CD screening should be considered in OLP patients, since untreated CD can present many complications and reduce a patient's quality of life.},

In particular, ZEN was the most detected mycotoxin among all the studied subjects with a total of 19 positive cases. Results did not show a statistically significant difference in mycotoxin exposure between the two groups, and the presence of specific mycotoxins was not related to the intake of any particular food category. Our findings suggest little urgency of specific regulation for gluten free products, although the prevalence of exposure observed in free-living diets of both celiac and healthy subjects underlines the need of a constant surveillance on mycotoxins occurrence at large.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Patients with celiac disease (CD) are at increased risk of osteoporosis and compromised B-vitamin status. Emerging evidence supports a beneficial role of folate and the metabolically related B-vitamins in bone health in generally healthy adults, but no previous study has investigated this in CD patients. The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship of folate, vitamins B12, B6 and B2 (riboflavin), and the related metabolite homocysteine, with bone mineral density (BMD) in CD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 400 treated adult CD patients invited to participate, 110 responded and met the eligibility criteria for study participation. BMD was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning at the lumbar spine (L1-L4), femoral neck, and total hip sites. Biomarker status of the relevant B-vitamins and homocysteine, and dietary B-vitamin intakes, were measured. RESULTS: The significant predictors of low BMD were increasing age (B = 0.080, p < 0.001) and decreasing weight (B = 0.072, p = 0.004), whereas no significant relationship with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (B = 0.093, p = 0.928) was observed. Following adjustment for these predictors, serum vitamin B12 (but no other B-vitamin biomarker) was found to be a significant determinant of BMD at the femoral neck (beta = 0.416, p = 0.011) and total hip (beta = 0.327, p = 0.049) in men only. No significant relationships were found between any of the B-vitamin biomarkers investigated and BMD (at any measured site) in women. CONCLUSION: These findings add to current evidence suggesting a potential role of vitamin B12 in BMD, particularly in men, and show such a relationship for the first time in CD patients.},

The role of gluten in comparison to other nutriments such as saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) remains debated. If a gluten-free diet is clearly indicated in celiac disease and wheat allergy, it remains debatable in non-celiac gluten sensitivity given weak and contradictory evidence. There is no strong evidence for a strict indication to a gluten-free diet in endocrinological, psychiatric, and rheumatologic diseases, or to improve performance in elite sports.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a disease of the small intestine that occurs in genetically susceptible subjects triggered by the ingestion of cereal gluten proteins for which the only treatment is strict adherence to a life-long gluten-free diet. Barley contains four gluten protein families, and the existence of barley genotypes that do not accumulate the B-, C-, and D-hordeins paved the way for the development of an ultralow gluten phenotype. Using conventional breeding strategies, three null mutations behaving as recessive alleles were combined to create a hordein triple-null barley variety. Proteomics has become an invaluable tool for characterization and quantification of the protein complement of cereal grains. In this study multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry, viewed as the gold standard for peptide quantification, was compared to the data-independent acquisition strategy known as SWATH-MS (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra). SWATH-MS was comparable (p < 0.001) to MRM-MS for 32/33 peptides assessed across the four families of hordeins (gluten) in eight barley lines. The results of SWATH-MS analysis further confirmed the absence of the B-, C-, and D-hordeins in the triple-null barley line and showed significantly reduced levels ranging from <1% to 16% relative to wild-type (WT) cv Sloop for the minor gamma-hordein class. SWATH-MS represents a valuable tool for quantitative proteomics based on its ability to generate reproducible data comparable with MRM-MS, but has the added benefits of allowing reinterrogation of data to improve analytical performance, ask new questions, and in this case perform quantification of trypsin-resistant proteins (C-hordeins) through analysis of their semi- or nontryptic fragments.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Consumers, especially those with allergies and/or intolerances, should have confidence in two critical areas of food safety: foods should be correctly labelled and free from contamination. To this end, global proteomic analysis employing LC-MS/MS of gluten-enriched extracts derived from 12 barley cultivars was undertaken, providing a foundation for the development of MS-based quantitative methodologies that would enable the detection of barley contamination in foods. Subsequently, a number of candidate barley-specific peptide markers were evaluated by multiple-reaction monitoring MS. From an initial panel of 26, 9 peptide markers were unique to barley, yet present in a wide range of barley varieties. The analytical method was then used to examine a range of breakfast cereals and was able to detect barley in a barley-based breakfast cereal and a muesli, but additionally allowed detection of contamination of cereals that were comprised of ancient grains and in commercially-sourced flours, including amaranth, chia, buckwheat, millet, rice, corn, oats, rye, spelt and green wheat (0.01-0.08%). LC-MS/MS provides an alternative to ELISA approaches to monitor food safety and the identification of robust and sensitive cereal-specific peptide markers is the first step toward the adoption of this technology. SIGNIFICANCE: Coeliac disease is a serious health issue affecting up to 70million people globally for which there is no cure. The only treatment is a life-long gluten-free diet. Contamination of foods can occur at many stages of food production from farm to fork. As such, accurate quantification and identification of the source (i.e. cereal) and type (e.g. gluten) of contamination is critical to the health and well-being of a subset of the population, including those affected by coeliac disease and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an itchy blistering skin disease with predilection sites on elbows, knees, and buttocks. Diagnosis is confirmed by showing granular immunoglobulin A deposits in perilesional skin. DH is one manifestation of coeliac disease; the skin symptoms heal with gluten free diet (GFD) and relapse on gluten challenge. Of the first-degree relatives, 5% may be affected by either condition. Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is the autoantigen in coeliac disease and epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) in DH. Both diseases conditions exhibit TG2-specific autoantibodies in serum and small bowel mucosa; patients with DH have IgA-TG3 in the skin. There are some divergencies between these two phenotypes. One-fourth of DH patients do not have small bowel mucosal villous atrophy, but virtually all have coeliac-type inflammatory changes. The skin symptoms respond slowly to GFD. The incidence of coeliac disease is increasing, whereas the opposite is true for DH. A female predominance is evident in coeliac disease, while DH may be more common in males. Coeliac disease carries the risk of small intestinal T-cell lymphoma; in DH B-cell lymphomas at any site may prevail. Adult coeliac disease carries a slightly increased elevated mortality risk, whereas in DH, the relative mortality rate is significantly decreased. Key messages Dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous manifestation of coeliac disease; both conditions are genetically determined and gluten-dependent. Gastrointestinal symptoms and the degree of villous atrophy are less obvious in dermatitis herpetiformis than in coeliac disease. Both show tissue transglutaminase (TG2) specific autoantibodies in serum and small bowel mucosa. In addition, TG3-targeted IgA antibodies are found in the skin of DH patients Both conditions carry an increased elevated risk of lymphoma, in coeliac disease small intestinal T-cell lymphoma, in dermatitis herpetiformis mainly B-cell lymphoma at various sites. Coeliac disease is currently eight times more common that DH; the incidence of DH is decreasing in contrast to that of coeliac disease, where it is increasing.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic immune disorder. We assessed serum levels of adhesion molecules as a marker of endothelial dysfunction in patients with CD at first diagnosis and in those on a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with CD (mean age 6.74 +/- 4.6 years) and 51 age- and sex-matched control patients participated in the present case-controlled, prospective clinical study. Serum levels of vascular adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, endothelial selectin, vascular endothelial cadherin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and homocysteine levels were measured. RESULTS: Average soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (CD vs control group: 1320 +/- 308 vs 1120 +/- 406 ng/mL, P = 0.006), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (336 +/- 99 vs 263 +/- 67 ng/mL, P = 0.025), and soluble endothelial selectin (113.9 +/- 70 vs 76.9 +/- 32 ng/mL, P = 0.007) levels were significantly higher in cases of newly diagnosed CD than in the control group. Soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (1050 +/- 190 ng/mL) and soluble endothelial selectin (68.7 +/- 45 ng/mL) levels in patients with CD, who were fully compliant with a gluten-free diet, were significantly lower than that in those newly diagnosed as having CD (P = 0.003 and P = 0.0012, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that serum adhesion molecule levels are higher in patients with CD. Some of the risks associated with endothelial dysfunction may be related to CD and these risks can be reduced with an appropriate and fully controlled diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oats provide important nutritional and pharmacological properties, although their safety in coeliac patients remains controversial. Previous studies have confirmed that the reactivity of the anti-33-mer monoclonal antibody with different oat varieties is proportional to the immune responses in terms of T-cell proliferation. Although the impact of these varieties on the adaptive response has been studied, the role of the dendritic cells (DC) is still poorly understood. The aim of this study is to characterize different oat fractions and to study their effect on DC from coeliac patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Protein fractions were isolated from oat grains and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Several proteins were characterized in the prolamin fraction using immunological and proteomic tools, and by Nano-LC-MS/MS. These proteins, analogous to alpha- and gamma-gliadin-like, showed reactive sequences to anti-33-mer antibody suggesting their immunogenic potential. That was further confirmed as some of the newly identified oat peptides had a differential stimulatory capacity on circulating DC from coeliac patients compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time, to our knowledge, where newly identified oat peptides have been shown to elicit a differential stimulatory capacity on circulating DC obtained from coeliac patients, potentially identifying immunogenic properties of these oat peptides.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Patients should be followed-up with dietary interviews and serology as CD markers to ensure adherence to the diet. However, none of these methods offer an accurate measure of dietary compliance. Our aim was to evaluate the measurement of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in stools as a marker of GFD adherence in CD patients and compare it with traditional methods of GFD monitoring. METHODS: We performed a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter study including 188 CD patients on GFD and 84 healthy controls. Subjects were given a dietary questionnaire and fecal GIP quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serological anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) IgA and anti-deamidated gliadin peptide (anti-DGP) IgA antibodies were measured simultaneously. RESULTS: Of the 188 celiac patients, 56 (29.8%) had detectable GIP levels in stools. There was significant association between age and GIP in stools that revealed increasing dietary transgressions with advancing age (39.2% in subjects >/=13 years old) and with gender in certain age groups (60% in men >/=13 years old). No association was found between fecal GIP and dietary questionnaire or anti-tTG antibodies. However, association was detected between GIP and anti-DGP antibodies, although 46 of the 53 GIP stool-positive patients were negative for anti-DGP. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of gluten peptides in stools reveals limitations of traditional methods for monitoring GFD in celiac patients. The GIP ELISA enables direct and quantitative assessment of gluten exposure early after ingestion and could aid in the diagnosis and clinical management of nonresponsive CD and refractory CD.

   abstract = {A gluten-free diet is currently the only effective means of treating individuals with celiac disease. Such a diet enables celiac patients to control their symptoms and avoid various complications associated with this condition. However, while the quality of gluten-free foods has significantly improved during recent decades, maintenance of a gluten-free diet does not necessarily ensure adequate nutritional intake. Because oats are an important source of proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals, and fibre, their inclusion in a gluten-free diet might improve the nutritional status of a celiac patient. Although oats are included in the list of gluten-free ingredients specified in European regulations, their safety when consumed by celiac patients remains debatable. Some studies claim that pure oats are safe for most celiac people, and contamination with other cereal sources is the main problem facing people with this disease. However, it is necessary to consider that oats include many varieties, containing various amino acid sequences and showing different immunoreactivities associated with toxic prolamins. As a result, several studies have shown that the immunogenicity of oats varies depending on the cultivar consumed. Thus, it is essential to thoroughly study the variety of oats used in a food ingredient before including it in a gluten-free diet.},

METHODS: We studied retrospectively and prospectively 52 patients with diagnosis of undifferentiated connective tissue disease, subdivided, according to Vaz criteria, in systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis and Sjogren's syndrome-like subgroups. Serological markers of celiac disease as anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were investigated. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy with duodenal biopsy and histological examination was proposed to patients with positive celiac disease serology. In addition antibodies directed to hepatitis C virus and total IgA-antibodies were investigated. RESULTS: Six patients (11,5%) were positive for celiac disease serological tests although two of them were asymptomatic. Four patients underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, showing total or subtotal villous atrophy at duodenal biopsies. Hepatitis C virus serology was negative in all patients and none had IgA deficiency. 83% of celiac patients showed a scleroderma-like phenotype. We observed a statistically higher incidence of autoimmune symptoms in patients with gluten sensitivity. Fatigue and myalgia regressed early after the beginning of gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of patients the prevalence of celiac disease was higher than that reported in the general population. We believe that all patients with diagnosis of undifferentiated connective tissue disease, especially those with a systemic sclerosis-like presentation, should be investigated for celiac disease, even in absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Gluten-free diet should be early recommended to all patients having undifferentiated connective tissue disease and gluten sensitivity.},

The results are very similar to those obtained in our previous work using an immuno assay and the same enzyme preparation.

   abstract = {The classic symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are abdominal pain, bloating and some form of bowel dysfunction. The pain is typically colicky in nature and can occur at any site although most commonly it is on the left side. The abdomen feels flat in the morning and then gradually becomes more bloated as the day progresses reaching a peak by late afternoon or evening. It then subsides again over night. Traditionally IBS is divided into diarrhoea, constipation or alternating subtypes. IBS patients frequently complain of one or more non-colonic symptoms, these include constant lethargy, low backache, nausea, bladder symptoms suggestive of an irritable bladder, chest pain and dyspareunia in women. The traditional view that IBS is a largely psychological condition is no longer tenable. Rectal bleeding, a family history of malignancy and a short history in IBS should always be treated with suspicion. Both pain and bowel dysfunction are often made worse by eating. It is recommended that a coeliac screening test is undertaken to rule out this condition. Other routine tests should include inflammatory markers such as CRP or ESR. Calprotectin is a marker for leukocytes in the stools and detects gastrointestinal inflammation. A negative test almost certainly rules out inflammatory bowel disease, especially in conjunction with a normal CRP. Fermentable carbohydrates can have a detrimental effect on IBS and this has led to the introduction of the low FODMAP diet.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a complex small intestinal enteropathy that develops consequently to a breach of tolerance to gliadin, a storage protein abundantly found in cereals such as wheat, rye and barley. The understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of coeliac disease in HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genetically susceptible individuals has greatly improved during the last decades but so far did not allow to develop curative therapeutics, leaving a long-life gluten free diet as the only treatment option for the patients. In order to bring new therapeutic targets to light and to test the safety and efficacy of putative drugs, animal models recapitulating features of the disease are needed. Here, we will review the existing animal models and the clinical features of coeliac disease they reflect and discuss their relevance for modelling immune pathways that may lead to potential therapeutic approaches.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: precise information on gluten consumption is crucial for specifically studying the impact of gluten introduction and gluten intake in celiac disease development. Our aim was to develop and validate tools (food frequency questionnaires, FFQs) for the assessment of gluten consumption in Spanish children aged 7-36 months. METHODS: a total of 342 children, who attended primary healthcare centers for routine health surveys or La Fe Hospital for minor health problems as well as healthy children (recruited in nurseries and primary schools) participated in this survey. We have developed two different FFQs (one for 7-12 months and other for 13-36 months). For validation, results from two FFQs were compared with results of 2-day food records and also with the gold standard 7-day records. The mean gluten intake obtained by the 2DR vs. FFQ and the 7DR vs. FFQ, were compared using the Bland Altman plot method and also Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. RESULTS: we found a good agreement between our FFQs and the 2DR and 7DR according to the results of both the Bland-Altman plots and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. CONCLUSIONS: our two new FFQs are therefore the only validated questionnaires available to determine gluten consumption in Spanish children. They are user-friendly and offer excellent instruments to assess gluten intake in children up to 36 months of age.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CeD) is a common gluten-sensitive autoimmune enteropathy. A gluten-free diet is an effective treatment, but compliance is demanding; hence, new treatment strategies for CeD are required. OBJECTIVE: Parasitic helminths hold promise for treating inflammatory disorders, so we examined the influence of experimental hookworm infection on the predicted outcomes of escalating gluten challenges in CeD subjects. METHODS: A 52-week study was conducted involving 12 adults with diet-managed CeD. Subjects were inoculated with 20 Necator americanus larvae, and escalating gluten challenges consumed as pasta were subsequently administered: (1) 10 to 50 mg for 12 weeks (microchallenge); (2) 25 mg daily + 1 g twice weekly for 12 weeks (GC-1g); and (3) 3 g daily (60-75 straws of spaghetti) for 2 weeks (GC-3g). Symptomatic, serologic, and histological outcomes evaluated gluten toxicity. Regulatory and inflammatory T cell populations in blood and mucosa were examined. RESULTS: Two gluten-intolerant subjects were withdrawn after microchallenge. Ten completed GC-1g, 8 of whom enrolled in and completed GC-3g. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: median villous height-to-crypt depth ratios (2.60-2.63; P = .98) did not decrease as predicted after GC-1g, and the mean IgA-tissue transglutaminase titers declined, contrary to the predicted rise after GC-3g. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: quality of life scores improved (46.3-40.6; P = .05); celiac symptom indices (24.3-24.3; P = .53), intra-epithelial lymphocyte percentages (32.5-35.0; P = .47), and Marsh scores were unchanged by gluten challenge. Intestinal T cells expressing IFNgamma were reduced following hookworm infection (23.9%-11.5%; P = .04), with corresponding increases in CD4(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (0.19%-1.12%; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Necator americanus and gluten microchallenge promoted tolerance and stabilized or improved all tested indices of gluten toxicity in CeD subjects.},

More recently, a new entity, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), with a still evolving definition and clinical spectrum, has been described. Although, the benefits of GFD are clearly supported in this condition as well as in celiac disease, in the last two decades, GFD has expanded to a wider population. In this review, we will attempt to clarify, according to the existing evidence, which are the myths and facts of these diets.},

The objectives were: 1. An analysis of wheat and rice sIgG and sIgG4 in healthy children, children with IgE-mediated wheat allergy (WA), coeliac disease (CD) and Helicobacter pylori infection (HP). 2. Usability of wheat sIgG and sIgG4 in the WA diagnostics. METHODS: We compared 388 each wheat and rice sIgG and sIgG4 in a group of 200 children: 50 WA (diagnosis, diet treatment, tolerance), 50 CD (diagnosis and remission), 50 HP and 50 healthy. SIgE, sIgG, sIgG4 were determined with the FEIA method (Pharmacia CAP System). RESULTS: In healthy children food sIgG were the lowest; no sIgG4 were found. In the CD diagnosis group wheat and rice sIgG and rice sIgG4 were the most common and their concentrations were the highest (p < .001, p < .05). Wheat sIgG4 were the highest in WA children (diagnosis and tolerance) to fall during the elimination diet (p < .05). Wheat and rice sIgG remained the same in all allergy phases. Rice sIgG also did not differ in the class G4. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Serum concentrations of wheat and rice sIgG and sIgG4 are elevated in children with CD, HP and WA. 2. Sub-clinical incidence of some gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases may be responsible for high individual versatility of food sIgG and sIgG4 concentrations in serum. 3. Wheat sIgG and sIgG4 in children do not correlate with WA clinical picture.},

METHODS: This is an analytical cross-sectional study, which included patients diagnosed with T1DM who had complete anthropometric data (weight and height) and excluded those using drugs with effect on weight gain, genetic syndromes, celiac disease, hypothyroidism, renal failure and other chronic diseases, and pregnant women. The data collection was referring to the last consultation, and with respect to laboratory tests, the most recent data was collected. The dependent variable was the overweight, defined as Z score >/=1. The independent variables were gender, age, insulin dose, duration of disease, lipid profile, glycated hemoglobin, type of prescribed food planning, and place of residence. A logistic regression model was built for each outcome studied, considering significant associations those with p < 0.05. RESULTS: The study included 195 patients with a mean age of 10.6 (+/-3.8) years, and 49.7 % (n = 97) aged less than 10 years. The overweight frequency was 40 % (n = 78). The age >/=10 years (OR 0.41; 95 % CI 0.20-0.86; p = 0.019) and the dose of insulin/kg ideal weight (OR 3.38; 95 % CI 1:55-7:39; p = 0.002) were considered the variables associated with overweight. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of overweight, which explains strategies for promoting healthy eating habits and changing lifestyle with a focus on children and adolescents with diabetes.},

Here, we conducted a large-scale single-cell paired T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing study to characterize the TCR repertoire for two homologous immunodominant gluten epitopes, DQ2.5-glia-alpha2 and DQ2.5-glia-omega2, in blood of celiac disease patients after oral gluten challenge. Despite sequence similarity of the epitopes, the TCR repertoires are unique but shared several overall features. We demonstrate that clonally expanded T cells dominate the T-cell responses to both epitopes. Moreover, we find V-gene bias of TRAV26, TRAV4, and TRBV7 in DQ2.5-glia-alpha2 reactive TCRs, while DQ2.5-glia-omega2 TCRs displayed significant bias toward TRAV4 and TRBV4. The knowledge that antigen-specific TCR repertoire in chronic inflammatory diseases tends to be dominated by a few expanded clones that use the same TCR V-gene segments across patients is important information for HLA-associated diseases where the antigen is unknown.},

   abstract = {To address the possible involvement of VGF peptides in obesity and diabetes, we studied type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obese patients, and high-fat diet induced obese mice. Two VGF peptides (NAPP-19 and QQET-30) were identified in human plasma by HPLC-ESI-MS. The VGF C-terminus, the above two cleaved peptides, and the TLQP-21 related peptide/s were studied using ELISA and immunohistochemistry. In euglycemic patients, plasma NAPPE and TLQP like peptides were significantly reduced with obesity (74+/-10 vs. 167+/-28, and 92+/-10 vs. 191+/-19 pmol/ml, mean+SEM, n = 10 and 6, obese vs. normal BMI, respectively, p<0.03). Upon a standard glucose load, a distinct response was shown for VGF C-terminus, TLQP and QQET-like (ERVW immunoreactive) peptides in euglycemic normal BMI patients, but was virtually abolished in euglycemic obese, and in T2D patients independently of BMI. High-fat diet induced obese mice showed reduced plasma VGF C-terminus, NAPPE and QQET-like (ERVW) peptide/s (3+/-0.2 vs. 4.6+/-0.3, 22+/-3.5 vs. 34+/-1.3, and 48+/-7 vs. 100+/-7 pmol/ml, mean+SEM, n = 8/group, obese vs. slim, respectively, p<0.03), with a loss of the response to glucose for all VGF peptides studied. In immunohistochemistry, TLQP and/or VGF C-terminus antibodies labelled VGF containing perikarya in mouse celiac ganglia, pancreatic islet cells and thin beaded nerve fibres in brown adipose tissues, with fewer in white adipose tissue. Upon the glucose load, tyrosine hydroxylase and VGF C-terminus immunoreactive axons became apparent in pancreatic islets of slim animals, but not in obese animals. Alltogether, a significant loss of VGF peptide immunoreactivity and/or their response to glucose was demonstrated in obese patients, with or without T2D, in parallel with a similar loss in high-fat diet induced obese mice. An involvement of VGF in metabolic regulations, including those of brown and/or white adipose tissues is underlined, and may point out specific VGF peptides as potential targets for diagnosis and/or treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD)-associated duodenal dysbiosis has not yet been clearly defined, and the mechanisms by which CD-associated dysbiosis could concur to CD development or exacerbation are unknown. In this study, we analyzed the duodenal microbiome of CD patients. METHODS: The microbiome was evaluated in duodenal biopsy samples of 20 adult patients with active CD, 6 CD patients on a gluten-free diet, and 15 controls by DNA sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA libraries. Bacterial species were cultured, isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. Isolated bacterial species were used to infect CaCo-2 cells, and to stimulate normal duodenal explants and cultured human and murine dendritic cells (DCs). Inflammatory markers and cytokines were evaluated by immunofluorescence and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: Proteobacteria was the most abundant and Firmicutes and Actinobacteria the least abundant phyla in the microbiome profiles of active CD patients. Members of the Neisseria genus (Betaproteobacteria class) were significantly more abundant in active CD patients than in the other two groups (P=0.03). Neisseria flavescens (CD-Nf) was the most abundant Neisseria species in active CD duodenum. Whole-genome sequencing of CD-Nf and control-Nf showed genetic diversity of the iron acquisition systems and of some hemoglobin-related genes. CD-Nf was able to escape the lysosomal compartment in CaCo-2 cells and to induce an inflammatory response in DCs and in ex-vivo mucosal explants. CONCLUSIONS: Marked dysbiosis and an abundance of a peculiar CD-Nf strain characterize the duodenal microbiome in active CD patients thus suggesting that the CD-associated microbiota could contribute to the many inflammatory signals in this disorder.},

Gluten-free diet has been shown to benefit even in patients having a positive anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody titre and mild enteropathy. AIM: We explored the balance between mucosal apoptotic enterocyte loss and cell regeneration in mild and advanced enteropathies. METHODS: Duodenal biopsies from patients with mild enteropathy (Marsh grade 0 and 1) (n=26), advanced enteropathy (Marsh grade >/=2) (n=41) and control biopsies (n=12) were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for end-apoptotic markers (M30, H2AX); markers of cell death (perforin, annexin V); and cell proliferation (Ki67). Composite H-scores based on the intensity and distribution of markers were compared. RESULTS: End-apoptotic markers and marker of cell death (perforin) were significantly up-regulated in both mild and advanced enteropathies, in comparison to controls; without any difference between mild and advanced enteropathies. Ki67 labelling index was significantly higher in crypts of mild enteropathy, in comparison to controls, suggesting maintained regenerative activity in the former. CONCLUSIONS: Even in patients with mild enteropathy, the rate of apoptosis is similar to those with advanced enteropathy. These findings suggest the necessity of reviewing the existing practice of not treating patients with mild enteropathy.},

Recently diagnosed adults with celiac disease should be assessed for micronutrient deficiencies because early institution of a gluten-free diet (GFD) prevents morbidity and reduces the incidence of gastrointestinal malignant neoplasms and osteoporosis. In this report, we present the case of a 49-year-old woman of Southeast Asian-Indian descent living in the United States who had folate insufficiency, as manifested by low serum and red blood cell (RBC) folate levels. Further investigation, including serologic testing and intestinal biopsy, confirmed a diagnosis of celiac disease and other nutrient deficiencies. Managing the condition of this patient with folate supplements and implementation of a recommended GFD reversed the folate insufficiency. In conclusion, when serum and/or RBC levels are low in a person of Southeast Asian-Indian descent living in a country with folate fortification of the grain supply, such as the United States, the medical team needs to look for an organic cause, as in our patient, to diagnose and manage celiac disease early and, hopefully, forestall complications.},

   abstract = {The non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder which is very common world wide. The human gut harbors microbiota which has a wide variety of microbial organisms; they are mainly symbiotic and important for well being. However, "dysbiosis" - i.e. an alteration in normal commensal gut microbiome with an increase in pathogenic microbes, impacts homeostasis/health. Dysbiosis in NCGS causes gut inflammation, diarrhea, constipation, visceral hypersensitivity, abdominal pain, dysfunctional metabolic state, and peripheral immune and neuro-immune communication. Thus, immune-mediated gut and extra-gut dysfunctions, due to gluten sensitivity with comorbid diarrhea, may last for decades. A significant proportion of NCGS patients may chronically consume alcohol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and fatty diet, as well as suffer from various comorbid disorders. The above pathophysiological substrate and dysbiosis are underpinned by dysfunctional bidirectional "Gut-Brain Axis" pathway. Pathogenic gut microbiota is known to upregulate gut- and systemic inflammation (due to lipopolysaccharide from pathogenic bacteria and synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines); they enhance energy harvest, cause obesity, insulin resistance, and dysfunctional vago-vagal gut-brain axis. Conceivably, the above cascade of pathology may promote various pathophysiological mechanisms, neuroinflammation, and cognitive dysfunction. Hence, dysbiosis, gut inflammation, and chronic dyshomeostasis are of great clinical relevance. It is argued here that we need to be aware of NCGS and its chronic pathophysiological impact. Therapeutic measures including probiotics, vagus nerve stimulation, antioxidants, alpha 7 nicotinic receptor agonists, and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 antagonist may ameliorate neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in NCGS; they may therefore, prevent cognitive dysfunction and vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease.},

CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 31-year-old white woman with celiac disease who presented manifestations related to a hyperactive immune system, including macroamylasemia, false-positive anti-HCV, positive antinuclear antibody, and Raynaud's phenomenon. The introduction of a gluten-free diet (GFD) resolved these features, but myasthenia gravis (MG) symptoms unexpectedly occurred on that occasion. DISCUSSION: The role of a GFD in the course of autoimmune diseases has been studied and improvement has been reported in many diseases. However, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the course of neurological disorders associated with celiac disease. In the present case, a GFD did not prevent the appearance of symptoms related to myasthenia gravis. There are few reports on the association of celiac disease with myasthenia gravis and therefore little is known about the course and time of onset of myasthenia in celiac patients. The present case increases the knowledge about this unusual autoimmune neurological disease associated with celiac disease.},

A life-long gluten free diet (GFD) is the only therapeutic approach. Dysbiosis, which can precede the CD pathogenesis and/or persist when subjects are on GFD, is reviewed and discussed. Salivary microbiota and metabolome differed between healthy and celiac children treated under GFD (T-CD) for at least two years. The type of GFD (African- vs Italian-style) modified the microbiota and metabolome of Saharawi T-CD children. Different studies showed bacterial dysbiosis at duodenal and/or fecal level of patients with active untreated CD (U-CD) and T-CD compared to healthy subjects. The ratio of protective anti-inflammatory bacteria such as Lactobacillus-Bifidobacterium to potentially harmful Bacteroides-Enterobacteriaceae was the lowest in U-CD and T-CD children. In agreement with dysbiosis, serum, fecal and urinary metabolome from U-CD and T-CD patients showed altered levels of free amino acids and volatile organic compounds. However, consensus across studies defining specific bacteria and metabolites in U-CD or T-CD patients is still lacking. Future research efforts are required to determine the relationships between CD and oral and intestinal microbiotas to improve the composition of GFD for restoring the gut dysbiosis as a preventative or therapeutic approach for CD.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess in the primary care setting the prevalence of CD in patients with psoriasis and the response to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in subjects with psoriasis and CD. METHODS: We enrolled 218 patients with psoriasis and 264 controls. Coeliac screening was carried out in all subjects (Eurospital, Trieste, Italy). In subjects with a positive serology, the diagnosis of CD was confirmed histologically. RESULTS: Nine (4.1%) psoriatic patients had positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies compared to only 1 among controls (0.4%, p < 0.05; OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.42-90.11). The diagnosis of CD was confirmed histologically in all 10 subjects. At 6 months GFD was associated with a great improvement of skin lesions in 7 out of 8 patients with psoriasis. CONCLUSION: Our multicentre primary care study showed an high prevalence of CD in psoriasis and an improvement of skin lesions in CD under GFD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The role of serological tests such as IgA anti-transglutaminase autoantibodies has become increasingly important in celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. However, the efficiency of these tests for patient follow-up is controversial. We investigated the correlation of 12 different serological tests, including recent deamidated gliadin and actin IgA tests, with villous atrophy (VA) in a retrospective cohort of treated celiac patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 100 treated CD patients who had intestinal biopsy in the course of their follow-up. Antibodies against transglutaminase, deamidated gliadin peptides, and native gliadin were measured, along with IgA anti-actin. The biopsy slides were all blind-reviewed and scored according to Marsh classification. RESULTS: For all deamidated gliadin and transglutaminase tests, we found that a positive result was significantly associated with persistence of intestinal VA, with a diagnostic efficacy up to 80%. Furthermore, antibodies titers directly correlated with the degree of VA, indicating a strong link between disease activity and presence of antibodies in the serum. Interestingly, the tests with the highest association with persistent VA were those for deamidated gliadin IgG. Using a test positivity pattern analysis, we were also able to identify several groups of patients with distinct antibody profiles that showed significant differences in intestinal damage and diet compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results show that deamidated gliadin antibodies are strongly correlated with VA and should be considered valuable tools in CD follow-up and that multiplex serologic analysis for treated CD represents a promising tool for personalized patient management.},

   abstract = {IBS is one of the most common types of functional bowel disorder. Increasing attention has been paid to the causative role of food in IBS. Food ingestion precipitates or exacerbates symptoms, such as abdominal pain and bloating in patients with IBS through different hypothesised mechanisms including immune and mast cell activation, mechanoreceptor stimulation and chemosensory activation. Wheat is regarded as one of the most relevant IBS triggers, although which component(s) of this cereal is/are involved remain(s) unknown. Gluten, other wheat proteins, for example, amylase-trypsin inhibitors, and fructans (the latter belonging to fermentable oligo-di-mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs)), have been identified as possible factors for symptom generation/exacerbation. This uncertainty on the true culprit(s) opened a scenario of semantic definitions favoured by the discordant results of double-blind placebo-controlled trials, which have generated various terms ranging from non-coeliac gluten sensitivity to the broader one of non-coeliac wheat or wheat protein sensitivity or, even, FODMAP sensitivity. The role of FODMAPs in eliciting the clinical picture of IBS goes further since these short-chain carbohydrates are found in many other dietary components, including vegetables and fruits. In this review, we assessed current literature in order to unravel whether gluten/wheat/FODMAP sensitivity represent 'facts' and not 'fiction' in IBS symptoms. This knowledge is expected to promote standardisation in dietary strategies (gluten/wheat-free and low FODMAP) as effective measures for the management of IBS symptoms.},

METHODS: Eighteen T1D+CD+GFD patients aged 10-16years were identified and matched 2:1 for age, sex, diabetes duration and glycated hemoglobin to 36 T1D subjects and 36 HC. T1D+CD+GFD patients were adherent with a GFD. Urine and serum levels of cytokines/chemokines as well as baseline clinical and laboratory variables were assessed. RESULTS: T1D+CD+GFD patients exhibited lower levels of urinary IL-1B, IL-4, IL-5 (p<0.05) and IFN-gamma, IL-8 and G-CSF levels (p<0.07) compared with T1D patients. Urinary biomarker levels between T1D+CD+GFD and HC were mostly similar. In contrast, urinary FGF-2, Flt-3, IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-15, MIP-1beta, and TNF-beta (p<0.05) were higher in T1D patients compared to HC. Similar levels of inflammatory markers were seen in the serum for all 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: T1D+CD+GFD patients demonstrated decreased urinary inflammatory cytokine/chemokines compared to T1D and some similar to HC, which is suggestive of a potential modulatory role of treated CD on urinary markers.},

   abstract = {The question about recommending pure, noncontaminated oats as part of the gluten-free diet of patients with celiac disease remains controversial. This might be due to gluten cross contamination and to the possible immunogenicity of some oat cultivars. In view of this controversy, a review of the scientific literature was conducted to highlight the latest findings published between 2008 and 2014 to examine the current knowledge on oats safety and celiac disease in Europe and North America. Results showed that regular oats consumed in Canada are largely contaminated. Overall, the consumption of pure oats has been generally considered to be safe for adults and children. However, it appears that some oat cultivars may trigger an immune response in sensitive individuals. Therefore, further long-term studies on the impact of consumption of oats identifying the cultivar(s) constitute an important step forward for drawing final recommendations. Furthermore, a closer and more accurate monitoring of the dietary intake of noncontaminated oats would be paramount to better determine what its actual contribution in the gluten-free diet of adults and children with celiac disease are in order to draw sound recommendations on the safety of pure oats as part of the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Celiac disease is an autoimmune mediated small intestine inflammation which occurs due to hypersensitivity reaction to gluten and related proteins in diet in genetically predisposed individuals. Prevalence of celiac among the population is about 0.5 - 1 % in most countries. Frequency of celiac disease in children is the subject of a few research. In this study, we aim to determine the frequency of celiac disease in patients presenting with functional constipation. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted on children referring to Imam Reza Clinic, affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences during one year starting from 2011, March 20. One hundred and one children 2-18 years of age with constipation for more than 2 months according to ROME III criteria. The entire participants underwent serologic studies of Total IgA and IgA TTG. Serum IgG TTG was measured in cases with reported values of Total IgA below the lowest normal limits. Moreover, endoscopic biopsy of the small intestine was also performed for patients with positive serology. RESULTS Of all the 101 studied participants, only four individuals (3.96 %) had positive test results for IgA TTG ( potential celiac disease). one of these patients refused to do endoscopy and endoscopic small intestine biopsy was performed for 3 patients. Two of them had normal pathology and one of them(0.99 %) was confirmed for celiac disease. CONCLUSION The frequency of celiac disease in children with chronic constipation is slightly higher than general population but without significant difference( 0.99% VS 0.6% ; p=0.64). So the screening serologic test for celiac disease is not recommended in children with chronic constipation.},

   abstract = {The association between celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune condition involving intestinal inflammation related to gluten ingestion, and type 1 diabetes has long been recognized. CD prevalence rates 4 to 6 times greater in adults with type 1 diabetes than in the general population. Much of the existing literature focuses on important implications related to the impact of a gluten-free diet on short-term outcomes in metabolic control and quality of life. Canadian Diabetes Association guidelines recommend targeted CD screening in patients with type 1 diabetes who have classic symptoms, such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, unexplained weight loss or labile metabolic control; however, a significant proportion (40% to 60%) of patients may have mild or absent symptoms. Recent evidence suggests that adult patients with both conditions are at higher risk for diabetes microvascular comorbidities, increased mortality and impaired bone health if the CD is untreated. The purpose of this review is to describe the association between CD and type 1 diabetes and to summarize recent literature that evaluates risks in patients with both conditions.},

Our aim was to investigate whether pediatric CD patients have an increased risk of atherosclerosis. We evaluated the premature atherosclerosis by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT). A total of 37 CD patients (20 girls, mean age 13+/-3.3 years) and 36 healthy age and sex matched controls were enrolled. Mean duration of CD was 47.1+/-32.3 months and 40.5% of patients had positive tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTg) IgA. Total cholesterol level was lower in CD (p=0.026) and cIMT was lower in tTg IgA antibody negative CD (p=0.030). cIMT was significantly correlated with tTg IgA antibody positivity (r=0.336; p=0.042). Adherence to strict gluten-free diet is associated with decreased cIMT, suggesting that gluten withdrawal seems to have a beneficial effect on premature atherosclerosis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is among the most important health problems and the most important feature of this disease is its being the only lifelong food allergy. To overcome this problem, some gluten-free and starch based food products have been generally introduced to the market; however, these products are starch based with low nutritive value. Therefore, it is important to enrich such products for individuals who are obliged to be nourished by gluten-free diet. In this study, wheat flour was replaced with quinoa flour (QF) in the production of tarhana. The objective of this work was to investigate the steady shear, viscoelastic and deformation and recovery properties (applying three interval thixotropy test (3ITT)) of gluten-free tarhana soups prepared with different concentrations of QF (40%, 50%, and 60%). It was found that the soups fitted well (R2 > 0.99) Ostwald de Waele model and exhibited shear thinning behavior. Besides, elastic properties dominated the viscous properties. Although the maximum deformation and recovery were determined at 40% concentration level, minimum deformation and recovery properties were specified at 60% concentration level. The results suggest that QF can be used in gluten-free tarhana formulations to enhance rheological properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Malnutrition is currently widespread in many areas of the world. Therefore, it must be focused on the cheap, but nutritious plant protein and mineral sources, such as legume and cereals. Several recent studies have showed the successful formulation of pseudocereal containing cereal based products. Tarhana is a traditional fermented food made of mainly a mixture cereal and yoghurt. Tarhana or tarhana-like products have been enriched or replaced with cereal and pseudocereal. In this research, the applicability of QF in traditional tarhana production were investigated. As a result, it is advisable to replace wheat flour with QF in products such as tarhana, couscous, noodle and pasta formulation for nutritional and sensory properties enrichment. The results suggest that QF can be used in gluten-free tarhana formulations to enhance rheological properties.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated and chronic inflammatory enteropathy, triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related diseases are a recently defined emerging clinical condition, characterized by increased serum IgG4 concentrations. The aim of this study was to investigate whether IgG4 levels correlate with the titers of intestinal antibodies and the degree of mucosal damage in CD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 41 CD patients and 28 healthy controls were included in the study. All patients underwent a duodenal biopsy and were then diagnosed with the modified Marsh classification. Blood samples were obtained for IgG4 measurements. Serums were kept at -80 degrees C until the analysis was carried out and plasma IgG4 levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay method with a diagnostic cutoff value of 135 mg/dl. RESULTS: The mean age of the CD and the control group was 26.8 +/- 8.3 and 26.9 +/- 6.2 years, respectively. The mean IgG4 levels were significantly higher in CD patients (283.21 +/- 39.02 mg/dl) compared with the healthy control group (68.97 +/- 15.89 mg/dl, P<0.0001). In the CD group, 27/41 patients and in the control group, 4/28 patients had high IgG4 levels (>135 mg/dl, P < 0.0001). A close correlation was found between the grade of mucosal damage, IgG4 levels, and antigliadin-IgA; the higher the grade Marsh score, the higher the measured IgG4 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In our study, IgG4 levels of CD patients were higher than normal ranges whereas the results of the control group were within physiologic limits. We also showed for the first time that there was a correlation between IgG4 levels, autoantibody, and severity of mucosal damage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate IgG4 levels and mucosal damage in CD patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by ingested gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and other closely related cereal grains. The current treatment for celiac disease is life-long adherence to a strict gluten-exclusion diet. The replacement of gluten presents a significant technological challenge, as it is an essential structure-building protein, which is necessary for formulating high-quality baked goods. A major limitation in the production of gluten-free products is the lack of protein functionality in non-wheat cereals. Additionally, commercial gluten-free mixes usually contain only carbohydrates, which may significantly limit the amount of protein in the diet. In the recent past, various approaches are attempted to incorporate protein-based ingredients and to modify the functional properties for gluten-free product development. This review aims to the highlight functionality of the alternative protein-based ingredients, which can be utilized for gluten-free product development both functionally as well as nutritionally.},

   abstract = {Patients with Down syndrome are more susceptible to autoimmune pathologies, in particular endocrine or digestive diseases such as celiac disease. Autoimmune enteropathy is another form of digestive autoimmune disease, non-gluten-dependant, more often diagnosed in male neonates with immunodysregulation and polyendocrinopathy such as the Immunodysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked syndrome. It also exists in the adult, but this pathology is less known and therefore frequently under-diagnosed. Clinical manifestations are similar to celiac disease, but not improved after a gluten-free diet. Autoimmune enteropathy is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as thyroiditis, myasthenia gravis, lupus or immune deficiencies, as Common Variable Immunodeficiency. Pathological analysis of intestinal biopsies can frequently distinguish autoimmune enteropathy and celiac disease. Autoimmune enteropathy usually has an important lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the mucosa and a lack of intraepithelial lymphocytes in the gastrointestinal mucosal surface, while celiac disease usually has a polymorph infiltration of the mucosa and an important intraepithelial lymphocytes infiltration. Nevertheless, the two pathological patterns may overlap. Here we report the first case of a patient with Down syndrome associated to autoimmune enteropathy (initially diagnosed as celiac disease), chronic pancreatitis and cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Even if autoimmune pathologies are much more common in patients with Down syndrome, we would like to report on this rare and original association found in our patient.},

In each patient diagnosed as having CD, thrombin generation was determined twice by means of calibrated automated thrombography. The first measurement was undertaken when CD was diagnosed; the second measurement was undertaken after normalization of their IgA antitissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG-Ab) titers following a gluten-free diet. In the controls, measurement for TTG-Ab and thrombin generation was undertaken once during recruitment. RESULTS: Patients with CD at diagnosis showed a significantly shorter lag time compared with controls (P < 0.001) and a shorter time-to-peak compared with controls (P < 0.02). These differences were no longer detectable after normalization of TTG-Ab values. The overall amount of generated thrombin, represented by the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), showed no significant difference between the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that alterations in coagulation can be found in untreated CD that may help to explain the described increased risk of stroke or VTE. A shorter lag time in patients with untreated CD indicates a more rapid onset of thrombin generation as a sign of hypercoagulability. ETP, the best predictive parameter for thromboembolic disease, however, was not altered.},

   abstract = {There is no diet that is recommended for all individuals. Some special diets (eg, gluten-free for celiac disease) are necessary for health and quality of life. Other diets may be recommended for a short period of time to aid in symptom relief but may not be recommended for the long- term (eg, LFD). Popular diets continue to come and go with varying levels of success. When considering adolescents, continued growth and development are most important, and restrictive diets can lead to nutrient inadequacies and poor growth. Before making any recommendation, it is important to consider the goal of the diet and the cost versus benefits associated with following the diet. Adherence is always a challenge, regardless of the type of diet implemented. If a special diet is not warranted for the health, safety, and desired quality of life of the individual, it should not be implemented.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) are distinct diseases of the gastrointestinal tract with specific clinico-pathological characteristics. Recent studies have found higher rates of EoE in patients with CD than in the general population. Our aim was to estimate the incidence of EoE among children who were diagnosed with CD over a 42-month period. METHODS: The study included patients diagnosed with CD based on endoscopy and histopathological findings between January 2010 and June 2013. Histopathology reports of esophageal biopsies were reviewed to identify all cases of EoE. The patients' presenting symptoms, laboratory evaluations, endoscopic and histopathological findings, treatments, and follow-ups were analysed. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with CD were identified, of whom six (10.7%) were diagnosed with both CD and EoE. Four of these patients presented with abdominal pain and diarrhea, two presented with failure to thrive, and three presented with food allergies. Endoscopic and histopathological changes typical of EoE were observed in all six patients. During follow-up, two patients showed significant improvement with the gluten-free diet and a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). Two patients improved with the elimination diet and two patients were treated with topical corticosteroid therapy. Endoscopic appearance was normal in all children on follow-up endoscopy after treatment. Biopsy samples also showed resolution of the histologic features of EoE in all of the children. CONCLUSION: The incidence of EoE in our cohort of children with CD was 10.7%, which is higher than what has been reported for the general population. In all children undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for suspected CD, coexistence of EoE should be considered.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) is defined as a reaction to ingested wheat after exclusion of celiac disease and wheat allergy. As its pathogenesis is incompletely understood, we evaluated the inflammatory response in the rectal mucosa of patients with well-defined NCWS. METHODS: The prospective study included 22 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like clinical presentation, diagnosed with NCWS by double-blind placebo-controlled challenge. Eight IBS patients not improving on wheat-free diet were used as controls. Two weeks after oral challenge was performed with 80 grams of wheat daily, cells were isolated from rectal biopsies and thoroughly characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis for intracellular cytokines and surface markers. RESULTS: Rectal biopsies from wheat-challenged NCWS patients showed that a significant mucosal CD45(+) infiltrate consisted of CD3(+) and CD3(-) lymphocytes, with the latter spontaneously producing more interferon (IFN)-gamma than IBS controls. About 30% of IFN-gamma-producing CD45(+) cells were T-bet(+), CD56(-), NKP44(-), and CD117(-), defining them as a type-1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1). IFN-gamma-producing ILC1 cells significantly decreased in 10 patients analyzed 2 weeks after they resumed a wheat-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that, in patients with active NCWS, IFN-gamma-producing ILC1 cells infiltrate rectal mucosa and support a role for this innate lymphoid cell population in the pathogenesis of NCWS.},

   abstract = {A hallmark of celiac disease is autoantibodies to transglutaminase 2 (TG2). By visualizing TG2-specific antibodies by antigen staining of affected gut tissue, we identified TG2-specific plasma cells in the lamina propria as well as antibodies in the subepithelial layer, inside the epithelium, and at the brush border. The frequency of TG2-specific plasma cells were found not to correlate with serum antibody titers, suggesting that antibody production at other sites may contribute to serum antibody levels. Upon commencement of a gluten-free diet, the frequency of TG2-specific plasma cells in the lesion dropped dramatically within 6 months, yet some cells remained. The frequency of TG2-specific plasma cells in the celiac lesion is thus dynamically regulated in response to gluten exposure. Laser microdissection of plasma cell patches, followed by antibody gene sequencing, demonstrated that clonal cells were seeded in distinct areas of the mucosa. This was confirmed by immunoglobulin heavy chain repertoire analysis of plasma cells isolated from individual biopsies of two untreated patients, both for TG2-specific and non-TG2-specific cells. Our results shed new light on the processes underlying the B-cell response in celiac disease, and the approach of staining for antigen-specific antibodies should be applicable to other antibody-mediated diseases.},

A series of synthetic peptide constructs containing cross-linked tTG and Glia deamidated peptides have been synthesized. Peptides were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays against celiac disease patients' sera versus normal blood donors, and their conformational features were evaluated by molecular modeling techniques. Four peptides were recognized as epitopes by autoantibodies (IgG class) circulating in CD patients' sera before gluten-free diet. The peptide II, containing Ac-tTG(553-564)-NH2 sequence cross-linked with deamidated Ac-alpha2-Glia(63-71)-NH2, was able to identify specific disease antibodies with a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 94.4%. Structural conformations of the linear fragments Ac-tTG(553-564)-NH2 and Ac-alpha2-Glia(63-71)-NH2 and the corresponding cross-linked peptide II were calculated by molecular modeling. Results showed that cross-linking is determinant to assume conformations, which are not accessible to the linear fragments.},

METHODS: In the supernatants of ex vivo-cultured duodenal biopsies from 14 self-reported NCGS patients, 9 untreated and 10 treated CD patients, and 12 controls we detected innate cytokines - interleukin (IL)-15, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, IL-27, IL-32alpha, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IFN-alpha-, adaptive cytokines - interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-17A, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13-, chemokines - IL-8, CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10-, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). RESULTS: Mucosal innate and adaptive cytokines, chemokines and growth factors did not differ between self-reported NCGS, treated CD and controls. On the contrary, IL-6, IL-15, IL-27, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-17A, IL-23, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-8, CCL1 and CCL4 were significantly higher in untreated CD than in self-reported NCGS, treated CD and controls, while TSLP was significantly lower in untreated CD than in self-reported NCGS, treated CD and controls. CONCLUSION: In our hands, patients with self-reported NCGS showed no abnormalities of the mucosal immune response.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is debate over the existence of nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms in response to ingestion of gluten-containing foods by people without celiac disease or wheat allergy. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to determine the effects of administration of low doses of gluten to subjects with suspected NCGS. METHODS: We enrolled 61 adults without celiac disease or a wheat allergy who believed ingestion of gluten-containing food to be the cause of their intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. Participants were assigned randomly to groups given either 4.375 g/day gluten or rice starch (placebo) for 1 week, each via gastrosoluble capsules. After a 1-week gluten-free diet, participants crossed over to the other group. The primary outcome was the change in overall (intestinal and extraintestinal) symptoms, determined by established scoring systems, between gluten and placebo intake. A secondary outcome was the change in individual symptom scores between gluten vs placebo. RESULTS: According to the per-protocol analysis of data from the 59 patients who completed the trial, intake of gluten significantly increased overall symptoms compared with placebo (P = .034). Abdominal bloating (P = .040) and pain (P = .047), among the intestinal symptoms, and foggy mind (P = .019), depression (P = .020), and aphthous stomatitis (P = .025), among the extraintestinal symptoms, were significantly more severe when subjects received gluten than placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In a cross-over trial of subjects with suspected NCGS, the severity of overall symptoms increased significantly during 1 week of intake of small amounts of gluten, compared with placebo.

AIM: We analysed the effect of gluten on gastric and gallbladder emptying and intestinal fermentation in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Ultrasound measurement of gastric and gallbladder emptying after both gluten-containing and gluten-free meals was performed in 18 volunteers (8 women, age 25.0+/-2.5 years; BMI 22+/-1.9). Breath hydrogen excretion after a gluten-containing meal, a gluten-free meal and a gluten-free meal with added gluten powder was measured in 16 volunteers (10 women, age 25.2+/-2.7 years; BMI 22+/-1.8). The severity of symptoms was monitored. RESULTS: Gluten presence in the meals was not recognised. Gastric emptying time was 81.6+/-13.8min after gluten-containing and 73.9+/-21.6min after gluten-free meals (p=0.11). Percentage ejection fraction after gluten-containing meals was 60+/-9% and 60.6+/-6% after gluten-free meals (p=0.68). Peak and cumulative hydrogen excretion were significantly higher after gluten-containing than after gluten-free meals (peak: 12.5+/-7.3 vs 6.5+/-5.1 parts-per-million, p<0.01; and cumulative: 2319+/-1720 vs 989+/-680 parts-per-million/minute, respectively; p<0.01). Adding gluten powder to the gluten-free meal did not modify fermentation. Symptoms were mild and not different after the meals. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy volunteers, gluten may induce gastrointestinal alterations. Further studies are needed to clarify which patients could benefit from dietary modification.},

TA and T1D are defined as 'associated conditions' to CD (conditions at increased prevalence in CD but not directly related to gluten ingestion). The diagnosis of CD may precede or follow that of TA/T1D. To date, the available evidence suggests that the common genetic background is the main factor determining the high prevalence of the association. Conversely, no conclusive findings clarify whether extrinsic gluten-related factors (age at the first introduction, concomitant breastfeeding, length of gluten exposure and gluten-free diet) may link CD to the ADs. The aim of this review is to evaluate whether genetic background alone could explain the association between CD and ADs or if gluten-related factors ought to be considered. The pathophysiological links clarifying how the gluten-related factors could predispose to ADs will also be discussed.},

   abstract = {Childhood Obesity is associated with a wide range of serious health complications and constitutes an increased risk of premature syndromes, including diabetes or heart diseases. Its treatment seems to be complicated. So, in order to help parents we have developed a system that will try to make easier the process of choosing foodstuff for overweight and obese children at the supermarket. To interact with the system, Near Field Communication mobile phones and tags are used. Those tags would have nutritional information such as energy or fat contain of each product. When the interaction takes place, the system will generate an alert determining if the product is adequate for the user diet or not. Decision will be influenced by specific prescript diets, which would have been previously generated by the system based on user profile parameters. At the same time the diet is established, the shopping list would be generated automatically. Therefore, the user could download and print both things at home easily by the PC application. The system also takes into account physical activity of the user. Children mobile phone includes an accelerometer that will detect and collect user activities in order to modify calorical requirements and, if necessary, to change physical activity too. In the future, it would be possible to extend this project system for adults, managing diets not just for obese and overweight, but also to diabetic or celiac people.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a complex immune-related disease with a very strong genetic component. Multiple genetic findings over the last decade have added to the already known MHC influence numerous genetic variants associated to CD susceptibility. Currently, it is well-established that 6 MHC and 39 non-MHC loci, including a higher number of independent genetic variants, are associated to disease risk. Moreover, additional regions have been recently implicated in the disease, which would increase the number of involved loci. Together, the firmly described genetic variants account for roughly 31% of CD heritability, being 25% explained by the MHC influence. These new variants represent markers of disease risk and turn the identification of the causal genes and the causal variants inside the associated loci, as well as their precise biological role on the disease, into a major challenge in CD research. Numerous studies have been developed with this aim showing the high impact of risk variants on gene expression. These studies also indicate a central role of CD4(+) T cells in CD pathogenesis and point to B cells as important players, which is in accordance with the key steps highlighted by the immunological models of pathogenesis. We comprehensively summarize the current knowledge about the genetic architecture of CD, characterized by multiple low-risk variants located within diverse loci which are most likely affecting genes with immune-related functions. These findings are leading to a better understanding of CD pathogenesis and helping in the design of new treatments. The repertoire of potential drug targets for CD has largely broadened last years, bringing us closer to get alternative or complementary treatments to the life-long gluten-free diet, the only effective treatment so far. Epigenetics and microbiota are emerging as potent factors modulating disease risk and putatively affecting disease manifestation, which are also being explored as therapeutic targets.},

The close relationship between immune-mediated disorders makes it mandatory to perform serological screening periodically in order to avoid delayed diagnosis of additional autoimmune diseases. We studied a patient with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who later developed an autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) and was referred to our hospital with a serious condition of his clinical status. The patient was suffering from an advance stage of celiac disease (CD), the delay in its diagnosis and in the establishment of a gluten-free dietled the patient to a severe proteincalorie malnutrition. Later, the patient developed an autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). We consider that clinical deterioration in patients with APS should alert physicians about the possible presence of other immune-mediated diseases. Periodic screening for autoantibodies would help to prevent delayed diagnosis and would improve patient's quality of life.},

Cereals having gluten such as wheat and rye must be removed from the diet for the clinical and histological improvement. The variety of gluten-free foods should be offered for the sufferers. In the study, gluten-free wafer formulas were optimized using corn, rice and buckwheat flours, xanthan and guar gum blend as an alternative product for celiac sufferers. Wafer sheet attributes and textural properties were investigated. Considering all wafer sheet properties in gluten-free formulas, better results were obtained by using 163.5% water, 0.5% guar and 0.1% xanthan in corn formula; 173.3% water, 0.45% guar and 0.15% xanthan gum in rice formula; 176% water, 0.1% guar and 0.5% xanthan gum in buckwheat formula. Average desirability values in gluten-free formulas were between 0.86 and 0.91 indicating they had similar visual and textural profiles to control sheet made with wheat flour.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A large retrospective multicentre study was conducted in Spain to evaluate the efficiency of the new European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria for the diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD). METHODS: The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe (Valencia, Spain). The present study included 2177 children (ages 0.6-15.9 years) with small bowel biopsy (SBB) performed for diagnostic purposes (from 2000 to 2009) and with a minimum 2-year follow-up after biopsy. RESULTS: CD was diagnosed in 2126 patients (97.5%) and excluded in 51 (2.5%). Tissue transglutaminase antibodies (TG2A), anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) were reported in 751 patients, 640 symptomatic and 111 asymptomatic. TG2A levels >10 times the upper limit of normal, plus positive EMA and HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 haplotypes, were found in 336 symptomatic patients, all of them with final diagnosis of CD. In 65 of 69 asymptomatic patients, 65 had confirmed CD and 4 did not have CD. According to the 2012 ESPGHAN guidelines, SBB may have been omitted in 52% of the symptomatic patients with CD with serologic and HLA available data. Gluten challenge was performed in 158 children, 75 of them <2 years at first biopsy. Only 1 patient in whom according to the new proposed diagnostic criteria gluten challenge would not have been mandatory did not relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the new ESPGHAN 2012 guidelines for diagnosis of CD can be safely used without the risk of overdiagnosis. A prospective multicentre study is needed to confirm our results.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease affects approximately 1% of Northern American and European populations. It is caused by an inappropriate immune response to dietary gluten. Gluten comprises of two major protein fractions: gliadins and glutenins. Glutenins have recently been found to be toxic to coeliac individuals. Proliferation assays suggest in some but not all paediatric coeliac individuals there may be immunological stimulation with high molecular weight (HMW) glutenins. Less evidence pertains to low molecular weight (LMW) glutenins. The aim is to assess adaptive, T-cell driven, and innate immune response in adult coeliac individuals towards HMW glutenin peptide, glut04, and LMW glutenin peptide, glt156. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Coeliac patients were recruited attending endoscopy for routine monitoring. Adaptive immune response towards glut04 and glt156 was measured by proliferation assays and measurement of interferon-gamma secretion in 28 T-cell lines. The innate immune response was assessed by measurement of enterocyte cell height (ECH) in coeliac small intestinal biopsies following overnight incubation in organ culture chambers in a further nine individuals. RESULTS: There were 3/28 and 2/28 positive proliferation results using gluten-sensitive T-cells with glut04 and glt156, respectively. All coeliac biopsies tested in organ culture chambers demonstrated clear reduction in ECH with peptic-tryptic digest of whole industrial gluten, glut04 and glt156 when compared to negative control ovalbumin (p < 0.005). Three individuals had both T-cell and organ culture study data. Their proliferation assays showed no stimulation of the T-cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates glutenin epitopes glut04 and glt156, while minor T-cell epitopes, are important in their ability to trigger the innate immune response.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune enteropathy based disorder that is triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The global prevalence of 1% to 2% represents only the tip of the iceberg. The diagnosis is confirmed by positive specific antibody, anti-transglutaminase or anti-endomysium, specific lesions of the small intestine and a response to strict gluten-free diet. The diagnosis is difficult and often delayed because the clinical variability is very large, ranging from digestive clinical presentation "classic" to "atypical" symptoms, often extra-intestinal, that are sometimes attributed to a concomitant disease or a complication. Among them, there are frequent musculoskeletal manifestations such as osteoporosis and osteomalacia. In the absence of risk factor, osteoporosis, in a premenopausal women or in a man less than 55 years, more is if it is severe and refractory to medications, need to rheumatologists on the track of celiac disease in the absence of digestive symptoms. Osteomalacia is related to secondary hypovitaminosis D malabsorption. Supplementation by calcifediol, water-soluble vitamin D, may be indicated. Celiac disease is associated with an autoimmune disease in almost 1/3 of the cases. Knowing these potential associations allows earlier diagnosis in patients whose only manifestation, a concomitant disease. Anemia, chronic fatigue or unexplained polyarthralgia are symptoms associated with celiac disease to look for specific antibodies. The aim of early diagnosis is to prevent the emergence of other systemic disorders and avoid complications such as bone fractures and cancer, especially intestinal lymphoma. Non-celiac gluten intolerance is a new entity defined by symptomatology similar to that of celiac disease induced by the ingestion of gluten and disappearing after crowding-out, among patients without specific antibodies and without intestinal lesion of celiac disease. This entity is a cause, at least in part, of increasing interest in gluten-free diet in the general population.},

However, strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is difficult, with findings from a recent review suggesting that up to 42% of individuals with coeliac disease do not eat a strict gluten-free diet. METHODS: The present study aimed to examine psychosocial predictors of adherence (purposeful and accidental) to a gluten-free diet among adults with coeliac disease over a 1-month period. In this longitudinal study, 212 North American adults with coeliac disease completed online questionnaires at two time points, baseline and 1 month later. RESULTS: The results revealed that intentions partially mediated the effects of symptom severity, self-regulatory efficacy, planning and knowledge on purposeful gluten consumption. Intentions did not mediate the effects of severity, response cost, self-regulatory efficacy, planning and knowledge for accidental gluten consumption but, interestingly, self-regulatory efficacy directly predicted fewer accidental incidents of gluten-consumption. CONCLUSIONS: These findings delineate the differential psychological processes in understanding accidental and purposeful gluten consumption among adults with coeliac disease and emphasise the importance of bolstering self-regulatory efficacy beliefs to prevent accidental and purposeful consumption of gluten.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an inflammatory disorder with leukocyte infiltration and changes of tissue architecture of the small intestine. The condition develops in genetically susceptible individuals as the result of an inappropriate immune response to gluten proteins of wheat, barley and rye. The clinical manifestations and the histological changes normalize when gluten is eliminated from the diet. CD4(+) T cells that recognize gluten peptides bound to predisposing HLA-DQ molecules play a key role in the pathogenesis. These T cells recognize better gluten peptides that are deamidated, and this posttranslational modification is mediated by the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Another hallmark of celiac disease is the production of antibodies to gluten as well as to TG2. A role for B cells in celiac disease pathogenesis is receiving increased recognition. This review will discuss the main discoveries in the field of T-cell and B-cell biology of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: Identify and characterize bacteria from the proximal gastrointestinal tract of pigs capable of degrading immunogenic gluten peptides. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacteria were cultured from the small intestine of pigs fed a 20% gluten diet and from an enrichment media with the 18-mer peptide LQLQPFPQPQLPYPQPQL. Isolates were screened for the production of specialized proteolytic enzymes and the ability to degrade and remove metastable peptides from alpha-gliadin (16-mer and 33-mer) and omega-gliadin (17-mer), with established roles in the aetiology of coeliac disease. Degradation was determined by ELISA and mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS in MRM mode), and hydrolysis fragments were characterized by LC-MS/MS. Four strains from the species Lactobacillus ruminis, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus amylovorus and Lactobacillus salivarius showed the highest peptide-degrading activities. Strains displayed different degradation rates and cleavage patterns that resulted in reduction but not complete removal of immunotoxic epitopes. CONCLUSIONS: We employed a unique enrichment process to select for bacteria adapted to the conditions of the proximal gastrointestinal tract with the ability to partially detoxify well-characterized peptides involved in coeliac disease. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides a basis for the selection of Lactobacillus strains for probiotic applications aimed to reduce epitope-containing gluten peptides before reaching the epithelium of the small intestine of patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIM: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with celiac disease (CD). Although gluten-free diet (GFD) is an efficient treatment for CD, IDA remains an occasional finding during follow-up and correlates to inadequate gluten exclusion. Little is known regarding persistent IDA despite effective GFD. We aimed to evaluate the role of small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) in this setting. METHODS: We prospectively included consecutive patients undergoing GFD for >/=24 months with persistent concomitant IDA. Patients were assessed serologically and, if negative, underwent endoscopic evaluation. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients underwent esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy and SBCE. Altogether, 11 patients resulted positive. EGD showed mucosal lesions in 7: erosive gastritis (n=3), erosive duodenitis (n=1), active CD (n=3). Colonoscopy showed hemorrhoids in 2. SBCE was positive in 6 cases: erosive jejunitis (n=3, 1 eventually diagnosed as refractory CD, 2 as Crohn's disease), angiodysplasias (n=2), lymphangectasia (n=1). Some overlap was observed between procedures, since in 4 subjects EGD and SBCE produced significant findings. However, in 3 cases SBCE documented severe disease, not found at EGD. Hypoalbuminemia was significantly associated with a positive SBCE outcome (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: SBCE yielded significant findings in 23% of celiacs with persistent IDA despite adequate GFD. These were associated to hypoalbuminemia, indicating their occurrence at more severe stages of the disease.},

   abstract = {Cereal crops and cereal consumption have had a vital role in Mankind's history. In the recent years gluten ingestion has been linked with a range of clinical disorders. Gluten-related disorders have gradually emerged as an epidemiologically relevant phenomenon with an estimated global prevalence around 5%. Celiac disease, wheat allergy and non-celiac gluten sensitivity represent different gluten-related disorders. Similar clinical manifestations can be observed in these disorders, yet there are peculiar pathogenetic pathways involved in their development. Celiac disease and wheat allergy have been extensively studied, while non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a relatively novel clinical entity, believed to be closely related to other gastrointestinal functional syndromes. The diagnosis of celiac disease and wheat allergy is based on a combination of findings from the patient's clinical history and specific tests, including serology and duodenal biopsies in case of celiac disease, or laboratory and functional assays for wheat allergy. On the other hand, non-celiac gluten sensitivity is still mainly a diagnosis of exclusion, in the absence of clear-cut diagnostic criteria. A multimodal pragmatic approach combining findings from the clinical history, symptoms, serological and histological tests is required in order to reach an accurate diagnosis. A thorough knowledge of the differences and overlap in clinical presentation among gluten-related disorders, and between them and other gastrointestinal disorders, will help clinicians in the process of differential diagnosis.},

   abstract = {In the last few years, a new nomenclature has been proposed for the disease induced by the ingestion of gluten, a protein present in wheat, rice, barley and oats. Besides celiac disease and wheat allergy, the most studied forms of gluten-related disorders characterized by an evident immune mechanism (autoimmune in celiac disease and IgE-mediated in wheat allergy), a new entity has been included, apparently not driven by an aberrant immune response: the non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). NCGS is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical picture with intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms arising after gluten ingestion and rapidly improving after its withdrawal from the diet. The pathogenesis of NCGS is largely unknown, but a mixture of factors such as the stimulation of the innate immune system, the direct cytotoxic effects of gluten, and probably the synergy with other wheat molecules, are clues for the complicated puzzle. In addition, the diagnostic procedures still remain problematic due to the absence of efficient diagnostic markers; thus, diagnosis is based upon the symptomatic response to a gluten-free diet and the recurrence of symptoms after gluten reintroduction with the possibility of an important involvement of a placebo effect. The temporary withdrawal of gluten seems a reasonable therapy, but the timing of gluten reintroduction and the correct patient management approach are have not yet been determined.},

   abstract = {Background and Aim. Although mercury is involved in several immunological diseases, nothing is known about its implication in celiac disease. Our aim was to evaluate blood and urinary levels of mercury in celiac patients. Methods. We prospectively enrolled 30 celiac patients (20 treated with normal duodenal mucosa and 10 untreated with duodenal atrophy) and 20 healthy controls from the same geographic area. Blood and urinary mercury concentrations were measured by means of flow injection inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Enrolled patients underwent dental chart for amalgam fillings and completed a food-frequency questionnaire to evaluate diet and fish intake. Results. Mercury blood/urinary levels were 2.4 +/- 2.3/1.0 +/- 1.4, 10.2 +/- 6.7/2.2 +/- 3.0 and 3.7 +/- 2.7/1.3 +/- 1.2 in untreated CD, treated CD, and healthy controls, respectively. Resulting mercury levels were significantly higher in celiac patients following a gluten-free diet. No differences were found regarding fish intake and number of amalgam fillings. No demographic or clinical data were significantly associated with mercury levels in biologic samples. Conclusion. Data demonstrate a fourfold increase of mercury blood levels in celiac patients following a gluten-free diet. Further studies are needed to clarify its role in celiac mechanism.},

   abstract = {Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterized by the onset of symptoms after eating gluten-containing food. We aimed to single out NCGS subjects among subjects with functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients were enrolled in a multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled trial with crossover. Symptoms and quality of life were evaluated by means of 10-cm VAS and SF36. Iron parameters, transaminases and C reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated. After a three-week-long gluten-free diet (GFD), responsive patients were randomly assigned to gluten intake (5.6 g/day) or placebo for seven days, followed by crossover. The primary endpoint was the worsening of symptoms (VAS increase >/=3 cm) during gluten ingestion compared to placebo. One hundred and forty patients were enrolled and 134 (17 males, mean age 39.1 +/- 11.7 years, BMI 22.4 +/- 3.8) completed the first period. A total of 101 subjects (10 males, mean age 39.3 +/- 11.0 years, BMI 22.3 +/- 4.0) reported a symptomatic improvement (VAS score 2.3 +/- 1.2 vs. 6.5 +/- 2.2 before and after GFD, p = 0.001). 98 patients underwent the gluten challenge and 28 (all females, mean age 38.9 +/- 12.7 years, BMI 22.0 +/- 2.9) reported a symptomatic relapse and deterioration of quality of life. No parameters were found to be statistically associated with positivity to the challenge. However, 14 patients responded to the placebo ingestion. Taking into account this finding, about 14% of patients responding to gluten withdrawal showed a symptomatic relapse during the gluten challenge. This group is suspected to have NCGS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: "Gluten-related disorders" is a term that encompasses different diseases induced by the ingestion of gluten-containing food. Because of their incidence the scientific community has been intensively studying them. AIM: To support gastroenterologists with a correct nomenclature and diagnostic approach to gluten-related disorders in adulthood. METHODS: The Italian Association of Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (AIGO) commissioned a panel of experts to prepare a position statement clarifying the nomenclature and diagnosis of gluten-related disorders, focusing on those of gastroenterological interest. Each member was assigned a task and levels of evidence/recommendation have been proposed. RESULTS: The panel identified celiac disease, wheat allergy and non-celiac gluten sensitivity as the gluten-related disorders of gastroenterological interest. Celiac disease has an autoimmune nature, wheat allergy is IgE-mediated while the pathogenesis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity is still unknown as is the case of non-IgE mediated allergy. Diagnosis should start with the serological screening for celiac disease and wheat allergy. In case of normal values, the response to a gluten-free diet should be evaluated and a confirmatory blind food challenge carried out. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-related disorders are clinically heterogeneous. Patients should be carefully managed and specific protocols applied for a correct differential diagnosis in gastroenterological setting.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is characterised by villous atrophy, which usually normalises after gluten withdrawal. Sometimes the revaluation of duodenal histology is required during follow-up, even if the methodology for comparing duodenal histology before and after introducing a gluten-free diet is not yet established. Our aim was to evaluate a novel criterion to compare duodenal histology in coeliac disease before and after gluten withdrawal. METHODS: Duodenal biopsies from coeliac patients were retrospectively reviewed to compare duodenal histology at diagnosis and after at least one year on a gluten-free diet. Two different methods were used: the first was represented by the classical Marsh-Oberhuber score, the second compared the areas covered by each Marsh-Oberhuber grade and expressed as percentages, the final grade being calculated from the analysis of ten power fields per duodenal biopsy. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients (17 males 52 females, age at diagnosis 36 +/- 15 years) who underwent duodenal biopsies, were considered. According to the classical Marsh-Oberhuber scale, 32 patients did not present atrophy during follow-up while 37 showed duodenal atrophy, among whom 26 improved the grade of severity and 11 retained the same one. Of these latter, according to the second method, eight patients were considered improved, two showed a worsened duodenal damage and only one remained unchanged; the evaluation changed in 91 % of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed semi-quantitative approach (i.e. the second method) for the evaluation of histology at follow-up provides additional information about the progression/regression of the mucosal damage.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by intermittent abdominal pain/discomfort, altered bowel habits and abdominal bloating/distension. This review aimed at presenting the recent developments concerning the role of diet in the pathophysiology and management of IBS. There is no convincing evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy/intolerance, and there is no evidence that gluten causes the debated new diagnosis of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The component in wheat that triggers symptoms in NCGS appears to be the carbohydrates. Patients with NCGS appear to be IBS patients who are self-diagnosed and self-treated with a gluten-free diet. IBS symptoms are triggered by the consumption of the poorly absorbed fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) and insoluble fibre. On reaching the distal small intestine and colon, FODMAPS and insoluble fibre increase the osmotic pressure in the large-intestine lumen and provide a substrate for bacterial fermentation, with consequent gas production, abdominal distension and abdominal pain or discomfort. Poor FODMAPS and insoluble fibres diet reduces the symptom and improve the quality of life in IBS patients. Moreover, it changes favourably the intestinal microbiota and restores the abnormalities in the gastrointestinal endocrine cells. Five gastrointestinal endocrine cell types that produce hormones regulating appetite and food intake are abnormal in IBS patients. Based on these hormonal abnormalities, one would expect that IBS patients to have increased food intake and body weight gain. However, the link between obesity and IBS is not fully studied. Individual dietary guidance for intake of poor FODMAPs and insoluble fibres diet in combination with probiotics intake and regular exercise is to be recommended for IBS patients.},

   abstract = {Wheat products make a substantial contribution to the dietary intake of many people worldwide. Despite the many beneficial aspects of consuming wheat products, it is also responsible for several diseases such as celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy, and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). CD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients have similar gastrointestinal symptoms, which can result in CD patients being misdiagnosed as having IBS. Therefore, CD should be excluded in IBS patients. A considerable proportion of CD patients suffer from IBS symptoms despite adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The inflammation caused by gluten intake may not completely subside in some CD patients. It is not clear that gluten triggers the symptoms in NCGS, but there is compelling evidence that carbohydrates (fructans and galactans) in wheat does. It is likely that NCGS patients are a group of self-diagnosed IBS patients who self-treat by adhering to a GFD.},

   abstract = {Patients with coeliac disease and myocardial infarction have a more favourable atherosclerotic risk factor profile than controls with myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, MI prognosis and treatment may differ according to coeliac status. This paper reports on the study of Swedish MI patients with and without coeliac disease (equal to villous atrophy; Marsh histopathology stage 3) based on duodenal or jejunal biopsy data. We used the Swedish Quality Register (SWEDEHEART) to identify individuals with a record of MI from 2005 to 2008 and to obtain data on medication, coronary interventions, and clinical and laboratory parameters at 6-10 weeks and one year after first MI. One-year mortality and coronary interventions were assessed for 430 coeliac patients and 1988 controls. For other outcome variables, we compared 42 coeliac patients with MI and 201 general population controls with MI. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by logistic regression. The results showed that compared with controls with MI, coeliac individuals with MI had significantly higher one-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.95) but less often underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (OR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.61-0.96). Coeliac patients were more often prescribed warfarin but less often aspirin and statins. The readmission rate due to cardiac events in coeliac patients was 15.2% vs. 12.6% in controls (p-value = 0.69). Other clinical and laboratory parameters were similar. We conclude that the follow up of MI does not seem to differ between coeliac patients and controls, and is unlikely to explain the excess mortality from cardiovascular disease noted in Swedish patients with CD.},

   abstract = {Fourteen Saharawi celiac children following an African-style gluten-free diet for at least two years were subjected to a change of diet to an Italian-style gluten-free diet for 60 days. Significant differences were identified in the salivary microbiota and metabolome when Saharawi celiac children switched from African- to Italian-style dietary habits. An Italian-style gluten-free diet caused increases in the abundance of Granulicatella, Porphyromonas and Neisseria and decreases in Clostridium, Prevotella and Veillonella, altering the 'salivary type' of the individuals. Furthermore, operational taxonomic unit co-occurrence/exclusion patterns indicated that the initial equilibrium of co-occurring microbial species was perturbed by a change in diet: the microbial diversity was reduced, with a few species out-competing the previously established microbiota and becoming dominant. Analysis of predicted metagenomes revealed a remarkable change in the metabolic potential of the microbiota following the diet change, with increased potential for amino acid, vitamin and co-factor metabolism. High concentrations of acetone and 2-butanone during treatment with the Italian-style gluten-free diet suggested metabolic dysfunction in the Saharawi celiac children. The findings of this study support the need for a translational medicine pipeline to examine interactions between food and microbiota when evaluating human development, nutritional needs and the impact and consequences of westernisation.},

A review of the current literature on this topic is provided. METHOD: PUBMED/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google scholar were searched to include all published trials on ADHD and CD (no date limitation, both noncontrolled and controlled trials). In addition, the reference list of included studies was screened to find other relevant articles. RESULTS: Eight studies report a possible association between CD and ADHD; however, the results are inconsistent. Only three out of eight studies report a positive correlation between ADHD and CD. CONCLUSION: Up till now, there is no conclusive evidence for a relationship between ADHD and CD. Therefore, it is not advised to perform routine screening of CD when assessing ADHD (and vice versa) or to implement gluten-free diet as a standard treatment in ADHD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is the most common oral intolerance in Western countries. It results from an immune response towards gluten proteins from certain cereals in genetically predisposed individuals (HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8). Its pathogenesis involves the adaptive (HLA molecules, transglutaminase 2, dendritic cells, and CD4(+) T-cells) and the innate immunity with an IL-15-mediated response elicited in the intraepithelial compartment. At present, the only treatment is a permanent strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Multidisciplinary studies have provided a deeper insight of the genetic and immunological factors and their interaction with the microbiota in the pathogenesis of the disease. Similarly, a better understanding of the composition of the toxic gluten peptides has improved the ways to detect them in food and drinks and how to monitor GFD compliance via non-invasive approaches. This review, therefore, addresses the major findings obtained in the last few years including the re-discovery of non-celiac gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {Fumonisins are mycotoxins produced by Fusarium species and affecting maize crops. Some analogues of fumonisins are known for their toxic and possible carcinogenic effects on humans and animals. Because of their occurrence in corn-based food, diet is the main source of exposure to these mycotoxins, especially among people affected by celiac disease. Hence, the purpose of this paper was to evaluate the amount of fumonisins B1, B2 and B3 in maize-based products and to assess the exposure of people affected by celiac disease to fumonisins. The sample consisted of 154 gluten-free products analyzed according to method UNI EN 14352:2005. Results showed a heterogeneous contamination by fumoninisin B1, B2 and B3, although below limits of Commission Regulation No 1126/2007 and consistent with other European literature data. Exposure to fumonisins was evaluated for different age groups. In some cases exposure to fumonisins could not be ignored since the total intake could exceed EFSA Provisional Maximum Tolerable Intake up to 150%. Therefore, in the light of an overall contamination by fumonisins the total dietary exposure could be underrated not only in people affected by celiac disease, but also in non-celiac population.},

(3) Evaluate markers of potential coeliac disease and associated autoimmunity. METHODS: Crude incidence rates in the area of Terrassa (Catalonia) were calculated. Clinical characteristics of patients in the Spanish registry were collected. Duodenal lymphocyte subpopulations and anti-TG2 IgA deposits were assessed in a subset of patients. RESULTS: Annual incidence rates (2011-2014) ranged from 0 to 22 cases per 10(4) treated patients. Twenty patients were included in the Spanish registry. Nineteen (95%) exhibited villous atrophy and 16 (80%) had severe enteropathy. Lupus-like disease occurred during olmesartan treatment in 3 patients. HLA-DQ2/DQ8 was positive in 64%. Markers of potential coeliac disease were present in 4 out of 8 patients (positive anti-TG2 deposits and/or increased CD3+gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes and reduced CD3-). Histopathological changes and clinical manifestations including autoimmune disorders improved after olmesartan discontinuation but not after gluten-free diet, irrespective of the presence or absence of coeliac markers. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of severe olmesartan-associated enteropathy was low. Autoimmune phenomena were present in a subset of cases and reversed after olmesartan removal. A genetic coeliac disease background and the presence of potential coeliac markers might uncover predisposing factors.},

   abstract = {While gluten and wheat must be absolutely avoided in coeliac disease and allergy, respectively, nutritional recommendations are largely more confused about non-coeliac wheat/gluten sensitivity (NCWGS). Today, some even recommend avoiding all cereal-based foods. In this paper, the increased NCWGS prevalence is hypothesized to parallel the use of more and more drastic processes applied to the original wheat grain. First, a parallel between gluten-related disorders and wheat processing and consumption evolution is briefly proposed. Notably, increased use of exogenous vital gluten is considered. Drastic processing in wheat technology are mainly grain fractionation and refining followed by recombination and salt, sugars and fats addition, being able to render ultra-processed cereal-based foods more prone to trigger chronic low-grade inflammation. Concerning bread, intensive kneading and the choice of wheat varieties with high baking quality may have rendered gluten less digestible, moving digestion from pancreatic to intestinal proteases. The hypothesis of a gluten resistant fraction reaching colon and interacting with microflora is also considered in relation with increased inflammation. Besides, wheat flour refining removes fiber co-passenger which have potential anti-inflammatory property able to protect digestive epithelium. Finally, some research tracks are proposed, notably the comparison of NCWGS prevalence in populations consuming ultra-versus minimally-processed cereal-based foods.},

   abstract = {During the past decade there has been an impressive increase in popularity of the gluten-free diet (GFD)-now the most trendy alimentary habit in the United States and other countries. According to recent surveys, as many as 100 million Americans will consume gluten-free products within a year. Operating under the concept that the GFD benefits only individuals with celiac disease, health care professionals have struggled to separate the wheat from the chaff; there are claims that eliminating gluten from the diet increases health and helps with weight loss, or even that gluten can be harmful to every human being. However, apart from unfounded trends, a disorder related to ingestion of gluten or gluten-containing cereals, namely nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), has resurfaced in the literature, fueling a debate on the appropriateness of the GFD for people without celiac disease. Although there is clearly a fad component to the popularity of the GFD, there is also undisputable and increasing evidence for NCGS. However, we require a better understanding of the clinical presentation of NCGS, as well as its pathogenesis, epidemiology, management, and role in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue, and autoimmunity. Before we can begin to identify and manage NCGS, there must be agreement on the nomenclature and definition of the disorder based on proper peer-reviewed scientific information. We review the most recent findings on NCGS and outline directions to dissipate some of the confusion related to this disorder.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND GOALS: There are little data examining patient satisfaction with celiac disease (CD) care. We sought to assess how satisfied patients are with their CD care, and to determine the influencing factors. STUDY: We distributed an online questionnaire to adults receiving programmatic updates from a CD referral center, querying aspects of CD care and using disease-specific validated instruments to measure quality of life and dietary adherence. The univariable and multivariable analyses were performed using satisfaction as a binary outcome comparing grouped "satisfied" and "very satisfied" respondents to "neutral," "dissatisfied," and "very dissatisfied" respondents. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-seven (22%) individuals completed the survey, and 229 met the inclusion criteria of biopsy-proven CD. Seventy-nine individuals (34.5%) reported being "very satisfied" with their CD care, 82 (35.8%) "satisfied," 46 (20.1%) "neutral," 14 (6.1%) "dissatisfied," and 8 (3.5%) "very dissatisfied." On multivariable analysis, reporting that physicians spend ample time managing CD needs (P=0.013), and having CD-antibody levels checked yearly (P=0.003), were positive predictors of patient satisfaction. Factors that were not correlated with patient satisfaction included symptom severity (P=0.268), quality of life (P=0.13), and following with a CD specialist (P=0.139). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients we surveyed were satisfied with their CD care. We found that patients report higher satisfaction when they feel physicians spend time caring for their CD needs and when they receive annual CD-antibody testing. On the basis of our study, these factors are more important than disease severity, seeing a CD specialist, and quality of life in determining patient satisfaction with CD care.},

Rare cases of chronic intussusception require investigation with greater attention. CASE REPORT:: We present a clinical case of a three-year-old boy with aqueous diarrhea, abdominal distension, vomiting and weight loss over a two-month period. During the investigation, abdominal ultrasound showed imaging of intussusception. The intraoperative findings showed the intussusception had resolved spontaneously. In further investigation, it was found that the diarrhea was malabsorptive and, after the patient underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, a diagnosis of celiac disease was made. After a gluten-free diet was introduced, the patient showed complete remission of symptoms and regained weight, and normal growth was reestablished. CONCLUSION:: If the clinical presentation of intussusception is unusual, etiological investigation should be undertaken. In this case report, celiac disease was the underlying cause.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of mixture of sorghum-rice-corn flour and potato starch in the development of gluten-free pasta for celiac disease patients. The experiment was designed according to simplex-lattice method and different types of gluten-free flours were used, such as sorghum, rice, corn, and potato starch. The fifteen formulations were subjected to sensory analysis (Mixed Structured Scale - MSS) and seven formulations were selected in respect to taste and grittiness. These formulations were subjected to Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA), which evaluated the attributes: appearance, color, odor, hardness, elasticity, stickiness, grittiness, taste, residual bitterness and overall quality. Results showed significant difference in appearance, color and hardness. The formulations that showed the best sensory results were submitted to chemical analysis and cooking quality of pasta. It was observed that the best results for mixing is sorghum flour, rice flour and potato starch.},

   abstract = {Nutrition and growth during early infancy influence later health and development, but most research has focused on the period of milk feeding, and the possibility that the timing, content or method of complementary feeding (CF) might have similar later effects has received less attention. Such effects are plausible, given that the CF period is one of rapid growth and development when infants are susceptible to nutrient deficiencies and excesses, and during which there are marked changes in diet with exposure to many new foods, tastes and feeding experiences. CF practices could influence later outcome by several potential mechanisms, including programming effects, but also direct effects on food preferences, appetite and eating behavior. Investigating these issues is challenging given the diversity and complexity of CF practices, which limit the feasibility and generalizability of randomized trials in this field. Available evidence relating CF practices to later health and development are currently limited in quantity and quality, but suggest that avoiding the introduction of solid foods before 4 months may reduce the risk of subsequent obesity and allergy. Whilst recommendations for different aspects of CF may be developed in the future based on broad principles, they will need to be tailored for different populations.},

The aim of the current work is to report a case of possible refractory encephalitis due to celiac disease. CASE REPORT: A 45 years-old man with histopathologic diagnosis of celiac disease but negative celiac antibodies developed encephalic, brainstem and periphery nervous system manifestations: cognitive declaim and seizures, diplopia and ataxia, polyneuropathy and polyradiculopathy respectively; inflammatory cebrospinal fluid and cortico-subcortical and multiple brainstem lesions with mild contrast enhancement; the neurologic deficits progress in spite of gluten a free diet and immuno-suppressive treatment. During the illness process some pathologies with nervous system and intestinal involvement were discarded: sarcoidosis, systemic lupus; Sjogren syndrome, paraneoplastic syndromes, Whipple disease, AIDS and B12 vitamin deficit. CONCLUSION: The encephalitis is an infrequent clinical manifestation of the celiac disease despite the high prevalence of the celiac disease in the general population. It presents with numerous differential diagnosis, with requires high suspicious diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Links between IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and the mucosa have been recognized since the 1970s. In particular, the observation of visible haematuria induced by respiratory infections in patients with IgAN and the association of IgAN with diseases in which the mucosa plays a part, especially coeliac disease, have been taken as evidence of a mucosa-kidney axis. Here, we review current evidence that links the mucosa, in particular the gastrointestinal mucosa, and IgA produced by the bone marrow with IgAN. Genome-wide association studies in patients with IgAN have identified risk loci in genes involved in the intestinal mucosal integrity and immune network. Furthermore, the systemic immune response to mucosal antigens in IgAN is increased. Moreover, patients with IgAN have an increased reactivity to dietary proteins associated with subclinical intestinal mucosal inflammation. Associations between IgAN and gastrointestinal diseases have also been reported in a small number of patients, but whether these diseases share a common pathogenesis or whether gastrointestinal inflammation exacerbates IgAN is uncertain. Indeed, mucosal alterations such as infections could activate the innate immune system, aggravate a pre-existing IgAN and promote disease manifestations such as macrohaematuria. Various clinical interventions and trials targeting the mucosa or presumed mucosa-associated mechanisms have so far not yielded consistent findings and the results of ongoing trials are eagerly awaited.},

Snack foods are consumed worldwide and have become a normal part of the eating habits of the celiac population making them a target to improve their nutritive value. Extrusion and deep-frying of unripe plantain, chickpea, and maize flours blends produced gluten-free snacks with high dietary fiber contents (13.7-18.2 g/100 g) and low predicted glycemic index (28 to 35). The gluten-free snacks presented lower fat content (12.7 to 13.6 g/100 g) than those reported in similar commercial snacks. The snack with the highest unripe plantain flour showed higher slowly digestible starch (11.6 and 13.4 g/100 g) than its counterpart with the highest chickpea flour level (6 g/100 g). The overall acceptability of the gluten-free snacks was similar to that chili-flavored commercial snack. It was possible to develop gluten-free snacks with high dietary fiber content and low predicted glycemic index with the blend of the 3 flours, and these gluten-free snacks may also be useful as an alternative to reduce excess weight and obesity problems in the general population and celiac community.},

The authors identify a particular exclusionary-type approach that seeks to eliminate dietary gluten. Although the relationship between celiac disease (CD) and ADHD/ASD is not well established, a repeated clinical feature noted in CD is the elevated levels of nitric oxide in serum and urine. Elevated oxidative stress has also been observed in neurodevelopmental conditions, and the author of this correspondence has been the first to propose that chronic, environmental exposure to the air pollutant, nitrous oxide may contribute to these oxidative stress profiles through neural cholinergic perturbation. Therefore, the purpose of this correspondence is to highlight this biochemical connection between these conditions so as to identify the clinical populations who may realize the greatest benefit of these dietary approaches, while minimizing any potential risk of nutrient deficiencies.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated genetic condition elicited by the ingestion of gluten, leading to proximal small bowel enteropathy. It affects around 1% of the population, although only a small proportion of cases are actually diagnosed. It is a multisystem disorder presenting with both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal manifestations such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting, iron deficiency anaemia, faltering growth, dental enamel defects, short stature, liver disease, arthropathy and recurrent aphthous ulcers. Nurses, working in different clinical settings, are best placed for early recognition and diagnosis of CD in children. Suspicion of CD should lead to immunoglobulin A (IgA)-based anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody screening tests and a diagnosis confirmed by an intestinal biopsy. Modification of European (ESPGHAN) guidelines now enables CD to be diagnosed without a small-bowel biopsy in a select group of symptomatic children. A gluten-free diet should preferably be started by paediatric dietitians. Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is essential to maintain good health and to prevent long-term complications. A case study demonstrating some of the challenges that may be faced in children with CD in clinical practice is described. Specialist nurse-led CD clinics are gaining popularity and have been found to be equally effective in providing continuity of quality care.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A gluten-free diet (GFD) may carry high energy and fat load. We verified lipid profile and dietary indicators cross-sectionally and prospectively in patients with celiac disease (CD). METHODS: In any consecutive child receiving a GFD (group 1) or newly diagnosed as having CD (group 2), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, blood pressure (BP), anthropometric data, physical activity, and a 24-hour food diary were collected during follow-up visits (yearly in group 1 and during the first year of GFD in group 2). RESULTS: In group 1 (132 girls, 73 boys, 10.7 +/- 4.2 years), TC (P = 0.006), TG (P = 0.014), and HDL (P = 0.019) were significantly higher in girls than in boys. Compared with the general pediatric population, group 1 girls had higher TC, TG, HDL, and low-density lipoprotein; group 1 boys had lower TC, TG, and low-density lipoprotein and higher HDL. TC was significantly and positively affected by age, sex, and time receiving GFD, whereas HDL was significantly and positively affected by body mass index, diastolic BP, and sex; TG was negatively affected by diastolic BP. Compared with recommendations, group 1 children introduced less calories, iron, and calcium; one-third more sodium; similar amounts of fiber; and twice as many proteins. In group 2 (20 girls, 10 boys, 8.6 +/- 3.55 years), TC did not change over time and TG diminished, whereas HDL, blood glucose, and body mass index increased; saturated fats and caloric intake were below recommendations, whereas proteins were excessively introduced. Fibers were optimal. HDL was inversely correlated to calories and saturated fat (R(2) = 80, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Lipid profiles of children with CD differ across sexes and from reference population. GFD, being unexpectedly appropriate in fibers and fat proportion, may be a contributor.},

There was complete clinical and biochemical remission of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis following the introduction of a gluten-free diet. CASE PRESENTATION: A 7-year-old white girl presented with fevers and maculopapular rash with a recent history of tonsillitis. Blood tests revealed thrombocytopenia (64x109/L), anemia (80 g/L), hypofibrinogenemia (1 g/L), and hyperferritinemia (71,378 mug/L). A bone marrow revealed evidence of hemophagocytosis, but the results of tests for the genetic or familial-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndromes were negative. The results of screening tests for known secondary causes were negative. She was diagnosed as having hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and following treatment with the hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-2004 protocol these symptoms, in addition to the biochemical and hematological markers, completely resolved. She presented again 10 months later with fever, rash, and biochemical abnormalities suggestive of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Her tissue transglutaminase was markedly raised and the results of blood tests revealed a genetic susceptibly to coeliac disease in the form of HLA-DQ2 positivity. She commenced a gluten-free diet and there was complete symptomatic and biochemical response without any further chemotherapy. She had further episodic rashes, each associated with the accidental intake of gluten. CONCLUSIONS: This is to the best of our knowledge the first documented case of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in association with coeliac disease. No other secondary cause found; she initially responded to chemoimmunotherapy specific for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis but relapsed within a few months of cessation of treatment and then achieved complete remission on gluten withdrawal alone.},

   abstract = {The market of gluten-free bakery products is considerably growing since better diagnostic methods allow identifying an increasing number of people suffering coeliac disease and other gluten-related disorders such as dermatitis herpetiformis, gluten ataxia, wheat allergy and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity. The only and safe treatment available nowadays for these types of disorders is to follow a strict and permanent lifelong gluten-free diet. Beside the people needing to follow a gluten-free diet for health reasons, a new segment of consumers has arisen who consume gluten-free products as a lifestyle choice. Among the bakery products, bread is a major staple food consumed daily all over the world. The dough and bread quality characteristics (such as gas retaining ability, mixing tolerance, resistance to stretch and extensibility and crumb structure) are mostly attributed to the presence of gluten. Despite the improved quality of gluten-free breads in the last number of years, most products on the market are still described as low quality product. In addition to the low overall quality of gluten-free products, the nutritional value of a large number of them is quite poor. In this context, this review gives an overview on the consumers, which need to follow a gluten-free diet for health reasons. The trends in this gluten-free bakery segment will also be reviewed based on the current analysis of marketing studies. An overview of the major ingredients used in gluten-free bread products will be given. The choice of the ingredients discussed in this paper is based on a comprehensive study of the leading gluten-free breads available on the market, as well as a detailed study of the scientific literature. The impact of the various ingredients on bread-making process and bread quality is also part of this review. Major emphasis will be placed on the application of sourdough as a means to improve gluten-free bread quality.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic genetically based gluten-sensitive immune-mediated enteropathic process primarily affecting the small intestinal mucosa. The disorder classically presents with diarrhea and weight loss; however, more recently, it has been characterized by subclinical occult or latent disease associated with few or no intestinal symptoms. Diagnosis depends on the detection of typical histopathological biopsy changes followed by a gluten-free diet response. A broad range of clinical disorders may mimic celiac disease, along with a wide range of drugs and other therapeutic agents. Recent and intriguing archeological data, largely from the Gobleki Tepe region of the Fertile Crescent, indicate that celiac disease probably emerged as humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer groups to societies dependent on agriculture to secure a stable food supply. Longitudinal studies per-formed over several decades have suggested that changes in the prevalence of the disease, even apparent epidemic disease, may be due to superimposed or novel environmental factors that may precipitate its appearance. Recent therapeutic approaches are being explored that may supplement, rather than replace, gluten-free diet therapy and permit more nutritional options for future management.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated gluten-dependent disorder, primarily affecting the small intestine in genetically predisposed individuals. The disorder has a very heterogeneous clinical and histopathological spectrum. Current treatment with a gluten-free diet is very effective, but the diet is difficult to maintain and remains costly. AREAS COVERED: Alternatives to the gluten-free diet have been proposed to either replace this current treatment, or at least, to supplement use of the gluten-free diet. Studies in the published English language literature relevant to this review were examined for this report. EXPERT OPINION: Most recent published double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials have focused on an orally administered recombinant glutenase (ALV003) showing significant but limited benefit to celiac disease patients already compliant with a gluten-free diet. Other studies have addressed other immune mechanisms that may play a role in its pathogenesis and have not been so positive. Added investigations, particularly over the long-term, in other larger and more heterogeneous populations are needed.},

   abstract = {Iron is an important micronutrient that may be depleted in celiac disease. Iron deficiency and anemia may complicate well-established celiac disease, but may also be the presenting clinical feature in the absence of diarrhea or weight loss. If iron deficiency anemia occurs, it should be thoroughly evaluated, even if celiac disease has been defined since other superimposed causes of iron deficiency anemia may be present. Most often, impaired duodenal mucosal uptake of iron is evident since surface absorptive area in the duodenum is reduced, in large part, because celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder largely focused in the proximal small intestinal mucosa. Some studies have also suggested that blood loss may occur in celiac disease, sometimes from superimposed small intestinal disorders, including ulceration or neoplastic diseases, particularly lymphoma. In addition, other associated gastric or colonic disorders may be responsible for blood loss. Rarely, an immune-mediated hemolytic disorder with increased urine iron loss may occur that may respond to a gluten-free diet. Reduced expression of different regulatory proteins critical in iron uptake has also been defined in the presence and absence of anemia. Finally, other rare causes of microcytic anemia may occur in celiac disease, including a sideroblastic form of anemia reported to have responded to a gluten-free diet.},

Often, one or more associated endocrine disorders may be associated with CD. For this review, methods involved an extensive review of published English-language materials. In children and adolescents, prospective studies have demonstrated a significant relationship to insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes, whereas in adults, autoimmune forms of thyroid disease, particularly hypothyroidism, may commonly co-exist. In some with CD, multiple glandular endocrinopathies may also occur and complicate the initial presentation of the intestinal disease. In others presenting with an apparent isolated endocrine disorder, serological screening for underlying subclinical CD may prove to be positive, particularly if type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid or other autoimmune endocrine diseases, such as Addison's disease are first detected. A number of reports have also recorded hypoparathyroidism or hypopituitarism or ovarian failure in CD and these may be improved with a strict gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {The association of diarrhea with diabetes mellitus has been known for more than 70 years. In diabetic patients its prevalence is around 20%.Its clinical manifestations are diverse, and represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.There are certain diagnoses of higher prevalence in diabetic patients than in the general population.The different related etiologies can be adequately diagnosed through the clinical history and complementary diagnostic tests.The medications used by the diabetic patient to manage their disease often cause chronic diarrhea, so the pharmacological background should be studied at the time of the study of diarrhea.Diabetic patients can present other associated pathological conditions, such as celiac disease or microscopic colitis, which only discomfort is diarrhea.Exocrine pancreatic function may be decreased in the diabetic patient, frequently leading to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Dietary factors, such as sugar-free sweeteners and other agents, can cause diarrhea in the diabetic patient.The presence of conditions such as autonomic neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes mellitus may explain disorders such as anorectal dysfunction and faecal incontinence. Finally, diabetic enteropathy alone or with associated bacterial overgrowth can cause diarrhea.Achieving adequate glycemic control is the pillar of the treatment of diarrhea in the diabetic, after which there are additional measures that are applied according to the specific context of the patient.This article reviews the causes of higher diarrhea incidence in the diabetic patient and the pathophysiological mechanisms involved.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A gluten-free diet is to date the only treatment available to celiac disease sufferers. However, systematic reviews indicate that, depending on the method of evaluation used, only 42% to 91% of patients adhere to the diet strictly. Transculturally adapted tools that evaluate adherence beyond simple self-informed questions or invasive analyses are, therefore, of importance. The aim is to obtain a Spanish transcultural adaption and validation of Leffler's Celiac Dietary Adherence Test. METHODS: A two-stage observational transversal study: translation and back translation by four qualified translators followed by a validation stage in which the questionnaire was administered to 306 celiac disease patients aged between 12 and 72 years and resident in Aragon. Factorial structure, criteria validity and internal consistency were evaluated. RESULTS: The Spanish version maintained the 7 items in a 3-factor structure. Reliability was very high in all the questions answered and the floor and ceiling effects were very low (4.3% and 1%, respectively). The Spearman correlation with the self-efficacy and life quality scales and the self-informed question were statistically significant (p < 0.01). According to the questionnaire criteria, adherence was 72.3%. CONCLUSION: The Spanish version of the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test shows appropriate psychometric properties and is, therefore, suitable for studying adherence to a gluten-free diet in clinical and research environments.},

   abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Gluten sensitivity can cause neurologic manifestations, such as ataxia or neuropathy, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms. Many patients with gluten ataxia produce antibodies toward the newly identified neuronal transglutaminase 6 (TG6). Two case reports described patients initially diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ultimately with celiac disease who improved with a strict gluten-free diet. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of celiac disease-related antibodies and HLA antigen alleles, as well as TG6 antibodies, in patients with ALS and healthy individuals serving as controls to determine whether a neurologic presentation of a gluten-related disorder mimicking ALS might occur in some patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a case-control study conducted in an ALS tertiary center, we measured serum levels of total IgA antibodies, IgA antibodies to transglutaminase 2 (TG2) and endomysium, as well as IgA and IgG antibodies to deamidated gliadine peptide and TG6 and performed HLA antigen genotyping in 150 consecutive patients with ALS and 115 healthy volunteers of similar age and sex. Participants did not have any known autoimmune or gastroenterologic disorder and were not receiving any immunomodulatory medications. The study was conducted from July 1, 2010, to December 31, 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Antibody levels and frequency of individuals with abnormal antibody values as well as frequency of HLA antigen alleles were compared between patient and control groups. RESULTS: All patients and control group participants were seronegative to IgA antibodies to TG2, endomysium, and deamidated gliadine peptide. Twenty-three patients (15.3%) were seropositive to TG6 IgA antibodies as opposed to only 5 controls (4.3%) (P = .004). The patients seropositive for TG6 showed a classic picture of ALS, similar to that of seronegative patients. Fifty patients and 20 controls were tested for celiac disease-specific HLA antigen alleles; 13 of 22 TG6 IgA seropositive individuals (59.1%) were seropositive for celiac disease-related alleles compared with 8 (28.6%) of the 28 seronegative individuals (P = .04). Mean (SD) levels of IgA antibodies to TG2 were 1.78 (0.73) in patients and 1.58 (0.68) in controls (normal, <10). In a subset of study participants, mean levels of deamidated gliadin peptide autoantibodies were 7.46 (6.92) in patients and 6.08 (3.90) in controls (normal, <16). Mean levels of IgA antibodies to TG6 were 29.3 (30.1) in patients and 21.0 (27.4) in controls (P = .02; normal, <26). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The data from this study indicate that, in certain cases, an ALS syndrome might be associated with autoimmunity and gluten sensitivity. Although the data are preliminary and need replication, gluten sensitivity is potentially treatable; therefore, this diagnostic challenge should not be overlooked.},

It is used for a broad range of applications, including quantification of gene expression, measuring RNA interference, biomarker discovery, pathogen detection, and drug target validation. When studying gene expression with qPCR, scientists usually investigate changes-increases or decreases-in the quantity of particular gene products or a set of gene products. Investigations typically evaluate gene response to biological conditions such as disease states, exposure to pathogens or chemical compounds, organ or tissue location, and cell cycle or differentiation status. Here we describe this technique applied to molecular profiling of candidate genes in celiac biopsies and peripheral blood monocytes. Using data obtained by gene expression experiments, a discriminant equation has been developed that allows the correct classification of Celiac Disease (CD) patients compared to healthy controls, CD patients on a Gluten Free Diet (GFD), and other disease controls.},

During the surgery, we found a tumor on the small intestine with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Histology and immunohistochemistry of the specimen objectified a digestive T lymphoma CD3+ and immunological assessment of celiac disease was positive. The diagnosis of EATL was thus retained. Chemotherapy (CHOEP protocol) was established as well as gluten-free diet with a complete response to treatment. The EATL is a rare complication of CD that can be revealed by intestinal obstruction. The prognosis can be improved by early treatment involving surgery and chemotherapy. Its prevention requires early diagnosis of celiac and gluten-free diets.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The aim of this work was to assess the ability of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to distinguish wheat lines with low gliadin content, obtained by RNA interference (RNAi), from non-transgenic wheat lines. The discriminant analysis was performed using both whole grain and flour. The transgenic sample set included 409 samples for whole grain sorting and 414 samples for flour experiments, while the non-transgenic set consisted of 126 and 156 samples for whole grain and flour, respectively. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples were scanned using a Foss-NIR Systems 6500 System II instrument. Discrimination models were developed using the entire spectral range (400-2500 nm) and ranges of 400-780 nm, 800-1098 nm and 1100-2500 nm, followed by analysis of means of partial least square (PLS). Two external validations were made, using samples from the years 2013 and 2014 and a minimum of 99% of the flour samples and 96% of the whole grain samples were classified correctly. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the ability of NIRS to successfully discriminate between wheat samples with low-gliadin content and wild types. These findings are important for the development and analysis of foodstuff for celiac disease (CD) patients to achieve better dietary composition and a reduction in disease incidence.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic disorder elicited by gluten and related prolamines in genetically susceptible individuals and is characterized by the presence of a variable combination of gluten-dependent clinical manifestations, CD-specific antibodies, HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes and enteropathy. CD is triggered by wheat gluten and related prolamines in barley and rye. Worldwide, the disease affects approximately 1 % of the general population. Clinical features of CD vary considerably. Intestinal symptoms are more common in young children. In older children extra intestinal manifestations affecting almost all organs are seen. IgA tTG antibody, upper GI endoscopy with histological analysis of multiple biopsies of the duodenum and in selected cases HLA DQ2 and DQ8 positivity and endomysial antibodies (EMA) are needed for diagnosis. Currently, the only treatment for CD is a life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). Strict avoidance of wheat, rye, barley and their derivatives will result in intestinal healing and relief of symptoms for the majority of individuals with CD. The GFD is simple in principle, however, completely eliminating all foods and ingredients containing wheat, rye, barley, and most commercial oats can be very challenging. Newly diagnosed CD children should undergo testing and treatment for micronutrient deficiencies specially iron, folic acid, vitamin D, and vitamin B12. Long-term monitoring and follow up of patients with CD is necessary.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy. The only known treatment consists of a permanent adherence to a strict gluten-free diet, which represents an important challenge for patients. Objective. To describe the gluten-free processed food offer in food locals from 3 neighborhoods representative of high, middle and low economic status in Buenos Aires, Argentina. METHODS: Cross-sectional study. Specially trained monitors performed a standardized direct assessment of food locals. Whenever direct observation was not possible, we interviewed the personnel as an indirect assessment. We classified dish offer in different categories, and evaluated the processes of food elaboration, storage and distribution. RESULTS: We included 112 food locals. Results for neighborhoods representative of high, middle and low economic status were, respectively: no gluten free dish available in 27.5% (45/62), 27.0% (27/37) and 30.8% (9/13), (p = 0.96); adequate elaboration in 17.7%, 13.5% and 7.7%, (p = 0.61); appropriate food storage in 12.9% (8), 13.5% (5) and 7.7% (1); (p = 0.85); adequate distribution in 8.1%, 8.1% and 0% (0), (p = 0.56). Conclusion. In 1 out of 4 food locals there was not even one gluten free dish. In addition, there was a lack of compliance with safety measures to avoid gluten cross-contamination.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy, triggered by ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Since the use of anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysium antibodies in the early 1990s, two main groups of clinical presentation can be identified: patients with a symptomatic form of the disease, and patients with a pauci (a)-symptomatic form detected during the work-up of another autoimmune disease or due to a family history of celiac disease. The prevalence of both forms of the disease is currently estimated between 1/100 and 1/400. Classical form of the disease is characterized by occurrence of diarrhoea, failure to thrive, and abdominal bloating in young infants in the months following gluten introduction. Serological tests show high level of anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysium antibodies. Until recently, the diagnosis required duodenal biopsies that show villous atrophy. HLA genotype can help for diagnosis: the absence of the HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 alleles has a high negative predictive value. European guidelines recently proposed to reconsider the need for systematic endoscopy in typical symptomatic forms with high level of anti-transglutaminase and positive anti-endomysium. These recommendations are being assessed now. Currently, the gluten-free diet remains the only effective treatment for celiac disease. Children with celiac disease have to exclude from their diet all products containing wheat, barley and rye. Gluten-free diet causes clinical remission within a few weeks, but normalization of the small bowel mucosa and negativity of anti-transglutaminase antibodies are obtained in several months or even years. Gluten-free diet is useful to obtain clinical assessment, but also to prevent long-term complications of celiac disease, mainly osteoporosis, other autoimmune diseases, decreased fertility and cancers.},

We report the case of a 20-year-old female presenting with diarrhea due to celiac disease and biopsy proven cirrhosis with portal hypertension who had a remarkable clinical improvement in response to a gluten free diet (GFD). A follow-up liver biopsy 9 months after the initiation of GFD revealed a remarkable regression of both fibrosis as well as steatosis. Villous atrophy, as seen in patients with celiac disease, could lead to a deprivation of trophic factors leading to liver injury and subsequent cirrhosis. A gluten-free dietary regimen can produce a reversal of fibrosis leading to the amelioration of symptoms associated even with advanced liver disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical features of different racial patients with celiac disease (CD) and analyze the disease prevalence, diagnosis and treatment in Chinese population. METHODS: All the patients were diagnosed as CD and enrolled in Beijing United Family Hospital between January 2005 and July 2015.Clinical data including nationality, age, symptoms, endoscopic and pathological findings, outcome were collected and compared in patients from different countries. RESULTS: A total of 87 patients were enrolled including 63 Caucasians, 18 Asian patients and 6 Middle East patients.The peak age of disease onset was 40-60 years old.Patients with typical symptoms such as chronic diarrhea and weight loss only accounted for 20.7%(18/87) and 9.2%(8/87) respectively.Some patients presented with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloating [32.2%(28/87)], even constipation [5.7%(5/87)].13.8%(12/87) patients were previously diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.The incidence of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and constipation between Asians and Caucasians had no statistical significance (P>0.05); but the proportions of weight loss, growth retardation, iron deficiency anemia and dermatitis herpetiformis in Asian group were significantly higher than that in Caucasian group (P<0.05). IgA type of anti-gliadin antibody (AGA), endomysium antibody (EMA) and tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTGA) were dominant autoimmune antibodies in patients with CD, which accounted for 58.6%(51/87), 44.8%(39/87) and 36.8%(32/87) respectively.The endoscopy showed that the lesion of CD was mainly located in small intestine, with reducing severity from the proximal to the distal small intestine.The lesions of duodenal bulb and descending duodenum appeared more significant in Asian group.Accordingly pathological intestinal atrophy and the degree of intraepithelial lymphocytosis were more severe in Asian patients.All 87 cases took the gluten-free diet (GFD). Eighty-one cases received serological follow up and 8 with endoscopic intestinal biopsy.The celiac disease antibodies in 47 patients turned negative from 6-9 months after GFD treatment, while 34 patients turned negative from 12-18 months after GFD.All patients reported disease remission to some extent.After 1 year GFD treatment, the pathology of endoscopic intestinal biopsy in 8 patients showed significant improvement of villous atrophy and lymphocyte infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients with typical clinical manifestations are not the majority.Serological celiac disease antibodies (AGA, EMA and tTGA) have a high diagnostic value.GFD treatment is effective on majority of celiac patients.Clinical manifestations, endoscopy, intestinal pathology, and response to GFD in Chinese patients are not the same as Caucasians.Clinicians need to pay attention to the differential diagnosis.},

   abstract = {In assessing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), its diverse etiologies and the heterogeneous population affected should be considered. Diagnosing this condition remains a challenge in clinical practice especially for mild-to-moderate EPI, with the support of the time-consuming breath test or the coefficient of fat absorption. The fecal elastase-1 test, less precise for the diagnosis, cannot be useful for assessing treatment efficacy. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is the mainstay of treatment, whereby enteric-coated mini-microspheres are taken with every meal, in progressive doses based on an individual's weight and clinical symptoms. The main indication for PERT is chronic pancreatitis, in patients who have clinically relevant steatorrhea, abnormal pancreatic function test or abnormal function tests associated with symptoms of malabsorption such as weight loss or meteorism. While enzyme replacement therapy is not recommended in the initial stages of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic exocrine function should be monitored for at least 6-18 months. In the case of unresectable pancreatic cancer, replacement enzyme therapy helps to maintain weight and improve overall quality of life. It is also indicated in patients with celiac disease, who have chronic diarrhea (in spite of gluten-free diet), and in patients with cystic fibrosis with proven EPI.},

Recent investigations have highlighted the potential of helminth therapy for treating a range of inflammatory disorders, including celiac disease (CeD); however, the mechanisms by which helminths modulate the immune response of the human host and ameliorate CeD pathology are unknown. In this study, we investigated the potential role of alterations in the human gut microbiota in helminth-mediated suppression of an inflammatory disease. We assessed the qualitative and quantitative changes in the microbiota of human volunteers with CeD prior to and following infection with human hookworms, and following challenge with escalating doses of dietary gluten. Experimental hookworm infection of the trial subjects resulted in maintenance of the composition of the intestinal flora, even after a moderate gluten challenge. Notably, we observed a significant increase in microbial species richness over the course of the trial, which could represent a potential mechanism by which hookworms can regulate gluten-induced inflammation and maintain intestinal immune homeostasis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A transient dysfunction of the endocrine growth axis has been reported in celiac disease (CD). This apparent growth hormone deficiency (GHD) generally normalizes with the institution of a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, in few cases, the dysfunction of the GH axis persists despite a good adherence to the GFD. Aims of this study were to investigate pediatric patients with concurrent CD and GHD and to compare them with patients with isolated CD. METHODS: Data regarding CD patients with and without associated GHD were retrospectively collected. Inclusion criteria were availability of anthropometric and laboratory data at baseline and regularly at the reference center up to a 2-year follow-up. In case of poor catch-up growth despite a good adherence to the GFD, endocrinological investigation was carried on. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients with CD were included. Four (7.5%) out of 53 CD patients had a concurrent GHD. In two cases, firstly diagnosed with CD, GHD was suspected because of a poor catch-up growth despite a good adherence to the GFD. In two other cases, firstly diagnosed with GHD, gastrointestinal symptoms revealed the diagnosis of CD. Normalization of height velocity was achieved by GH treatment in all cases. No statistical significant difference between the two groups of patients was found as regard laboratory and histological features of CD. It is to note that 2 out of 4 patients with concomitant CD and GHD had thyroiditis compared to 6% of patients with isolated CD (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of CD and GHD association was found. CD patients with poor catch-up growth despite a good adherence to the GFD should be carefully investigated for endocrine disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: While it is well documented and widely appreciated that ingestion of wheat (and less so rye and barley) is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating or abdominal pain, the component of wheat to which such an effect is attributed is less well established. KEY MESSAGES: Wheat is a complex of proteins (80% gluten, 20% metabolic proteins), carbohydrates (starch, non-starch polysaccharides, fructans), lipids and other components. The majority of attention has focused on gluten as the culprit in triggering symptoms, but re-challenge studies have nearly all used wheat flour-related products (such as bread) as the stimulus. When carbohydrate-deplete gluten was used as the challenge agent, gluten-specific feelings of depression and not gut symptoms were observed in those who fulfilled strict criteria of 'non-coeliac gluten sensitivity', thereby underlining the complexity of cereals and of undertaking research in this area. Candidate components other than gluten include poorly absorbed oligosaccharides (mainly fructans), non-gluten wheat proteins such as amylase-trypsin inhibitors or wheat germ agglutinin, and exorphins released during the digestion of gluten. Specific biological and/or clinical effects associated with gluten-free diets or wheat ingestion need to be carefully dissected before attribution to gluten can be claimed. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, coeliac disease is the only common condition that has been unequivocally linked to gluten. Inaccurate attribution will be associated with suboptimal therapeutic advice and at least partly underlies the current gluten-free epidemic gripping the Western world.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We retrospectively examined the performance of the tissue transglutaminase (TTG), endomysial antibody (EMA) tests, and the ESPGHAN (European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) nonbiopsy criteria in a pediatric population. METHODS: Consecutive celiac serologies and corresponding intestinal biopsy results were obtained on children <18 years old over 3.5 years. Patients were classified into three categories: positive TTG, negative TTG, and IgA deficiency. RESULTS: Of the 17,505 patients with celiac serology performed, 775 had a positive TTG, 574 with a negative TTG were biopsied, and 25 were IgA deficient. Of the patients with a TTG >/=10 x upper limit of normal (ULN), positive EMA, and symptoms, 98.2% had biopsies consistent with celiac disease (CD). Four human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8-positive patients who met the ESPGHAN nonbiopsy criteria did not have CD. In the group with a TTG 3-10 x ULN, 75.7% EMA-positive patients and only 40% EMA-negative patients had CD (P<0.001). Of those with a TTG 1-3 x ULN, 52.2% EMA-positive patients vs. only 13.3% EMA-negative patients had CD (P<0.01). Of the patients with bulbar and duodenal biopsies, 9.8% had CD confined only in the bulb, especially those with a low titer TTG (P<0.01). CD prevalence in our cohort was 34.6%. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the TTG were 98.7%, 86.4%, and 79.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The TTG is a very sensitive screen for CD, but positive predictive value improves with a positive EMA titer. To apply the new ESPGHAN guidelines, clinicians must understand the performance of their celiac serology tests.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although pasta is one of the most widely demanded products among gluten-intolerant people, few studies have focused on the sensory analysis and acceptability of these products. Spaghetti was made from Andean corn (Zea mays var. amylacea), capia and cully varieties from northern Argentina, and the flash profile technique was applied by semi-trained assessors to compare the sensory profile of this type of spaghetti with those made with rice and wheat flours. Acceptability of capia corn spaghetti was studied in celiac and non-celiac consumer groups using a 9-point hedonic scale and check-all-that-apply (CATA) questions. RESULTS: Two Andean corn spaghetti samples were described by assessors as rough, odd-smelling and odd-tasting. These terms were also used by non-celiac consumers to describe the capia corn spaghetti sample, which explained its low acceptability scores. However, celiac consumers assigned high acceptability scores to the same sample and described it as tasty, smooth, tender, novel, having a pleasant flavor and good quality, and as a product that can be consumed every day and by the whole family. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that Andean corn flours are a suitable and acceptable product for celiac consumers and can be used in the production of spaghetti for celiac consumers but should be reformulated for non-celiac consumers.},

   abstract = {In the present narrative review, we analyzed the relationship between seronegative celiac disease (SNCD) and immunoglobulin deficiencies. For this purpose, we conducted a literature search on the main medical databases. SNCD poses a diagnostic dilemma. Villous blunting, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) count and gluten "challenge" are the most reliable markers. Immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-targeted mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune complexes in the intestinal mucosa of SNCD patients may be useful. In our experience, tTG-mRNA was similarly increased in seropositive celiac disease (CD) and suspected SNCD, and strongly correlated with the IELs count. This increase is found even in the IELs' range of 15-25/100 enterocytes, suggesting that there may be a "grey zone" of gluten-related disorders. An immune deregulation (severely lacking B-cell differentiation) underlies the association of SNCD with immunoglobulin deficiencies. Therefore, CD may be linked to autoimmune disorders and immune deficits (common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)/IgA selective deficiency). CVID is a heterogeneous group of antibodies dysfunction, whose association with CD is demonstrated only by the response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). We hypothesized a familial inheritance between CD and CVID. Selective IgA deficiency, commonly associated with CD, accounts for IgA-tTG seronegativity. Selective IgM deficiency (sIgMD) is rare (<300 cases) and associated to CD in 5% of cases. We diagnosed SNCD in a patient affected by sIgMD using the tTG-mRNA assay. One-year GFD induced IgM restoration. This evidence, supporting a link between SNCD and immunoglobulin deficiencies, suggests that we should take a closer look at this association.},

   abstract = {The existing guidelines on screening and treatment are confusing because different guidelines target different populations. The IOM and AAP guidelines target generally healthy populations, whereas the Endocrine Society and other subspecialty guidelines target individuals with specific medical conditions associated with increased bone fragility. These distinctions have not always been well articulated. For healthy adolescents, the AAP does not recommend universal screening or screening of obese or dark-skinned individuals. Increased dietary intake of vitamin D is recommended, and vitamin D supplementation can be considered if the RDA cannot be met. For adolescents with chronic medical illnesses associated with increased fracture risk, screening for vitamin D deficiency should be performed by obtaining a serum 25-OHD level. Those found to be deficient (25-OHD level < 20 ng/mL) should be treated with doses of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 higher than the daily requirement (as discussed in the section on vitamin D and chronic disease), followed by a maintenance dose. A repeat 25-OHD level should be obtained after the therapeutic course is completed. Some experts advocate for achievement of 25-OHD levels greater than 30 ng/mL in conditions associated with increased bone fragility, and several pediatric subspecialty organizations have made recommendations specific to the diseases they treat. In such instances, the recommendations of the pediatric subspecialty organizations should take precedence over the AAP recommendations for adolescents with chronic illnesses associated with increased bone fragility because the AAP recommendations were primarily targeted at a healthy population.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of and explanations for wheat avoidance, including reported symptoms, diagnoses and information sources influencing the decision to avoid wheat, and to investigate potential psychological predictors of this behaviour. DESIGN: Cross-sectional population survey. SETTING: The study was conducted in Australia, using a nationwide postal omnibus survey. SUBJECTS: Adults aged 18 years and over (n 1184; 52.9% female) selected at random from the Australian Electoral Roll. RESULTS: With cases of stated and suspected coeliac disease (1.2%) excluded, 7.3% of the sample reported adverse physiological effects, predominantly gastrointestinal, that they associated with wheat consumption. Few among this group (5.7%) claimed a formally diagnosed intolerance or allergy requiring avoidance of wheat-based foods. Symptomatic wheat avoidance was highly correlated with dairy avoidance and predicted by gender (female), lesser receptiveness to conventional medicine and greater receptiveness to complementary medicine, but not by neuroticism, reasoning style or tendency to worry about illness. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that many adult Australians are consciously avoiding consumption of wheat foods, predominantly without any formal diagnosis. Reported symptoms suggest a physiological but not allergenic basis to this behaviour. Questions to be answered concern whether symptoms are attributed correctly to wheat, the agents (wheat components, dietary factors or additives) and physiological mechanism(s) involved, the nutritional adequacy of avoiders' diets, and the clinical and psychosocial processes that lead a substantial number of adults to avoid consuming wheat (or any other dietary factor) apparently independently of a medical diagnosis.},

This systematic review of studies looked at the efficacy of the gluten-free diet, physical activity, nutrient supplementation, and bisphosphonates for low bone density treatment. Case control and cohort designs were identified from PubMed and other academic databases (from 1996 to 2015) that observed newly diagnosed adults with CD for at least one year after diet treatment using the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. Only 20 out of 207 studies met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was assessed using the Strengthening of the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement checklist. Gluten-free diet adherence resulted in partial recovery of bone density by one year in all studies, and full recovery by the fifth year. No treatment differences were observed between the gluten-free diet alone and diet plus bisphosphonates in one study. For malnourished patients, supplementation with vitamin D and calcium resulted in significant improvement. Evidence for the impact of physical activity on bone density was limited. Therapeutic strategies aimed at modifying lifestyle factors throughout the lifespan should be studied.},

   abstract = {We report the case of a two-year-five-month-old child who underwent screening for celiac disease due to strong familiarity. During the first observation body weight and height were at 25th and 50th centile for gender and age. Physical examination did not reveal any sign of disease. Blood tests showed increased transaminases levels and antibodies research showed: tTG IgA: 100 UI/ml, tTG IgG: 36,6 UI/ml, EMA IgA: positive. HLA study revealed homozygous allelic combination DRB1*07;DQA102:01; DQB1* 02:02 with presence of a double copy of beta chain in the composition of the DQ2 heterodymer. Biopsy with histological examination did find neither mucosal alteration nor lymphocytic infiltrates (Marsh 0). During follow up with free diet the patient remained asymptomatic and all antibody titers decreased up to normalization. According to ESPGHAN guidelines the finding of hypertransaminasemia as sign of celiac hepatic inflammation, a more than 10-fold increase of tTG IgA and a high-risk HLA would permit diagnosis of celiac disease but histological examination done due to mismatch between paucity of clinical sings and a "multiple risk combination" excluded it, allowing diagnosis of potential celiac disease. We believe that this case is interesting because of its being in contrast with current literature data that suggest a linear relationship between antibodies levels and histological damage with tTG IgA at the upper reference range in case of potential celiac disease. According to guidelines we could have avoided intestinal biopsy but we would have considered as celiac a patient who is maybe just potentially affected.},

Given an increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders, medical professionals of all varieties are encountering patients with a diagnosis of CD or who are thought to have food intolerance to gluten. The prevalence of CD among the general population is estimated to be 1% in Western nations, and there is growing evidence for underdiagnosis of the disease, especially in non-Western nations that were traditionally believed to be unaffected. The development of serologic markers specific to CD has revolutionized the ability both to diagnose and monitor patients with the disease. Additionally, understanding of the clinical presentations of CD has undergone a major shift over the past half century. Although it is well understood that CD develops in genetically predisposed subjects exposed to gluten, the extent of other environmental factors in the pathogenesis of the disease is an area of continued research. Currently, the main therapeutic intervention for CD is a gluten-free diet; however, novel nondietary agents are under active investigation. Future areas of research should also help us understand the relationship of CD to other gluten-related disorders.},

We report the case of a boy with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis, severe cognitive disability and celiac disease in which an unexpected improvement of autistic core symptoms was observed after four months of probiotic treatment. METHOD: The case study refers to a 12 years old boy with ASD and severe cognitive disability attending the Villa Santa Maria Institute in resident care since 2009. Diagnosis of ASDs according to DSM-V criteria was confirmed by ADOS-2 assessment (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule). The medication used was VSL#3, a multi-strain mixture of ten probiotics. The treatment lasted 4 weeks followed by a four month follow-up. The rehabilitation program and the diet was maintained stable in the treatment period and in the follow up. ADOS-2 was assessed six times: two times before starting treatment; two times during the treatment and two times after interruption of the treatment. RESULTS: The probiotic treatment reduced the severity of abdominal symptoms as expected but an improvement in Autistic core symptoms was unexpectedly clinically evident already after few weeks from probiotic treatment start. The score of Social Affect domain of ADOS improved changing from 20 to 18 after two months treatment with a further reduction of 1 point in the following two months. The level 17 of severity remained stable in the follow up period. It is well known that ADOS score does not fluctuate spontaneously along time in ASD and is absolutely stable. CONCLUSIONS: The appropriate use of probiotics deserves further research, which hopefully will open new avenues in the fight against ASD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) refers to patients with primarily gastrointestinal symptoms without enteropathy that symptomatically benefit from gluten-free diet (GFD). Little is known about its pathophysiology, propensity to neurological manifestations, and if these differ from patients with coeliac disease (CD). We investigated the clinical and immunological characteristics of patients presenting with neurological manifestations with CD and those with NCGS. METHODS: We compared clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging data of patients with CD and NCGS presenting with neurological dysfunction assessed and followed up regularly over a period of 20 years. RESULTS: Out of 700 patients, 562 were included. Exclusion criteria included no bowel biopsy to confirm CD, no HLA type available, and failure to adhere to GFD. All patients presented with neurological dysfunction and had circulating anti-gliadin antibodies. Out of 562 patients, 228 (41%) had evidence of enteropathy (Group 1, CD) and 334 (59%) did not (Group 2, NCGS). The most common neurological manifestations were cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and encephalopathy. There was a greater proportion of patients with encephalopathy in Group 1 and with a greater proportion of neuropathy in Group 2. The severity of ataxia did not differ between the two groups. Patients in Group 1 had more severe neuropathy. All patients from both groups responded to gluten-free diet. Anti-tissue transglutaminase (TG2) antibodies were found in 91% of patients in Group 1 and in 29% of patients in Group 2. Comparison between those patients in Group 2 with HLA-DQ2/DQ8 and those without as well as those with positive TG2 compared with those with negative TG2 antibodies identified no differences within these subgroups. Serological positivity for TG6 antibodies was similar in the two groups (67 and 60%). CONCLUSIONS: The neurological manifestations of CD and NCGS are similar and equally responsive to a GFD suggestive of common pathophysiological mechanisms.},

   abstract = {The term gluten-related disorders (GRD) refers to a spectrum of diverse clinical manifestations triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. They include both intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. Gluten ataxia (GA) is one of the commonest neurological manifestations of GRD. It was originally defined as otherwise idiopathic sporadic ataxia in the presence of circulating antigliadin antibodies of IgA and/or IgG type. Newer more specific serological markers have been identified but are not as yet readily available. GA has a prevalence of 15% amongst all ataxias and 40% of all idiopathic sporadic ataxias. It usually presents with gait and lower limb ataxia. It is of insidious onset with a mean age at onset of 53 years. Up to 40% of patients have evidence of enteropathy on duodenal biopsy. Gastrointestinal symptoms are seldom prominent and are not a reliable indicator for the presence of enteropathy. Furthermore, the presence of enteropathy does not influence the response to a gluten-free diet. Most patients will stabilise or improve with strict adherence to gluten-free diet depending on the duration of the ataxia prior to the treatment. Up to 60% of patients with GA have evidence of cerebellar atrophy on MR imaging, but all patients have spectroscopic abnormalities primarily affecting the vermis. Recent evidence suggests that patients with newly diagnosed coeliac disease presenting to the gastroenterologists have abnormal MR spectroscopy at presentation associated with clinical evidence of subtle cerebellar dysfunction. The advantage of early diagnosis and treatment (mean age 42 years in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms vs. 53 years in patients presenting with ataxia) may protect the first group from the development and/or progression of neurological dysfunction.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of persistent villous atrophy (VA) in patients with celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD) varies greatly between studies. Most studies show a relatively high prevalence of mucosal atrophy and inflammation in treated patients, a finding which have led to a concept of non-responsive CD. Few studies have examined the prevalence of long-term mucosal healing. Our study aimed to determine the extent of mucosal healing in a cohort of Norwegian patients with CD treated with GFD for several years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with VA between 1989 and 2009 were included. We performed a follow-up gastroscopy with duodenal biopsies. Two pathologists evaluated the biopsies according to the Marsh-Oberhuber classification. Mucosal healing was defined as Marsh 0 while mucosal recovery was defined as Marsh 0-2. RESULTS: Duodenal biopsies were obtained from 127 adult patients with established CD. After a follow-up time of 8.1 years (median, range 2.3-22.3), 103 (81%) of the patients showed mucosal healing, 120 patients (94%) showed mucosal recovery, and 7 patients (6%) showed persistent VA. In addition, 103 of the 127 patients (81%) had undergone a routine follow-up biopsy 12.6 months (median, range 5.2-28.8) after diagnosis. At the time of the routine follow-up, only 52 of these patients (50.5%) had achieved mucosal recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Although half of the patients had persistent VA at the time of routine follow-up, both long-term mucosal recovery and healing is possible for the vast majority of adult patients with CD.},

The disease may be diagnosed at any age and can affect many organ systems. Its diagnosis and management can often be challenging. A high index of suspicion is required to diagnose this disease at an early stage in patients presenting with atypical symptomatology and delayed onset. Although serological tests are widely used, duodenal biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of CD. Even though CD affects various body systems, Microscopic Colitis (MC) and refractory sprue are among the main gastrointestinal complications of CD, which are resistant to Gluten-Free Diet (GFD). A thorough and appropriate evaluation is mandatory for an early and accurate diagnosis of these complications.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Developing antigen-specific approaches for diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease requires a detailed understanding of the specificity of T cells for gluten. The existing paradigm is that T-cell lines and clones from children differ from those of adults in the hierarchy and diversity of peptide recognition. We aimed to characterize the T-cell response to gluten in children vs adults with celiac disease. METHODS: Forty-one children with biopsy-proven celiac disease (median age, 9 years old; 17 male), who had been on strict gluten-free diets for at least 3 months, were given a 3-day challenge with wheat; blood samples were collected and gluten-specific T cells were measured. We analyzed responses of T cells from these children and from 4 adults with celiac disease to a peptide library and measured T-cell receptor bias. We isolated T-cell clones that recognized dominant peptides and assessed whether gluten peptide recognition was similar between T-cell clones from children and adults. RESULTS: We detected gluten-specific responses by T cells from 30 of the children with celiac disease (73%). T cells from the children recognized the same peptides that were immunogenic to adults with celiac disease; deamidation of peptides increased these responses. Age and time since diagnosis did not affect the magnitude of T-cell responses to dominant peptides. T-cell clones specific for dominant alpha- or omega-gliadin peptides from children with celiac disease had comparable levels of reactivity to wheat, rye, and barley peptides as T-cell clones from adults with celiac disease. The alpha-gliadin-specific T cells from children had biases in T-cell receptor usage similar to those in adults. CONCLUSIONS: T cells from children with celiac disease recognize similar gluten peptides as T cells from adults with celiac disease. The findings indicate that peptide-based diagnostics and therapeutics for adults may also be used for children.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease, a prevalent immune-mediated enteropathy driven by dietary gluten, provides an exceptional human model to dissect the genetic, environmental and immunologic factors operating in autoimmunity. Despite the causative antigen being an exogenous food protein, coeliac disease has many features in common with autoimmune disease including a strong HLA class II association and the presence of pathogenic CD4+ T cells and autoantibodies. CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes specifically target and destroy intestinal epithelium in response to stress signals and not a specific antigen. A unique feature of coeliac disease is the ability to remove gluten to induce disease remission and reintroduce it to trigger a memory response. This provides an unparalleled opportunity to study disease-relevant CD4+ T cells that have been expanded in vivo. As a result, the causative peptides have been characterised at a level unprecedented for any autoimmune disease. Despite the complexity of the gluten proteome, resistance to gastrointestinal proteolysis and susceptibility to post-translational modification by transglutaminase help shape a restricted repertoire of immunogenic gluten peptides that have high affinity for disease-associated HLA. The critical steps in coeliac disease pathogenesis have been broadly elucidated and provide the basis for experimental therapies in pre-clinical or clinical development. However, little is known about how and why tolerance to gluten sometimes breaks or fails to develop. Understanding the interactions between genes, the environment, gluten immunity and the microbiome may provide novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of disease.},

   abstract = {Background. There is limited research investigating the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota in individuals with celiac disease (CoeD) reporting only partial symptom improvement despite adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). The aim of this research was to determine if the gastrointestinal microbiota could be altered by probiotic bacteria and provide a potential new therapy for this subgroup. Methods. A multicentre RCT was conducted between January and August 2011 in Australia. Participants included 45 people with CoeD reporting only partial symptom improvement despite adherence to a strict GFD for a minimum of 12 months. Participants took 5 g of VSL# probiotic formulation (n = 23) or 5 g placebo (n = 22) orally twice daily for 12 weeks. The main outcome measured was the efficacy of the probiotic formula in altering faecal microbiota counts between baseline and week 12. Safety was determined by safety blood and monitoring adverse events. Results. SPSS multivariate repeated measures analysis (95th confidence level) revealed no statistically significant changes between the groups in the faecal microbiota counts or blood safety measures over the course of the study. Conclusion. The probiotic formula when taken orally over the 12-week period did not significantly alter the microbiota measured in this population.

   abstract = {Ingestion of food is known to increase mesenteric blood flow. It is not clear whether this increased flow demand is compensated by a rise in cardiac output (CO) alone or by redistribution of blood flow from other organs. We used a new comprehensive imaging method to assess the human cardiovascular response to food ingestion. Following a 12-h fast, blood flow in segments of the aorta and in organ-specific arteries, and ventricular volumes were assessed in 20 healthy adults using MRI at rest and following ingestion of a high-energy liquid meal. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) fell substantially and CO rose significantly. Blood pressure remained stable. These changes were predominantly driven by a rapid fall in mesenteric vascular resistance, resulting in over four times more intestinal blood flow. Renal vascular resistance also declined but less dramatically. No changes in blood flow to the celiac territory, the brain, or the limbs were observed. In conclusion, this is the first study to fully characterize systemic and regional changes in vascular resistance after food ingestion in humans. Our findings show that the postprandial drop in SVR is fully compensated for by increased CO and not by redistribution of blood from other organs. With the exception of a modest increase in renal blood flow, there was no evidence of altered blood flow to nondigestive organs. The proposed oral food challenge protocol can be applied safely in an MRI environment and may be useful for studying the involvement of the gut in systemic or cardiovascular disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a complex autoimmune disorder in genetically predisposed individuals of all age groups triggered by the ingestion of food containing gluten. A reliable diagnosis is of high interest in view of embarking on a strict gluten-free diet, which is the CD treatment modality of first choice. The gold standard for diagnosis of CD is currently based on a histological confirmation of serology, using biopsies performed during upper endoscopy. Computer aided decision support is an emerging option in medicine and endoscopy in particular. Such systems could potentially save costs and manpower while simultaneously increasing the safety of the procedure. Research focused on computer-assisted systems in the context of automated diagnosis of CD has started in 2008. Since then, over 40 publications on the topic have appeared. In this context, data from classical flexible endoscopy as well as wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) and confocal laser endomicrosopy (CLE) has been used. In this survey paper, we try to give a comprehensive overview of the research focused on computer-assisted diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Celiac disease, an autoimmune disease induced by dietary gluten, is associated with metabolic bone disorders, such as low bone mineral density. However, it is unclear whether this translates into an association between celiac disease and such hard clinical outcomes as bone fractures. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and pool the evidence for the relationship of celiac disease with prevalence and incidence of bone fractures. DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library in January 2014 for studies of celiac disease and bone fractures. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies of any design, in which bone fracture outcomes were compared in individuals with and without celiac disease were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently extracted results from eligible studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the meta-analyses of case-control and cross-sectional studies, bone fractures were almost twice as common in individuals with a clinically diagnosed celiac disease as in those without the disease. In the meta-analyses of prospective studies, celiac disease at baseline was associated with a 30% increase (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14, 1.50) in the risk of any fracture and a 69% increase in the risk of hip fracture (95% CI: 1.10, 2.59). The two studies of unrecognized celiac disease (elevated circulating concentrations of celiac disease-specific autoantibodies but no celiac disease diagnosis) had contradicting findings. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that clinically diagnosed celiac disease and bone fractures co-occur and that celiac disease was associated with an increased risk of hip fractures as well as fractures in general. Further research would be needed to determine whether unrecognized celiac disease is associated with the risk of bone fractures.},

   abstract = {Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is an antigen-driven pan-oesophagitis that is defined by the presence of at least 15 eosinophils per high power field on oesophageal histology in conjunction with upper gastrointestinal symptoms. EoE is closely associated with atopic disorders, in particular with food allergy, and as for other atopic diseases in childhood, there is a strong preponderance of male patients who have this disorder. The mechanisms leading to EoE have been characterised at the molecular level. Eotaxin-3, interleukin-5 and interleukin-13 are the key effector molecules in EoE pathogenesis. EoE presents with a diverse range of gastrointestinal symptoms, including regurgitation, vomiting, feeding difficulties or feeding refusal in infancy, as well as heartburn, dysphagia and food bolus impaction in older children and adults. The diagnosis may also be ascertained as an incidental finding in patients undergoing gastroscopy for other suspected conditions, including coeliac disease. EoE is different from gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and does not improve in response to proton pump inhibitors. Therefore, EoE needs to be distinguished from so-called PPI-responsive oesophageal eosinophilia. The long-term prognosis of EoE remains poorly defined, and complications mainly relate to subepithelial remodelling and fibrosis that may result in dysmotility, dysphagia and oesophageal strictures. The treatment of EoE involves elimination diets and topical swallowed aerosolised corticosteroids, while biological therapies targeting molecular mechanisms have so far been unsuccessful. In children, elemental diets have proved highly effective, but multiple food elimination diets are more sustainable in the long term. Further randomised, controlled trials on dietary or pharmacological interventions are needed to inform the optimal long-term management of EoE.},

Refractory cases of coeliac disease, that do not respond to a gluten-free diet and which carry an increased risk of lymphoma, are well-known in coeliac disease. To determine whether refractory cases of DH with active rash and persistent small bowel atrophy occur we analysed our series of 403 patients with DH. Seven (1.7%) patients, who had been on a gluten-free diet for a mean of 16 years, but who still required dapsone to treat the symptoms of DH, were identified. Of these, one patient died from mucinous adenocarcinoma before re-examination. At re-examination skin immunoglobulin A (IgA) deposits were found in 5/6 refractory and 3/16 control DH patients with good dietary response. Small bowel mucosa was studied at re-examination from 5 refractory and 8 control DH patients and was normal in all 5 refractory and 7/8 control DH patients. One refractory DH patient died from adenocarcinoma, but no lymphoma developed in any of the patients. This study documents for the first time refractory DH, in which the rash is non-responsive to a gluten-free diet, but the small bowel mucosa heals. This differs from refractory coeliac disease, in which the small bowel mucosa does not heal on a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested that hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines may be less immunogenic in individuals with celiac disease (CD). A pre-S vaccine (Sci-B-Vac) has demonstrated superior immunogenicity compared with standard HBV vaccines in several diseases. We compared the short-term immunogenicity of a pre-S vaccine with a HBV vaccine (Engerix B) for repeat vaccination of seronegative, previously immunized patients with CD. METHODS: Participants were 1 to 18-year-old children with CD who despite standard HBV vaccines in infancy had nonprotective hepatitis B surface antibody (HBs-Ab) concentrations (</=10 mIU/mL). Patients were randomized to receive either Engerix B or pre-S vaccine. HBs-Ab concentrations were measured 1 month after the first dose. For those who had not responded after 1 dose, measurement was repeated after the third dose. RESULTS: Children (n = 82) were analyzed (42 pre-S vaccine and 40 Engerix B). Baseline characteristics were similar for both groups, including gluten-free diet status. Both arms showed high response rates following the first injection: 41 (98%) versus 35 (87%) for pre-S vaccine and Engerix B recipients, respectively (P = 0.08). All other patients responded when measured after dose 3. HBs-Ab concentrations (mIU/mL) were higher in the pre-S vaccine group (median 925, interquartile range [IQR] 424-1000) than the Engerix B group (median 363, IQR 106-996, P = 0.005). Twenty (48%) of the pre-S vaccine recipients were "high responders" (>1000 mIU/mL) versus 10 (25%) in Engerix B recipients (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Both vaccines elicited adequate booster responses in most previously vaccinated patients with CD with nonprotective HBs-Ab concentrations. Pre-S vaccine administration resulted in higher Hbs-Ab concentrations. Our data suggest that a single dose of either vaccine is sufficient to raise titers to protective levels in most patients with CD.},

   abstract = {Dietary exclusion of gluten-containing products has become increasingly popular in the general population, and currently approximately 30% of people in the United States are limiting gluten ingestion. Although celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy (WA), and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) constitute a spectrum of gluten-related disorders that require exclusion of gluten from the diet, together these account for a relatively small percentage of those following a gluten-free diet, and the vast majority has no medical necessity for doing so. Differentiating between CD, WA, and NCGS has important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Because of the protean manifestations of gluten-related disorders, it is not possible to differentiate between them on clinical grounds alone. This clinical report will compare and contrast the manifestations of gluten-related disorders, emphasize the importance of differentiating between these conditions, discuss initial and subsequent tests needed to confirm the diagnosis, and provide recommendations on treatment and follow-up for each condition.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although several pharmacological agents have emerged as potential adjunctive therapies to a gluten-free diet for coeliac disease, there is currently no widely accepted measure of disease activity used in clinical trials. We conducted a systematic review of coeliac disease activity indices to evaluate their operating properties and potential as outcome measures in registration trials. DESIGN: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane central library were searched from 1966 to 2015 for eligible studies in adult and/or paediatric patients with coeliac disease that included coeliac disease activity markers in their outcome measures. The operating characteristics of histological indices, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and endoscopic indices were evaluated for content and construct validity, reliability, responsiveness and feasibility using guidelines proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). RESULTS: Of 19 123 citations, 286 studies were eligible, including 24 randomised-controlled trials. Three of five PROs identified met most key evaluative criteria but only the Celiac Disease Symptom Diary (CDSD) and the Celiac Disease Patient-Reported Outcome (CeD PRO) have been approved by the FDA. All histological and endoscopic scores identified lacked content validity. Quantitative morphometric histological analysis had better reliability and responsiveness compared with qualitative scales. Endoscopic indices were infrequently used, and only one index demonstrated responsiveness to effective therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Current best evidence suggests that the CDSD and the CeD PRO are appropriate for use in the definition of primary end points in coeliac disease registration trials. Morphometric histology should be included as a key secondary or co-primary end point. Further work is needed to optimise end point configuration to inform efficient drug development.},

It comes along with serious damage of the mucosa in the small intestine and is caused by the storage proteins-termed "gluten"-of wheat, rye, barley and possibly oats. Sensitive individuals need to stick to a strict gluten-free diet. The gluten level in food products labeled as "gluten-free", must not exceed 20 mg/kg. It is obvious that effective test methods are needed to accurately determine the gluten concentration in foods. The determination of the presence of gluten in foodstuffs is mainly done by means of an immunochemical method called ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). To check the suitability of a G12 antibody-based gluten detection kit for its use in official control systems a number of routine samples were tested in parallel with two different test kits, as would be done in a routine lab. The determination of the gluten content was performed on samples entering the official laboratory including samples from official control plans, commercially available and private samples to request gluten-free labels. The results obtained with the G12 antibody ELISA assay were comparable to the official R5 method. A validation of the two different methods was not part of this study.},

A 35-item questionnaire consisting of open- and closed-ended questions was launched nationally via Canadian Celiac Association internet sites. Five focus groups were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. The survey and semi-structured interview guide content was vetted for face and content validity. Thematic analyses were conducted on the focus group content and open-ended survey questions, and chi(2) and Fischer's exact analysis were performed on closed-ended survey data. Survey respondents were predominantly mothers (97%) of female children (80 F, 49 M) between the ages of 9-12 (31%) with CD, residing in western provinces (55%) with a combined family income >/=$100 000/year (63%). Seventy-seven percent of parental respondent's children or adolescents consumed micronutrient supplements, for 1-5 years (52%), 7 days a week (65%), as both multi-vitamin and single vitamin preparations (40%). Parental influences on child micronutrient use included health beliefs and knowledge, parental supplement use, supplement characteristics, age of child (above or below 13 years), household routines, and provincial residential status (P < 0.05). Parents relied on health professional recommendation (69%; MD, RD) and the internet (21%) as sources of information regarding child micronutrient supplementation. Parental health beliefs and knowledge, socio-demographic factors, and practitioner recommendation influence micronutrient supplement use in children and adolescents with CD.},

In orthopaedic and trauma patients, celiac disease should be suspected in the following diagnoses: osteomalacia, premenopausal osteoporosis, post-menopausal osteoporosis more severe than expected and refractory to medication, osteoporosis in men under 55 years of age, recurrent bone fractures in the limbs, large joint arthralgia or arthritis of unclear aetiology, erosive spondyloarthropathy particularly in patients with the history of chronic diarrhoea, anaemia or associated autoimmune disorders (type 1 diabetes mellitus or autoimmune thyreopathy), and in women with secondary amenorrhea or early menopause. The orthopaedist or trauma surgeon should be aware of suspected celiac disease in patients who do not respond adequately to the standard treatment of pain related to the musculoskeletal system, in patients with recurrent fractures of the limb bones and in young patients with suspected secondary osteoporosis. With the use of appropriate screening methods, celiac disease as-yet undiagnosed can be revealed. A long-life gluten-free diet in these patients results in the alleviation of metabolic osteopathy and joint and muscle problems, in reduced requirements of analgesic and antiphlogistic drugs as well as in reduced risks of fracture.},

We tested the markers of epithelial apoptosis - cytokeratin 18 caspase-cleaved fragment (cCK-18), and enterocyte damage - intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) and soluble CD14 (sCD14) in sera of patients with untreated celiac disease (CLD), those on gluten-free diet (CLD-GFD), patients with autoimmune diabetes mellitus (T1D), T1D with insulitis (T1D/INS), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2D). We found elevated levels of cCK-18 (P<0.001), I-FABP (P<0.01) and sCD14 (P<0.05) in CLD when compared to healthy controls. However, the levels of cCK-18 (P<0.01) and I-FABP (P<0.01) in CLD-GFD were higher when compared with controls. Interestingly, elevated levels of cCK-18 and I-FABP were found in T2D and T1D (P<0.001), and T1D/INS (P<0.01, P<0.001). Twenty-two out of 43 CLD patients were seropositive for cCK-18, 19/43 for I-FABP and 11/43 for sCD14; 9/30 of T2D patients were positive for cCK-18 and 5/20 of T1D/INS for sCD14, while in controls only 3/41 were positive for cCK-18, 3/41 for I-FABP and 1/41 for sCD14. We documented for the first time seropositivity for sCD14 in CLD and potential usefulness of serum cCK-18 and I-FABP as markers of gut damage in CLD, CLD-GFD, and diabetes.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Celiac disease, an immunological response triggered by gluten, affects ~1 % of the Western population. Information concerning gluten intake in the general population is scarce. We determined intake of gluten from wheat, barley, rye and oat in the Danish National Survey of Diet and Physical Activity 2005-2008. The study population comprised a random cross-sectional sample of 1494 adults 20-75 years, selected from the Danish Civil Registration System. METHODS: Protein content in wheat, rye, barley and oat was determined from the National Danish Food Composition Table and multiplied with the amount of cereal used in recipes. Amount of gluten was calculated as amount of cereal protein x0.80 for wheat and oat, x0.65 for rye and x0.50 for barley. Dietary intake was recorded daily during seven consecutive days in pre-coded food diaries with open-answer possibilities. RESULTS: Mean total gluten intake was 10.4 +/- 4.4 g/day (10th-90th percentiles; 5.4-16.2 g/day), in men 12.0 +/- 4.6 g/day and 9.0 +/- 3.4 g/day in women. It was higher among men than among women in all age groups (20-75 years; P < 0.0001); however, this difference was eliminated when adjusting for energy intake. Intake of different gluten sources tended to be higher in men than in women with the exception of gluten from barley. Total gluten intake decreased with increasing age (P < 0.0001) as did gluten intake from wheat (P < 0.0001), whereas intake of gluten from rye (P < 0.0001) and barley (P = 0.001) increased with increasing age, also when adjusted for energy intake or body weight. CONCLUSION: This study presents representative population-based data on gluten intake in Danish adults. Total gluten intake decreased with increasing age.},

   abstract = {This national clinical guideline approved by the Danish Society for Gastroenterology and Hepatology describes the diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease (CD) in adults. CD is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy of the small intestine triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing proteins, which are found in wheat, rye, and barley. The disease prevalence is 0.5-1.0%, but CD remains under-diagnosed. The diagnosis relies on the demonstration of lymphocyte infiltration, crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy in duodenal biopsies. Serology, malabsorption, biochemical markers, and identification of specific HLA haplotypes may contribute to CD diagnosis. Classical CD presents with diarrhoea and weight loss, but non-classical CD with vague or extraintestinal symptoms is common. The treatment for CD is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), which, in the majority of patients, normalises the small intestinal mucosa and absorption. Adherence to a GFD usually requires dietary advice from a clinical dietician. The monitoring of antibody levels and malabsorption markers is crucial during follow-up and allows for early treatment of disease complications. Important complications include osteoporosis, iron and vitamin deficiencies, and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.},

We report a case of celiac disease in a predisposed patient, with a HLA-DQ2 heterodimer, and Graves' disease that was treated successfully with a gluten-free diet. A 47-year-old woman complained of persistent chronic diarrhea and weight loss over a 9 month period. Results of all serological tests and stool exams were negative. However, the patient was found to carry the HLA DQ2 heterodimer. Symptoms improved after a gluten-free diet was initiated. The patient has been followed and has suffered no recurrence of symptoms while on the gluten-free diet. An overall diagnosis of celiac disease was made in a genetically predisposed patient (HLA-DQ2 heterodimer) with Graves' disease.},

In the current study, we investigate the biological effects of ID331 Triticum monococcum gliadin-derived peptides in human Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Triticum aestivum gliadin derived peptides were employed as a positive control. The effects on epithelial permeability, zonulin release, viability, and cytoskeleton reorganization were investigated. Our findings confirmed that ID331 gliadin did not enhance permeability and did not induce zonulin release, cytotoxicity or cytoskeleton reorganization of Caco-2 cell monolayers. We also demonstrated that ID331 omega-gliadin and its derived peptide omega(105-123) exerted a protective action, mitigating the injury of Triticum aestivum gliadin on cell viability and cytoskeleton reorganization. These results may represent a new opportunity for the future development of innovative strategies to reduce gluten toxicity in the diet of patients with gluten intolerance.},

   abstract = {The diagnosis of Celiac Disease (CD) relies on the concordance of pathological, serological, genetic and clinical features. For this reason, the diagnosis of CD is often a challenge. Seronegative celiac disease (SNCD) is defined by the negativity of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies in the presence of a positive histology on duodenal biopsy samples, i.e. inflammatory infiltrate of intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs > 25/100 enterocytes), mild villous atrophy and uneven brush border associated to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype DQ2 and/or DQ8. SNCD is characterized by mucosal deposits of tissue transglutaminase (tTG)/anti-tTG immuno-complexes. These may counteract the passage of anti-tTG into the bloodstream, thus explaining seronegativity. Another reason for seronegativity may be found in an incomplete maturation of plasma cells with a consequent failure of antibodies production. This condition often characterizes immunoglobulin deficiencies, and, indeed, SNCD is common in subjects with immunoglobulin deficiencies. The management of SNCD still remains debated. The treatment option for SNCD may be represented by gluten free diet (GFD), but the usefulness and appropriateness of prescribing GFD are controversial. Some evidences support its use only in SNCD subjects showing CD clear clinical picture and compatible HLA status. The choice of GFD administration could be linked to an investigation able to diagnose SNCD in no doubt even if a reliable test is not currently available. On these bases, a test helping the diagnosis of SNCD is justifiable and desirable.},

   abstract = {Importance: Timing of introduction of allergenic foods to the infant diet may influence the risk of allergic or autoimmune disease, but the evidence for this has not been comprehensively synthesized. Objective: To systematically review and meta-analyze evidence that timing of allergenic food introduction during infancy influences risk of allergic or autoimmune disease. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and LILACS databases were searched between January 1946 and March 2016. Study Selection: Intervention trials and observational studies that evaluated timing of allergenic food introduction during the first year of life and reported allergic or autoimmune disease or allergic sensitization were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted in duplicate and synthesized for meta-analysis using generic inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel methods with a random-effects model. GRADE was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Wheeze, eczema, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, allergic sensitization, type 1 diabetes mellitus, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune thyroid disease, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Results: Of 16289 original titles screened, data were extracted from 204 titles reporting 146 studies. There was moderate-certainty evidence from 5 trials (1915 participants) that early egg introduction at 4 to 6 months was associated with reduced egg allergy (risk ratio [RR], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36-0.87; I2 = 36%; P = .009). Absolute risk reduction for a population with 5.4% incidence of egg allergy was 24 cases (95% CI, 7-35 cases) per 1000 population. There was moderate-certainty evidence from 2 trials (1550 participants) that early peanut introduction at 4 to 11 months was associated with reduced peanut allergy (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.74; I2 = 66%; P = .009). Absolute risk reduction for a population with 2.5% incidence of peanut allergy was 18 cases (95% CI, 6-22 cases) per 1000 population. Certainty of evidence was downgraded because of imprecision of effect estimates and indirectness of the populations and interventions studied. Timing of egg or peanut introduction was not associated with risk of allergy to other foods. There was low- to very low-certainty evidence that early fish introduction was associated with reduced allergic sensitization and rhinitis. There was high-certainty evidence that timing of gluten introduction was not associated with celiac disease risk, and timing of allergenic food introduction was not associated with other outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review, early egg or peanut introduction to the infant diet was associated with lower risk of developing egg or peanut allergy. These findings must be considered in the context of limitations in the primary studies.},

AIMS: To evaluate: (1) the prevalence of IMD at the time of and after CD diagnosis; (2) a possible change in immune response to gluten free diet (GFD); (3) the potential role of GFD in reducing and/or preventing IMD in CD. METHODS: Prospective study including all consecutive adult CD patients who underwent investigations for Th1-Th17/Th2-IMD at the time of CD diagnosis and after a 5-year follow-up period. RESULTS: 1255 CD were enrolled. Of these, 257 patients (20.5%) showed IMD at the time of CD diagnosis, with 58.4% presenting a Th1/Th17-IMD. After a 5-year follow-up period, 682 patients (54.3%) showed new IMD despite GFD. Of these, 57.3% presented a Th1/Th17-IMD and 42.7% a Th2-IMD (p=0.8). When compared the prevalence of each type of IMD before and after CD diagnosis, we did not identify any significant "switch" from Th1/Th17- to Th2-IMD or vice versa. The number of patients with Th1/Th17- and/or Th2-IMD increased during the GFD period (20.5% vs 54.3%; p<0.01; OR 1.9). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IMD at the time of CD diagnosis is high and it seems to increase in the follow-up period despite GFD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are a common group of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases defined by symptom-based diagnostic criteria, which consider chronic or recurrent symptoms of the GI tract in the absence of other organic or biochemical reasons. Recent evidences have been highlighted the role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of the FGIDs. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We focused our attention on critically analysis of the existing literature on the role of gut microbiota in FGIDs, by evaluating the differences of composition, functions and role of intestinal flora in FGIDs of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, we focused on recent evidences about gut microbiota and coeliac disease (CD), especially in CD patients who are symptomatic despite gluten free diet (GFD), and who seem to share similar features of FGIDs subjects. In this setting, we conducted an additional PUBMED search for guidelines, systematic reviews (SR) and primary studies published after the last search update of the most recent reviews. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Some data suggest that, in a significant percentage of patients, the microbiota plays an important role in the genesis and maintenance of FGIDs. Probiotic supplementation and antibiotic treatment appear to be of therapeutic value, although the clinical data remain controversial. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the exciting and growing research on the role of gut microbiota in FGIDs, our knowledge remains fairly limited. Further studies are needed to measure the diversity, function and resistance to antibiotics of the intestinal microbiota in FGIDs.},

Clinical and histological improvements usually follow when gluten is excluded from the diet. Coeliac disease can present with a wide range of clinical features, both gastrointestinal (such as indigestion, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bloating, distension or constipation) and non-gastrointestinal (such as fatigue, dermatitis herpetiformis, anaemia, osteoporosis, reproductive problems, short stature, neuropathy, ataxia or delayed puberty). Although some people present with typical symptoms, others have few or no symptoms. People with autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease, or people with a first-degree family history of coeliac disease, have an increased likelihood of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Limited pediatric data exist examining the trend and predictors of anti-tissue transglutaminase (atTG) normalization over time in children with celiac disease (CD). We aimed to evaluate time to normalization of atTG in children after CD diagnosis, and to assess for independent predictors impacting this duration. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was completed in pediatric CD patients diagnosed from 2007 to 2014 at the Stollery Children's Hospital Celiac Clinic (Edmonton, Alberta). The clinical predictors assessed for impact on time to atTG normalization were: initial atTG, Marsh score at diagnosis, gluten free diet compliance (GFDC), age at diagnosis, gender, ethnicity, medical comorbidities, and family history of CD. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was completed to assess time to atTG normalization, and Cox regression to assess for independent predictors of this time. RESULTS: 487 patients met inclusion criteria. 80.5% of patients normalized atTG levels. Median normalization time was 407 days for all patients (95% CI [361-453]), and 364 days for GFD compliant patients (95% CI [335-393]). Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients took significantly longer to normalize at 1204 days (95% CI [199-2209], p < 0.001). Cox regression demonstrated T1DM (HR = 0.36 [0.24-0.55], p < 0.001) and higher baseline atTG (HR = 0.52 [0.43 - 0.63], p < 0.001) were significant predictors of longer atTG normalization time. GFDC was a significant predictor of earlier normalization (OR = 13.91 [7.86-24.62], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: GFDC and lower atTG at diagnosis are predictors of earlier normalization. Patients with T1DM are less likely to normalize atTG levels, with longer normalization time. Additional research and education for higher-risk populations is needed.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune reaction to gluten, leading to intestinal inflammation, villous atrophy, and malabsorption. It is the most common autoimmune gastrointestinal disorder, with an increasing prevalence. A life-long gluten-free diet (GFD) is an effective treatment to alleviate symptoms, normalize autoantibodies, and heal the intestinal mucosa in patients with CD. Poorly controlled CD poses a significant concern for ongoing malabsorption, growth restriction, and the long-term concern of intestinal lymphoma. Achieving GFD compliance and long-term disease control poses a challenge, with adolescents at particular risk for high rates of noncompliance. Attention has turned toward innovative management strategies to improve adherence and achieve better disease control. One such strategy is the development of multidisciplinary clinic approach, and CD is a complex life-long disease state that would benefit from a multifaceted team approach as recognized by multiple national and international bodies, including the National Institutes of Health. Utilizing the combined efforts of the pediatric gastroenterologist, registered dietitian, registered nurse, and primary care provider (general practitioner or general pediatrician) in a CD multidisciplinary clinic model will be of benefit for patients and families in optimizing diagnosis, provision of GFD teaching, and long-term adherence to a GFD. This paper discusses the benefits and proposed structure for multidisciplinary care in improving management of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an autoimmune systemic disorder in genetically predisposed individuals precipitated by gluten ingestion. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to determine asymptomatic spike-and-wave findings on electroencephalography in children with celiac disease. METHODS: A total of 175 children with the diagnosis of celiac disease (study group) and 99 age- and sex-matched healthy children as controls (control group) were included in the study. In order to determine the effects of gluten free diet on laboratory and electroencephalography findings, the celiac group is further subdivided into two as newly-diagnosed and formerly-diagnosed patients. Medical histories of all children and laboratory findings were all recorded and neurologic statuses were evaluated. All patients underwent a sleep and awake electroencephalography. RESULTS: Among 175 celiac disease patients included in the study, 43 were newly diagnosed while 132 were formerly-diagnosed patients. In electroencephalography evaluation of patients the epileptiform activity was determined in 4 (9.3%) of newly diagnosed and in 2 (1.5%) of formerly diagnosed patients; on the other hand the epileptiform activity was present in only 1 (1.0%) of control cases. There was a statistically significant difference between groups in regards to the presence of epileptiform activity in electroencephalography. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that epileptiform activity in both sleep and awake electroencephalography were positively correlated with tissue transglutaminase levels (P=0.014 and P=0.019, respectively). CONCLUSION: We have determined an increased epileptiform activity frequency among newly-diagnosed celiac disease patients compared with formerly-diagnosed celiac disease patients and control cases. Moreover the tissue transglutaminase levels were also correlated with the presence of epileptiform activity in electroencephalography. Among newly diagnosed celiac disease patients, clinicians should be aware of this association and be alert about any neurological symptoms.},

METHODS: A total of 307 children with a diagnosis of celiac disease (study group) and 197 age- and sex-matched healthy children as controls (control group) were included in this study. The study group was further divided into newly diagnosed celiac disease patients (n = 216) and patients who were on a gluten-free diet (n = 91) for at least 6 months. Medical histories of all children including age, sex, symptoms, weight, height, physical examination findings, and laboratory data were recorded. All patients underwent an electroencephalograph in a pediatric neurology electroencephalograph laboratory with a 32-channel electroencephalograph for 30 minutes. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were defined to have epileptiform discharges (spike/sharp-wave discharges); 24 (7.8%) of those patients were in the celiac disease group and 1 (0.5%) was in the control group (P = 0.001). Among those 24 patients, 21 (9.7%) were in newly diagnosed celiac disease group and 3 (3.3%) were in the gluten-free diet group (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with celiac disease are prone to epileptiform activities on electroencephalography and should be evaluated carefully. Moreover, strict adherence to a gluten-free diet early should be advised in those patients with epileptiform activities because it may effectively decrease the occurrence of epileptiform activities.},

   abstract = {Autoantibodies specific for the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) are a hallmark of the gluten-sensitive enteropathy celiac disease. Production of the Abs is strictly dependent on exposure to dietary gluten proteins, thus raising the question how a foreign Ag (gluten) can induce an autoimmune response. It has been suggested that TG2-reactive B cells are activated by gluten-reactive T cells following receptor-mediated uptake of TG2-gluten complexes. In this study, we propose a revised model that is based on the ability of the BCR to serve as a substrate to TG2 and become cross-linked to gluten-derived peptides. We show that TG2-specific IgD molecules are preferred in the reaction and that binding of TG2 via a common epitope targeted by cells using the IgH variable gene segment (IGHV)5-51 results in more efficient cross-linking. Based on these findings we hypothesize that IgD-expressing B cells using IGHV5-51 are preferentially activated, and we suggest that this property can explain the previously reported low number of somatic mutations as well as the overrepresentation of IGHV5-51 among TG2-specific plasma cells in the celiac lesion. The model also couples gluten peptide uptake by TG2-reactive B cells directly to peptide deamidation, which is necessary for the activation of gluten-reactive T cells. It thereby provides a link between gluten deamidation, T cell activation, and the production of TG2-specific Abs. These are all key events in the development of celiac disease, and by connecting them the model may explain why the same enzyme that catalyzes gluten deamidation is also an autoantigen, something that is hardly coincidental.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gluten-free foods have increased in popularity over the past decade and are now being consumed by individuals without celiac disease. However, the physiologic effects of gluten intake in individuals without celiac disease remain unknown. High-abundance plasma proteins involved in inflammation, endothelial function, and other physiologic pathways may represent potential biomarkers of biological effects of gluten intake. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the association between gluten intake and plasma proteomic biomarkers in a population of adults without clinically diagnosed celiac disease. METHODS: Subjects (n = 1095) were participants of the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study, a cross-sectional examination of young adults aged 20-29 y. Dietary gluten intake was estimated by using a 1-mo, 196-item semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. The concentrations of 54 plasma proteins were measured simultaneously by liquid chromatography/multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. The association between gluten intake and each proteomic biomarker was examined by using general linear models. Analyses were then conducted in individuals who do not have the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or DQ8 risk variants required for the development of celiac disease to determine whether any associations observed could have been due to undiagnosed cases of celiac disease. RESULTS: Increased gluten intake was associated with increased concentrations of plasma alpha2-macroglobulin (P = 0.01), a marker of inflammation and cytokine release. The association remained after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, ethnicity, physical activity, energy intake, fiber intake, and hormonal contraceptive use among women. This relation was not modified by HLA risk variants. CONCLUSION: Gluten consumption is associated with increased plasma alpha2-macroglobulin in young adults, which appears to be independent of celiac disease, suggesting possible effects of gluten on inflammation.},

To evaluate the serum concentrations of insulin, ghrelin, adiponectin, leptin, leptin receptor, and lipocalin-2 in children with celiac disease who do and do not adhere to a gluten-free diet (GFD, intermittent adherence). METHODS: Prepubertal, pubertal, and adolescent celiac children were included in this study (74 girls and 53 boys on a GFD and 80 girls and 40 boys off of a GFD). RESULTS: Insulin levels in prepubertal (9.01+/-4.43 muIU/mL), pubertal (10.3+/-3.62 muIU/mL), and adolescent (10.8+/-4.73 muIU/mL) girls were higher than those in boys (5.88+/-2.02, 8.81+/-2.88, and 8.81+/-2.26 muIU/mL, respectively) and were neither age-dependent nor influenced by a GFD. Prepubertal children off of a GFD exhibited higher ghrelin levels than prepubertal children on a GFD. Adiponectin levels were not age-, sex- nor GFD-dependent. Adherence to a GFD had no effect on the expression of leptin, leptin receptor, and lipocalin-2. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to a GFD had no influence on the adiponectin, leptin, leptin receptor, and lipocalin-2 concentrations in celiac children, but a GFD decreased highly elevated ghrelin levels in prepubertal children. Further studies are required to determine whether increased insulin concentrations in girls with celiac disease is suggestive of an increased risk for hyperinsulinemia.},

METHODS: One hundred and sixty-one consecutive patients with iron-deficiency anemia of obscure origin were evaluated. Tissue transglutaminase antibodies levels were done and duodenal biopsies were scored according to Marsh classification. Diagnosis was based on positive IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and abnormal histopathology. Gluten-free diet (GFD) was adviced for celiac disease patients. One hundred and sixty healthy blood donors were tested for IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and positive controls were subjected to endoscopic duodenal biopsy. RESULTS: Tissue transglutaminase antibodies were positive in 13 (8 %) patients with iron-deficiency anemia of obscure origin and 4 (2.5 %) in control group (p = 0.026) (odds ratio 3.42; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.092-10.743). All 13 patients (8 %) and 2 out of 4 positive controls (1.25 %) had histopathology findings of celiac disease (p = 0.004). Duodenal biopsy showed Marsh grade 1 in 4, grade 2 in 4 (30.77 %), 3a in 1 (7.70 %), 3b in 2 (15.38 %), and 3c in 2 (15.38 %) patients. A statistically significant correlation was found between lower hemoglobin concentration and higher Marsh grading (Spearman's rho = -0.946, p = 0.001). Celiac disease patients adhered to GFD and after 6 months mean (SD) hemoglobin levels increased from 7.42 +/- 0.96 to 10.47 +/- 0.80 g/dL (p- < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with iron-deficiency anemia of obscure origin had increased prevalence of celiac disease. Gluten-free diet improved anemia in celiac disease patients irrespective of grade of duodenal involvement.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the GFD on extra-intestinal symptoms in pediatric and adult celiac populations at the University of Chicago (UofC). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of the UofC Celiac Center clinic charts from January 2002 to October 2014. Demographics, serologic testing, intestinal biopsies, and extra-intestinal symptoms at presentation, 12, 24, and greater than 24 months were recorded. Extra-intestinal symptoms included: abnormal liver enzymes, arthralgia/arthritis, dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), alopecia, fatigue, headache, anemia, stomatitis, myalgias, psychiatric disorders, rashes, seizures, neuropathy, short stature, delayed puberty, osteoporosis and infertility. RESULTS: A total of 737 patients with biopsy confirmed CeD or skin biopsy confirmed DH were included. Patients lost to follow up, or with insufficient data were excluded leaving 328 patients (157 pediatrics < 18 years). For pediatrics, the female to male ratio was 2:1 and the mean age at diagnosis was 8.9 years old. For adults, 4:1 and 40.6 years old. Extra-intestinal symptom rates were similar in children (60%) and adults (62%). Short stature (33%), fatigue (28%) and headache (20%) were most common in children. Iron deficiency anemia (48%), fatigue (37%) and headache/psychiatric disorders (24%) in adults. Children had faster/higher rates of symptom resolution compared to adults. Twenty-eight percent of children with unresolved short stature on a GFD were found to have other comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adults with CeD have similar rates of extra-intestinal manifestations. In children short stature, fatigue and headache were most common while anemia, fatigue and headache/psychiatric disorders were most common in adults. Children on a strict GFD showed faster and higher rates of symptom resolution as compared to adults. Unresponsive children with short stature must be assessed for comorbidities.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is the most common chronic intestinal disease. Nowadays it s known that this is a multisistemic pathology of immune mechanism, triggered by gluten, which occurs in genetically susceptible individuals. It affects approximately 1% of the world population, which is a very high prevalence, affects all age groups and has symptoms both digestive and extra-digestive. Since it is a disease that requires maintaining a gluten-free diet and medical monitoring for life, it is important to know it and establish its diagnosis properly. Along with celiac disease a number of new diseases related to gluten are diagnosed increasingly, including the non celiac gluten sensitivity or wheat allergy. The suffering of celiac disease, or other related diseases, by conditioning diet changes of the affected individual, it may be associated with nutritional imbalances that need to monitor and try to solve. Therefore patients with this problem need special nutritional advice.},

Pediatric studies postulate association between gluten sensitivity and EoE. However, few publications describe the prevalence, detection, or therapeutic and pathophysiologic implications of such association in adults. Retrospective chart review was done on patients diagnosed with EoE from 2009 to 2010 at University of Utah Hospitals and Clinics. Data included sex, age, presentation, duodenal pathology, tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A antibody (TTG) positivity, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type (when indicated), and gross and microscopic Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) findings. Duodenal biopsy, TTG results, and HLA type were correlated. Endoscopy was repeated after gluten-free diet. Forty-four of 75 patients were followed in EoE specialty clinic with duodenal biopsy and TTG testing per protocol. Six EoE patients had potential or probable CD. No sex or age differences were noted between those with findings of CD and EoE and those with EoE alone. Six patients with findings of CD and EoE followed gluten-free diet. Five underwent repeat endoscopy. Three had resolution of esophageal eosinophilia. Potential or probable CD was commonly found in adults with EoE. Diagnosis of CD may be challenging due to nonspecific symptoms and insufficient duodenal biopsy and serologic testing. Furthermore, gluten-free diet resolved EoE findings in some patients, suggesting possible shared pathophysiology in some cases of EoE and CD. TTG testing and adequate duodenal biopsy may further direct clinical care for EoE patients, and studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms linking EoE and CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a small-intestinal inflammatory disease that is triggered by the ingestion of the storage proteins (gluten) of wheat, barley and rye. KEY MESSAGES: Endocrine autoimmunity is prevalent in patients with CD and their relatives. The genes that predispose to endocrine autoimmune diseases, e.g. type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid diseases, and Addison's disease, i.e. DR3-DQ2 and DR4-DQ8, are also the major genetic determinants of CD, which is the best understood HLA-linked disease. Thus, up to 30% of first-degree relatives both of patients with CD and/or endocrine autoimmunity are affected by the other disease. In CD, certain gluten proteins bind with high affinity to HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 in the small-intestinal mucosa, to activate gluten-specific T cells which are instrumental in the destruction of the resorptive villi. Here, the autoantigen tissue transglutaminase increases the T cell response by generating deamidated gluten peptides that bind more strongly to DQ2 or DQ8. Classical symptoms such as diarrhea and consequences of malabsorption like anemia and osteoporosis are often absent in patients with (screening-detected) CD, but this absence does not significantly affect these patients' incidence of endocrine autoimmunity. Moreover, once autoimmunity is established, a gluten-free diet is not able to induce remission. However, ongoing studies attempt to address how far a gluten-free diet may prevent or retard the development of CD and endocrine autoimmunity in children at risk. CONCLUSIONS: The close relationship between CD and endocrine autoimmunity warrants a broader immune genetic and endocrine screening of CD patients and their relatives.},

   abstract = {Objective. Aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease, persistence of antithyroid antibodies, effect of gluten-free diet, and long-term outcome of thyroid function in pediatric patients with celiac disease (CD). Methods. 67 patients with CD aged from 1 year to 16 years were screened for thyroid antithyroperoxidase, antithyroglobulin and anti-TSH receptor antibodies, serum free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at diagnosis and during follow-up. Results. None of the patients had antithyroid antibodies at diagnosis. Antithyroid antibodies became positive in 16.4% of the patients (11/67) 2 to 3 years after the diagnosis of CD. Clinical hypothyroidism was observed only in 3 of 11 CD patients with positive antithyroid antibodies (27.2%). The antithyroid antibodies positive and negative patients did not differ significantly according to compliance to GFD (P > 0.05). A statistically significant difference was observed only in age, in which the patients with positive antithyroid antibodies were younger than the patients with negative antithyroid antibodies (P = 0.004). None of the patients had any change in their thyroid function and antibody profile during their follow-up. Conclusion. Antithyroid antibodies were detected in younger pediatric patients with CD and the prevalence of antithyroid antibodies did not correlate with the duration of gluten intake.},

METHODS: This cross-sectional population-based study was based on the 5-year follow-up of the Health2006 cohort, where 2297 individuals were screened for celiac disease; 56 were antibody positive and thus invited to clinical evaluation. Eight were diagnosed with biopsy-verified celiac disease. A follow-up questionnaire was sent to antibody-positive individuals 19 months after the clinical evaluation to obtain information on their symptoms and their experience with participation in the screening. RESULTS: Before screening, participants subsequently diagnosed with celiac disease did not differ from the rest of the population with respect to symptoms, but had significantly lower total cholesterol. Tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies with a cut-off of 10 U/ml had a positive predictive value of 88%. The majority of participants were satisfied with their participation in the screening program. Individuals with celiac disease were generally satisfied with having been diagnosed and 71% felt better on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: There were no differences in the prevalence of symptoms between participants with and without screening-detected celiac disease, confirming that risk stratification in a general population by symptoms is difficult. The majority of participants diagnosed with celiac disease felt better on a gluten-free diet despite not reporting abdominal symptoms before diagnosis and participants in the clinical evaluation were generally satisfied with participation in the screening program.},

   abstract = {Currently, the only effective treatment for celiac disease is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. However, gluten-free dieting is restrictive, difficult to maintain and nutritionally less than optimal. The improved knowledge on celiac disease pathogenesis has enabled researchers to suggest alternative strategies to treat the disorder. The drug development poses a challenge as any novel drug for celiac disease should be simultaneously effective and as safe as the gluten-free diet. The rationale behind enzyme supplementation therapy as a future treatment option for celiac patients lies in the fact that gluten is only poorly digested by gastrointestinal proteases. Due to incomplete degradation in the gastrointestinal tract, fairly long gluten peptides enter the small-intestinal lumen and come into contact with the mucosal epithelium, and in celiac disease patients this encounter launches deleterious downstream effects. Enzyme supplement therapy using either bacterial or fungal endopeptidases or proteases from germinating cereals has been proposed to promote complete digestion of prolamins and destroy disease-inducing gluten peptides. A major advantage of these glutenases is that they work in the lumen of the small intestine and do not themselves take part in the immunological cascade of events in the lamina propria, thus being unlikely to cause harmful side effects to the host. Studies to test this rationale, e.g. with Aspergillus niger prolyl endoprotease and a combination enzyme product ALV003, are already ongoing. The development of a novel medication for celiac disease is still in its early days, and thus the conventional dietary treatment will hold its place for the time being.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the authors of epidemiological studies have documented that autoimmune diseases are a major problem of modern society and are classified as diseases of civilization. Autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATDs) are caused by an abnormal immune response to autoantigens present in the thyroid gland - they often coexist with other autoimmune diseases. The most common dysfunctions of the thyroid gland are hypothyroidism, Graves-Basedow disease and Hashimoto's disease. Hashimoto's thyroiditis can be the main cause of primary hypothyroidism of the thyroid gland. Anthropometric, biochemical and physicochemical parameters are used to assess the nutritional status during the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid diseases. Patients with hypothyroidism are often obese, whereas patients with hyperthyroidism are often afflicted with rapid weight loss. The consequence of obesity is a change of the thyroid hormones' activity; however, weight reduction leads to their normalization. The activity and metabolic rate of thyroid hormones are modifiable. ATDs are associated with abnormalities of glucose metabolism and thus increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2. Celiac disease (CD) also increases the risk of developing other autoimmune diseases. Malnutrition or the presence of numerous nutritional deficiencies in a patient's body can be the cause of thyroid disorders. Coexisting deficiencies of such elements as iodine, iron, selenium and zinc may impair the function of the thyroid gland. Other nutrient deficiencies usually observed in patients suffering from ATD are: protein deficiencies, vitamin deficiencies (A, C, B6, B5, B1) and mineral deficiencies (phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, sodium, chromium). Proper diet helps to reduce the symptoms of the disease, maintains a healthy weight and prevents the occurrence of malnutrition. This article presents an overview of selected documented studies and scientific reports on the relationship of metabolic disorders and nutritional status with the occurrence of ATD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that is induced by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. It has a prevalence of approximately 1% in many populations worldwide. New diagnoses have increased substantially, owing to increased awareness, better diagnostic tools, and probable real increases in incidence. The breadth of recognized clinical presentations continues to expand, making the disorder highly relevant to all physicians. Newer diagnostic tools, including serologic tests for antibodies against tissue transglutaminase and deamidated gliadin peptide, greatly facilitate diagnosis. Tests for celiac-permissive HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules are useful in defined clinical situations. Celiac disease is diagnosed by histopathologic examination of duodenal biopsy specimens. However, according to recent controversial guidelines, a diagnosis can be made without a biopsy in certain circumstances, especially in children. Symptoms, mortality, and risk for malignancy each can be reduced by adherence to a gluten-free diet. This treatment is a challenge, however, because the diet is expensive, socially isolating, and not always effective in controlling symptoms or intestinal damage. Hence, there is increasing interest in developing nondietary therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms of gluten immunogenicity in patients with celiac disease. We studied temporal associations between infections and the development of celiac disease autoimmunity, and examined effects of HLA alleles, rotavirus vaccination status, and infant feeding. METHODS: We monitored 6327 children in the United States and Europe carrying HLA risk genotypes for celiac disease from 1 to 4 years of age for presence of tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (the definition of celiac disease autoimmunity), until March 31, 2015. Parental reports of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections were collected every third month from birth. We analyzed time-varying relationships among reported infections, rotavirus vaccination status, time to first introduction of gluten, breastfeeding, and risk of celiac disease autoimmunity using proportional hazard models. RESULTS: We identified 13,881 gastrointestinal infectious episodes (GIE) and 79,816 respiratory infectious episodes. During the follow-up period, 732 of 6327 (11.6%) children developed celiac disease autoimmunity. A GIE increased the risk of celiac disease autoimmunity within the following 3 months by 33% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.59). This risk increased 2-fold among children born in winter and introduced to gluten before age 6 months (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.46-2.98), and increased 10-fold among children without HLA-DQ2 alleles and breastfed for fewer than 4 months (HR, 9.76; 95% CI, 3.87-24.8). Risk of celiac disease autoimmunity was reduced in children vaccinated against rotavirus and introduced to gluten before age 6 months (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal infections increase the risk of celiac disease autoimmunity in children with genetic susceptibility to this autoimmune disorder. The risk is modified by HLA genotype, infant gluten consumption, breastfeeding, and rotavirus vaccination, indicating complex interactions among infections, genetic factors, and diet in the etiology of celiac disease in early childhood.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a common chronic immune disease triggered by gluten. Gliadin peptides pass through the epithelial layers, either paracellularly or transcellularly, to launch a potent adaptive immune response in the lamina propria. This aberrant immune response leads to diverse gastrointestinal and extra-gastrointestinal symptoms. Currently, the only treatment for CD is a strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), which can be challenging. An early effect of gluten in CD is an increase in gut permeability. Larazotide acetate, also known as AT-1001, is a synthetic peptide developed as a permeability regulator primarily targeting CD. In vitro studies indicate that larazotide acetate is capable of inhibiting the actin rearrangement caused by gliadin and clinical studies have been conducted using this peptide as a therapy for CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The in vitro gluten challenge test is an important diagnostic modality in celiac disease (CD), especially in patients who begin treatment with a gluten-free diet before adequate diagnostic workup or in cases with atypical CD. Available literature was reviewed regarding the accuracy of the in vitro gluten challenge test for CD diagnosis. METHODS: MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched, and studies that used serology and bowel biopsy as the criterion standard for diagnosis were included in our study. Data on authors, publication year, characteristics of the patient and control groups, patients' diet, duration of the gluten challenge test, histology findings, endomysial antibody (EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) levels, CD markers, and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, and human leukocyte antigens before and after the gluten challenge test were extracted. RESULTS: Overall, 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity %/specificity % was 84/99 for EMA after the challenge, 52/96 for EMA without the challenge, 95.5/98.3 for anti-tTG after the challenge, and 95.1/98.3 for anti-tTG without the challenge test. Sensitivity/specificity for immunological markers were 89/97 for the percentage of CD25(+)-lamina propria lymphocytes, 96/91 for the percentage of CD3(+)-lamina propria lymphocytes, and 96.1/85.7 for the percentage of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1-lamina propria lymphocytes. The factors that increased the sensitivity of EMA were longer test duration, and the evaluation of patients on a gluten-containing diet or short-term gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro gluten challenge test can be a useful part of the diagnostic workup of CD, rather than only a model to evaluate its mechanisms.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In recent years, the concern over food sensitivities in general and gluten intolerance in particular has sharply increased. Patients and medical providers are awash in various claims about the potential implications of including or excluding gluten from the diet. RECENT FINDINGS: Three main conditions are described with respect to gluten: wheat allergy, celiac disease, and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Wheat allergy is a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to nongluten proteins within wheat. Celiac disease is an autoimmune reaction to the gluten protein resulting in damage to the small intestine with genetic associations. NCGS is a diagnosis of exclusion and, to date, no biomarkers have been identified for this condition. SUMMARY: When evaluating and treating patients with potential reactions to gluten, it is important to distinguish among wheat allergy, celiac disease, and NCGS. Each condition has distinct dietary and treatment implications.},

Herein, we discuss a case of hemoptysis, who had IPH and other rare associations. A 19-year-old man presented with recurrent hemoptysis, generalized weakness and progressive dyspnea for 3 years. Earlier, he was diagnosed with anemia and was treated with blood transfusions and hematinics. On examination he had pallor, tachycardia and was underweight. Investigations revealed low level of hemoglobin (7.8 g/dl) and iron deficiency. An electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia, interventricular conduction delay and T-wave inversion. Echocardiography revealed dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular dysfunction. Computed tomography of the chest demonstrated bilateral diffuse ground glass opacity suggestive of pulmonary hemorrhage. Pulmonary function tests showed restrictive pattern with increased carbon monoxide diffusion. Bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial lung biopsy showed hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Patient could recall recurrent episodes of diarrhea in childhood. Serum antitissue transglutamase antibodies were raised (291.66 IU/ml, normal <30 IU/ml). Duodenal biopsy showed subtotal villous atrophy consistent with celiac disease. He was started on gluten-free diet, beta blockers and diuretics. After two years of treatment, he has been showing consistent improvement. Screening for CD is important in patients with IPH. Cardiomyopathy forms rare third association. All three show improvement with gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lifelong dietary abstinence of gluten is the only treatment available for celiac disease. This is not only challenging but also leads to several psychosocial morbidities and affects the quality of life of children and their parents. METHODS: An observational study was conducted on 50 children (5-18 years) diagnosed with celiac disease on gluten-free diet for at least 6 months and their parents to evaluate of the impact of celiac disease and its dietary manipulation on them. The quality of life was assessed by applying celiac disease-specific questionnaire. Dietary compliant and noncompliant groups were compared to assess the factors leading to poor compliance. Anthropometric parameters were utilized to ascertain clinical response. RESULTS: Fifty children with a mean age of 9.06 years were enrolled. Seventy-four percent of the children were compliant. In the compliant group, height and weight correlated with dietary compliance (p = 0.0087 and p = 0.023). Dietary compliance was found to be better in adolescent males and single child and those living in nuclear families. Quality of life was found to be higher among parents of noncompliant children (quality of life score: 63) as compared to the compliant children (quality of life score: 59). The acceptance of celiac disease was better among children whose parents had a higher level of education. The scale diet proved to be a useful indicator for evaluating compliance among children (p = 0.0036). CONCLUSIONS: Noncompliance to gluten-free diet was noted in 24 % of children with celiac disease.},

Celiac disease is the most well-known but not the only manifestation of gluten sensitivity. Myoclonus with Ataxia is a rare manifestation of gluten sensitivity and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients with idiopathic sporadic ataxia. The presence of gluten-related immune markers in normal population however complicates the reliable diagnosis of gluten related neurological disorders and clinical improvement on gluten free diet can serve as a diagnostic tool for this disease. We report a case of sporadic progressive cerebellar ataxia with myoclonus with positive antigliadin antibodies, which improved with a trial of gluten free diet. This case highlights an important diagnostic and therapeutic principle in management of late onset idiopathic ataxia.},

Innate immunity plays a critical role in both of these processes and cytokines such as interleukin-15 and interferon-alpha can modulate innate processes such as polarization of dendritic cells as well as intraepithelial lymphocyte function. These cytokines can be modulated by host microbiota, which can also influence dendritic cell function and intraepithelial lymphocyte homeostasis. We will elaborate on the role of interleukin-15, interferon-alpha, and the microbiota in modulating the processes that lead to loss of tolerance to gluten and tissue destruction in celiac disease.},

Symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and joint pain were eliminated with dietary restriction of foods to which hypersensitivity was demonstrated. Symptoms recurred with re-institution of offending foods. Resolution of fatigue required elimination of offending foods as well as treatment of underlying metabolic disorders.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES AND STUDY: In the development of Celiac Disease (CD) both genetic and environmental factors play a crucial role. The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 loci are strongly related to the disease and are necessary but not sufficient for the development of CD. Therefore, increasing interest lies in examining the mechanisms of CD onset from the early beginning. Differences in serum and urine metabolic profiles between healthy individuals and CD patients have been reported previously. We aimed to investigate if the metabolic pathways were already altered in young, 4 month old infants, preceding the CD diagnosis. METHODS: Serum samples were available for 230 four month old infants of the PreventCD project, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, dietary intervention study. All children were positive for HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 and had at least one first-degree relative diagnosed with CD. Amino acids were quantified after derivatization with liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and polar lipid concentrations (acylcarnitines, lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelins) were determined with direct infusion MS/MS. We investigated the association of the metabolic profile with (1) the development of CD up to the age of 8 years (yes/no), (2) with HLA-risk groups, (3) with the age at CD diagnosis, using linear mixed models and cox proportional hazards models. Gender, intervention group, and age at blood withdrawal were included as potential confounder. RESULTS: By the end of 2014, thirty-three out of the 230 children (14%) were diagnosed with CD according to the ESPGHAN criteria. Median age at diagnosis was 3.4 years (IQR, 2.4-5.2). Testing each metabolite for a difference in the mean between healthy and CD children, we (1) could not identify a discriminant analyte or a pattern pointing towards an altered metabolism (Bonferroni corrected P > 0.05 for all). Metabolite concentrations (2) did not differ across the HLA-risk groups. When investigating the age at diagnosis using (3) survival models, we found no evidence for an association between the metabolic profile and the risk of a later CD diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The metabolic profile at 4 months of age was not predictive for the development of CD up to the age of 8 years. Our results suggest that metabolic pathways reflected in serum are affected only later in life and that the HLA-genotype does not influence the serum metabolic profile in young infants before introduction of solid food.},

AIM: The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of two probiotic strains Bifidobacterium breve BR03 and B. breve B632 on serum production of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) and pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in children with CD. METHODS: The study was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that included 49 children with CD on gluten-free diet (GFD) randomized into two groups and 18 healthy children in the control group. The first group (24 children with CD) daily received B. breve BR03 and B632 (2 x 10(9) colony-forming units) and the second group (25 children with CD) received placebo for 3 months. RESULTS: TNF-alpha levels were significantly decreased in the first group after receiving B. breve for 3 months. On follow-up, 3 months after receiving probiotics, TNF-alpha levels increased again. Children with CD who were on GFD for less than 1 year showed similar baseline TNF-alpha levels as children who were on GFD for more than 1 year. IL-10 levels were in all groups of patients below detection level. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic intervention with B. breve strains has shown a positive effect on decreasing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in children with CD on GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Progression of potential celiac disease (PCD) to overt celiac disease (CD) has been described in some studies from the Western Hemisphere. There are no Asian data on this aspect of CD. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the short-term histological course of PCD in Indian patients. METHODS: Patients with PCD were prospectively identified by screening relatives of patients with CD, the diarrheal subtype of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) and patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Patients with serology that was positive for immunoglobulin A antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (IgA anti-tTG) were subjected to endoscopy with duodenal biopsy. PCD was defined as a Marsh-0 to Marsh-II lesion on duodenal biopsy, along with positive IgA tTG serology. Retesting for serology and histology was done at 6-month intervals, for 12 months. RESULTS: We diagnosed 57 patients (23 male) of mean age 28.7 years (range: 4-73 yrs) as having PCD. Of these 57 patients, 28 were identified by screening 192 first-degree relatives of 55 index cases of CD, while the remaining 29 had either IBS-D or IDA. Duodenal biopsy showed Marsh-0, Marsh-I and Marsh-II changes in 28, 27 and 2 patients, respectively. At 6 months, 12 patients became seronegative. The remaining 45 patients continued to be seropositive at the 12-month time point. Histological progression to Marsh-III occurred in only four patients, while progression from Marsh-0 to either Marsh-I or Marsh-II occurred in six patients and one patient, respectively; but 14 patients with Marsh-I did show regression to Marsh-0. Of the two patients who were initially Marsh-II, one remained so upon follow up and one showed regression to Marsh-0. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that despite the fact that nearly 80% of the patients diagnosed to have PCD continue to remain seropositive for tTG 12 months later, histological progression to Marsh-III occurred in only 7% of patients over the same time period. These observations do not justify starting a gluten-free diet in all patients with PCD, in India.},

   abstract = {Man began to consume cereals approximately 10,000 years ago when hunter-gatherers settled in the fertile golden crescent in the Middle East. Gluten has been an integral part of the Western type of diet ever since, and wheat consumption is also common in the Middle East, parts of India and China as well as Australia and Africa. In fact, the food supply in the world heavily depends on the availability of cereal-based food products, with wheat being one of the largest crops in the world. Part of this is due to the unique properties of wheat gluten, which has a high nutritional value and is crucial for the preparation of high-quality dough. In the last 10 years, however, wheat and gluten have received much negative attention. Many believe that it is inherently bad for our health and try to avoid consumption of gluten-containing cereals; a gluten-low lifestyle so to speak. This is fueled by a series of popular publications like Wheat Belly; Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health. However, in reality, there is only one condition where gluten is definitively the culprit: celiac disease (CD), affecting approximately 1% of the population in the Western world. Here, I describe the complexity of the cereals from which gluten is derived, the special properties of gluten which make it so widely used in the food industry, the basis for its toxicity in CD patients and the potential for the development of safe gluten and alternatives to the gluten-free diet.},

Specific stimulation of these T cells due to gluten consumption leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular IFNgamma and IL-21. This leads to tissue damage, the typical morphological alterations like the flattening of the intestinal epithelium, and a variety of disease-associated symptoms including malnutrition, diarrhea, stomach ache, and failure to thrive. Removal of gluten from the diet eliminates the trigger for these CD4 T cells and leads to recovery. These CD4 T cells thus play a crucial role in the disease pathogenesis. Here we describe how such T cells can be isolated and characterized.},

The migraine attacks measured by the Visual Analog Scale were less intensive, 55% in average, and had a later onset. The attacks were more frequent in CD patients who were older than 50 years old (small er, Cyrillic<0.05). The attacks disappeared in 25% of patients with migraine syndrome who were on the gluten diet and the reduction in the intensity and/or frequency of attacks was observed in 38% of patients.

Recent studies have shed new light on the importance of inflammation in the pathogenesis of arterial stiffness. The aim of this study was to evaluate arterial stiffness using pulse wave velocity (PWV) in adult CD patients without cardiovascular risk factors in comparison with a control group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 58 patients with CD without cardiovascular risk factors and age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. All patients completed a standard questionnaire form, and various laboratory parameters were assessed. Vascular measurements, including PWV, were carried out using a Mobil-O-Graph 24-h pulse wave analysis monitor, an automatic oscillometric device. RESULTS: Although cardiovascular risk factors, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride, were significantly lower (P<0.05) in celiac patients than in controls, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, homocysteine, and 24 h, day, and night PWV values were higher in patients with CD than in controls (P<0.05). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that PWV was correlated positively with age and the duration of CD. CONCLUSION: This study found increased arterial stiffness, homocysteine, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in patients with CD and provides evidence for the potential contribution of these parameters and inflammation toward arterial stiffening, independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis (OP) is a metabolic bone illness that may complicate celiac disease (CD). It can lead to devastating consequences because of low bone mass and fragility fractures. PURPOSE: To study the OP prevalence in a group of Brazilian patients with CD and the value of a gluten free diet (GFD). METHODS: Retrospective study of celiac female patients from a single University Center followed with bone densitometries. Results from densitometry made at first visit were compared with a second study after a median time of 5 years. During this period, patients were submitted to a GFD according to orientations from special program training. Calcium and vitamin D were prescribed to those patients who did not reach the minimal daily requirement through diet. RESULTS: Forty-one celiac female patients, mean age 46.1 +/- 14.8 years, were included. The prevalence of osteopenia at first visit was 56.1% and that of osteoporosis 29.2%. Osteoporosis was associated with longer disease duration (p = 0.01). The second densitometry was performed in a median time of 5 years (range 1 to 13 years) and disclosed 58.9% osteopenia and 28.2% osteoporosis. The GFD improved bone mass, mainly at (of) spine (comparison of T score with p = 0.03 and of bone mass in g/cm2 with p = 0.02), but it was not sufficient to reduce the number of osteopenic (p = 0.9) and osteoporotic patients (p = 0.4). During the follow up period 25% of osteoporotic patients developed low impact fractures. CONCLUSION: Bone health is notably impaired at baseline in CD patients, especially in those with a diagnostic delay. A GFD modestly improved bone mass density with low impact fractures occurring in one third of patients during the follow up period.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Secondary osteoporosis occurs in many diseases. Celiac disease-induced osteoporosis is the consequence of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Biochemical bone markers show predominance of bone resorption, thus making the bisphosphonates the first line therapy option. Intestinal mucosal changes are reversible on gluten-free diet. Osteoporosis reversibility is also possible, provided postmenopausal osteoporosis risk factors independent from celiac disease are not present. CASE REPORT: We presented a postmenopausal woman with at least a 10-year history of celiac disease prior to diagnosis, which had overt secondary hyperparathyroidism with insufficient status of vitamin D and a significant bone mass reduction. At the time of diagnosis of celiac disease the patient was receiving 250 mug of levothyroxine daily without achieving optimal substitution. Three years after the initiation of gluten-free diet the patient was without any signs and symptoms of the disease. All laboratory findings were within normal range. It was decided to treat the underlying disease and to supplement calcium and vitamin D without the initiation of bisphosponate therapy. CONCLUSION: Osteoporosis regression justified this therapeutic approach. The presence of primary autoimmune hypothyroidism makes this case specific, since the inability for optimal substitution therapy with a high daily dose of levothyroxine provoked the suspicion of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) refers to a clinical phenotype in which patients experience intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms related to ingesting a gluten-containing diet after a diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy has been excluded. CD, an autoimmune disease characterized by villous atrophy triggered by the ingestion of gluten, has increased in prevalence in recent decades, although the majority of patients remain undiagnosed. There is now an increasing public awareness of NCGS and growing interest in the health effects of gluten among health professionals and the lay public. Several randomized controlled trials have explored NCGS but have left many questions unanswered surrounding the pathophysiology, biomarkers, and established diagnostic approach to patients with this condition. Future studies are necessary to establish biomarkers and to elucidate the pathophysiology of this condition because at present, NCGS likely comprises a heterogeneous patient population. In this review, we outline the clinical trials of NCGS as well as the approach to patients with possible NCGS as recommended by an international expert panel. Because maintaining a gluten-free diet has important health, social, and economic consequences, it is necessary for medical professionals to provide practical and evidence-based advice to patients with this condition.},

Additionally, the research on the application of calcium supplements in the gluten-free breadmaking was reviewed, and its effect on the technological and sensory properties of baked products was indicated. Calcium-fortified gluten-free products could increase the calcium content in the diet of CD patients, supplying the amount of calcium they need for prophylactic or therapeutic use. Apart from this, the consumption of the naturally GF products as well as functional ingredients beneficially affecting calcium absorption need to be encouraged.},

Experimental calcium-fortified gluten-free bread (GFB) of improved calcium bioavailability could increase calcium content in the diets of coeliac disease patients, allowing them to obtain the amount of calcium they need for therapeutic use. Prebiotics, including inulin-type fructans (IFs) have a beneficial effect on calcium bioavailability. In the present study, the in vitro model composed of the intestinal-like Caco-2 cells and the human intestinal bacteria (Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae) were used to analyse the effect of inulin and fructooligosaccharide (FOS) of different chain lengths, on calcium uptake and absorption from experimental GFB. Analysed IFs, especially short-chain FOS, significantly (p < 0.05) increased cellular calcium uptake from GFB digest and stimulated the intestinal bacteria applied in the cultures to the intensive synthesis of organic acids. In particular, the concentration of butyric, valeric and lactic acids increased significantly. Similarly, in the calcium absorption experiment, IFs increased the cellular calcium retention but concomitantly reduced its content in basolateral filtrates. The results obtained suggest that the applied IFs affected differentially calcium uptake and absorption from the experimental calcium-enriched GFB, therefore a further study is needed to assess whether these observations made in vitro contribute to IF effects on calcium absorption from experimental GFB in vivo.},

METHOD: In all, 102 participants between 4 and 18 years of age diagnosed with ADHD participated in the study (M = 12.8 years; 84 boys and 18 girls). CD was diagnosed according to the adapted guidelines of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPHGAN). RESULTS: Among 102 tested children and teenagers with ADHD, we did not find anyone with suspected CD, so further diagnostic procedures for CD were not indicated. CONCLUSION: In our sample of children and teenagers with ADHD, the prevalence of CD was not higher than in the general population. On the basis of the obtained results and the results of similar studies, we conclude that there are not enough data to support screening for CD and the introduction of a gluten-free diet in children with ADHD unless there are additional indications.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A gluten free diet (GFD) is the only available treatment for celiac disease (CD). However many patients fail to respond fully clinically or histologically. Several surveys highlight the psychosocial implications of adherence to a GFD. Hence, efforts are ongoing to develop therapeutic strategies beyond a GFD. AREAS COVERED: We conducted a search of PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov to extract articles on CD using keywords including 'celiac disease' and 'refractory celiac disease' (RCD) and focused on articles conducting pathophysiologic and therapeutic research in/ex-vivo models and human trials. We highlight novel therapeutics that manipulate these mechanisms including tight junction regulators, glutenases, gluten sequestrants and immunotherapy using vaccines, nanoparticles that may serve as adjuncts to a GFD or more ambitiously to allow for gluten consumption. We also highlight the role of anti-inflammatories, immunosuppressants and monoclonal antibodies in RCD. Expert commentary: Therapeutics including tight junction regulators, glutenases have the potential to be approved for non-responsive CD or as gluten adjuncts. We expect results of various phase 1/2 trials using AMG 714, BL 7010, IgY antibodies to be published. In the interim, off-label use of 5 amino-salicylates, budesonide, nucleoside analogues and newer biologics developed for other inflammatory diseases will be used in RCD.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a common digestive disorder that affects 1% of adults. It is characterised by mucosal damage of the small intestine caused by dietary gluten. The main treatment for coeliac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet, which can reduce morbidity and mortality and also improve quality of life. Despite the benefits, adhering to this diet is often challenging, with patients often struggling to sustain dietary restriction. Structured follow-up for coeliac disease is recommended in international guidelines for improving adherence and for detecting complications;however, uncertainty exists concerning exactly who should be administering this follow-up care. Here, we undertake a review of the current approaches described in the literature to follow-up patients with coeliac disease, and assess the efficacy of these differing models. We also explore future directions for the care of these patients in the context of the UK National Health Service (a publicly funded healthcare system). Although the focus of this review pertains to follow-up within the UK healthcare system, these problems are recognised to be international, and so the findings of our review are likely to be of interest to all healthcare professionals seeing and managing patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Association between celiac disease and type 1 diabetes in adults is still somewhat unclear, and that between celiac disease and type 2 diabetes even less known. We studied these issues in a large cohort of adult celiac disease patients. METHODS: The prevalence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in 1358 celiac patients was compared with the population-based values. Furthermore, patients with celiac disease and concomitant type 1 or type 2 diabetes and those with celiac disease only underwent comparisons of clinical and histological features and adherence to gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The prevalence of type 1 diabetes (men/women) was 8.0 % /1.8 % in celiac patients and 0.7 % /0.3 % in the population, and that of type 2 diabetes 4.3 % /2.5 % and 4.4 % /3.0 %, respectively. Celiac patients with concomitant type 1 diabetes were younger (45 years vs 65 years and 52 years, P < 0.001) and more often screen-detected (43 % vs 13 % and 14 %, P < 0.001), had less other gastrointestinal diseases (8 % vs 40 % and 25 %, P = 0.028), more thyroidal diseases (18 % vs 16 % and 13 %, P = 0.043) and lower dietary adherence (71 % vs 95 % and 96 %, P < 0.001) compared with celiac patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes and patients with celiac disease only. Patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes had more hypercholesterolemia than the other groups (8 % vs 6 % and 4 %, P = 0.024), and both diabetes groups more hypertension (47 % and 31 % vs 15 %, P < 0.001) and coronary artery disease (29 % and 18 % vs 3 %, P < 0.001) than the patients with celiac disease only. CONCLUSIONS: Type 1 diabetes was markedly overrepresented in celiac disease, especially in men, whereas the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was comparable with the population. Concomitant type 1 or type 2 diabetes predisposes celiac patients to severe co-morbidities and type 1 diabetes also to poor dietary adherence.},

   abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the latest scientific data related to the safety of uncontaminated oats (<20 ppm of gluten) in the diet of individuals with celiac disease (CD). It updates the previous Health Canada position posted on the Health Canada website in 2007 and a related paper published in 2009. It considers a number of recent studies published between January 2008 and January 2015. While recognizing that a few people with celiac disease seem to be clinically intolerant to oats, this review concludes that oats uncontaminated by gluten-containing cereals (wheat, rye, and barley) can be safely ingested by most patients with celiac disease and that there is no conclusive evidence that the consumption of uncontaminated or specially produced oats containing no greater than 20 ppm gluten by patients with celiac disease should be limited to a specific daily amount. However, individuals with CD should observe a stabilization phase before introducing uncontaminated oats to the gluten-free diet (GFD). Oats uncontaminated with gluten should only be introduced after all symptoms of celiac disease have resolved and the individual has been on a GFD for a minimum of 6 months. Long-term regular medical follow-up of these patients is recommended but this is no different recommendation to celiac individuals on a GFD without oats.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autoantibodies against pancreatic secretory-granule membrane glycoprotein 2 (GP2) have been demonstrated in patients with Crohn's disease but recently also with celiac disease (CD). Both entities are characterized by intestinal barrier impairment with increased gut permeability. Pathophysiological hallmark of CD is a permanent loss of tolerance to alimentary gliadin and a transient loss of tolerance to the autoantigen human tissue transglutaminase (tTG). Therefore, we explored the behavior of loss of tolerance to GP2 reported in CD. METHODS: We assessed prevalences and levels of autoantibodies against GP2, CD-specific antibodies to endomysial antigens and tTG as well as Crohn's disease-specific anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies in sera of 174 patients with active CD, 84 patients under gluten-free diet (GFD) and 129 controls. Furthermore, we looked for an association between anti-GP2 antibody positivity and degree of mucosal damage in CD. RESULTS: We found significantly elevated anti-GP2 IgA positivity in active CD patients (19.5%) compared to CD patients under GFD (0.0%) and controls (5.4%, p < 0.001, respectively). Anti-GP2 IgA levels correlated significantly with CD-specific antibodies (p < 0.001). Anti-GP2 autoantibody positivity disappeared under GFD similarly to CD-specific autoantibodies against tTG and endomysial antigens. For the first time, IgA antibody levels to GP2 are demonstrated to be associated with degree of villous atrophy according to Marsh classification. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-GP2 IgA seems to be associated with disease activity in a distinct subgroup of patients with CD. The observed loss of tolerance to GP2 in a subset of patients with CD is transient and disappears under GFD.},

The diagnosis can be made using Rome III criteria or published guidelines after taking a thoughtful history, excluding warning signs, and performing a careful physical examination. Limited testing (ie, complete blood count and C-reactive protein level) may be useful in appropriate patients. A number of pharmacologic options are available, although many patients fail to respond to pharmacologic therapy. Although several IBS diets frequently are recommended, data supporting their use are limited. This article provides a rationale as to why specific diets might improve IBS symptoms and evaluates published trials.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinicopathologic features of adult-onset autoimmune enteropathy (AIE). METHODS: A case of adult-onset AIE was described along with a literature review. RESULTS: A 41-year-old male patient was admitted for intractable diarrhea for more than three months despite of any dietary restriction or anti-inflammatory therapy. Fat globule was observed by stool examination and Sudan III staining of the stool was positive. Enteroclysis showed weak movement and few plica of small intestine, while colonoscopy appeared normal. Small bowel biopsies revealed villus atrophy and increased crypt apoptotic bodies and lymphocytic infiltration in deep crypt. Although without significant surface intro-epithelial lymphocytosis, there were a large number of monocytes, lymphocytes, plasmacytes and neutrophilic granulocytes infiltrating in the lamina propria. Morphologically, the colonic mucous was similar to the small intestine although cryptitis and crypt abscess were significant in the former. Serum IgG anti-goblet cell antibody was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. Other causes of diarrhea were excluded on the base of medical history, histopathology and other accessory examinations before the diagnosis of AIE was made. The patient had a complete remission after steroid treatment without recurrence for eight months during the follow-up even after steroid withdrawal for five months. CONCLUSIONS: AIE is exceedingly rare and timely diagnosis is important for successful therapy. Histological differential diagnoses should include ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, lymphocytic colitis, etc. The final diagnosis should be based on histological examination combined with the patient history, clinical manifestation, endoscopy finding and serological testing.},

It is an immune-mediated disease manifested by diarrhea, steatorrhea, flatulence, and weight loss, caused by ingestion of gluten containing diets. The disease has typical small intestinal biopsy features of villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and intense inflammation of the mucosal layer. The disease is rarely associated with Crohn's disease (CRD). Studies on the impact of CD on the natural history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have shown that the natural course of CRD is not influenced by coexistent CD. We report a case of 54-year female who presented with diarrhea and weight loss. On initial evaluation, CD was diagnosed, and responded to gluten-free diet (GFD). Later on, she developed joint pains and her diarrhea recurred. Further evaluation revealed coexistence of CRD. The treatment of CRD was also initiated and this led to marked improvement in the symptoms of the patient.},

   abstract = {Small-fiber polyneuropathy (SFPN) causes non-specific symptoms including chronic pain, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and sweating complaints. Diagnosis is made from history and exam in patients with known risk factors such as diabetes, but objective test confirmation is recommended for patients without known risks. If tests confirm SFPN, and it is "initially idiopathic" (iiSFPN), screening for occult causes is indicated. This study's aim was to evaluate the 21 widely available, recommended blood tests to identify the most cost-effective ones and to learn about occult causes of iiSFPN. Records were reviewed from all 213 patients with SFPN confirmed by distal-leg skin biopsy, nerve biopsy, or autonomic-function testing in our academic center during 2013. We determined the prevalence of each abnormal blood-test result (ABTR) in the iiSFPN cohort, compared this to population averages, and measured the costs of screening subjects to obtain one ABTR. Participants were 70 % female and aged 43.0 +/- 18.6 years. High erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and antinuclear antibody (ANA; >/=1:160 titer) were most common, each present in 28 % of subjects. The ABTR >/=3 x more prevalent in iiSFPN than in the total population were high ESR, high ANA, low C3, and Sjogren's and celiac autoantibodies. Together, these suggest the possibility of a specific association between iiSFPN and dysimmunity. ABTR identifying diabetes, prediabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia were less common in iiSFPN than in the population and thus were not associated with iiSFPN here. The six most cost-effective iiSFPN-associated blood tests-ESR, ANA, C3, autoantibodies for Sjogren's and celiac, plus thyroid-stimulating hormone-had estimated cost of $99.57/person and 45.6 % probability of obtaining one abnormal result. Angiotensin-converting enzyme was elevated in 45 %, but no patients had sarcoidosis, so this test was futile here.},

   abstract = {The innate immune system is known to play an important role in oral tolerance to dietary antigens. This is important in development of celiac disease (CD) but may also be important in type 1 diabetes (T1D), and could potentially explain the reduced incidence of T1D in mice receiving a gluten-free (GF) diet. The direct in vivo effect of gluten on innate cells, and particularly dendritic cells (DC) is not sufficiently clarified. Therefore, we wished to investigate the innate cell populations of spontaneous diabetic NOD mice and healthy BALB/c mice kept on a GF or a standard (STD) gluten containing diet. We studied, by flow cytometry and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), if dietary gluten induces changes in the activation of DCs and distribution of selected innate cells in lymphoid, pancreatic and intestinal tissues in BALB/c and NOD mice. We found that a GF diet increased the percentage of macrophages in BALB/c spleen and of CD11c+ DCs in BALB/c and NOD spleen. Strictly gluten-free (SGF) diet increased the percentage of CD103+ DCs in BALB/c mice and decreased percentages of CD11b+ DCs in mesenteric and pancreatic lymph nodes in BALB/c mice. SGF diet in BALB/c mice also decreased DC expression of CD40, CCR7 and MHC-II in pancreatic lymph nodes. In conclusion, GF diet changes the composition of the innate immune system in BALB/c and NOD mice and increases expression of DC activation markers in NOD mice. These results contribute to the explanation of the low diabetes incidence in GF NOD mice. This mechanism may be important in development of type 1 diabetes, celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.},

We investigated the prevalence and severity of these symptoms in patients with variable duration of GFD. Altogether, 856 patients were classified into untreated (n = 128), short-term GFD (1-2 years, n = 93) and long-term GFD (>/=3 years, n = 635) groups. Analyses were made of clinical and histological data and dietary adherence. Symptoms were evaluated by the validated GSRS questionnaire. One-hundred-sixty healthy subjects comprised the control group. Further, the severity of symptoms was compared with that in peptic ulcer, reflux disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Altogether, 93% of the short-term and 94% of the long-term treated patients had a strict GFD and recovered mucosa. Untreated patients had more diarrhea, indigestion and abdominal pain than those on GFD and controls. There were no differences in symptoms between the short- and long-term GFD groups, but both yielded poorer GSRS total score than controls (p = 0.03 and p = 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, patients treated 1-2 years had more diarrhea (p = 0.03) and those treated >10 years more reflux (p = 0.04) than controls. Long-term treated celiac patients showed relatively mild symptoms compared with other gastrointestinal diseases. Based on our results, good response to GFD sustained in long-term follow-up, but not all patients reach the level of healthy individuals.},

A large clinical spectrum of manifestations accompanies the onset of the disease with diarrhoea, flatulence and weight loss being the most common. However, findings like osteoporosis, iron deficiency, anaemia and hypocalcaemia could also insinuate the existence of the disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 55-year-old man with numbness and tingling of the upper extremities due to hypocalcaemia that proved to be an uncommon case of celiac disease. CONCLUSION: A non-negligible number of adult patients with celiac disease can present with only minor and subclinical manifestations of the disease. As such, hypocalcaemia may be the sole manifestation of celiac disease. A high index of suspicion is needed for prompt diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with celiac disease (CD), characterized histologically by villous atrophy (VA) of the small intestine, have an increased risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and atrial fibrillation (AF), risks that persist for years after commencing the gluten-free diet. It is unknown whether persistent VA on follow-up biopsy, rather than mucosal healing, affects the risk of IHD or AF. METHODS: We identified patients with histologic evidence of CD diagnosed at all 28 pathology departments in Sweden. Among patients who underwent a follow-up small intestinal biopsy, we compared patients with persistent VA to those who showed histologic improvement, with regard to the development of IHD (angina pectoris or myocardial infarction) or AF. RESULTS: Among patients with CD and a follow-up biopsy (n = 7,440), the median age at follow-up biopsy was 25 years, with 1,063 (14%) patients who were >/= 60 years at the time of follow-up biopsy. Some 196 patients developed IHD and 205 patients developed AF. After adjusting for age, gender, duration of CD, calendar period, and educational attainment, there was no significant effect of persistent VA on IHD (adjusted HR 0.97; 95%CI 0.73-1.30). Adjusting for diabetes had a negligible effect (adjusted HR 0.98; 95%CI 0.73-1.31). There was no significant association between persistent VA and the risk of AF (adjusted HR 0.98; 95%CI 0.74-1.30). CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study of patients with CD, persistent VA on follow-up biopsy was not associated with an increased risk of IHD or AF. Failed mucosal healing does not influence the risk of these cardiac events.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lymphocytic gastritis (LG) is an uncommon entity with varying symptoms and endoscopic appearances. This condition, as well as two forms of H. pylori-negative gastritis [chronic active gastritis (CAG) and chronic inactive gastritis (CIG)], appears to be more common in patients with coeliac disease (CD) based on single-centred studies. AIM: To compare the prevalence of LG, CAG and CIG among those with normal duodenal histology (or nonspecific duodenitis) and those with CD, as defined by villous atrophy (Marsh 3). METHODS: We analysed all concurrent gastric and duodenal biopsy specimens submitted to a national pathology laboratory during a 6-year period. We performed multiple logistic regression to identify independent predictors of each gastritis subtype. RESULTS: Among patients who underwent concurrent gastric and duodenal biopsy (n = 287,503), the mean age was 52 and the majority (67%) were female. Compared to patients with normal duodenal histology, LG was more common in partial villous atrophy (OR: 37.66; 95% CI: 30.16-47.03), and subtotal/total villous atrophy (OR: 78.57; 95% CI: 65.37-94.44). CD was also more common in CAG (OR for partial villous atrophy 1.93; 95% CI: 1.49-2.51, OR for subtotal/total villous atrophy 2.42; 95% CI: 1.90-3.09) and was similarly associated with CIG (OR for partial villous atrophy 2.04; 95% CI: 1.76-2.35, OR for subtotal/total villous atrophy 2.96; 95% CI: 2.60-3.38). CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocytic gastritis is strongly associated with coeliac disease, with increasing prevalence correlating with more advanced villous atrophy. Chronic active gastritis and chronic inactive gastritis are also significantly associated with coeliac disease. Future research should measure the natural history of these conditions after treatment with a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a multisystem immune based disorder that is triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The prevalence of celiac disease has risen in recent decades and is currently about 1% in most Western populations. The reason for this rise is unknown, although environmental factors related to the hygiene hypothesis are suspected. The pathophysiology of celiac disease involves both the innate and adaptive immune response to dietary gluten. Clinical features are diverse and include gastrointestinal symptoms, metabolic bone disease, infertility, and many other manifestations. Although a gluten-free diet is effective in most patients, this diet can be burdensome and can limit quality of life; consequently, non-dietary therapies are at various stages of development. This review also covers non-celiac gluten sensitivity. The pathophysiology of this clinical phenotype is poorly understood, but it is a cause of increasing interest in gluten-free diets in the general population.},

   abstract = {Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) or Berger's disease is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis in the world and one of the first causes of end-stage renal failure. IgAN is characterized by the accumulation of immune complexes containing polymeric IgA1 in mesangial areas. The pathogenesis of this disease involves the deposition of polymeric and hypogalactosylated IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) in the mesangium. Quantitative and structural changes of Gd-IgA1 play a key role in the development of the disease due to functional abnormalities of two IgA receptors: the FcalphaRI (CD89) expressed by blood myeloid cells and the transferrin receptor (CD71) on mesangial cells. Abnormal Gd-IgA1 induces release of soluble CD89, which participates in the formation of circulating IgA1 complexes. These complexes are trapped by CD71 that is overexpressed on mesangial cells in IgAN patients together with the crosslinking enzyme transglutaminase 2 allowing pathogenic IgA complex formation in situ and mesangial cell activation. A humanized mouse model expressing IgA1 and CD89 develops IgAN in a similar manner as patients. In this model, a food antigen, the gliadin, was shown to be crucial for circulating IgA1 complex formation and deposition, which could be prevented by a gluten-free diet. Identification of these new partners opens new therapeutic prospects for IgAN treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is little information available on the use of social support systems for patients with coeliac disease (CD). We performed a cross-sectional study aiming to examine the association between participation in different types of social support networks and quality of life (QOL) in adults with CD. METHODS: A survey including a validated CD specific QOL instrument was administered online and in-person to adults with CD who were following a gluten-free diet. Participation in social support networks (type, frequency and duration) were assessed. RESULTS: Among the 2138 participants, overall QOL scores were high, averaging 68.9 out of 100. Significant differences in QOL scores were found for age, length of time since diagnosis and level of education. Most (58%) reported using no social support networks. Of the 42% reporting use of social support networks (online 17.9%, face-to-face 10.8% or both 12.8%), QOL scores were higher for those individuals who used only face-to-face social support compared to only online support (72.6 versus 66.7; P < 0.0001). A longer duration of face-to-face social support use was associated with higher QOL scores (P < 0.0005). By contrast, a longer duration and increased frequency of online social support use was associated with lower QOL scores (P < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Participation in face-to-face social support networks is associated with greater QOL scores compared to online social support networks. These findings have potential implications for the management of individuals with CD. Emphasis on face-to-face support may improve long-term QOL and patient outcomes.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine the proportion of pediatric patients with celiac disease (CD) who had transaminases obtained at diagnosis and to determine the proportion with hypertransaminasemia. METHODS: Data from newly diagnosed patients with CD at Nationwide Children's Hospital from February 2007 to March 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) values at diagnosis and after initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) were assessed. RESULTS: Of 388 patients (mean age 10.1 +/- 4.4 years, 235 girls), 185 (47.7%) had transaminases obtained at the time of diagnosis. Twenty-eight of one hundred eighty-five (15.1%) had an elevated ALT and/or AST level with an average ALT 2.52 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and AST 1.87 x ULN. Those with hypertransaminasemia were younger than those with normal levels (6.31 +/- 4.75 vs 11.00 +/- 4.28 years, P < 0.0001). Sex, symptoms at diagnosis, and weight, height, and body mass index z scores were not predictive of elevated transaminases. Of the 21 patients with hypertransaminasemia at diagnosis who had repeat laboratory test results after starting the GFD, 15 (71.4%) normalized whereas 6 (28.6%) remained elevated. CONCLUSIONS: There is variation in practice among pediatric gastroenterologists in the assessment of transaminases in children with CD. Hypertransaminasemia is present at diagnosis in a significant proportion of children with CD although at a lower frequency than previously reported. Younger patients are more likely to have an elevation in transaminases. Abnormal transaminases normalize in the majority of patients within 1 year after initiation of a GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CeD) is a prevalent autoimmune condition. Recurrent signs and symptoms are common despite treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD), yet no approved or proven nondietary treatment is available. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we assessed larazotide acetate 0.5, 1, or 2 mg 3 times daily to relieve ongoing symptoms in 342 adults with CeD who had been on a GFD for 12 months or longer and maintained their current GFD during the study. The study included a 4-week placebo run-in, 12 weeks of treatment, and a 4-week placebo run-out phase. The primary end point was the difference in average on-treatment Celiac Disease Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale score. RESULTS: The primary end point was met with the 0.5-mg dose of larazotide acetate, with fewer symptoms compared with placebo by modified intention to treat (n = 340) (analysis of covariance, P = .022; mixed model for repeated measures, P = .005). The 0.5-mg dose showed an effect on exploratory end points including a 26% decrease in celiac disease patient-reported outcome symptomatic days (P = .017), a 31% increase in improved symptom days (P = .034), a 50% or more reduction from baseline of the weekly average abdominal pain score for 6 or more of 12 weeks of treatment (P = .022), and a decrease in the nongastrointestinal symptoms of headache and tiredness (P = .010). The 1- and 2-mg doses were no different than placebo for any end point. Safety was comparable with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Larazotide acetate 0.5 mg reduced signs and symptoms in CeD patients on a GFD better than a GFD alone. Although results were mixed, this study was a successful trial of a novel therapeutic agent targeting tight junction regulation in patients with CeD who are symptomatic despite a GFD.

   abstract = {The association between coeliac disease and type 1 diabetes has long been established. The combination of genetic susceptibility along with a potential role for gluten in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity makes defining gluten's role in type 1 diabetes extremely important. Evidence supporting the role of a gluten-free diet to improve complications associated with type 1 diabetes is not robust. However there is evidence to support improved growth, bone density and potentially the prevention of additional autoimmune diseases in patients with coeliac disease and type 1 diabetes. The gluten free diet is expensive and challenging to adhere to in people already on a modified diet. Early identification of those who have coeliac disease and would benefit from a gluten-free diet is of utmost importance to prevent complications associated with type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and celiac disease (CD) belong to the autoimmune disease family. Despite being separate entities they share multiple aspects. Epidemiologically they share comparable incidence environmental influences, associated antibodies and a recent incidental surge. They differ in their HLA pre-dispositions and specific predictive and diagnostic biomarkers. At the clinical level, celiac disease exhibits extra-intestinal rheumatic manifestations and RA gastrointestinal ones. Small bowel pathology exists in rheumatic patients. A trend towards responsiveness to a gluten free diet has been observed, ameliorating celiac rheumatic manifestations, whereas dietary interventions for rheumatoid arthritis remain controversial. Pathophysiologically, both diseases are mediated by endogenous enzymes in the target organs. The infectious, dysbiotic and increased intestinal permeability theories, as drivers of the autoimmune cascade, apply to both diseases. Contrary to their specific HLA pre-disposition, the diseases share multiple non-HLA loci. Those genes are crucial for activation and regulation of adaptive and innate immunity. Recently, light was shed on the interaction between host genetics and microbiota composition in relation to CD and RA susceptibility, connecting bugs and us and autoimmunity. A better understanding of the above mentioned similarities in the gut-joint inter-relationship, may elucidate additional facets in the mosaic of autoimmunity, relating CD to RA.},

   abstract = {Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is associated with chronic inflammatory activity and disrupted insulin signaling, leading to insulin resistance (IR). The present study investigated the benefits of neurolytic celiac plexus block (NCPB) on IR in a rat NIDDM model. Goto-Kakizaki rats fed a high-fat, high-glucose diet to induce signs of NIDDM were randomly divided into NCPB and control groups; these received daily bilateral 0.5% lidocaine or 0.9% saline injections into the celiac plexus, respectively. Following 14 and 28 daily injections, rats were subject to oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) or sacrificed for the analysis of serum free fatty acids (FFAs), serum inflammatory cytokines and skeletal muscle insulin signaling. Compared with controls, rats in the NCPB group demonstrated significantly (P<0.05) lower baseline, 60-min and 120-min OGTT values, lower 120-min serum insulin, lower IR [higher insulin sensitivity index (ISI1) and lower ISI2) and lower serum FFAs, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6. Conversely, NCPB rats exhibited higher basal and insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose uptake and higher skeletal muscle insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and glucose transporter type 4 expression. There were no differences between the groups in insulin receptor beta (Rbeta) or Akt expression; however Rbeta-Y1162/Y1163 and Akt-S473 phosphorylation levels were higher and IRS-1-S307 phosphorylation were lower in NCPB rats than in the controls. These results indicate that NCPB improved insulin signaling and reduced IR, possibly by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine release.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients with celiac disease experience difficulties in adherence to a gluten-free diet. Methods for testing compliance to a gluten-free diet are costly and cumbersome. Thus, a simple biomarker of gluten intake is needed in a clinical setting and will be useful for epidemiologic studies investigating wider effects of gluten intake. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate plasma total alkylresorcinol concentrations as a measure of gluten intake. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, crossover intervention study in 52 Danish adults with features of the metabolic syndrome, we compared 8 wk of a gluten-rich and gluten-poor diet separated by a washout period of >/=6 wk. We measured fasting plasma concentrations of alkylresorcinols to determine if they reflected differences in gluten intake as a secondary outcome of the original study. In addition, we investigated in 118 Danish adults the cross-sectional association between self-reported gluten intake and plasma alkylresorcinols in the same and a similar study at baseline. We used mixed-model ANCOVA for examining treatment effects, a classification tree to determine compliance to the gluten-poor diet, and linear regression models for examining baseline correlation between plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations and gluten intake. RESULTS: Plasma total alkylresorcinols decreased more during the gluten-poor period (geometric mean: -124.8 nmol/L; 95% CI: -156.5, -93.0 nmol/L) than in the gluten-rich period (geometric mean: -31.8 nmol/L; 95% CI: -63.1, -0.4 nmol/L) (P < 0.001). On the basis of the plasma alkylresorcinol profile, we built a classification tree to objectively determine compliance and found an overall participant misclassification error of 3.9%. In the cross-sectional study we found a 5.6% (95% CI: 2.4%, 8.9%) increase in plasma total alkylresorcinols per 1-g increase in reported gluten intake (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We propose the use of plasma alkylresorcinols to monitor compliance to a gluten-free diet as well as to help investigations into the possible effects of gluten in the wider population.

   abstract = {Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome diagnosed in patients with symptoms that respond to removal of gluten from the diet, after celiac disease and wheat allergy have been excluded. NCGS has been related to neuro-psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia and depression. A singular report of NCGS presenting with hallucinations has been described in an adult patient. We report a pediatric case of a psychotic disorder clearly related to NCGS and investigate the causes by a review of literature. The pathogenesis of neuro-psychiatric manifestations of NCGS is unclear. It has been hypothesized that: (a) a "leaky gut" allows some gluten peptides to cross the intestinal membrane and the blood brain barrier, affecting the endogenous opiate system and neurotransmission; or (b) gluten peptides may set up an innate immune response in the brain similar to that described in the gut mucosa, causing exposure from neuronal cells of a transglutaminase primarily expressed in the brain. The present case-report confirms that psychosis may be a manifestation of NCGS, and may also involve children; the diagnosis is difficult with many cases remaining undiagnosed. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to establish the real role of gluten as a triggering factor in neuro-psychiatric disorders.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on exercise performance, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, perceived well-being, intestinal injury, and inflammatory responses in nonceliac athletes. METHODS: Thirteen competitive endurance cyclists (8 males, 5 females) with no positive clinical screening for celiac disease or history of irritable bowel syndrome (mean +/- SD; age, 32 +/- 7 yr; weight, 71.1 +/- 13.4 kg; height, 177.0 +/- 11.8 cm, VO2max 59.1 +/- 8.0 mL.kg(-)(1).min(-)(1)) were allocated to a 7-d gluten-containing diet (GCD) or GFD separated by a 10-d washout in a controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Cyclists ate a GFD alongside either gluten-containing or gluten-free food bars (16 g wheat gluten per day) while habitual training and nutrition behaviors were controlled. During each diet, cyclists completed the Daily Analysis of Life Demand for Athletes (DALDA) and GI questionnaires (postexercise and daily). On day 7, cyclists completed a submaximal steady-state (SS) 45-min ride at 70% Wmax followed by a 15-min time trial (TT). Blood samples were taken preexercise, post-SS, and post-TT to determine intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) and inflammatory markers (cytokine responses: interleukin [IL] 1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, tumor necrosis factor alpha). Mixed effects logistic regression was used to analyze data. RESULTS: TT performance was not significantly different (P = 0.37) between the GCD (245.4 +/- 53.4 kJ) and GFD (245.0 +/- 54.6 kJ). GI symptoms during exercise, daily, and DALDA responses were similar for each diet (P > 0.11). There were no significant differences in IFABP (P = 0.69) or cytokine (P > 0.13) responses. CONCLUSIONS: A short-term GFD had no overall effect on performance, GI symptoms, well-being, and a select indicator of intestinal injury or inflammatory markers in nonceliac endurance athletes.},

   abstract = {Adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) for nonceliac athletes (NCA) has become increasingly popular despite a paucity of supportive medical or ergogenic evidence. This study aimed to quantify the demographics of NCA and determine associated experiences, perceptions, and sources of information related to GFD. Athletes (n = 910, female = 528, no gender selected = 5) completed a 17-question online survey. Forty-one percent of NCA respondents, including 18-world and/or Olympic medalists, follow a GFD 50-100% of the time (GFD > 50): only 13% for treatment of reported medical conditions with 57% self-diagnosing their gluten sensitivity. The GFD > 50 group characteristics included predominantly endurance sport athletes (70.0%) at the recreationally competitive level (32.3%), between 31 and 40 years of age (29.1%). Those who follow a GFD > 50 reported experiencing, abdominal/gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms alone (16.7%) or in conjunction with two (30.7%) or three (35.7%) additional symptoms (e.g., fatigue) believed to be triggered by gluten. Eighty-four percent of GFD > 50 indicated symptom improvement with gluten-removal. Symptom-based and non-symptom-based self-diagnosed gluten-sensitivity (56.7%) was the primary reason for adopting a GFD. Leading sources of GFD information were online (28.7%), trainer/coach (26.2%) and other athletes (17.4%). Although 5-10% of the general population is estimated to benefit clinically from a GFD a higher prevalence of GFD adherence was found in NCA (41.2%). Prescription of a GFD among many athletes does not result from evidence-based practice suggesting that adoption of a GFD in the majority of cases was not based on medical rationale and may be driven by perception that gluten removal provides health benefits and an ergogenic edge in NCA.},

   abstract = {AIM: Implementing international guidelines guarantees high standards of clinical care. A group of experts developed an algorithm to drive the management of common gastrointestinal symptoms in infancy by paediatricians and general practitioners. METHODS: The algorithm started from the evidence-based recommendations of the European Society of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and an updated review of the literature. We used the structured quantitative method of nominal group technique to reach a consensus. RESULTS: A practical algorithm for the management of infants with acute diarrhoea was designed based on the consensus reached for each statement. The management of an infant with acute diarrhoea should include a sequence of actions: (i) a semiquantitative estimate of infant dehydration through validated clinical scores, (ii) rehydration therapy and early refeeding with breast milk or regular formula and (iii) effective agents to reduce the severity and duration of the diarrhoea. Finally, in children with prolonged diarrhoea, the search for aetiology should include persistent infections or reinfections, cows' milk protein allergy and coeliac diseases. Lactose should always be withdrawn. CONCLUSION: This algorithm provides an evidence-based sequence of interventions to optimise the management of infants with acute diarrhoea.},

   abstract = {The IL-33/ST2 axis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several tissue-specific autoimmune diseases. Celiac disease (CD) is the only autoimmune disease in which both the major genetic factors (HLA-DQ2/DQ8) and etiologic ones (dietary gluten) for susceptibility are known. We have measured serum levels and determined intestinal tissue expression of IL-33 and its receptor soluble ST2 in patients with CD to investigate their association with disease activity. Serum and tissue levels of both IL-33 and sST2 were significantly higher in patients with CD compared with those in control patients without CD. We show that toxic peptides extracted from barley and wheat gliadin significantly stimulate the production of IL-33 and ST2 in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cell from celiac patients, strongly implicating the IL-33/ST2 axis in the pathogenesis of CD. The higher levels of IL-33 and its receptor ST2 in tissue and serum reflect an active inflammatory state and may represent a potential biomarker for disease activity. A better understanding of IL-33/ST2 release, mode of action, and regulation will be crucial to develop therapeutics that target the IL-33/ST2 pathway to treat CD.Cellular & Molecular Immunology advance online publication, 7 September 2015; doi:10.1038/cmi.2015.85.},

   abstract = {The intestinal microbiota would be implicated in pathology associated with celiac disease caused by an abnormal immune system reaction against gluten present in cereal grains. The objectives of this work were to detect through basic methods the changes in the composition of the most common genera of bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of symptom-free celiac disease children with a gluten-free diet compared with healthy children from Tucuman and to select lactobacilli (Lb) strains with probiotic potential from the feces of healthy children. Results demonstrated that the feces of celiac children with a gluten-free diet showed significantly lower counts of Lb (P < 0.05) compared with healthy children, while enterobacteria tended to increase in celiac children. On the basis of these results, isolation of some Lb from the feces of healthy children was carried out. Thus, 5 Lb strains were selected because of their high resistance percentages to gastrointestinal tract conditions. In addition, their autoaggregation and hydrophobicity properties were evaluated: Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LC4) showed the highest percentage of autoaggregation while Lactobacillus paracasei (LC9) showed high hydrophobicity. Based on these results, LC4 and LC9 were selected, and their use as potential probiotic strains to improve signs and symptoms associated with celiac disease is discussed. This is the first study performed in Argentina concerning the relationship between intestinal microbiota and celiac disease in celiac children with a gluten-free diet. In addition, the development of a probiotic food addressed towards celiac patients and designed with Lb isolated from the feces of healthy children from our province represents a promising alternative to improve the quality of life of celiac patients.},

   abstract = {Fats constitute the most significant nutritional source of energy. Their proper use by the body conditions a number of complex mechanisms of digestion, absorption, distribution, and metabolism. These mechanisms are facilitated by fats made of medium chain fatty acids; therefore, they are an easy and quick source of energy. Thus, an increased supply of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) is particularly important in patients with disturbances of digestion and absorption such as disturbed bile secretion, classic coeliac disease, short bowel syndrome, inflammatory diseases of the intestines, disturbed outflow of lymph, some metabolic disease, and severe food allergies, as well as in prematurely born neonates. Use of preparations containing an additive of MCT is limited, especially if they are to be used for a longer period of time. With a large quantity of MCT in a diet, there is a risk of deficiency of necessary unsaturated fatty acids and some fat-soluble vitamins. The caloricity of MTC compared to long-chain triglycerides is lower, and formulas with MCT are characterised by higher osmolality. Medium chain triglycerides is not recommended as an additive to standard formulas for healthy children. The use of MCT should be limited to strictly specified medical indications.},

Objectives of the study were to compare dietary adherence in coeliac disease (CD) subjects and in non-coeliac gluten sensitive (NCGS) subjects, and to estimate gluten exposure based on weighed food records and analysis of gluten content in selected food items. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twenty-three subjects with biopsy verified CD on a gluten-free diet and 34 HLA-DQ2+ NCGS subjects on a self-instituted gluten-free diet were enrolled. The latter group was under investigation of CD. Dietary adherence was assessed by frequency questionnaire and structured forms supplied by weighed food records. For the analyses of food samples, the sandwich R5-ELISA, Ridascreen(R) Gliadin competitive method was used. RESULTS: There was no difference in dietary adherence between CD and NCGS subjects (83% vs 68%, p = 0.21). NCGS subjects were mainly self-educated in gluten-free diet compared to CD subjects (91% and 39%, respectively, p < 0.001). In non-adherent subjects, there was no difference in gluten exposure between CD and NCGS (10 vs 138 mg/day, p = 0.83). There was no difference in BMR-factor between CD and NCGS subjects, or between adherent and non-adherent subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Both CD and NCGS subjects were largely adherent, and adherence did not differ between the groups. Gluten exposure varied greatly, and some CD and NCGS subjects reached gluten intake above 500 mg/day, which might have considerable health effects on the individual, especially in case of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {The process of transition from childhood to adulthood is characterised by physical, mental and psychosocial development. Data on the transition and transfer of care in adolescents/young adults with coeliac disease (CD) are scarce. In this paper, 17 physicians from 10 countries (Sweden, Italy, the USA, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, Australia, Britain, Israel and Denmark) and two representatives from patient organisations (Association of European Coeliac Societies and the US Celiac Disease Foundation) examined the literature on transition from childhood to adulthood in CD. Medline (Ovid) and EMBASE were searched between 1900 and September 2015. Evidence in retrieved reports was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. The current consensus report aims to help healthcare personnel manage CD in the adolescent and young adult and provide optimal care and transition into adult healthcare for patients with this disease. In adolescence, patients with CD should gradually assume exclusive responsibility for their care, although parental support is still important. Dietary adherence and consequences of non-adherence should be discussed during transition. In most adolescents and young adults, routine small intestinal biopsy is not needed to reconfirm a childhood diagnosis of CD based on European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) or North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) criteria, but a biopsy may be considered where paediatric diagnostic criteria have not been fulfilled, such as, in a patient without biopsy at diagnosis, additional serology (endomysium antibody) has not been performed to confirm 10-fold positivity of tissue transglutaminase antibodies or when a no biopsy strategy has been adopted in an asymptomatic child.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong disorder. Patients are at increased risk of complications and comorbidity. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a review of the literature on patient support and information in CD and aim to issue recommendations about patient information with regards to CD. METHODS: DATA SOURCE: We searched PubMed for English-language articles published between 1900 and June 2014, containing terms related to costs, economics of CD, or education and CD. STUDY SELECTION: Papers deemed relevant by any of the participating authors were included in the study. DATA SYNTHESIS: No quantitative synthesis of data was performed. Instead we formulated a consensus view of the information that should be offered to all patients with CD. RESULTS: There are few randomized clinical trials examining the effect of patient support in CD. Patients and their families receive information from many sources. It is important that health care personnel guide the patient through the plethora of facts and comments on the Internet. An understanding of CD is likely to improve dietary adherence. Patients should be educated about current knowledge about risk factors for CD, as well as the increased risk of complications. Patients should also be advised to avoid other health hazards, such as smoking. Many patients are eager to learn about future non-dietary treatments of CD. This review also comments on novel therapies but it is important to stress that no such treatment is available at present. CONCLUSION: Based on mostly observational data, we suggest that patient support and information should be an integral part of the management of CD, and is likely to affect the outcome of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) occurs in approximately 1% of the Western population. It is a lifelong disorder that is associated with impaired quality of life (QOL) and an excessive risk of comorbidity and death. OBJECTIVES: To review the literature on screening for CD in relation to the current World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for mass screening. METHODS: We performed a PubMed search to identify indexed papers on CD screening with a publication date from 1900 until 1 June 2014. When we deemed an abstract relevant, we read the corresponding paper in detail. RESULTS: CD fulfills several WHO criteria for mass screening (high prevalence, available treatment and difficult clinical detection), but it has not yet been established that treatment of asymptomatic CD may reduce the excessive risk of severe complications, leading to higher QOL nor that it is cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is not sufficient to support mass screening for CD, but active case-finding may be appropriate, as we recognize that most patients with CD will still be missed by this strategy. Although proof of benefit is still lacking, screening for CD may be appropriate in high-risk groups.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Histological examination of small bowel biopsies is normally the gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). The objective of this study was to investigate whether the rate of decreases in elevated plasma IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody (IgA-tTG) and/or IgG deamidated gliadin peptides antibody (IgG - DGP) concentrations could be used as a confirming test for CD in children on a gluten-free diet (GFD) when biopsy was omitted in the diagnostic process. METHODS: In this retrospective study we compared children (</=18 years old) with a CD-confirming biopsy (n = 16) to children without a biopsy (n = 18). After initiation of GFD the antibody half-life (the time (T(1/2)) when the antibody concentration is 50% decreased) was determined in all children. RESULTS: Children with a biopsy (IgA-tTG, T(1/2) = 1.9 months; IgG - DGP, T(1/2) = 2.2 months) and children without a biopsy (IgA-tTG, T(1/2) = 1.6 months; IgG - DGP, T(1/2) = 2.7 months) had comparable T(1/2) (mean) results (p < 0.05) supporting that all children had the CD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: When biopsy was omitted a rapid rate of decrease in CD antibody concentrations confirmed the CD diagnosis in children on GFD. The half-lives (T(1/2)) of IgA-tTG were less than 2 months in CD children.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a treatable, gluten-induced disease that often occurs concurrently with other autoimmune diseases. In genetic studies since 2007, a partial genetic overlap between these diseases has been revealed and further insights into the pathophysiology of coeliac disease and autoimmunity have been gained. However, genetic screening is not sensitive and specific enough to accurately predict disease development. The current method to diagnose individuals with coeliac disease is serological testing for the presence of autoantibodies whilst the patient is on a regular, gluten-containing diet, followed by gastroduodenoscopy with duodenal biopsy. Serological test results can also predict the probability of coeliac disease development, even if asymptomatic. In patients with autoimmune diseases known to occur alongside coeliac disease (particularly type 1 diabetes mellitus or thyroid disorders), disease screening-and subsequent treatment if coeliac disease is detected-could have beneficial effects on progression or potential complications of both diseases, owing to the effectiveness of gluten-free dietary interventions in coeliac disease. However, whether diagnosis of coeliac disease and subsequent dietary treatment can prevent autoimmune diseases is debated. In this Review, the genetic and immunological features of coeliac disease, overlap with other autoimmune diseases and implications for current screening strategies will be discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is managed by life-long adherence to a gluten-free diet and dietitians have the potential to facilitate this. Patient involvement through shared decision-making is central to behaviour-change skills used by dietitians, although there is little evidence supporting its inclusion in evaluating dietetic interventions. The present study aimed to explore patients' preferences for diet and nutrition-related outcomes in CD. METHODS: Adults with CD or adult carers of children with CD were invited through support networks. Participants took part in a telephone, face-to-face interview or focus group which was audio-recorded and transcribed. Themes were developed using a framework method. Ethical approval was obtained. RESULTS: Twenty-nine adult patients and five parents of CD children participated 0-34 years after diagnosis. Four main outcome-related themes emerged: (i) Participants wanted information specific to their lifestyle and time since diagnosis, focussing on food containing gluten, practical issues, prescribable items and general nutrition. (ii) The degree of satisfaction with the consultation process impacted on participants' experience, including the dietitian's CD expertise, consistency of the dietitian seen, and the frequency and length of appointments. (iii) Health concerns were important to participants and focussed on risk of osteoporosis, unwanted weight gain, and the fat and sugar content of manufactured gluten-free products. (iv) Clinical monitoring, including bone scans and antibody measurements, was mentioned but was not described as being of importance for most participants. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes preferred by CD patients and carers focussed primarily on information and resources received and satisfaction with their dietetic consultation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is increasingly diagnosed through screening of at-risk groups (relatives of individuals and associated autoimmune disorders). The impact of diagnosis and treatment on screen-detected CD patients is poorly studied, particularly in the United States. We therefore compared the quality of life (QOL) between screen-detected and symptom-detected CD patients. METHODS: Patients with a known diagnosis of CD were invited to complete 3 validated survey instruments: the CD Quality of Life (CDQOL), the CD Adherence Test for dietary adherence and the general Psychological General Well-Being index. In addition, demographic details, mode of presentation, and compliance with gluten-free diet (GFD) were assessed. RESULTS: The overall response rate was high at 69%. Of 226 responses received, 211 were eligible for inclusion; the median age was 47, and the median duration of GFD was 4 years. One third of the sample (71, 34%) was screen detected. Of these, 57 (80%) had a relative diagnosed with CD, whereas 14 (20%) had an associated condition. Despite being screen detected, 49 (69%) reported symptoms before diagnosis. GFD adherence was excellent and did not differ between groups. Overall, there were no significant differences between screen-detected and symptom-detected patients with regard to CDQOL, CD Adherence Test, and Psychological General Well-Being scores. CONCLUSIONS: Screen-detected and symptom-detected CD patients do not differ with regard to QOL or disease adherence as measured by validated disease-specific instruments. A high proportion of screen-detected patients reported symptoms before diagnosis, which often improve with GFD.},

Intractable diarrhea of infancy (IDI) includes several types of early onset diarrhea; one of the rare etiologies is trichohepatoenteric (THE) syndrome, also known as syndromic diarrhea (SD) which was primarily described by Stankler et al. Hereby we report a family with several affected members which to our knowledge is the first case report from Iran. Report of Cases. A three-year-old boy referred with short stature, poor weight gain, and intermittent steatotic diarrhea to our center. He was born to healthy, relative parents (cousins). He did not gain any weight after four months of age and began having intermittent steatotic diarrhea, abdominal distension, and fever. He was hospitalized several times. Two other children in the family also showed somewhat similar symptoms. Two sweat tests were negative for cystic fibrosis. Workup for Celiac disease was performed several times which was negative; however, gluten-free diet was tried several times which was not effective. Workup for Hirschsprung's disease was performed but colon was ganglionic. Evidence of liver involvement was approved by elevated liver enzymes and coarse echo of liver on sonography. Discussion. Trichoenterohepatic syndrome should be put in mind in cases of intractable diarrhea presenting in a family with several affected members. Early diagnosis would save patients from unnecessary workups.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition characterised by gluten-induced intestinal inflammation, and observed at a 5-10 fold greater prevalence in type 1 diabetes. While universal screening for CD in patients with diabetes is frequently advocated, objective data is limited as to benefits on diabetes control, bone health or quality of life related to the adoption of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in the large proportion of patients with diabetes with asymptomatic CD. The Celiac Disease and Diabetes-Dietary Intervention and Evaluation Trial (CD-DIET) study is a multicenter, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a GFD in patients with type 1 diabetes with asymptomatic CD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Children and adults (8-45 years) with type 1 diabetes will be screened for asymptomatic CD. Eligible patients with biopsy-proven CD will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with a GFD for 1 year, or continue with a gluten-containing diet. The primary outcome will evaluate the impact of the GFD on change in glycated haemoglobin. Secondary outcomes will evaluate changes in bone mineral density, blood glucose variability and health-related quality of life between GFD-treated and the regular diet group over a 1-year period. The study was initiated in 2012 and has subsequently expanded to multiple paediatric and adult centres in Ontario, Canada. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The findings from this study will provide high-quality evidence as to the impact of GFD treatment on glycaemic control and complications in asymptomatic children and adults with CD and type 1 diabetes.

   abstract = {The spectrum of gluten-related disorders has widened in recent times and includes celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy. The complex of symptoms associated with these diseases, such as diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain may overlap for the gluten related diseases, and furthermore they can be similar to those caused by various other intestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The mechanisms underlying symptom generation are diverse for all these diseases. Some patients with celiac disease may remain asymptomatic or have only mild gastrointestinal symptoms and thus may qualify for the diagnosis of IBS in the general clinical practice. Similarly, the overlap of symptoms between IBS and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) often creates a dilemma for clinicians. While the treatment of NCGS is exclusion of gluten from the diet, some, but not all, of the patients with IBS also improve on a gluten-free diet. Both IBS and NCGS are common in the general population and both can coexist with each other independently without necessarily sharing a common pathophysiological basis. Although the pathogenesis of NCGS is not well understood, it is likely to be heterogeneous with possible contributing factors such as low-grade intestinal inflammation, increased intestinal barrier function and changes in the intestinal microbiota. Innate immunity may also play a pivotal role. One possible inducer of innate immune response has recently been reported to be amylase-trypsin inhibitor, a protein present in wheat endosperm and the source of flour, along with the gluten proteins.},

Besides the classic complications, autoimmune diseases and osteopenia, numerous forms of CD non-responsive to a gluten-free diet have been recently identified. Among the non-responsive CD, the majority of patients presents as long term responders. However a small subset of CD patients becomes refractory to a gluten-free diet with persistent malabsorption and intestinal villous atrophy. Whereas refractory coeliac disease type I (RCDI) is hardly distinguishable from active CD, the type II (RCDII) has a severe clinical presentation and a very poor prognosis. Enteropathy Associated T cell Lymphoma (EATL) is even more aggressive with a five year survival of 20%. Classic adriamycin-based chemotherapy is poorly efficient in the lymphomatous complications of CD and current therapeutic strategies focus on more intensive regimen with autologous or allogenic stem cell transplantation. Notable pathogenic advances let us to test targeted therapy both in low (RCDII) and high grade lymphomatous (EATL) complications associated with CD.},

   abstract = {The first competitive disposable amperometric immunosensor based on gliadin-functionalized carbon/nanogold screen-printed electrodes was developed for rapid determination of celiotoxic prolamins. To date, no competitive spectrophotometric or electrochemical immunoassays have yet been successfully applied to gluten detection in processed food samples, which require the use of complex prolamin extraction solutions containing additives with denaturing, reducing and disaggregating functions. Thus, in this work, great effort was put into the optimization and performance evaluation of the immunosensor in terms of suitability as a screening tool for analysis of cereal-based food samples. For this purpose, aqueous ethanol or complex extraction mixtures, as the patented Cocktail Solution(R), were proved effective in the extraction of gliadin. Good sensitivity was achieved after optimization of the immunocompetitive assay, giving limit of detection and limit of quantitation of 8 and 22 ng/ml of gliadin, respectively, for ethanol extracts. The immunosensor was proved to be suitable also for samples extracted with Cocktail Solution(R) after a proper dilution. Analysis of real samples of different flours proved the suitability of the immunosensing device as a powerful tool for safety assessment of raw materials used for the formulation of dietary products for celiac disease patients. This immunosensor combines good analytical performance using a very simplified set-up protocol with suitability for rapid screening analysis performed using inexpensive and portable instrumentation.

   abstract = {Celiac patients should feel confident in the safety of foods labelled or expected to be gluten-free. In this context, a targeted proteomic approach based on liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) technique was proposed to assess the presence of celiotoxic cereals, namely wheat, oats, barley and rye, in raw and processed food products. To this aim, unique marker peptides were properly selected in order to distinguish between the different cereal types. A revised cocktail solution based on reducing and denaturing agents was exploited for prolamin extraction from raw and processed food; in addition, defatting with hexane was carried out for sample clean-up, allowing to largely reduce problems related to matrix effect. Method validation on fortified rice flour showed good analytical performance in terms of sensitivity (limits of detection in the 2-18 mg kg(-1) range). However, poor trueness was calculated for self-made incurred bread (between 3 and 30% depending on the peptide), probably due to baking processes, which reduce gluten extractability. Thus, it is evident that in the case of processed foods further insights into sample treatment efficiency and reference materials for protein calibration are required to obtain accurate gluten determination. Finally, the developed method was applied for the analysis of market food products, offering the possibility to discriminate among cereals, with good agreement with labelled ingredients for gluten-containing foodstuffs.},

Most patients with IBS attribute their symptoms to adverse food reactions. We review the role of diet in the pathogenesis of IBS and the importance of dietary factors in the management of these patients. The MEDLINE electronic database (1966 to Jan 2015) was searched using the following keywords: "food", "diet", "food allergy", "food hypersensitivity", "food intolerance", "IBS", "epidemiology", "pathogenesis", "pathophysiology", "diagnosis", "treatment". We found 153 eligible papers; 80 were excluded because: not written in English, exclusive biochemical and experimental research, case reports, reviews, and research otherwise not relevant to our specific interest. We selected 73 papers: 43 original papers, 26 reviews and 4 letters to the editor. These papers focused on IBS pathogenesis, the association between IBS and atopy, and between IBS and food allergy, the relationship between IBS and non-celiac wheat sensitivity, the role of diet in IBS. Pending further scientific evidence, a cautious approach is advisable but the concept of food allergy should be included as a possible cause of IBS, and a dietary approach may have a place in the routine clinical management of IBS.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Intolerance to various foods, excluding bona fide coeliac disease and lactose intolerance, represents a growing cause of patient visits to allergy clinics.Histamine intolerance is a long-known, multifaceted clinical condition triggered by histamine-rich foods and alcohol and/or by drugs that liberate histamine or block diamine oxidase (DAO), the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of ingested histamine. Histamine limitation diets impose complex, non-standardized restrictions that may severely impact the quality of life of patients. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 14 patients who visited allergy outpatient facilities in northern Italy with a negative diagnosis for IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity, coeliac disease, conditions related to gastric hypersecretion, and systemic nickel hypersensitivity, and who previously underwent a histamine limitation diet with benefits for their main symptoms. Serum diamine oxidase levels and the clinical response to diamine oxidase supplementation were investigated. RESULTS: We found that 10 out of 14 patients had serum DAO activity<10 U/mL, which was the threshold suggested as a cutoff for probable histamine intolerance. Moreover, 13 out of 14 patients subjectively reported a benefit in at least one of the disturbances related to food intolerances following diamine oxidase supplementation. The mean value (+/-SD) of diamine oxidase activity in the cohort of patients with histamine intolerance symptoms was 7.04+/-6.90 U/mL compared to 39.50+/-18.16 U/mL in 34 healthy controls (P=0.0031). CONCLUSION: In patients with symptoms triggered by histamine-rich food, measuring the serum diamine oxidase activity can help identify subjects who can benefit from a histamine limitation diet and/or diamine oxidase supplementation.Properly designed, controlled studies investigating histamine intolerance that include histamine provocation are indispensable for providing insights into the area of food intolerances, which are currently primarily managed with non-scientific approaches in Italy.},

   abstract = {Recent evidence regarding celiac disease has increasingly shown the role of innate immunity in triggering the immune response by stimulating the adaptive immune response and by mucosal damage. The interaction between the gut microbiota and the mucosal wall is mediated by the same receptors which can activate innate immunity. Thus, changes in gut microbiota may lead to activation of this inflammatory pathway. This paper is a review of the current knowledge regarding the relationship between celiac disease and gut microbiota. In fact, patients with celiac disease have a reduction in beneficial species and an increase in those potentially pathogenic as compared to healthy subjects. This dysbiosis is reduced, but might still remain, after a gluten-free diet. Thus, gut microbiota could play a significant role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease, as described by studies which link dysbiosis with the inflammatory milieu in celiac patients. The use of probiotics seems to reduce the inflammatory response and restore a normal proportion of beneficial bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. Additional evidence is needed in order to better understand the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of celiac disease, and the clinical impact and therapeutic use of probiotics in this setting.},

   abstract = {Wheat-related disorders have become a growing area of clinical and scientific interest and can be categorized broadly as: autoimmune-mediated; allergic; and non-autoimmune/non-allergic conditions. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) present on this spectrum as disorders associated with adverse gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal manifestations following exposure to gluten and/or other wheat-related constituents. NCGS/NCWS is increasingly considered in patients with unexplained symptoms after the exclusions of celiac disease and wheat allergy. As objective diagnostic data and specific biomarkers are lacking, response to a gluten-free/wheat-free diet can confirm the presence of NCGS/NCWS. An association with irritable bowel syndrome has been detected, and the effects of other food components, such as fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, may contribute. Our organization and synthesis of extant knowledge pertaining to wheat-related disorders may advance current practice and research efforts toward an improved understanding of NCGS/NCWS as an evolving clinical entity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is the most common autoimmune enteropathy. Clinical manifestations may range from a typical malabsorption syndrome to several apparently unrelated extra-intestinal symptoms. AIM: Here we specifically focus on the spectrum of CD-related liver disorders and the underlying pathomechanisms. METHODS: A computer-based search up to August 2015 was completed using appropriate keywords. References from selected papers were also reviewed and used if relevant. RESULTS: An unexplained hypertransaminasemia with nonspecific histologic hepatic changes is the most common hepatic presentation. CD however can coexist with a number of liver disorders such as Autoimmune Hepatitis, Autoimmune Cholangitis, Primary Biliary Cirrhosis and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis requiring a specific treatment in addition to gluten-free diet. CD has also been associated with Viral Hepatitis, Fatty Liver, Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis and some severe cryptogenic hepatopaties in the liver transplantation list. Pathomechanisms underlying hepatic injury in CD are multiple, appear still not completely defined and may probably co-occur. CONCLUSIONS: An ever-increasing number of CD-related liver injuries exist, probably representing a continuum of a same disorder where genetic predisposition, timing, and duration of previous gluten exposure might influence the reversibility of liver damage. Evidences, although not conclusive, support therefore testing for CD also in cryptogenic hepatobiliary conditions where the relationship with CD has not yet been fully investigated.},

   abstract = {AIM: To provide an estimate of the prevalence of celiac disease by race/ethnic origin in large sample of US population. METHODS: Data from the 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 NHANES were combined and analyzed. The NHANES is a nationally representative survey with oversampling of certain minorities. Sample-based frequencies were reported and weighted frequencies were used to estimate prevalence. RESULTS: A total of 14,701 participants were checked for tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and endomysial (EMA) IgA antibodies. Seventy-four participants had positive tTG and/or EMA corresponding to prevalence of 0.79 % (95 % CI 0.54-1.04 %). Non-Hispanic white were more likely to be positive for both compared with other races (72.0 vs 31.7 %; p = 0.010) and less likely to be weakly positive for tTG but positive for EMA (3.6 vs 26.4 %; p = 0.03). The prevalence of positive serology according to race was as follows: 1.08 % (95 % CI 0.70-1.45 %) in non-Hispanic white, 0.23 % (95 % CI 0.03-0.43 %) in Mexican, 0.22 % (95 % CI 0.01-0.44 %) in non-Hispanic black, 0.38 % (95 % CI 0.00-0.89 %) in "other Hispanic," and 0.15 % (95 % CI 0.00-0.34 %) in other races including multiracial and undeterminable in non-Hispanic Asian due to the presence of only one positive EMA test. 0.9 % of the NHANES sample participants followed gluten-free diet. Of this group of participants, 85 % were never diagnosed with celiac disease and 99 % of them had negative celiac disease serology. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially 0.79 % of the general US population demonstrate serologic evidence of celiac disease autoimmunity. The prevalence is 4-8 times higher among non-Hispanic white compared with other races. Close to 1 % of the population is electively following gluten-free diet despite having little evidence of the disease.},

Unfortunately, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with intestinal malabsorption syndromes, including cystic fibrosis (CF), celiac disease (CD), short bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is higher than that in the general population, indicating the presence of disease-specific causative factors. In this review, we aimed to present clinical findings to highlight the roles of insufficient exposure to sunlight and inflammation in the development of vitamin D deficiency in patients with intestinal malabsorption syndromes. Furthermore, we aimed to present experimental evidence that supported a role of vitamin D deficiency in the pathogenesis of IBD. Finally, we reviewed clinical intervention strategies aiming to normalize vitamin D status in and even to improve the conditions of patients and to discuss certain issues that needed to be addressed in future research.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is the most important cause of intestinal villous atrophy. Seronegative intestinal villous atrophy, including those that are nonresponsive to a gluten-free diet, is a diagnostic challenge. In these cases, before establishing the diagnosis of seronegative celiac disease, alternative etiologies of atrophic enteropathy should be considered. Recently, a new clinical entity responsible for seronegative villous atrophy was described-olmesartan-induced sprue-like enteropathy. Herein, we report two uncommon cases of atrophic enteropathy in patients with arterial hypertension under olmesartan, who presented with severe chronic diarrhea and significant involuntary weight loss. Further investigation revealed intestinal villous atrophy and intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Celiac disease and other causes of villous atrophy were ruled out. Drug-induced enteropathy was suspected and clinical improvement and histologic recovery were verified after olmesartan withdrawal. These cases highlight the importance for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for olmesartan as a precipitant of sprue-like enteropathy.},

   abstract = {Gluten derived from wheat and related Triticeae can induce gluten sensitivity as well as celiac disease. Consequently, gluten content in foods labeled "gluten-free" is regulated. Determination of potential contamination in such foods is achieved using immunoassays based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize specific epitopes present in gluten. However, food-processing measures can affect epitope recognition. In particular, preparation of wheat protein isolate through deamidation of glutamine residues significantly limits the ability of commercial gluten testing kits in their ability to recognize gluten. Adding to this concern, evidence suggests that deamidated gluten imparts more pathogenic potential in celiac disease than native gluten. To address the heightened need for antibody-based tools that can recognize deamidated gluten, we have generated a novel mAb, 2B9, and subsequently developed it as a rapid lateral flow immunoassay. Herein, we report the ability of the 2B9-based lateral flow device (LFD) to detect gluten from wheat, barley, and rye and deamidated gluten down to 2 ppm in food as well as its performance in food testing.},

   abstract = {A tremendous amount of data from research was published over the past decades concerning the roles of different vitamins in various gastrointestinal diseases. For instance, most vitamins showed an inverse relationship with the risk of colorectal carcinoma as well as other malignancies like gastric and esophageal cancer in observational trials, however interventional trials failed to prove a clear beneficial preventive role. On the other hand, more solid evidence was obtained from high quality studies for a role of certain vitamins in specific entities. Examples for this include the therapeutic role of vitamin E in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, the additive role of vitamins B12 and D to the standard therapy of chronic hepatitis C virus, the role of vitamin C in reducing the risk of gallstones, the positive outcome with vitamin B12 in patients with aphthous stomatitis, and the beneficial effect of vitamin D and B1 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Other potential uses are yet to be elaborated, like those on celiac disease, pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis, cholestasis and other potential fields. Data from several ongoing interventional trials are expected to add to the current knowledge over the coming few years. Given that vitamin supplementation is psychologically accepted by patients as a natural compound with relative safety and low cost, their use should be encouraged in the fields where positive data are available.},

   abstract = {In the last decade the development of gluten-free foodstuffs has attracted great attention as a result of better diagnoses of coeliac disease and a greater knowledge of the relationship between gluten-free products and health. The increasing interest has prompted extensive research into the development of gluten-free foodstuffs that resemble gluten-containing foods. This review aims to provide some insights on dough functionality and process conditions regarding bread quality and to point out recent research dealing with the nutritional composition of those products. Gluten-free dough results from the combination of different ingredients, additives, and the processing aids required for building up network structures responsible for bread quality. Some relationships between dough rheology and bread characteristics were established to identify possible predictor parameters. Regarding bread-making processes, the impact of mixing, dough treatment and baking is stated. Nutritional quality is an important asset when developing gluten-free breads, and different strategies for improving it are reviewed. Gluten-free bread quality is dependent on ingredients and additives combination, but also processing can provide a way to improve bread quality. Nutritive value of the gluten-free breads must be always in mind when setting up recipes, for obtaining nutritionally balanced bread with adequate glycaemic index.},

   abstract = {Down syndrome (DS) is one of the more commonly occurring genetic disorders, where mental retardation is combined with nutritional diseases. It is caused by having a third copy of chromosome 21, and there exist 3 forms; Simple Trisomy 21, Translocation Trisomy and Mosaic Trisomy. Symptoms include intellectual disability/mental retardation, early onset of Alzheimer's disease and the appearance of various phenotypic features such as narrow slanted eyes, flat nose and short stature. In addition, there are other health problems throughout the body, consisting in part of cardiac defects and thyroid function abnormalities along with nutritional disorders (ie. overweight, obesity, hypercholesterolemia and deficiencies of vitamins and minerals). Those suffering DS have widespread body frame abnormalities and impaired brain development and function; the latter leading to impaired intellectual development. Many studies indicate excessive or deficient nutrient uptakes associated with making inappropriate foodstuff choices, food intolerance, (eg. celiac disease) or malabsorption. DS persons with overweight or obesity are linked with a slow metabolic rate, abnormal blood leptin concentrations and exhibit low levels of physical activity. Vitamin B group deficiencies and abnormal blood homocysteine levels decrease the rate of intellectual development in DS cases. Zinc deficiencies result in short stature, thyroid function disorders and an increased appetite caused by excessive supplementation. Scientific advances in the research and diagnosis of DS, as well as preventing any associated conditions, have significantly increased life expectancies of those with this genetic disorder. Early dietary interventions by parents or guardians of DS children afford an opportunity for decreasing the risk or delaying some of the DS associated conditions from appearing, thus beneficially impacting on their quality of life.},

Iron malabsorption is usually observed in CD. Only few studies investigated oral iron absorption in subjects with gastrointestinal diseases and Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), using the oral iron absorption test (OIAT). We considered useful to investigate the OIAT, using Ferrous Bisglycinate Chelate (FBC), in patients with CD at diagnosis or on Gluten Free Diet (GFD) from at least 1 year. METHODS: A total of 25 patients with CD (3-18 years old) and iron depletion, at diagnosis of CD (n=12) or on GFD from at least 12 months (n=13), were considered. Serum iron was evaluated at baseline (T0) and after 3 hours (T1) from the oral iron ingestion. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 21.0 software for Mac. RESULTS: OIAT was well tolerated by all patients. An important increase of the serum iron at T1, of at least twice the baseline values, occurred in all patients except in one (p-value <0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated good efficacy of the FBC, not only in patients with CD on GFD but also in children with newly diagnosed CD with the characteristic intestinal lesions.},

DESIGN: The database was built using the nutritional composition of the products, taking into consideration both the composition of the ingredients and the nutritional information reported on the product label. SETTING: The nutrient composition of each ingredient was obtained from two Italian databases (European Institute of Oncology and the National Institute for Food and Nutrition). SUBJECTS: The study developed a food composition database including a total of sixty foods representative of different categories of gluten-free products sold on the Italian market. The composition of the products included in the database is given in terms of quantity of macro- and micronutrients per 100 g of product as sold, and includes the full range of nutrient data present in traditional databases of gluten-containing foods. RESULTS: As expected, most of the products had a high content of carbohydrates and some of them can be labelled as a source of fibre (>3 g/100 g). Regarding micronutrients, among the products considered, breads, pizzas and snacks were especially very high in Na content (>400-500 mg/100 g). CONCLUSIONS: This database provides an initial useful tool for future nutritional surveys on the dietary habits of coeliac people.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date, it is unclear whether individuals with celiac disease following a gluten-free (GF) diet for several years have adequate intake of all recommended nutrients. Lack of a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for individuals with celiac disease could be partly responsible for this still-debated issue. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of a modified European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) FFQ in estimating nutrient and food intake in a celiac population. DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, the dietary habits of individuals with celiac disease were reported using a modified Italian EPIC FFQ and were compared to a 7-day weighed food record as a reference method. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: A total of 200 individuals with histologically confirmed celiac disease were enrolled in the study between October 2012 and August 2014 at the Center for Prevention and Diagnosis of Celiac Disease (Milan, Italy). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nutrient and food category intake were calculated by 7-day weighed food record using an Italian food database integrated with the nutrient composition of 60 GF foods and the modified EPIC FFQ, in which 24 foods were substituted with GF foods comparable for energy and carbohydrate content. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: An evaluation of the modified FFQ compared to 7-day weighed food record in assessing the reported intake of nutrient and food groups was conducted using Spearman's correlation coefficients and weighted kappa. RESULTS: One hundred individuals completed the study. The Spearman's correlation coefficients of FFQ and 7-day weighed food record ranged from .13 to .73 for nutrients and from .23 to .75 for food groups. A moderate agreement, which was defined as a weighted kappa value of .40 to .60, was obtained for 30% of the analyzed nutrients, and 40% of the nutrients showed values between .30 and .40. The weighted kappa exceeded .40 for 60% of the 15 analyzed food groups. CONCLUSIONS: The modified EPIC FFQ demonstrated moderate congruence with a weighed food record in ranking individuals by dietary intakes, particularly food groups.},

This case suggests a link between coeliac disease and cardiomyopathy.},

   abstract = {Several studies have suggested a protective role of breastfeeding and/or the timing and quantity of gluten introduction in the subsequent development of celiac disease. Especially, prolonged breastfeeding during the introduction of gluten-containing feeding has been associated with a reduced risk of developing celiac disease in infancy. The mentioned results suggest the existence of a 'window of opportunity' between 4 and 6 months of age in which gluten can be introduced in small amounts. Therefore, the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition recommends avoiding gluten introduction before the age of 4 months and after the age of 7 months and that gluten should be preferably introduced during ongoing breastfeeding. However, the influence of breastfeeding in the development of celiac disease is not clear, since some studies report prevention and others do not, and the studies reporting a protective effect of breastfeeding do not make clear if it concerns prevention of the disease or delays the onset of symptoms. In addition, most of the studies on this topic have been observational and retrospective. For these reasons, prospective studies are needed to understand the relationship between early nutrition in particular and environmental factors in general, concerning the development and possible prevention of celiac disease. Some of these studies are ongoing. One example is the European multicenter PreventCD project (www.preventcoeliacdisease.com) among infants with a first-degree family member with celiac disease carrying HLA-DQ2 and/or -DQ8, randomized to a double-blind dietary intervention with 100 mg of gluten daily or placebo between the age of 4-6 months. All included children are already 3 years old, and the first analyses are being prepared (http://www.trialregister.nl).},

   abstract = {Primary prevention of coeliac disease is currently not possible. Previously, a 'window of opportunity' was suggested for primary prevention, by introducing gluten between four and six months of age. However, results from recent prospective studies establish that the timing of gluten introduction and the duration or maintenance of breastfeeding do not influence the development of the disease. Secondary prevention is possible through early diagnosis and treatment. Since coeliac disease is severely underdiagnosed, the only way to achieve large-scale secondary prevention is by mass screening. Prospective studies indicate that important health problems, such as reduced foetal growth and birth weight, delayed growth in height and weight in children, and reduced bone mineral density in both children and adults can be prevented by mass screening. Adherence to a strict gluten-free diet may be considered as tertiary prevention.},

The normal GI tract, except for the esophagus, is populated by eosinophils that are present throughout the mucosa, raising the possibility that eosinophils participate in innate mechanisms of defense. However, data from clinical studies associates increased numbers of eosinophils with inflammatory GI diseases, prompting concerns that eosinophils may have a deleterious effect on the gut. We present clinical features of 4 disease processes that have been associated with eosinophilia and suggest areas requiring investigation as to their clinical significance and scientific relevance.},

Noncoeliac gluten sensitivity is defined as the presence of a variety of symptoms related to gluten ingestion in patients in whom coeliac disease and wheat allergy have been excluded. The pathophysiology and biomarkers of coeliac disease and wheat allergy are well known, but this is not the case for noncoeliac gluten sensitivity. It is also not clear whether noncoeliac gluten sensitivity is caused by consumption of gluten or by consumption of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. Randomized trials on noncoeliac gluten sensitivity in children are lacking and are hardly needed to evaluate its role in paediatric patients with gastroenterology to avoid the use of unnecessary restrictive diets in children and interference with proper diagnosis of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The immune response causing celiac disease (CD) depends on the activation of intestinal CD4+ T cells by gluten-derived peptides presented by HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules, the main genetic risk factor. However, additional factors are necessary to impair immune tolerance to dietary gluten, to stimulate intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and to induce intestinal damage. KEY MESSAGES: Current data point to a central role of interleukin-15 (IL-15). In situ and ex vivo studies indicate that IL-15 stimulates the accumulation and cytotoxic activation of CD8+ T IEL in active CD, and that of the malignant innate-like IEL in type II refractory CD (RCDII). Other studies show that IL-15 impairs the immunoregulatory control of effector T cells, notably CD8+. Recently, animal models have been designed to investigate the respective role of CD4+ T cells and IL-15 in CD. We discuss more particularly our results in such a model, which shows that IL-15 produced in excess in the intestine can cooperate with CD4+ T cells specific for a dietary antigen to trigger a celiac-like enteropathy. In this mouse model, CD4+ T cells activated by dietary ovalbumin secreted IL-2 which, along with IL-15, stimulated the expansion of noncognate intestinal cytotoxic CD8+ T cells containing large amounts of granzyme B. In the presence of IL-15, the latter cells did not respond to regulatory T cells, and accumulated in the intestine close to epithelial damage. CONCLUSION: On the basis of these data, we propose that, in CD, gluten-specific CD4+ T cells synthesize cytokines that synergize with IL-15 to license the expansion and activation of cytotoxic IEL, which drive tissue damage. We suggest that IL-15 is a meaningful therapeutic target, notably in patients with RCDII in which malignant IEL can respond to IL-15 independently of signals provided by CD4+ T cells.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Due to allergies or other health disorders a certain segment of the population is not able to safely consume some plant proteins, which are the main protein support in human nutrition. Coeliac disease is a prominent autoimmune disorder and requires a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. The aim of this study was to identify suitable combinations of enzymatic hydrolysis and common unit operations in food processing (centrifugation, ultra-filtration) to produce gluten-free wheat gluten hydrolysates for food application. To analyse the hydrolysates, a simple and cheap competitive ELISA protocol was designed and validated in this study as well. RESULTS: The competitive ELISA was validated using gliadin spiked skim milk protein hydrolysates, due to the latter application of the assay. The limit of quantification was 4.19 mg kg(-1) , which allowed the identification of gluten-free (<20 mg kg(-1) ) hydrolysates. Enzymatic hydrolysis, including the type of peptidase, and the downstream processing greatly affected the antigenicity of the hydrolysates. CONCLUSION: Enzymatic hydrolysis and downstream processing operations, such as centrifugation and ultra-filtration, reduced the antigenicity of wheat gluten hydrolysates. Gluten-free hydrolysates were obtained with Flavourzyme after centrifugation (25 g L(-1) substrate) and after 1 kDa ultra-filtration (100 g L(-1) substrate). A multiple peptidase complex, such as Flavourzyme, seems to be required for the production of gluten-free hydrolysates. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.},

METHOD: Children with CD and their parents completed a disease-specific HRQOL self-report questionnaire, the Celiac Disease DUX. These children and matched controls without CD completed the Children's Leisure Assessment Scale (CLASS). RESULTS: Parents perceived HRQOL significantly more negatively than did children. No significant group differences were found in leisure participation. However, specific CLASS food-related activities and HRQOL significantly correlated. CONCLUSION: Hearing the child's voice in addition to the parents' is important in determining the HRQOL of children with a chronic condition. Findings contribute to understanding of CD in the context of participation and well-being and can lead to development of occupational performance-based assessments and interventions for children with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the biochemical and immunochemical properties of avenins in some special oat raw materials and additionally the possibility of using them as a raw material for the gluten-free bakery products. METHODS: The compared oat raw materials were - oat flakes, commercial oat flours (including gluten-free oat flour) and residual oat flour, which is by-product of beta-glucan preparation. Biochemical characteristic included amino acid compositions and SDS-PAGE profiles of extracted avenins. The immunochemical reactivity with polyclonal anti-gluten and monoclonal anti-gliadin antibodies was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by immunoblotting and ELISA methods. Additionally, experimental bakery products made of examined raw materials were assessed according to their suitability for the celiac patients' diet. RESULTS: The highest protein content was measured in the beta-glucan preparation "Betaven" and gluten-free oat flour. Proteins of all materials are rich in glutamic and aspartic acid, leucine and arginine. Proportions of amino acids in avenins extracted from most of oat raw materials are similar, excluding gluten-free oat flour, which has a very low avenin content and proportions of individual amino acids are different. The SDS-PAGE protein pattern consisted of proteins with molecular weight of about 25-35 kDa. Polyclonal anti-gluten anti-body recognized all protein fractions of molecular weight higher than 20 kDa. Quantitative ELISA analysis shows that the majority of samples has a gliadin-like protein content within the range of 80-260 mg/kg, excluding gluten-free flours and corresponding bakery products. Altogether, beta-glucan preparation has extremely high level of gliadin-like proteins. CONCLUSIONS: In the examined oat raw materials and foods the contents of immunoreactive amino acid sequences exceeded the limit of 20 mg/kg (considered as gluten-free) except for gluten-free flours (oat and the prepared mixture) and the bakery products based on gluten-free flours. Unfortunately, the rest of oat raw materials and products cannot be considered gluten-free.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune, gastrointestinal disorder characterized by intolerance to the dietary grain protein gluten. An increased prevalence of celiac disease has been reported in Down syndrome and Turner syndrome, but there has been only few previous reports with respect to the association of celiac disease in Williams-Beuren syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of celiac disease in our 24 Williams-Beuren syndrome patients. Gastrointestinal problems and celiac disease symptoms of patients were noted. All patients were analyzed by the titer of tissue transglutaminases IgA and IgG. HLA genotyping and intestinal biopsy was performed to the patients with positive serology. We also performed gluten free diet in the presence of compatible symptoms, serology, HLA genotyping and intestinal biopsy. In our study, two patients had positive tTG antibodies, but only one had positive biopsy finding for celiac disease. The frequency of celiac disease in patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome was estimated as 1/24 (4.1%). Though the number of participants in this study was limited, the results show that the frequency of celiac disease is higher in Williams-Beuren syndrome compared to the general population. We suggest that a high suspicion and testing for celiac disease should be recommended at certain intervals in all cases with Williams-Beuren syndrome to detect the cause of growth retardation and gastrointestinal problems.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess dietary intake of coeliac disease (CD) patients and to determine if they are meeting the dietary reference values for a balanced diet. SUBJECTS/METHODS: 40 women with CD, aged from 23 to 76 participated in our study. Total daily intake was assessed by a three-day food diary. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was calculated using Harris-Benedict equation. Considering physical activity level (PAL) 1.4, the recommended total energy expenditure (TEE) value was determined. The data was evaluated with professional evaluation software Prodi and statistically analysed. RESULTS: 40 participants returned the food diary. The average energy intake was significantly too low to ensure the meeting of all-day energy needs (p<0.05). The meals contained a recommended proportion of protein, but a statistically significantly higher proportion of fat (p<0.05), lower proportion of carbohydrates and a significantly lower intake of dietary fibre (p<0.05). Regarding macro-, micro- elements and vitamins, there was a significant lack in the intake of calcium and iodine, folic acid, vitamin D and vitamin A (p<0.05), meanwhile iron intake was at the lower limit of the recommended intake, whereas zinc, potassium and vitamin K intake were significantly higher according to the recommended values, but were comparable with the intake of the general population in the Central European area. CONCLUSION: Even in subjects with adequate or low daily energy intake, their meals contained too much fat, too few carbohydrates and dietary fibre as well as inorganic substances. The patients with CD should get regular nutritional monitoring and education on the quality and balance of a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {While coeliac disease is primarily a disease of the digestive system, there have been several reports of neurological effects, both motor and cognitive. Here, we present the case of a woman with coeliac disease, under dietary control, in whom there is profound long-standing visual disturbance including reduction of visual fields, loss of rapid flicker and colour sensitivity and severe deficits in acuity. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicates large regions of calcification and abnormal tissue that is restricted to the occipital cortex, particularly the posterior region. Functional MRI indicates an absence of normal visual activation in the primary visual cortex, but at least in one hemisphere, there is neural activity to moving stimuli in visual motion area hMT+. White matter microstructure in the pathway between the lateral geniculate nucleus and hMT+ is normal compared to healthy control subjects, but is severely abnormal between the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex. This case study illustrates the very specific nature of cortical deficit that can arise in association with coeliac disease, and highlights the importance of early dietary control for the disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a lifelong autoimmune disorder triggered by foods containing gluten, the storage protein in wheat, rye, and barley. The rapidly escalating number of patients diagnosed with this disease poses a great challenge to both food industry and authorities to guarantee food safety for all. Therefore, intensive efforts are being made to establish minimal disease-eliciting doses of gluten and consequently to improve gluten-free labeling. These efforts depend to a high degree on the availability of methods capable of detecting the protein in food samples at levels as low as possible. Current analytical approaches rely on the use of antibodies as selective recognition elements. With limited sensitivity, these methods exhibit some deficiencies that compromise the accuracy of the obtained results. Aptamers provide an ideal alternative for designing biosensors for fast and selective measurement of gluten in foods. This article highlights the challenges in gluten detection, the current status of the use of aptamers for solving this problem, and what remains to be done to move these systems into commercial applications.},

To put GF foods into proper perspective both for those who need it (patients with celiac disease) and for those who do not, we provide contemporary data about cost and nutritional quality of GF food products. The objective of this study is to develop a food composition database for seven discretionary food categories of packaged GF products. Nutrient composition, nutritional information and cost of foods from 63 GF and 126 gluten-containing counterparts were systematically obtained from 12 different Austrian supermarkets. The nutrition composition (macro and micronutrients) was analyzed by using two nutrient composition databases in a stepwise approximation process. A total of 63 packaged GF foods were included in the analysis representing a broad spectrum of different GF categories (flour/bake mix, bread and bakery products, pasta and cereal-based food, cereals, cookies and cakes, snacks and convenience food). Our results show that the protein content of GF products is >2 fold lower across 57% of all food categories. In 65% of all GF foods, low sodium content was observed (defined as <120 mg/100 g). Across all GF products, 19% can be classified as source high in fiber (defined as >6g/100 g). On average, GF foods were substantially higher in cost, ranging from +205% (cereals) to +267% (bread and bakery products) compared to similar gluten-containing products. In conclusion, our results indicate that for GF foods no predominant health benefits are indicated; in fact, some critical nutrients must be considered when being on a GF diet. For individuals with celiac disease, the GF database provides a helpful tool to identify the food composition of their medical diet. For healthy consumers, replacing gluten-containing products with GF foods is aligned with substantial cost differences but GF foods do not provide additional health benefits from a nutritional perspective.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CeD) is a highly heritable common autoimmune disease involving chronic small intestinal inflammation in response to dietary wheat. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, and 40 newer regions identified by genome wide association studies (GWAS) and dense fine mapping, account for approximately 40% of the disease heritability. We hypothesized that in pedigrees with multiple individuals with CeD rare [minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.5%] mutations of larger effect size (odds ratios of approximately 2-5) might exist. We sequenced the exomes of 75 coeliac individuals of European ancestry from 55 multiply affected families. We selected interesting variants and genes for further follow up using a combination of: an assessment of shared variants between related subjects, a model-free linkage test, and gene burden tests for multiple, potentially causal, variants. We next performed highly multiplexed amplicon resequencing of all RefSeq exons from 24 candidate genes selected on the basis of the exome sequencing data in 2,248 unrelated coeliac cases and 2,230 controls. 1,335 variants with a 99.9% genotyping call rate were observed in 4,478 samples, of which 939 were present in coding regions of 24 genes (Ti/Tv 2.99). 91.7% of coding variants were rare (MAF <0.5%) and 60% were novel. Gene burden tests performed on rare functional variants identified no significant associations (p<1x10(-3)) in the resequenced candidate genes. Our strategy of sequencing multiply affected families with deep follow up of candidate genes has not identified any new CeD risk mutations.},

   abstract = {The celiac disease is an immune chronic condition with genetic transmission, caused by the intolerance to gluten. Gluten is a protein from cereals containing the following soluble proteins: gliadine, which is the most toxic, and the prolamins. The average prevalence is about 1% in USA and Europe, but high in Africa: 5.6% in West Sahara. In the pathogenesis several factors are involved: gluten as external trigger, genetic predisposition (HLA, MYO9B), viral infections, abnormal immune reaction to gluten. Severity is correlated with the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, cryptic hyperplasia and villous atrophy, as well as with the length of intestinal involvement. The severity is assessed according to the Marsh-Oberhuber staging. Diagnostic criteria are: positive serological tests, intestinal biopsy, the reversal after gluten free diet (GFD). Beside refractory forms, new conditions have been described, like the non celiac gluten intolerance. In a time when more and more people adhere to GFD for nonscientific reasons, practitioners should be updated with the progress in celiac disease knowledge.},

   abstract = {The composition of the gut microbiome reflects the overall health status of the host. In this study, stool samples representing the gut microbiomes from 6 gluten-sensitive (GS) captive juvenile rhesus macaques were compared with those from 6 healthy, age- and diet-matched peers. A total of 48 samples representing both groups were studied using V4 16S rRNA gene DNA analysis. Samples from GS macaques were further characterized based on type of diet administered: conventional monkey chow, i.e., wheat gluten-containing diet (GD), gluten-free diet (GFD), barley gluten-derived diet (BOMI) and reduced gluten barley-derived diet (RGB). It was hypothesized that the GD diet would lower the gut microbial diversity in GS macaques. This is the first report illustrating the reduction of gut microbial alpha-diversity (p < 0.05) following the consumption of dietary gluten in GS macaques. Selected bacterial families (e.g., Streptococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae) were enriched in GS macaques while Coriobacteriaceae was enriched in healthy animals. Within several weeks after the replacement of the GD by the GFD diet, the composition (beta-diversity) of gut microbiome in GS macaques started to change (p = 0.011) towards that of a normal macaque. Significance for alpha-diversity however, was not reached by the day 70 when the feeding experiment ended. Several inflammation-associated microRNAs (miR-203, -204, -23a, -23b and -29b) were upregulated (p < 0.05) in jejunum of 4 biopsied GS macaques fed GD with predicted binding sites on 16S ribosomal RNA of Lactobacillus reuteri (accession number: NR_025911), Prevotella stercorea (NR_041364) and Streptococcus luteciae (AJ297218) that were overrepresented in feces. Additionally, claudin-1, a validated tight junction protein target of miR-29b was significantly downregulated in jejunal epithelium of GS macaques. Taken together, we predict that with the introduction of effective treatments in future studies the diversity of gut microbiomes in GS macaques will approach those of healthy individuals. Further studies are needed to elucidate the regulatory pathways of inflammatory miRNAs in intestinal mucosa of GS macaques and to correlate their expression with gut dysbiosis.},

The primary hyperoxalurias are a group of autosomal recessive disorders of endogenous oxalate overproduction. Secondary hyperoxaluria may occur as a result of excess dietary intake, poisoning with oxalate precursors (ethylene glycol), or enteric hyperoxaluria. The differential diagnosis of enteric hyperoxaluria includes inflammatory bowel disease, short bowel syndrome, bariatric surgery (with jejunoileal bypass or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), celiac disease, partial colectomy, and chronic pancreatitis. The common etiology in all these processes is fat malabsorption, steatorrhea, saponification of calcium, and absorption of free oxalate. Hyperoxaluria causes increased urinary oxalate excretion, urolithiasis (promoted by hypovolemia, decreased urinary pH caused by metabolic acidosis, and decreased citrate and magnesium concentrations in urine), tubulointerstitial oxalate deposits, and tubulointerstitial nephritis. We report a rare case of acute oxalate nephropathy due to pancreatic atrophy and exocrine insufficiency caused by newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated small bowel disorder that develops in genetically susceptible individuals upon exposure to dietary gluten. Celiac disease could have extra-intestinal manifestations that affect women's reproductive health. The aim of this study was to investigate fertility and outcomes of pregnancy among women with celiac disease. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we analyzed information collected from patients at a tertiary care celiac center and from members of 2 national celiac disease awareness organizations. Women without celiac disease were used as controls. Women completed an anonymous online survey, answering 43 questions about menstrual history, fertility, and outcomes of pregnancy (329 with small bowel biopsy-confirmed celiac disease and 641 controls). RESULTS: Of the 970 women included in the study, 733 (75.6%) reported that they had been pregnant at some point; there was no significant difference between women with celiac disease (n=245/329, 74.5%) and controls (488/641, 76.1%; P=0.57). However, fewer women with celiac disease than controls (79.6% vs. 84.8%) gave birth following 1 or more pregnancies (P=0.03). Women with celiac disease had higher percentages of spontaneous abortion than controls (50.6% vs. 40.6%; P=0.01), and of premature delivery (23.6% vs. 15.9% among controls; P=0.02). The mean age at menarche was higher in the celiac disease group (12.7 years) than controls (12.4 years; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective cohort analysis examining reproductive features of women with celiac disease, we associated celiac disease with significant increases in spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and later age of menarche.},

   abstract = {A double-blind, placebo-controlled, gluten challenge has been proposed to confirm a diagnosis of nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) in patients without celiac disease who respond to a gluten-free diet. To determine the accuracy of this approach, we analyzed data from 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled, gluten-challenge trials, comprising 1312 adults. The studies varied in the duration of the challenge (range, 1 d to 6 wk), daily doses for the gluten challenge (range, 2-52 g; 3 studies administered <8 g/d), and composition of the placebo (gluten-free products, xylose, whey protein, rice, or corn starch containing fermentable carbohydrates). Most of the studies found gluten challenge to significantly increase symptom scores compared with placebo. However, only 38 of 231 NCGS patients (16%) showed gluten-specific symptoms. Furthermore, 40% of these subjects had a nocebo response (similar or increased symptoms in response to placebo). These findings reveal heterogeneity and potential methodology flaws among studies of gluten challenge, cast doubt on gluten as the culprit food component in most patients with presumptive NCGS, and highlight the importance of the nocebo effect in these types of studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a controversial emerging disorder. Despite reported symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten, NCGS remains a diagnosis based on the exclusion of coeliac disease, given the absence of reliable biomarkers. AIM: To evaluate the prevalence, diagnostic exclusion of coeliac disease and the efficacy of a gluten-free diet (GFD) for NCGS patients. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed up to December 2014. According to consensus diagnostic criteria, NCGS was defined as self-reported gluten intolerance, negative coeliac serology and absence of villous atrophy. Studies evaluating the impact of a GFD on patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were also included. RESULTS: Prevalence rates of NCGS (0.5-13%) differed widely. Seventeen studies, including 1561 patients (26 children), met the inclusion criteria for NCGS. HLA haplotypes could not be linked to histology [normal or lymphocytic enteritis (LE)] in 1123 NCGS patients. HLADQ2/DQ8 haplotypes were present in 44% of NCGS patients. After advanced diagnostic techniques in 189 NCGS patients combining LE and HLADQ2/DQ8 haplotypes, 39 (20%) were reclassified as coeliac disease. There was a higher than expected family history of coeliac disease and autoimmune disorders in NCGS patients. A GFD resulted in variable results for variable, but significantly improved stool frequency in HLADQ2 positive diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence rates for NCGS are extremely variable. A subset of NCGS patients might belong in the so-called 'coeliac-lite' disease. The benefit of a GFD for NCGS patients is currently controversial. HLADQ2 positive diarrhoea-type IBS patients might gain symptom improvement from a GFD.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 10-15% of the western population. Drug therapy for this entity has shown limited efficacy. The low Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides And Polyols (FODMAP) diet has recently emerged as an effective intervention for reducing gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS. Currently, several mechanistic studies have proven the rational basis of carbohydrate restriction. In addition, high-quality evidence (prospective studies and randomized controlled trials) from a variety of countries supports the high effectiveness of a low-FODMAP diet for IBS symptoms (70%), especially abdominal bloating, pain, and diarrhea. Importantly, this diet seems to be superior to a gluten-free diet for patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity. The most controversial features of the low FODMAP diet are its short- and long-term limitations (a high level of restriction, the need for monitoring by an expert dietitian, potential nutritional deficiencies, significant gut microbiota reduction, lack of predictors of response), as well as the potential lack of advantage over alternative dietary, pharmacological and psychological interventions for IBS. Although liberalization of carbohydrate intake is recommended in the long-term, the reintroduction process remains to be clarified as, theoretically, global carbohydrate restriction is deemed to be necessary to avoid additive effects.},

   abstract = {Celiac Disease (CD) is an interferon (IFN)gamma-mediated duodenal hypersensitivity to wheat gluten occurring in genetically predisposed individuals. Gluten-free diet (GFD) leads to a complete remission of the disease. Valpha24-restricted invariant NKT (iNKT) cells are important to maintain immune homeostasis in the gut mucosa because of their unique capacity to rapidly produce large quantities of both T-helper (Th)1 and Th2 cytokines upon stimulation. We studied the presence of these cells in the CD duodenum. Duodenal biopsies were obtained from 45 untreated-CD patients (uCD), 15 Gluten Free Diet-CD patients (GFD-CD), 44 non-inflamed non-CD controls (C-controls) and 15 inflamed non-CD controls (I-controls). Two populations from Spain and Argentina were recruited. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of Valpha24-Jalpha18 (invariant TCRalpha chain of human iNKT cells), IFNgamma and intracellular transcription factor Forkhead Box P3 (Foxp3), and flow cytometry intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) profile were determined. Both uCD and GFD-CD patients had higher Valpha24-Jalpha18 mRNA levels than non-CD controls (I and C-controls). The expression of Valpha24-Jalpha18 correlated with Marsh score for the severity of mucosal lesion and also with increased mRNA IFNgamma levels. uCD and GFD-CD patients had decreased mRNA expression of FoxP3 but increased expression of Valpha24-Jalpha18, which revealed a CD-like molecular profile. Increased numbers of iNKT cells were confirmed by flow cytometry within the intraepithelial lymphocyte compartment of uCD and GFD-CD patients and correlated with Valpha24-Jalpha18 mRNA expression. In conclusion, we have found an increased number of iNKT cells in the duodenum from both uCD and GFD-CD patients, irrespective of the mucosal status. A CD-like molecular profile, defined by an increased mRNA expression of Valpha24-Jalpha18 together with a decreased expression of FoxP3, may represent a pro-inflammatory signature of the CD duodenum.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is caused by intolerance to gluten. Oral supplementation with enzymes like Aspergillus niger propyl-endoprotease (AN-PEP), which can hydrolyse gluten, has been proposed to prevent the harmful effects of ingestion of gluten. The influence of meal composition on AN-PEP activity was investigated using an in vitro model that simulates stomach-like conditions. AN-PEP optimal dosage was 20 proline protease units (PPU)/g gluten. The addition of a carbonated drink strongly enhanced AN-PEP activity because of its acidifying effect. While fat did not affect gluten degradation by AN-PEP, the presence of food proteins slowed down gluten detoxification. Moreover, raw gluten was degraded more efficiently by AN-PEP than baked gluten. We conclude that the meal composition influences the amount of AN-PEP needed for gluten elimination. Therefore, AN-PEP should not be used to replace a gluten free diet, but rather to support digestion of occasional and/or inadvertent gluten consumption.},

A selection of recent landmark findings is addressed here. RECENT FINDINGS: The complexity of host-microbe interactions is confirmed by unfolding evidence for signalling networks including microbe-macrophage-neuronal communication and several examples of diet-microbe-host metabolic exchanges. The contribution of the microbiota to several disorders, including celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, is increasingly evident and the importance of drug-bug interactions has been clarified. SUMMARY: Despite difficulty accessing the small bowel microbiota, there is growing evidence for its role in development, homeostasis and a diversity of diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only management for coeliac disease (CD). Available methods to assess GFD compliance are insufficiently sensitive to detect occasional dietary transgressions that may cause gut mucosal damage. We aimed to develop a method to determine gluten intake and monitor GFD compliance in patients with CD and to evaluate its correlation with mucosal damage. DESIGN: Urine samples of 76 healthy subjects and 58 patients with CD subjected to different gluten dietary conditions were collected. A lateral flow test (LFT) with the highly sensitive and specific G12 monoclonal antibody for the most dominant gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) and a LFT reader were used to quantify GIP in solid-phase extracted urines. RESULTS: GIP were detectable in concentrated urines from healthy individuals previously subjected to GFD as early as 4-6 h after single gluten intake, and remained detectable for 1-2 days. The urine assay revealed infringement of the GFD in about 50% of the patients. Analysis of duodenal biopsies revealed that most of patients with CD (89%) with no villous atrophy had no detectable GIP in urine, while all patients with quantifiable GIP in urine showed incomplete intestinal mucosa recovery. CONCLUSION: GIP are detected in urine after gluten consumption, enabling a new and non-invasive method to monitor GFD compliance and transgressions. The method was sensitive, specific and simple enough to be convenient for clinical monitoring of patients with CD as well as for basic and clinical research applications including drug development.

Sarcoidosis shows characteristic microRNAs (miRNAs) profiles. MiRNAs have recently emerged as a new class of modulators of gene expression. MiRNAs are involved in susceptibility to a number of autoimmune diseases promoting and inhibiting the gene expression of different Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL18. Sarcoidosis has been connected with a variety of autoimmune disorders including celiac disease (CD). CD is a chronic, immune-mediated condition of the small intestine caused by permanent intolerance to dietary gluten. IL-18 has been reported to play an important role in inducing and maintaining inflammation after gluten exposure. MiRNAs expression is significantly altered in CD patients. We hypothesize that sarcoidosis and CD may be the result of common genetic variants in IL-18 miRNA target site.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder caused by the ingestion of wheat gluten. A lifelong, gluten-free diet is required to alleviate symptoms and to normalize the intestinal mucosa. We previously found that transamidation reaction by microbial transglutaminase (mTG) was effective in down-regulating the gliadin-specific immune response in CD patients. In this study, the two-step transamidation protocol was adopted to treat commercial wheat semolina on a pilot scale. The effectiveness of the enzymatic reaction was tested by means of consolidated biochemical and immunological methods on isolated prolamins. We found that water-insoluble gliadin and glutenin yields decreased in wheat semolina to 5.9% +/- 0.3% and 11.6% +/- 0.1%, respectively, after a two-step transamidation reaction. Using DQ8 transgenic mice as a model of gluten sensitivity, we observed a dramatic reduction in IFN-gamma production in spleen cells challenged in vitro with the residual insoluble gliadin from transamidated semolina (N = 6; median values: 850 vs. 102; control vs. transamidated semolina, p < 0.05). The technological properties of treated wheat semolina were then tested by manufacturing classical pasta (spaghetti). Notably, the spaghetti manufactured with transamidated semolina had only minor changes in its features before and after cooking. In conclusion, the two-step transamidation reaction modified the immunogenic epitopes of gliadins also on a pilot-scale level without influencing the main technological properties of semolina. Our data shed further light on a detoxification strategy alternative to the current gluten-free diet and may have important implications for the management of CD patients.},

Its clinical presentation includes the classical malabsorption syndrome, unspecific and extra-intestinal manifestations, and silent celiac disease. The serologic diagnosis has an elevated sensitivity and specificity and, at least in adult population, it must be confirmed by biopsy in every case. Diagnosis in subjects already on gluten free diet includes HLA typing and gluten challenge with posterior serologic and histologic evaluation. The core of the treatment is the gluten free diet, which must be supervised by an expert nutritionist. Monitoring must be performed with serology beginning at 3-6 months, and with histology two years after the diagnosis, unless the clinical response is poor. Poor disease control is associated with complications such as lymphoma and small bowel adenocarcinoma. In the future, it is likely that new pharmacologic therapies will be available for the management of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is, as we know it, rather than being a rare and incurable disease until the 1950's, both quite common in screening studies and readily treatable. Three conditions are triggered by gluten consumption: celiac disease, the skin rash dermatitis herpetiformis and gluten ataxia. We describe our follow up for out clinic management, as evidence based data about such an approach are lacking in current literature. No food, beverages or medications containing any amount of gluten can be taken. Compliance is often difficult especially when patients are asymptomatic. We control a cohort, in daily practice, of over 700 adult patients. The majority of patients manage the diet without any problems. We describe our follow up in general, for serology, laboratory and histology. Forty percent of our newly diagnosed celiac patients do have a BMI over 25 kg/m(2). An appropriate attitude for this problem is lacking. The problem of slowly weaning off Dapsone over 5-10 years in DH is recognized. The bone density is checked in all newly diagnosed celiac patients. We control, if necessary, by telephone and lab controls done in local cities and see our patients only every two years face-to-face for follow up. The main question is if the adherence to a GFD, quality of life and prevention of complications is improved by visiting a dedicated celiac clinic. We hope to standardize this attitude on evidence data in the years to come.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gluten ingestion leads to symptoms and small intestinal mucosal injury in patients with celiac disease. The only option is the strict lifelong exclusion of dietary gluten, which is difficult to accomplish. Many patients following a gluten-free diet continue to have symptoms and have small intestinal mucosal injury. Nondietary therapies are needed. We performed a phase 2 study of the ability of latiglutenase, an orally administered mixture of 2 recombinant gluten-targeting proteases, to reduce mucosal morphometric measures in biopsy specimens from patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to assess the efficacy and safety of latiglutenase in 494 patients with celiac disease (with moderate or severe symptoms) in North America and Europe, from August 2013 until December 2014. Participants reported following a gluten-free diet for at least 1 year before the study began. Patients with documented moderate or severe symptoms and villous atrophy (villous height:crypt depth ratio of </=2.0) were assigned randomly to groups given placebo or 100, 300, 450, 600, or 900 mg latiglutenase daily for 12 or 24 weeks. Subjects completed the Celiac Disease Symptom Diary each day for 28 days and underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsy of the distal duodenum at baseline and at weeks 12 and 24. The primary end point was a change in the villous height:crypt depth ratio. Secondary end points included numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes, serology test results (for levels of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase-2 and deamidated gliadin peptide), symptom frequencies, and safety. RESULTS: In a modified intent-to-treat population, there were no differences between latiglutenase and placebo groups in change from baseline in villous height:crypt depth ratio, numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes, or serologic markers of celiac disease. All groups had significant improvements in histologic and symptom scores. CONCLUSIONS: In a phase 2 study of patients with symptomatic celiac disease and histologic evidence of significant duodenal mucosal injury, latiglutenase did not improve histologic and symptom scores when compared with placebo. There were no significant differences in change from baseline between groups. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT01917630.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic Pulmonary Hemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare cause of alveolar hemorrhage, which is seen primarily in childhood. Celiac disease is defined as a chronic, immune-mediated enteropathy of the small intestine, caused by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically pre-disposed individuals. Association of IPH and celiac disease is known as Lane Hamilton syndrome. There are limited number of case reports of this syndrome in literature. CASE PRESENTATION: Although there were no growth and developmental delay and gastrointestinal symptoms like chronic diarrhea, chronic constipation, vomiting, abdominal bloating and pain in the two patients with IPH, they were diagnosed with Lane Hamilton Syndrome. After initiation of gluten-free diet, their IPH symptoms disappeared and hemoglobin levels were observed to return to normal. CONCLUSIONS: Even if there were no gastrointestinal symptoms in a patient with IPH, celiac disease should be investigated. These patients may benefit from gluten free diet and IPH symptoms may disappear.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is defined as a state of heightened immunologic responsiveness to ingested gluten (from wheat, barley, or rye) in genetically susceptible individuals. Ingestion of the offending proteins leads to inflammation and intestinal mucosal damage, which may result in a spectrum of gastrointestinal symptoms, nutritional abnormalities, and systemic complications ranging from anemia and osteoporosis to secondary autoimmunity and malignancy. The genetic influence in the pathogenesis of celiac disease is indicated by its familial occurrence. Celiac disease does not develop unless a person has alleles that encode for human leukocyte antigen DQ2 or DQ8 proteins. The clinical picture of celiac disease has changed considerably during the past 30 years. Diarrhea, which was the presenting symptom in > 90% of celiac disease patients before 1981, is now the chief complaint in < 40%. In contrast, the increased frequency of atypical celiac disease presentations, including anemia and bone disease, is revealed by the widespread availability of serologic testing. An association between celiac disease and autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, and Sjogren's syndrome, has been well documented. The tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin antibody and the endomysial immunoglobulin antibody are the most sensitive and specific serologic tests, respectively, for identifying individuals who need to undergo an intestinal biopsy. If the suspicion of celiac disease is high, intestinal biopsy should be pursued even if serologic tests are negative. The gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease is a small bowel biopsy showing villous atrophy. The treatment for celiac disease is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Despite the proven benefits of the GFD, it can be exceedingly difficult to completely avoid gluten-containing foods, and adherence to a GFD is estimated to be only 45% to 80%.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is colonized by a dense community of commensal microorganisms referred to as the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota and the host have co-evolved, and they engage in a myriad of immunogenic and metabolic interactions. The gut microbiota contributes to the maintenance of host health. However, when healthy microbial structure is perturbed, a condition termed dysbiosis, the altered gut microbiota can trigger the development of various GI diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, celiac disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as genetic variations, diet, stress, and medication, can dramatically affect the balance of the gut microbiota. Therefore, these factors regulate the development and progression of GI diseases by inducing dysbiosis. Herein, we will review the recent advances in the field, focusing on the mechanisms through which intrinsic and extrinsic factors induce dysbiosis and the role a dysbiotic microbiota plays in the pathogenesis of GI diseases.},

   abstract = {Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is a rare complication of coeliac disease (CD) and involves malabsorption and villous atrophy despite adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) for at least 12 months in the absence of another cause. RCD is classified based on the T-cells in the intra-epithelial lymphocyte (IEL) morphology into type 1 with normal IEL and type 2 with aberrant IEL (clonal) by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for T cell receptors (TCR) at the beta/gamma loci. RCD type 1 is managed with strict nutritional and pharmacological management. RCD type 2 can be complicated by ulcerative jejunitis or enteropathy associated lymphoma (EATL), the latter having a five-year mortality of 50%. Management options for RCD type 2 and response to treatment differs across centres and there have been debates over the best treatment option. Treatment options that have been used include azathioprine and steroids, methotrexate, cyclosporine, campath (an anti CD-52 monoclonal antibody), and cladribine or fluadribine with or without autologous stem cell transplantation. We present a tertiary centre's experience in the treatment of RCD type 2 where treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine was used, and our results show good response with histological recovery in 56.6% of treated individuals.},

   abstract = {Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is a recognised complication, albeit very rare, of coeliac disease (CD). This condition is described when individuals with CD continue to experience enteropathy and subsequent or ongoing malabsorption despite strict adherence to a diet devoid of gluten for at least 12 months and when all other causes mimicking this condition are excluded. Depending on the T-cell morphology and T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality at the beta/gamma loci, RCD can be subdivided into type 1 (normal intra-epithelial lymphocyte morphology, polyclonal TCR population) and type 2 (aberrant IELs with clonal TCR). It is important to differentiate between the two types as type 1 has an 80% survival rate and is managed with strict nutritional and pharmacological management. RCD type 2 on the other hand has a 5-year mortality of 50% and can be complicated by ulcerative jejunitis or enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). Management of RCD type 2 has challenged many experts, and different treatment approaches have been adopted with variable results. Some of these treatments include immunomodulation with azathioprine and steroids, methotrexate, cyclosporine, alemtuzumab (an anti CD-52 monoclonal antibody), and cladribine or fludarabine sometimes with autologous stem cell transplantation. In this article, we summarise the management approach to patients with RCD type 2.},

   abstract = {Remission of gastrointestinal and general symptoms after gluten withdrawal has been described in some non-celiac individuals for nearly 30 years. Only recently, efforts have been made to define this entity, now referred to as "non-celiac gluten sensitivity". It includes patients that clinically respond to gluten free diet without exhibiting allergic or autoimmune features to explain such response. Wheat allergy, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome and symptoms induced by high FODMAPs (Fermentable, Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols) consumption are the main differential diagnoses. The relationship with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism has not been demonstrated, but currently it gives ground to great hope in families with affected children. Epidemiology of non-celiac gluten sensitivity is not clear. It is described as more common among women and less common in children. Genetic and immune factors, changes in intestinal microbiota and non-gluten components present in wheat grains are main factors postulated in the pathogenesis of this condition. To date, there are no specific biomarkers for non-celiac gluten sensitivity and diagnosis is reached by excluding other causes of disease. A trial with gluten-free diet and subsequent gluten challenge is the methodology most frequently used to confirm diagnosis.},

Little is known about CAM use in patients with celiac disease (CD). GOALS: We aimed to determine the demographics and clinical characteristics of patients with biopsy-proven CD who use dietary supplements to treat their symptoms. STUDY: CD patients completed a questionnaire on demographics, types of dietary supplement use, attitudes toward CAM, and 3 validated scales: CD-related Quality Of Life (CD-QOL), the CD Symptoms Index (CSI), and the CD Adherence Test (CDAT). RESULTS: Of 423 patients, 100 (23.6%) used dietary supplements to treat CD symptoms. The most frequently used supplement was probiotics (n=59). Supplement users had a higher CD-QOL score (75.06 vs. 71.43, P=0.04) but had more symptoms based on CSI (35.64 vs. 32.05, P=0.0032). On multivariable analysis, adjusting for age, sex, education, symptom improvement following a gluten-free diet, and where the survey was completed, patients presenting with classic symptoms (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.01-6.44) or nonclassic symptoms (OR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.04-7.24) were significantly more likely to use supplements than those with asymptomatic/screen-detected CD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with biopsy-proven CD who have symptoms at diagnosis tend to use dietary supplements more than those that are screen detected. Those using supplements report persistent symptoms, but a higher quality of life. The contribution of the gluten-free diet and supplement use to quality of life in the symptomatic CD patient needs to be determined.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical picture of celiac disease is changing with the emergence of subclinical forms and growing evidence reporting associated neurological disorders. AIMS: To establish the prevalence of celiac disease in children suffering from recurrent headache. METHODS: In our retrospective study we collected charts from 1131 children attending our tertiary care Centre for Paediatric Headache over the period 2001-2012. They were screened for celiac disease and positive patients were referred to our Operative Unit for Coeliac disease and confirmed positive children underwent upper endoscopy with multiple duodenal biopsies. Celiac children started a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: 883 children (481 females; median age, 9.8 years, range 3-19) performed celiac disease screening, and among them, 11 children (7 females; median age, 8.2 years, range: 4.8-13.9) were diagnosed with celiac disease. Seven children (5 females, median age, 11.9 years, range: 10.3-13.9) had been diagnosed as celiac prior to the neurological evaluation. The prevalence of celiac disease in our sample is 2.04% vs. 1.2% of the general population (p=0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates, on a large series, that celiac disease prevalence is doubled in patients with chronic headache. Screening for celiac disease could be advised as part of the diagnostic work-up in these paediatric patients, particularly among pharmacological non-responders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Key aims of treatment of coeliac disease are to heal the intestinal mucosa and correct nutritional abnormalities. AIM: We aim to determine prospectively the degree of success and time course of achieving those goals with a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients were enrolled at diagnosis and taught the diet. The first 52 were reassessed at 1 year and 46 at 5 years, 25 being assessed at the three time points regarding dietary compliance (dietitian-assessed), coeliac serology, bone mineral density and body composition analysis by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and intestinal histology. RESULTS: Mean age (range) was 40 (18-71) years and 48 (76%) were female. Dietary compliance was very good to excellent in all but one. Tissue transglutaminase IgA was persistently elevated in 44% at 1 year and 30% at 5 years and were poorly predictive of mucosal disease. Rates of mucosal remission (Marsh 0) and response (Marsh 0/1) were 37% and 54%, and 50% and 85% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Fat mass increased significantly over the first year in those with normal/reduced body mass index. Lean body mass indices more slowly improved irrespective of status at diagnosis with significant improvement at 5 years. Bone mass increased only in those with osteopenia or osteoporosis, mostly in year 1. CONCLUSION: Dietary compliance is associated with a high chance of healing the intestinal lesion and correction of specific body compositional abnormalities. The time course differed with body fat improving within 1 year, and correction of the mucosal lesion and improvement in lean mass and bone mass taking longer.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Refractory coeliac disease type II (RCDII) frequently transforms into an enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) and therefore requires intensive treatment. Current evaluated treatment strategies for RCDII include cladribine (2-CdA) and autologous stem cell transplantation (auSCT). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term survival and define clear prognostic criteria for EATL development comparing two treatment strategies. METHODS: A total of 45 patients were retrospectively analysed. All patients received 2-CdA, after which they were either closely monitored (monotherapy, n = 30) or a step-up approach was used including auSCT (step-up therapy, n = 15). RESULTS: Ten patients (22%) ultimately developed EATL; nine of these had received monotherapy. Absence of histological remission after monotherapy was associated with EATL development (p = 0.010). Overall, 20 patients (44%) died with a median survival of 84 months. Overall survival (OS) within the monotherapy group was significantly worse in those without histological remission compared to those with complete histological remission(p = 0.030). The monotherapy group who achieved complete histological remission showed comparable EATL occurrence and OS as compared to the step-up therapy group (p = 0.80 and p = 0.14 respectively). CONCLUSION: Histological response is an accurate parameter to evaluate the effect of 2-CdA therapy and this parameter should be leading in the decisions whether or not to perform a step-up treatment approach in RCDII.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is treated by life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). Novel therapies are under development. Willingness of CD children's parents to alternative therapies and GFD impact were evaluated. METHODS: Parents of celiac children on GFD were investigated on need and preference for novel CD therapies, children's enrolment in trials, compliance to and personal judgment on GFD, health status (HS) and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: About 59.5% surveyed parents expressed the need for alternative therapies with a preference for vaccine-based strategy (39.9%). About 37.7% would accept enrollment in an ad hoc trial, 20.3% would agree to endoscopy during the trial. GFD compliance was 97.4% and well accepted by 93.8%. HS and QoL significantly improved during GFD (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of novel therapies for CD is desirable for over half of parents, with preference for vaccines. Parents frown upon enrolment in new clinical trials and the subsequent need for additional endoscopy.},

   abstract = {Canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates the homeostasis of intestinal epithelium by controlling the balance between intestinal stem cell self-renewal and differentiation but epigenetic mechanisms enacting the process are not known. We hypothesized that epigenetic regulator, Polycomb Repressive Complex-2 (PRC2), is involved in Wnt-mediated epithelial homeostasis on the crypt-villus axis and aberrancies therein are implicated both in celiac disease and in intestinal malignancies. We found that PRC2 establishes repressive crypt and villus specific trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) signature on genes responsible for, for example, nutrient transport and cell killing in crypts and, for example, proliferation and differentiation in mature villi, suggesting that PRC2 facilitates the Wnt-governed intestinal homeostasis. When celiac patients are on gluten-containing diet PRC2 is out-of-bounds active and consequently its target genes were found affected in intestinal epithelium. Significant set of effective intestinal PRC2 targets are also differentially expressed in colorectal adenoma and carcinomas. Our results suggest that PRC2 gives rise and maintains polar crypt and villus specific H3K27me3 signatures. As H3K27me3 is a mark enriched in developmentally important genes, identified intestinal PRC2 targets are possibly imperative drivers for enterocyte differentiation and intestinal stem cell maintenance downstream to Wnt-signaling. Our work also elucidates the mechanism sustaining the crypt hyperplasia in celiac disease and suggest that PRC2-dependent fostering of epithelial stemness is a common attribute in intestinal diseases in which epithelial hyperplasia or neoplasia prevails. Finally, this work demonstrates that in intestine PRC2 represses genes having both pro-stemness and pro-differentiation functions, fact need to be considered when designing epigenetic therapies including PRC2 as a drug target.

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate whether breast-milk composition and microbiota differ in healthy mothers and mothers with celiac disease (CD) to ultimately contribute to identify additional factors determining CD risk. METHODS: Breast-milk samples from healthy mothers (n = 12) and mothers with CD (n = 12) were collected. Cytokines and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) were analyzed by bead-arrays and flow cytometry and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) were assessed by capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF) detection. Breast-milk microbiota composition was analyzed by conventional and quantitative real-time PCR. RESULT: Breast milk from CD mothers showed significantly lower levels of interleukin (IL) 12p70 (P < 0.042), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 (P < 0.018) and sIgA (P < 0.003) and almost significantly lower levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma (P < 0.058). Six mothers in each group belonged to the secretor Le(a-b+) type, one to the secretor Le(a-b-) type and five to the non-secretor Le(a+b-) type. CD mothers of non-secretor Le(a+b-) type showed increased Lacto-N-tetraose content (P < 0.042) compared with healthy mothers. CD mothers' milk showed reduced gene copy numbers of Bifidobacterium spp. (P < 0.026) and B. fragilis group (P < 0.044). CONCLUSION: CD mothers' breast milk is characterized by a reduced abundance of immunoprotective compounds (TGF-beta1 and sIgA) and bifidobacteria. The reduction in these components could theoretically diminish the protective effects of breast-feeding on the child's future risk of developing CD.},

   abstract = {The publication of papers on the topic of gluten related disorders has substantially increased over the last few years. This has motivated healthcare professionals to pay attention not only to celiac disease and wheat allergy but also to a condition termed nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Until now this condition has been diagnosed clinically on the basis of exclusion criteria and clinical response to gluten withdrawal. In addition, recent research in this field has shown that other food components distinct from gluten are implicated in NCGS cases, thereby changing our general understanding of NCGS diagnosis in either individuals on gluten containing diets or those already following a gluten-free diet with no proper diagnostic work-up of celiac disease. With this in mind, the assessment of NCGS will require extensive knowledge of celiac disease manifestations and the laboratory tests commonly performed during diagnosis of celiac disease.},

These measurements are strongly linked to gluten-related disorders. This work aimed to estimate the prevalence of adverse reactions to oral gluten and the adherence to gluten-free diet in the adult Mexican population. To reach this aim, a self-administered questionnaire was designed and tested for clarity/comprehension and reproducibility. Then, a self-administered questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the Mexican population. The estimated prevalence rates were (95% CI): 11.9% (9.9-13.5) and 7.8 (6.4-9.4) for adverse and recurrent adverse reactions to gluten respectively; adherence to gluten-free diet 3.7% (2.7-4.8), wheat allergy 0.72% (0.38-1.37); celiac disease 0.08% (0.01-0.45), and NCGS 0.97% (0.55-1.68). Estimated pooled prevalence of self-reported physician-diagnosis of gluten-related disorders was 0.88% (0.49-1.5), and 93.3% respondents reported adherence to gluten-free diet without a physician-diagnosis of gluten-related disorders. Symptom comparisons between those who reported recurrent adverse reactions to gluten and other foods showed statistically significant differences for bloating, constipation, and tiredness (p < 0.05). Gluten-related disorders may be underdiagnosed in the Mexican population and most people adhering to a gluten-free diet are doing it without proper diagnostic work-up of these disorders, and probably without medical/dietician advice.},

Fruit by-products are know from literature to contain a high level of dietary fibre which could improve the bread properties and fibre contents of gluten-free bread. Therefore, a mathematical design was created; three variables were identified from preliminary tests (water (85-100% flour weight, OP 0-8% flour weight and proofing time 35-100 min) as being crucial in the development of acceptable bread. Results illustrated longer proofing times (p<0.05) and lower orange pomace levels (OP) (p<0.001) produced a bread with a greater specific volume. OP had the most significant (p<0.0001) effect on hardness at 2h and 24h post-baking. The optimised formulation was calculated to contain 5.5% OP, 94.6% water and a proofing time of 49 min. Total fibre content of the control bread (2.1%) was successfully increased t o 3.9% in the OP containing bread. Substituting gluten-free flours with orange pomace flour can help improve the total dietary intake of a coeliac while not negating on the quality properties of the bread.},

   abstract = {There are 10 things that all gastroenterologists should know about celiac disease (CD). (1) The immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase is the single best serologic test to use for the detection of CD. (2) CD can be recognized endoscopically, and water immersion enhances villi detection, although a normal endoscopic appearance does not preclude the diagnosis. (3) It is recommended that 4 biopsies be taken from the second part of the duodenum and 2 bulb biopsies be taken at the 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions to maximize the sensitivity for histologic confirmation of CD. (4) Consider serologic testing of first-degree relatives, patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Down's, Turner's, and Williams' syndromes, as well as those with premature osteoporosis, iron deficiency, abnormal liver biochemistries, and other manifestations of CD. (5) Patients already on a prolonged gluten-free diet (GFD) should be tested for the presence of HLA DQ2 or DQ8, thereby avoiding the need for further evaluation of CD in non-allelic carriers. (6) The basic treatment of CD is a strict, lifelong GFD, enabled by an expert dietitian. (7) Newly diagnosed adults with CD should be assessed for micronutrient deficiencies (iron, B12, folate, zinc, copper), fat soluble vitamin deficiencies (vitamin D), and bone densitometry. (8) All patients diagnosed with CD should have clinical follow-up to ensure response and adherence to a GFD. (9) In those with persistent or relapsing symptoms, the robustness of the original diagnosis should be reviewed, gluten exposure sought, and a systematic evaluation for alternative and associated diseases performed. (10) Evaluate those with refractory disease for malignant transformation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) affects approximately 1% of the population and negatively affects aspects of life including physical and social function. The relationship between socioeconomic (SE) factors, symptom severity, and perceived burden of living with CD is not well understood. The objective of this study was to assess the relationships between income, symptoms, and perceived burden of CD. METHODS: In this survey study conducted at a tertiary care center, 773 patients 18 years of age or more with biopsy confirmed CD were eligible to participate. Patients completed a survey with information on SE data, the validated Celiac Symptom Index (CSI), and visual analog scales (VAS) assessing overall health, CD-related health, difficulty in following a gluten-free diet (GFD), and importance of following a GFD. RESULTS: Three hundred forty one patients completed the survey. Higher income predicted better overall health, better CD related health, and fewer symptoms. In the logistic regression model, low income was associated with greater CD symptoms (odds ratio=6.04, P=0.002). Other factors associated with greater symptoms were younger age, poor overall health state, and more physician visits. Factors associated with increased burden of CD included hospitalizations, more symptoms, poor overall health state, and burden of following a GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lower incomes have worse CD-related health and greater symptoms. Those with low income had 6 times the odds of greater symptoms compared with those with high income. Our data suggest that income is associated with perceived overall health, CD-related health, and CD symptoms.},

   abstract = {The use of gluten-free products is increasing since a growing number of people are suffering from celiac disease and thereby need gluten-free diet. Gluten is responsible for the visco-elastic characteristics of wheat-based products; therefore, its lack makes the gluten-free products not similar to wheat-based product, with scarce textural properties. This reason constitutes the major industrial limitation. Thus, obtaining good-quality gluten-free products represents a technological challenge. This review reports the main strategies adopted to produce high quality gluten-free pasta and bread. They are mainly obtained by the utilization of specific ingredients (hydrocolloids, proteins or enzymes) to be incorporated into the standard formulation or the adoption of proper technological variables that can enhance above all the functional properties, the texture and the taste.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy, triggered by dietary wheat gluten and similar proteins of barley and rye in genetically susceptible individuals. This is a complex disorder involving both environmental and immune-genetic factors. The major genetic risk factor for CD is determined by HLA-DQ genes. Dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems can conceivably cause impairment of mucosal barrier function and development of localized or systemic inflammatory and autoimmune processes. Exposure to gluten is the main environmental trigger responsible for the signs and symptoms of the disease, but exposure to gluten does not fully explain the manifestation of CD. Thus, both genetic determination and environmental exposure to gluten are necessary for the full manifestation of CD; neither of them is sufficient alone. Epidemiological and clinical data suggest that other environmental factors, including infections, alterations in the intestinal microbiota composition, and early feeding practices, might also play a role in disease development. Thus, this interaction is the condicio sine qua non celiac disease can develop. The breakdown of the interaction among microbiota, innate immunity, and genetic and dietary factors leads to disruption of homeostasis and inflammation; and tissue damage occurs. Focusing attention on this interaction and its breakdown may allow a better understanding of the CD pathogenesis and lead to novel translational avenues for preventing and treating this widespread disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Multiple European studies report increased prevalence of selective immunoglobulin A deficiency (SIgAD) and partial immunoglobulin A deficiency (PIgAD) in patients with celiac disease (CD). However; prospective data representing North American adults are lacking. While SIgAD precludes the use of IgA-tissue-transglutaminase antibody (IgA-tTG), the effect of PIgAD on IgA-tTG sensitivity is not well documented. We aim to determine the prevalence and impact of IgA deficiency on CD presentation and diagnosis in North American adult patients. METHODS: We reviewed 1000 consecutive patients undergoing IgA-tTG testing and 243 healthy controls. Eligible sera were tested for IgA-tTG, serum immunoglobulins, and IgA/IgG-deamidated gliadin peptide (IgA/IgG-DGP). RESULTS: Prevalence of SIgAD was marginally higher in patients with CD (1.9%) compared with healthy controls (0.4%, P = 0.24) and patients without CD (0.7%, P = 0.173). Prevalence of PIGAD was similar in patients with CD (4.8%) compared with healthy controls (5.9%, P = 0.57) and patients without CD (7.2%, P = 0.22). One (16.7%) of 6 patients with CD with SIgAD and all 15 (100%) with PIGAD tested IgA-tTG positive prior to gluten-free diet initiation. Patients with CD with SIGAD showed lower frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms (33% vs 82%, P = 0.01) and more co-morbid autoimmune disease (67% vs 23%, P = 0.03) when compared with patients with CD with normal IgA. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SIgAD in North American patients with CD is comparable with European data but not significantly different than control populations. Patients with CD with SIgAD exhibit decreased IgA-tTG sensitivity and lack of gastrointestinal symptoms. PIgAD is common in patients with gastrointestinal disorders but does not alter CD presentation or IgA-tTG sensitivity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Macrophage activation syndrome is described as a "clinical syndrome of hyperinflammation resulting in an uncontrolled and ineffective immune response" in the context of an autoinflammatory or rheumatic disease. Current associations of macrophage activation syndrome with autoimmune disease most notably include a host of rheumatological conditions and inflammatory bowel disease. Epidemiological studies have shown that macrophage activation syndrome is precipitated by autoimmune disease more commonly than previously thought. Diagnosing the precipitating factor is essential for effective treatment and prognosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a six year old girl with coeliac disease diagnosed after two episodes of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Her condition only responded to treatment once the patient was placed on a gluten free diet. Further immunological testing confirmed anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies, however histological biopsy was deemed inappropriate due to the severity of her condition. She has remained stable with no further episodes of macrophage activation syndrome since commencing a gluten free diet. CONCLUSION: This case report is the first literature that links macrophage activation syndrome to coeliac disease and highlights the challenge of diagnosing coeliac disease with unusual features such as associated prolonged fever. Clinicians should have a low threshold for screening children with other autoimmune diseases for coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {This experiment was designed to establish the localization and neurochemical phenotyping of sympathetic neurons supplying prepyloric area of the porcine stomach in a physiological state and during acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) induced gastritis. In order to localize the sympathetic perikarya the stomachs of both control and acetylsalicylic acid treated (ASA group) animals were injected with neuronal retrograde tracer Fast Blue (FB). Seven days post FB injection, animals were divided into a control and ASA supplementation group. The ASA group was given 100 mg/kg of b.w. ASA orally for 21 days. On the 28th day all pigs were euthanized with gradual overdose of anesthetic. Then fourteen-micrometer-thick cryostat sections were processed for routine double-labeling immunofluorescence, using primary antisera directed towards tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DbetaH), neuropeptide Y (NPY), galanin (GAL), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), leu 5-enkephalin (LENK), cocaine- and amphetamine- regulated transcript peptide (CART), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The data obtained in this study indicate that postganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers supplying prepyloric area of the porcine stomach originate from the coeliac-cranial mesenteric ganglion complex (CCMG). In control animals, the FB-labelled neurons expressed TH (94.85 +/- 1.01%), DbetaH (97.10 +/- 0.97%), NPY (46.88 +/- 2.53%) and GAL (8.40 +/- 0.53%). In ASA group, TH- and DbetaH- positive nerve cells were reduced (85.78 +/- 2.65% and 88.82 +/- 1.63% respectively). Moreover, ASA- induced gastritis resulted in increased expression of NPY (76.59 +/- 3.02%) and GAL (26.45 +/- 2.75%) as well as the novo-synthesis of nNOS (6.13 +/- 1.11%) and LENK (4.77 +/- 0.42%) in traced CCMG neurons. Additionally, a network of CART-, CGRP-, SP-, VIP-, LENK-, nNOS- immunoreactive (IR) nerve fibers encircling the FB-positive perikarya were observed in both intact and ASA-treated animals. The results of this study indicate involvement of these neuropeptides in the development or presumably counteraction of gastric inflammation.},

   abstract = {Aim. To clinically evaluate the activity of glucoamylase, maltase, saccharase, and lactase in the small intestinal mucosa (SIM) of patients with celiac disease. Subjects and methods. Twenty-nine patents with celiac disease were examined. The disease was first detected in 8 patients; in the remaining patients, it had been diagnosed 6 months to 35 years before. The diagnosis was verified by histological examinations of duodenal biopsy specimens and by determination of immunoglobulin (Ig) A and G antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (atTG) and gliadin (AGA) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Carbohydrase activities were estimated in the duodenal biopsy specimens, by applying the method of A. Dahlquist. Results. In the control group, the activities of glucoamylase, maltase, saccharase, and lactase averaged 598.8+184.2, 825.3+239.3, 180.2-68.1, and 53.4+16.3 ng/glucose/mg tissue min, respectively. In the patients with celiac disease, the average activities of all the examined enteric enzymes were significantly below the normal value even they had been on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for 10 years or longer. Complete SIM structural recovery (Marsh stage 0) occurred in only 7 of 18 patients who had been on a strictly GFD. Serological (atTG and AGA) tests got also negative in all the 7 patients with completely recovered SIM. Six of the latter patients continued to have abdominal bloating and borborygmus, unstable stool with a propensity for diarrhea and weakness. Each was detected to have a lower activity of one or a few enzymes. The activity of all the carbohydrases reached its normal value in only 1 patient and she felt healthy, without perceiving any food intolerance. Conclusion. The activity of membrane enzymes may serve as a marker for the degree of SIM recovery in patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether celiac children are at risk for EEG-neurological features and sleep disordered breathing (SDB), and whether an appropriate gluten-free diet (GFD) influences these disorders. METHODS: We consecutively enrolled 19 children with a new biopsy-proven celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. At CD diagnosis and after 6 months of GFD, each patient underwent a general and neurological examination, an electroencephalogram, a questionnaire about neurological features, and a validated questionnaire about SDB: OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) scores<0 predict normality; values>0 predict OSA. RESULTS: At CD diagnosis, 37% of patients complained headache that affected daily activities and 32% showed positive OSA score. The EEG examinations revealed abnormal finding in 48% of children. After 6 months of GFD headache disappeared in 72% of children and EEG abnormalities in 78%; all children showed negative OSA score. CONCLUSION: According to our preliminary data, in the presence of unexplained EEG abnormalities and/or other neurological disorders/SDB an atypical or silent CD should also be taken into account.},

   abstract = {The current review paper highlights the complicacies associated with communities relying on wheat as their dietary staple. Although, wheat is an important source of nutrients but is also linked with allergenic responses in genetically susceptible subjects. The wheat proteins especially alpha-amylase inhibitors, omega-5 gliadins, prolamins, nonprolamin, glucoprotein, and profilins are of significance importance. The allergenic responses are further categorized into IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions. Conjugation and degranulation of the IgEs with the allergens results in release of several mediators. In contrary, non-IgE-mediated wheat allergy depends on immune complexes formed by food and food antibodies and cell-mediated immunity. As results, different diseases tend to occur on the completion of these reactions, i.e., celiac disease, baker's asthma, diarrhea, atopic dermatitis, and urticaria. This instant paper highlighted the concept of food allergy with special reference to wheat. The models are developed that are included in this paper showing the wheat allergen, their possible routes, impact on human health, and indeed possible remedies. The paper would provide the basic information for the researchers, common man, and allied stakeholders to cater the issue in details. However, the issue needs the attention of the researchers as there is a need to clarify the issues of wheat allergy and wheat intolerance.},

   abstract = {Bloating, abdominal discomfort or pain, disturbed bowel habits are very common symptoms, frequently reported by the patients soon after food ingestion. These symptoms may occur in different clinical conditions, such as functional bowel disorders, food adverse reactions, gluten-related syndromes, which frequently are interrelated. Consequently, in clinical practice, it is necessary to perform a correct diagnosis in order to identify, for the single patient, the most appropriate therapeutic strategy, which may include not only specific drugs, but also, and mainly, life style changes (healthy nutritional behavior and constant physical activity). The aim of this review is to provide to the general physician, according to the available evidence, the most appropriate diagnostic work-ups for recognizing the different clinical scenarios (i.e. food allergy and intolerance, functional bowel diseases, gluten-related syndromes), to identify their clinical interrelationships and to suggest the most appropriate management. In fact, as far as food intolerances are concerned, it is well known that the number of patients who believe that their symptoms are related to food intolerance is increasing and consequently they restrict their diet, possibly causing nutritional deficiencies. Furthermore, there is an increasing use of unconventional diagnostic tests for food intolerance which lack accurate scientific evidence; the application of their results may induce misdiagnosis and unhealthy therapeutic choices. Consequently the recognition of food intolerance has to be performed on the basis of reliable tests within an agreed diagnostic workup.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. Both conditions are treated with a restrictive life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). Treated celiac disease patients have been shown to have more severe gastrointestinal symptoms and inferior quality of life compared with healthy controls, but evidence regarding quality of life in DH is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate whether long-term GFD-treated DH patients suffer from persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and if they experience a drawdown in quality of life. METHODS: Gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life were assessed in 78 long-term GFD-treated DH patients using the validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, Psychological General Well-Being and Short Form 36 Health Survey questionnaires. The findings were compared with 110 healthy controls, population-based reference values and 371 treated celiac disease controls. RESULTS: The median age of the DH patients at the time of the study was 57 years, and 51 % were male. Significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms or quality of life were not detected when treated DH patients were compared with healthy controls, but treated DH patients had less severe gastrointestinal symptoms and increased quality of life compared with celiac disease controls. Female DH patients had more severe gastrointestinal symptoms and reduced vitality compared with male DH patients. The presence of skin symptoms and the adherence to or duration of GFD did not have any influence on gastrointestinal symptoms or quality of life. CONCLUSION: We conclude that long-term GFD-treated DH patients do not suffer from the burden of dietary treatment and have a quality of life comparable to that of controls.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic disorder caused by ingestion of gluten found in wheat, rye and barley. It affects around 1% of children, but 90% of cases are considered to remain undiagnosed. CD classically presents with gastrointestinal manifestations including diarrhoea, bloating, weight loss and abdominal pain, but extra-intestinal features (including oral and dental manifestations) are increasingly being reported. Dental and oral manifestations such as dental enamel defects, delayed eruption of teeth, recurrent aphthous ulcers are well-recognised manifestations of CD. In patients with yet undiagnosed CD, these can sometimes be the only presenting features. Dentists have regular contact with well children, and therefore the visit to the dentist is an opportunity to suspect CD. When CD is suspected, Dental practitioners can liaise with the general medical practitioner to organise screening for coeliac disease. Positive serology will prompt onward referral to a paediatric gastroenterologist to confirm the diagnosis. The recent European Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines revised in 2012 have streamlined the diagnostic pathway for faster diagnosis of CD. Management involves strict adherence to a gluten free diet, which should lead to resolution of symptoms, recovery of intestinal mucosa and prevention of long-term complications associated with it. This article aims to describe CD, inform of recent changes to the diagnostic pathway and highlight the dental manifestations of the condition to equip dental practitioners to aid early diagnosis and initiation of treatment for children with CD.},

The condition presents classically with gastrointestinal signs including diarrhoea, bloating, weight loss and abdominal pain, but presentations can include extra-intestinal symptoms such as iron-deficiency anaemia, faltering growth, delayed puberty and mouth ulcers. Some children are at higher risk of developing coeliac disease, for example those with a strong family history, certain genetic disorders and other autoimmune conditions. If coeliac disease is suspected, serological screening with anti-tissue transglutaminase titres should be performed and the diagnosis may be confirmed by small bowel biopsy while the child remains on a normal (gluten-containing) diet. Modified European guidelines recommend that symptomatic children with anti-tissue transglutaminase titres more than ten times the upper limit of normal, and positive human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 status, do not require small bowel biopsy for diagnosis of coeliac disease. Management of the disease involves strict adherence to a lifelong gluten-free diet, which should lead to resolution of symptoms and prevention of long-term complications. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the varied presentations of coeliac disease to ensure timely screening and early initiation of a gluten-free diet.},

More recently, for a selective group of children, modification of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines has enabled non-biopsy (serological) diagnosis of coeliac disease. Children's nurses have an important role in recognising and diagnosing coeliac disease earlier as well as offering ongoing dietary support. Enabling children to maintain a gluten-free diet is essential for general wellbeing and preventing long-term complications.},

The spectrum of presentation of coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease may be similar. However, those disorders require various therapeutic approaches. Thus, early recognition of the overlap between coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease is crucial to apply appropriate treatment and to prevent possible complications. We report a case of a 6-year-old boy with a delay in physical and psychomotor development, rickets, severe anaemia and bloody diarrhoea. He was diagnosed with coeliac disease and ulcerative disease. The coexistence of both disorders is extremely rare in childhood. However, ulcerative colitis should be considered in coeliac children on restrictive gluten-free diet with persistent diarrhoea or bleeding from lower gastrointestinal tract. Screening for coeliac disease should be considered in children with ulcerative colitis with impaired physical development and lack of remission despite of proper treatment.},

R.D., 34-year-old woman (gravida 2 para 1), was referred to the High Risk Pregnancy Outpatient Clinic at Cannizzaro Hospital in Catania at 8 weeks' gestation. She was affected from type III Polyglandular Autoimmune Disease (Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Autoimmune Hashimoto Thyroiditis and Celiac Disease). Pre-conception glycated hemoglobin and thyrotropin levels were normal. This pregnancy was characterized by glycemic instability and the need to increase the insulin units every month. The patient was hospitalized at 32+6 weeks for monitoring fetus and mother health because of inadequate glycemic control and the high insulin dosage required. She was delivered by caesarean section at 36+6 weeks because of uterine contractions, the previous cesarean section, glycemic instability and the gestational age. She delivered a baby boy, birth-weight 3300 g, Apgar 8-9. She was discharged in the fourth day after delivery with good maternal and child prognosis. Literature data and the experience derived by this case report suggest some recommendations to improve obstetrics and neonatologist outcome in the patients affected from type III Polyglandular Autoimmune Syndrome: pre-conception counseling, thyrotropin assay every 4-6 weeks, gluten-free diet, fasting and post-prandial blood glucose level targets.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In celiac disease, a follow-up biopsy taken 1 year after diagnosis is considered important in monitoring histological recovery. In many cases, recovery is incomplete, and the clinical significance of this is poorly understood. We now investigated associated factors and the significance of imperfect histological recovery in patients in whom the follow-up had been completed. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-three biopsy-proven patients were divided into two groups: histological recovery and incomplete recovery after 1 year on gluten-free diet. Serology, laboratory values, bone mineral density, and different clinical variables were measured at diagnosis and after 1 year. Gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life were assessed by validated questionnaires. Further, long-term follow-up data on mortality, malignancies, and other severe complications were collected. RESULTS: The incomplete recovery group had more severe mucosal damage (P=0.003), higher antibody values (P=0.017), and more signs of malabsorption (P<0.001) at diagnosis. There was no difference in gender, symptoms or quality of life, family history of celiac disease, or comorbidities. At follow-up, there was still a difference in antibodies (P=0.018) and femoral T-scores (P=0.024). Histologically recovered patients showed better dietary adherence, although it was excellent in both groups (97% vs. 87%, P<0.001). There was no difference in long-term outcomes between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of more severe disease in terms of histology, serology, and signs of malabsorption was associated with histological non-response. In patients with high dietary adherence, incomplete villous recovery after 1 year does not affect the clinical response or long-term prognosis. A personalized approach is required to decide the optimal timing of the follow-up biopsy.},

   abstract = {The Central American countries: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama are in transition from a dietary culture based mainly on maize to a wheat-containing diet. Several other changes are occurring, such as a decrease of parasitic and infectious diseases. The environmental changes permit a prediction of an increase of celiac disease and other autoimmune diseases such as type I diabetes and thyroid disease in these genetically heterogeneous countries. At present, celiac disease and gluten-related disorders are considered to be of no relevance at the level of public health in these nations. This review documents the presence of celiac disease in Central America. It draws attention to some of the challenges in planning systematic studies in the region since up until recently celiac disease was unknown. The aim of this review is to disseminate knowledge obtained with preliminary data, to stimulate clinical and basic scientists to study these diseases in Central America and to alert authorities responsible for the planning of education and health, to find possibilities to avoid a rise in these disorders before the epidemics start, as has occurred in the Mediterranean countries.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have noticed that patients with postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) were placing themselves on a gluten-free diet without medical consultation. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of coeliac disease and self-reported gluten sensitivity in a cohort of patients with PoTS and compare this with local population data. METHODS: A total of 100 patients with PoTS were recruited to complete a questionnaire that screened for gluten sensitivity, related symptoms and dietary habits. Patients were also assessed for coeliac disease. For comparison, the local coeliac prevalence was determined from a total of 1200 controls (group 1) and a further 400 controls (group 2), frequency matched for age and sex, who completed the same questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall, 4/100 (4%) patients with PoTS had serology and biopsy-proven coeliac disease. This was significantly higher than the local population prevalence of coeliac disease (12/1200, 1%; odds ratio: 4.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.3-13.0; P=0.03). PoTS patients also had a higher prevalence of self-reported gluten sensitivity (42 vs. 19%, respectively; odds ratio: 3.1, 95% confidence interval: 2.0-5.0; P<0.0001) compared with age-matched and sex-matched controls. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to suggest a potential association between gluten-related disorders and PoTS. A prospective study evaluating this relationship further may enable a better understanding and management of these conditions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The low FODMAP diet eliminates carbohydrates and fermentable alcohols because they are not absorbed by the intestine, but are fermented by the microbiota, causing bloating and flatulence. AIMS: To evaluate the clinical response to the low FODMAP diet in patients with the different clinical subtypes of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients attended to at the Gastroenterology Department in 2014 that were diagnosed with IBS based on the Rome III criteria were included in the study. They were managed with a low FODMAP diet for 21 days and their response to the symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and stool form pre and post-diet were evaluated through the visual analogue scale, Bristol scale, and patient overall satisfaction. The results were analyzed by means, 95% CI, and the Student's t test. RESULTS: Of the 31 patients included in the study, 87% were women and the mean age was 46.48 years. Distribution was: IBS-C 64.5%, IBS-D 22.6%, and IBS-M 12.9%. The score for pain was 6.0 (95% CI 5.04-6.96) and the post-diet score was 2.77 (95% CI 1.60-3.95) (P<.001). The score for bloating was 7.10 (95% CI 6.13-8.06) and the post-diet score was 4.19 (95% CI 2.95-5.44) (P<.001). The score for flatulence was 5.94 (95% CI 4.79-7.08) and the post-diet score was 3.06 (IC95% 1.99-4.14) (P<.001). The pre-diet Bristol Scale result was 3.68 (95% CI 3.14-4.22) and the post-diet result was 4.10 (95% CI 3.66-4.54) (P=.1). The satisfaction percentage was 70.9%. CONCLUSIONS: In this first study on a Mexican population with IBS, there was significant improvement of the main symptoms, including pain, bloating, and flatulence after treatment with a low FODMAP diet.},

   abstract = {Refractory celiac disease is characterized by mucosal damage in patients with celiac disease despite a gluten-free diet. Little is known about the mechanisms that cause persistent intestinal inflammation in these patients. We performed a case-control study of 17 consecutive patients diagnosed with refractory celiac disease from 2001 through 2014 (median age, 51 y; 10 women) and 24 patients with uncomplicated celiac disease (controls) to determine whether refractory disease is associated with infection by lymphotropic oncogenic viruses. We performed real-time PCR analyses of duodenal biopsy samples from all patients to detect Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus-8, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus-I, -II, or -III. We used in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses to identify infected cells and viral proteins. We did not detect human herpesvirus-8 or human T-cell lymphotropic viruses in any of the biopsy specimens. However, 12 of 17 (70.5%) biopsy specimens from patients with refractory celiac disease were positive for EBV, compared with 4 of 24 (16.6%) biopsy specimens from controls (P < .001). EBV was detected in inflammatory cells and enterocytes. An analysis of latency- and replication-associated proteins confirmed active infection. Further studies are needed to determine whether EBV infection contributes to the pathogenesis of refractory celiac disease and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the perceived importance, knowledge and confidence in nutritional management in a sample of Australian medical students undertaking a 4-year postgraduate medical degree. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: In 2015, students in years 1-4 were anonymously surveyed to assess students' perceived importance of nutrition, and knowledge and confidence in nutritional management. RESULTS: A total of 131 first and second year (preclinical/yr 1-2) medical students (46% response rate) and 66 third and fourth year (clinical/yr 3-4) students (24% response rate) completed the questionnaire. Most preclinical students agreed that medical graduates should understand nutritional issues in managing cardiovascular disease (99%), type 2 diabetes (93%), coeliac disease (95%), and renal impairment (97%). However, students were limited in their confidence to demonstrate this knowledge (range of confidence: 26%-41%) for individual medical conditions. This improved for students in the clinical context of years 3 and 4, although it was still not optimal (range 26%-81%). Few year 3 and 4 students reported confidence in knowledge related to medicolegal issues, respiratory disease, nutritional guidelines and nutrition assessment (all <40%). However the majority (>80%) reported confidence in the dietary management of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and coeliac disease and >60% indicated they would refer onto nutrition professionals. CONCLUSIONS: This cohort of postgraduate medical students recognize the importance of nutrition in disease. The number of students reporting increased confidence in nutritional management of a few select diseases where dietary management is one of the cornerstones of treatment (e.g. type 2 diabetes) rises throughout the course. However, students reported lower levels of knowledge in diseases where diet is secondary to other treatments and preventative strategies (e.g. respiratory disease). Filling the gap by integrating the nutritional management into the range of common chronic diseases during training has the potential to positively impact on patient health outcomes.},

   abstract = {In HLA-DQ8-associated celiac disease (CD), the pathogenic T cell response is directed toward an immunodominant alpha-gliadin-derived peptide (DQ8-glia-alpha1). However, our knowledge of TCR gene usage within the primary intestinal tissue of HLA-DQ8 (+) CD patients is limited. We identified two populations of HLA-DQ8-glia-alpha1 tetramer(+) CD4(+) T cells that were essentially undetectable in biopsy samples from patients on a gluten-free diet but expanded rapidly and specifically after antigenic stimulation. Distinguished by expression of TRBV9, both T cell populations displayed biased clonotypic repertoires and reacted similarly against HLA-DQ8-glia-alpha1. In particular, TRBV9 paired most often with TRAV26-2, whereas the majority of TRBV9(-) TCRs used TRBV6-1 with no clear TRAV gene preference. Strikingly, both tetramer(+)/TRBV9(+) and tetramer(+)/TRBV9(-) T cells possessed a non-germline-encoded arginine residue in their CDR3alpha and CDR3beta loops, respectively. Comparison of the crystal structures of three TRBV9(+) TCRs and a TRBV9(-) TCR revealed that, as a result of distinct TCR docking modes, the HLA-DQ8-glia-alpha1 contacts mediated by the CDR3-encoded arginine were almost identical between TRBV9(+) and TRBV9(-) TCRs. In all cases, this interaction centered on two hydrogen bonds with a specific serine residue in the bound peptide. Replacement of serine with alanine at this position abrogated TRBV9(+) and TRBV9(-) clonal T cell proliferation in response to HLA-DQ8-glia-alpha1. Gluten-specific memory CD4(+) T cells with structurally and functionally conserved TCRs therefore predominate in the disease-affected tissue of patients with HLA-DQ8-mediated CD.},

   abstract = {Although many people have symptoms of celiac disease, it can take a while to diagnose. Villous atrophy may be present long before any gastrointestinal symptoms. An important point to acknowledge is that celiac disease could be identified earlier in some women with a positive family history. The disease also could be the cause of some women's reproductive problems. Primary care providers, using comprehensive history taking, are in the unique position to identify individuals who may have celiac disease, assist women in gaining knowledge about a gluten-free diet, order diagnostic testing, and refer to a gastroenterologist. The positive change in fertility with a simultaneous improvement of nutrient deficiencies shortly after adopting a gluten-free diet indicates a possible link between such nutrients and sex hormone function. High levels of homocysteine, which can negatively impact fertility, have also been linked to individuals with problems, such as celiac disease, that decrease vitamin B12 absorption. The purpose of this article is to review the literature and the evidence-based care guidelines for comprehensive screening, diagnostics, and pathophysiology of celiac disease, with a specific focus on the female reproductive system, anemia management, and gluten-free diet integration.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate quality of life (QoL) and glycemic control in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease vs T1D only. We hypothesized that QoL scores would be lower in youth with T1D and celiac disease and those nonadherent to the gluten-free diet (GFD). STUDY DESIGN: This case control study included 35 youth with T1D and 35 with T1D and celiac disease matched for age, sex, diabetes duration, and hemoglobin A1c level. QoL was assessed in participants and parents using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Generic Core Scale, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Diabetes Module. and the General Well-Being Scale; youth with T1D and celiac disease also completed the celiac disease-specific DUX questionnaire and parents completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Family Impact Scale. Questionnaires were scored from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate better QoL or well-being. Scores were compared between T1D vs T1D with celiac disease, with subgroup analysis by GFD adherence vs nonadherence and therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs multiple daily injections). RESULTS: Youth with T1D and celiac disease reported similar generic and diabetes-specific QoL to T1D only. GFD nonadherent vs adherent youth reported lower diabetes-specific QoL (mean score 58 vs 75, P = .003) and lower general well-being (57 vs 76, P = .02), as did their parents (50 vs 72, P = .006), and hemoglobin A1c was higher (9.6% vs 8.0%, P = .02). Youth with T1D and celiac disease using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs multiple daily injections had similar generic and diabetes-specific QoL and A1C (8.6 vs 8.2%, P = .44), but were less happy having to follow a lifelong diet (59 vs 29, P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Youth with T1D and celiac disease who do not adhere to the GFD have lower QoL and worse glycemic control. Novel strategies are required to understand and improve adherence in those with both conditions.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a common lifelong food intolerance triggered by dietary gluten affecting 1% of the general population. Gliadin-specific T-cell lines and T-cell clones obtained from intestinal biopsies have provided great support in the investigation of immuno-pathogenesis of CD. In the early 2000 a new in vivo, less invasive, approach was established aimed to evaluate the adaptive gliadin-specific T-cell response in peripheral blood of celiac patients on a gluten free diet. In fact, it has been demonstrated that three days of ingestion of wheat-containing food induces the mobilization of memory T lymphocytes reactive against gliadin from gut-associated lymphoid tissue into peripheral blood of CD patients. Such antigen-specific T-cells releasing interferon-gamma can be transiently detected by using the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays or by flow cytometry tetramer technology. This paper discusses the suitability of this in vivo tool to investigate the repertoire of gluten pathogenic peptides, to support CD diagnosis, and to assess the efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies. A systematic review of all potential applications of short oral gluten challenge is provided.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was the setting up of a gluten-free sourdough from selected lactobacilli and yeasts isolated from a traditional wheat-based Type I sourdough. A gluten-free matrix was inoculated with Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and Candida humilis, fermented to pH 4.0, and constantly propagated for ten times. A stable association between micro-organisms was observed from the second refreshment with mean values of 9.08 +/- 0.25 log CFU g(-1) for lactobacilli and 7.81 +/- 0.07 log CFU g(-1) for yeasts. In order to have a good workability of the dough, a 230 BU consistency was considered. Rheofermentographic indices remained constant over the ten refreshments, showing an average value of 23.2 mm dough height in about 7.5 h. The CO2 production and retention volumes reached average values of 1430 and 1238 ml respectively. The microbiological and technological data obtained highlighted that a GF sourdough was effectively developed. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Type I sourdough has a long tradition as a leavening agent of baked goods as its use results in an improved texture, flavour, taste and extended shelf-life of the final products. In this study a Type I gluten-free sourdough was obtained. After few refreshments in controlled conditions, the sourdough presented a stable association between Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and Candida humilis, constant fermentation times and technological properties (in terms of dough consistency, dough maximum height, CO2 production and retention). The results showed that the gluten-free sourdough developed in this study can improve the overall quality of gluten-free baked products.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease induced by an autoimmune reaction to indigested gluten, which occurs in genetically predisposed population. The etiology of CD is linked to innate and adaptive immunity, mostly mediated by lymphocytes, especially T cells, infiltrating into the small intestinal wall. The subpopulations of T cells that infiltrate inflamed intestinal tissues comprise various CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. The plethora of T cell subtypes activated in CD leads to simultaneous activation of different signaling cascades including GATA1, NF-kB, JAK or STAT5 the activity of which may be modified by diet or drugs. It was recently showed that food allergens may accelerate CD by altering the interaction between IL-15 and CD4+ T cells in the activation of CD8+ T cells. Increased levels of cytokines like IL-15 are considered to play a role in CD development. Furthermore it was showed that some drugs like tofacitinib or ruxolitinib may influence CD by blocking IL-15 signaling and CD8+ T cell activity. This mini-review will summarize the current knowledge on the role of CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell in clinical and experimental CD and will describe how T cell-activated signaling pathways and locally released proteins may be influenced by dietary factors and drugs used in CD treatment.},

   abstract = {The association between food allergy and celiac disease (CD) is still to be clarified. We screened for CD 319 patients with severe food allergy (IgE > 85 kU/l against food proteins and a history of severe allergic reactions) who underwent specific food oral immunotherapy (OIT), together with 128 children with mild allergy who recovered without OIT, and compared the prevalence data with our historical data regarding healthy schoolchildren. Sixteen patients (5%) with severe allergy and one (0.8%) with mild allergy tested positive for both genetic and serological CD markers, while the prevalence among the schoolchildren was 1%. Intestinal biopsies were obtained in 13/16 patients with severe allergy and in the one with mild allergy, confirming the diagnosis of CD. Sufferers from severe food allergy seem to be at a fivefold increased risk of CD. Our findings suggest that routine screening for CD should be recommended in patients with severe food allergy.},

   abstract = {Regulation of gut motility is complex and involves neuromuscular, immune and environmental mechanisms. It is well established that patients with celiac disease (CD) often display gut dysmotility. Studies have shown the presence of disturbed esophageal motility, altered gastric emptying, and dysmotility of the small intestine, gallbladder and colon in untreated CD. Most of these motor abnormalities resolve after a strict gluten-free diet, suggesting that mechanisms related to the inflammatory condition and disease process are responsible for the motor dysfunction. Motility abnormalities are also a hallmark of functional bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), where it has been proposed as underlying mechanism for symptom generation (diarrhea, constipation, bloating). Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a poorly defined entity, mostly self-diagnosed, that presents clinically with IBS symptoms in the absence of specific celiac markers. Patients with NCGS are believed to react symptomatically to wheat components, and some studies have proposed the presence of low-grade inflammation in these patients. There is little information regarding the functional characterization of these patients before and after a gluten-free diet. A study suggested the presence of altered gastrointestinal transit in NCGS patients who also have a high prevalence of nonspecific anti-gliadin antibodies. Results of an ongoing clinical study in NCGS patients with positive anti-gliadin antibodies before and after a gluten-free diet will be discussed. Elucidating the mechanisms for symptom generation in NCGS patients is important to find new therapeutic alternatives to the burden of imposing a strict gluten-free diet in patients who do not have CD.},

   abstract = {Case finding for celiac disease (CD) is becoming increasingly common practice and is conducted in a wide range of clinical situations ranging from the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms to failure to thrive in children, prolonged fatigue, unexpected weight loss and anemia. Case finding is also performed in associated conditions, such as autoimmune thyroid disease, dermatitis herpetiformis and type 1 diabetes, as well as in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, unexplained neuropsychiatric disorders and first-degree relatives of patients with diagnosed CD. This aggressive active case finding has dramatically changed the clinical characteristics of newly diagnosed patients. For instance, higher numbers of patients who present with extraintestinal symptoms are now being diagnosed with CD. Current recommendations state that due to a high risk for complications if the disease remains undiagnosed, patients with extraintestinal symptoms due to CD require appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Despite criticism regarding the cost-effectiveness of case finding in CD, such an aggressive approach has been considered cost-effective for high-risk patients. The diagnosis of CD among patients with extraintestinal symptoms requires a high degree of awareness of the clinical conditions that carry a high risk for underlying CD. Also, understanding the correct use of specific serology and duodenal histology is key for an appropriate diagnostic approach. Both procedures combined are able to confirm diagnosis in the vast majority of cases. However, in certain circumstances, serology and even duodenal histology cannot confirm or rule out CD. A common cause of negative IgA serology is IgA deficiency. For such eventuality, IgG-based serological tests can help confirm the diagnosis. Importantly, some histologically diagnosed cases still remain seronegative despite exclusion of IgA deficiency. On the other hand, duodenal histology may be normal despite the presence of CD-specific antibodies and active CD. This has been clearly demonstrated in some cases of untreated dermatitis herpetiformis, but may also be due to the patchy condition of CD or lesions that are not adequately recognized by nonexpert endoscopists and/or pathologists. The effectiveness of agluten-free diet depends on the clinical end point addressed. A good example is the outcome of bone loss. While risk for fracture normalizes after the first year of dietary treatment, bone parameters measured by densitometry may not be normalized in the long-term follow-up. Moreover, it is still unclear how far an early gluten-free diet will positively affect associated autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroiditis.},

   abstract = {Background/Aim. Reflux symptoms (RS) are common in patients with celiac disease (CD), a chronic enteropathy that affects primarily the small intestine. We evaluated mucosal integrity and motility of the lower esophagus as mechanisms contributing to RS generation in patients with CD. Methods. We enrolled newly diagnosed CD patients with and without RS, nonceliac patients with classical reflux disease (GERD), and controls (without RS). Endoscopic biopsies from the distal esophagus were assessed for dilated intercellular space (DIS) by light microscopy and electron microscopy. Tight junction (TJ) mRNA proteins expression for zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-2 and claudin-3 (CLDN-2; CLDN-3) was determined using qRT-PCR. Results. DIS scores were higher in patients with active CD than in controls, but similar to GERD patients. The altered DIS was found even in CD patients without RS and normalized after one year of a gluten-free diet. CD patients with and without RS had lower expression of ZO-1 than controls. The expression of CLDN-2 and CLDN-3 was similar in CD and GERD patients. Conclusions. Our study shows that patients with active CD have altered esophageal mucosal integrity, independently of the presence of RS. The altered expression of ZO-1 may underlie loss of TJ integrity in the esophageal mucosa and may contribute to RS generation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously shown a reduction of gastrointestinal symptoms after the oral administration of Bifidobacterium infantis Natren Life Start super strain (NLS-SS) in untreated celiac disease (CD) patients. The symptomatic improvement was not associated with changes in intestinal permeability or serum levels of cytokines, chemokines, or growth factors. Therefore, we hypothesized that the beneficial symptomatic effect observed previously in patients with CD treated with B. infantis may be related to the modulation of innate immunity. GOALS: To investigate the potential mechanisms of a probiotic B. infantis Natren Life Start super strain on the mucosal expression of innate immune markers in adult patients with active untreated CD compared with those treated with B. infantisx6 weeks and after 1 year of gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Numbers of macrophages and Paneth cells and alpha-defensin-5 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry in duodenal biopsies. RESULTS: We showed that GFD decreases duodenal macrophage counts in CD patients more effectively than B. infantis. In contrast, B. infantis decreases Paneth cell counts and expression of alpha-defensin-5 in CD (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results identify differential innate immune effects of treatment with B. infantis compared with 1 year of GFD. Further studies are needed to investigate synergistic effects of GFD and B. infantis supplementation in CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease affects 1% of the North American population, with an estimated 350,000 Canadians diagnosed with this condition. The disease is triggered by the ingestion of gluten, and a lifelong, strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only currently available treatment. Compliance with a strict GFD is essential not only for intestinal mucosal recovery and alleviation of symptoms, but also for the prevention of complications such as anemia, osteoporotic fractures and small bowel lymphoma. However, a GFD is difficult to follow, socially inconvenient and expensive. Different approaches, such as tax reduction, cash transfer, food provision, prescription and subsidy, have been used to reduce the additional costs of the GFD to patients with celiac disease. The current review showed that the systems in place exhibit particular advantages and disadvantages in relation to promoting uptake and compliance with GFD. The tax offset system used in Canada for GFD coverage takes the form of a reimbursement of a cost previously incurred. Hence, the program does not help celiac patients meet the incremental cost of the GFD - it simply provides some future refund of that cost. An ideal balanced approach would involve subsidizing gluten-free products through controlled vouchers or direct food provision to those who most need it, independently of 'ability or willingness to pay'. Moreover, if the cost of such a program is inhibitive, the value of the benefits could be made taxable to ensure that any patient contribution, in terms of additional taxation, is directly related to ability to pay. The limited coverage of GFD in Canada is concerning. There is an unmet need for GFD among celiac patients in Canada. More efforts are required by the Canadian medical community and the Canadian Celiac Association to act as agents in identifying ways of improving resource allocation in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence regarding the effect of time of gluten introduction and breastfeeding on the risk of developing celiac disease (CD). STUDY DESIGN: We included randomized controlled trials and observational studies evaluating the proper timing for introducing gluten to the infant diet, the appropriate quantity of gluten consumption at weaning, and the effect of breastfeeding on CD risk. Studies were located through the electronic databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE). Two independent authors collected the data. RESULTS: A total of 1982 studies were identified, 15 of which were eligible for data extraction. A meta-analysis was performed on 2 randomized controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, and 1 case-control study. There was a 25% increase in CD risk with late (>6 months) vs recommended (4-6 months) gluten introduction (risk ratio [RR], 1.25; 95% CI, 1.08-1.45). There was no significant effect of breastfeeding vs no breastfeeding on CD risk (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.28-1.10), with substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 92%) among studies. CONCLUSION: There is currently no evidence to support that early introduction of gluten to the infant diet increases the risk of CD; however, late introduction of gluten may be associated with increased risk of CD. More studies are needed that control for potential confounders and that evaluate environmental factors in low-risk families.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The intestinal stem cells (ISC) modulation and the role of circulating hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in coeliac disease (CD) are poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate the longitudinal modifications in peripheral blood HSC traffic and putative ISC density induced by gluten-free diet (GFD) in CD. METHODS: Thirty-one CD patients and 7 controls were enrolled. Circulating CD133(+) and CD34(+) HSC were measured by flow cytometry, at enrolment and after 7 days and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of GFD. Endoscopy was performed at diagnosis and repeated at 6, 12, and 24 months following GFD. We used the Marsh-Oberhuber score to evaluate the histological severity of duodenal damage; immunohistochemistry was employed to measure the intraepithelial lymphoid infiltrate (IEL, CD3(+) lymphoid cells) and the putative ISC compartment (CD133(+) and Lgr5(+) epithelial cells). RESULTS: At enrolment, circulating HSCs were significantly increased in CD patients and they further augmented during the first week of GFD, but progressively decreased afterwards. CD patients presented with villous atrophy, abundant IEL and rare ISC residing at the crypt base. Upon GFD, IEL progressively decreased, while ISC density increased, peaking at 12 months. After 24 months of GFD, all patients were asymptomatic and their duodenal mucosa was macroscopically and histologically normal. CONCLUSIONS: In active CD patients, the ISC niche is depleted and there is an increased traffic of circulating HSC versus non-coeliac subjects. GFD induces a precocious mobilization of circulating HSC, which is followed by the expansion of the local ISC compartment, leading to mucosal healing and clinical remission.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common, lifelong autoimmune disorder for which dietary control is the only accepted form of therapy. A strict gluten-free diet is burdensome to patients and can be limited in efficacy, indicating there is an unmet need for novel therapeutic approaches to supplement or supplant dietary therapy. Many molecular events required for disease pathogenesis have been recently characterized and inspire most current and emerging drug-discovery efforts. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) confirm the importance of human leukocyte antigen genes in our pathogenic model and identify a number of new risk loci in this complex disease. Here, we review the status of both emerging and potential therapeutic strategies in the context of disease pathophysiology. We conclude with a discussion of how genes identified during GWAS and follow-up studies that enhance susceptibility may offer insight into developing novel therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alveolar hemorrhage is a potentially life-threatening condition which is usually managed by the pulmonologist. When considering its etiology, there is a rare association that sets the disease into the hands of the gastroenterologist. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 48 year-old female who was admitted to the intensive care unit for severe anemia and hemoptysis. On imaging, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of alveolar hemorrhage were detected and a diagnosis of pulmonary hemosiderosis was made. She received cortisone therapy and hematologic correction of anemia, with slow recovery. In search of an etiology for the pulmonary hemosiderosis, an extensive workup was done, and celiac disease specific serology was found positive. After confirmation of celiac disease by biopsy, a diagnosis of Lane-Hamilton syndrome was established. The patient was recommended a gluten-free diet and at 6 months follow-up, resolution of anemia and pulmonary infiltrates were observed. CONCLUSION: Although the association is rare, celiac disease should be considered in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis. In our case, severe anemia and alveolar infiltrates markedly improved with glucocorticoids and gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated intolerance to dietary gluten, affecting genetically predisposed individuals. ELISA-based serological tests help to decide if further duodenal biopsy is necessary, for this the diagnostic kits have to be accurate, specific, and sensible. In this study, we investigate the performance of an ELISA that uses the purified cross-linked complex of tissue transglutaminase and gliadin, referred as the "neoepitope" (AESKULISA(R) tTG New Generation), as antigen. METHODS: We evaluated 41 newly diagnosed celiac patients, 18 celiac patients on gluten-free diet, and 169 controls, comprising healthy subjects, patients affected by other autoimmune diseases, and patients affected by several non-autoimmune diseases. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The assay has an excellent performance. Due to its high level of diagnostic accuracy, this assay constitutes a new approach for the screening of celiac patients not only for the diagnosis of CD, but also for monitoring patients on gluten-free diet and their compliance. Moreover, cases of neoepitope-positive subjects who were tested negative with "classical" serological markers could have a predictive value for this pathology. This aspect will require further studies of elaboration.},

   abstract = {Gluten-containing cereals are a main food staple present in the daily human diet, including wheat, barley, and rye. Gluten intake is associated with the development of celiac disease (CD) and related disorders such as diabetes mellitus type I, depression, and schizophrenia. However, until now, there is no consent about the possible deleterious effects of gluten intake because of often failing symptoms even in persons with proven CD. Asymptomatic CD (ACD) is present in the majority of affected patients and is characterized by the absence of classical gluten-intolerance signs, such as diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain. Nevertheless, these individuals very often develop diseases that can be related with gluten intake. Gluten can be degraded into several morphine-like substances, named gluten exorphins. These compounds have proven opioid effects and could mask the deleterious effects of gluten protein on gastrointestinal lining and function. Here we describe a putative mechanism, explaining how gluten could "mask" its own toxicity by exorphins that are produced through gluten protein digestion.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of celiac disease(CED) on the upper-gut motility and release of enteral hormones (ghrelin and pancreatic peptide (PP)). MATERIALS AND METHODS: the study included 25 patients diagnosed with CED and 30 healthy controls. Gastric myoelectric activities (EGG) in a fasted and fed state were recorded. The plasma concentrations of ghrelin and PP were determined. R e s u l t s: CED patients presented in a fasted state a decreased percentage of normogastria 54.8 +/- 24.5 vs. 86 +/- 12.3%, p = 0.02 and slow wave coupling (SWC) 52.7 +/- 13.4 vs. 77.4 +/- 11.9%; p = 0.00001 with increased dominant power (DP) 11.6 +/- 1.5 vs. 11.1 +/- 1.1. Contrary to the controls, they did not show an improvement in the percentage of normogastria, DP and SWC when examined in a fed state (p 0.05). Furthermore, CED patients presented with significantly lower fasting plasma concentrations of ghrelin 156.8 +/- 86.7 vs. 260.2 +/- 87.6 pg/ml, p = 0.0002 and significantly higher fasting PP levels than did the controls 265.2 +/- 306.3 vs. 54.1 +/- 54.6 pg/ml, p = 0.0005. C o n c l u s i o n: CED affects gastric myoelectric activity (decreasing normogastria and coupling) and causes changes in fasting concentrations of enteral hormones (decrease in ghrelin and an increase in PP). Gastric myoelectric response to food is abolished in CED patients, probably due to the neurohormonal changes induced by primary inflammation associated with this disease.},

There is sparse data on the seroprevalence of immunoglobulin A (IgA) transglutaminase (tTG) in T1D patients of South Indian origin. AIMS: To detect the prevalence of IgA tTG in T1D patients of South Indian origin. To evaluate the relation between the presence of autoimmunity and metabolic control and complications of diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 258 T1D patients. All the patients were subjected to biochemical tests and evaluated for microvascular complications. IgA tTG was estimated by ELISA. IgA tTG levels >40 AU/ml was considered positive. RESULTS: Of the 258 participants, 12 (4.65%) were found to be positive for IgA tTG antibodies. Distribution of IgA positivity was equal in both sexes. There was a significant negative correlation of IgA tTG positivity with hemoglobin and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). CONCLUSIONS: The seropositivity of CD in South Indian patients with T1D has been observed to be 4.68%. This is much lower compared to studies from North India. This can be explained by both the genetic and dietary factors. The seropositivity correlated negatively with hemoglobin and HbA1c.},

Although several Bifidobacterium strains showed anti-inflammatory activity and prevention of toxic gliadin peptides generation in vitro, few data are available on their efficacy when administered to CD subjects. This study evaluated the effect of administration for three months of a food supplement based on two Bifidobacterium breve strains (B632 and BR03) to restore the gut microbial balance in coeliac children on a gluten free diet (GFD). Microbial DNA was extracted from faeces of 40 coeliac children before and after probiotic or placebo administration and 16 healthy children (Control group). Sequencing of the amplified V3-V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene as well as qPCR of Bidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis group Clostridiumsensu stricto and enterobacteria were performed. The comparison between CD subjects and Control group revealed an alteration in the intestinal microbial composition of coeliacs mainly characterized by a reduction of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, of Actinobacteria and Euryarchaeota. Regarding the effects of the probiotic, an increase of Actinobacteria was found as well as a re-establishment of the physiological Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Therefore, a three-month administration of B. breve strains helps in restoring the healthy percentage of main microbial components.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to determine whether psychological well-being and weight-teasing history of young adults with bowel conditions (i.e. coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome) differed from those without bowel conditions. METHODS: Young adults (aged 18-26 years) completed an online survey that collected demographic information and assessed psychological well-being (mentally and physically unhealthy days, self-esteem, and depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder severity) and weight-teasing history (Perception of Teasing Scale). Each bowel condition participant (cases = 135) was matched to four healthy participants (controls = 504) based on sex and body mass index (BMI) (+/-0.50 BMI units). Conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted and odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were presented for all measures and demographics. RESULTS: Cases were significantly more likely to have poorer overall psychological well-being. Specifically, cases were significantly (P </= 0.05) more likely to have more mentally and physical unhealthy days, depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms than controls. Cases were also significantly more likely to recall being weight teased as a child (P = 0.02, OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.04-1.53) and being more upset from the weight-teasing insults (P = 0.006, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05-1.35) than controls. Cases were also more than 1.5 times more likely to be made fun of (P = 0.03, OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.09-2.43) or laughed at (P = 0.01, OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.15-2.73) because of their weight than controls. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that healthcare providers should monitor the psychological well-being of young adults with bowel conditions and incorporate opportunities for them to develop skills and strategies for coping.},

The diagnosis of CD was based on the revised ESPGHAN criteria and CC on acute worsening and rapid progression of chronic diarrhea and vomiting followed by severe dehydration, multiple metabolic derangements and a marked decrease of body weight. RESULTS: Celiac crisis was confirmed in six (1.63 %) children, five in the first and one in the second year of life. In three patients CC was precipitated by rotavirus and in one by Salmonella enteritidis infection, while in the remaining two, except for a too long-standing disease and severe malnutrition, no additional causes of CC were found. CONCLUSION: Celiac crisis in Serbia is still-present in children exclusively below the second year of life as a spontaneous or intestinal infection precipitated complication of previously unrecognized CD.},

   abstract = {The avoidance of wheat, gluten and other cereal products is a growing phenomenon in industrialized countries. The diagnostic criteria of celiac disease and of food allergy to wheat flour and/or other cereals are clearly defined. Only about 0.5-25 % of the population are affected from both of these immunological diseases.Nevertheless, there exists a significantly greater proportion of people reporting at least subjectively significant complaints and quality of life improvements after switching to a wheat- or gluten-free diet. Celiac disease or wheat allergy cannot be detected in these individuals on the basis of established criteria. The absence of clear diagnostic autoimmune or allergic criteria in these wheat sensitive patients has resulted in the description of non-celiac gluten sensitivity.It is clinically detectable in only very few individuals and may manifest with either intestinal, extra-intestinal or neurovegetative and psychosomatic symptoms, respectively. However, non-celiac disease gluten sensitivity has to be differentiated critically from irritable bowel syndrome, carbohydrate malassimilation, postinfectious conditions and psychosomatic diseases.Pathophysiologically, non-celiac disease gluten sensitivity is still poorly characterized; several non-immunological mechanisms are discussed to contribute to non-celiac gluten sensitivity. These include the effects of fructo- and galacto-oligosaccharides, of trypsin inhibitors of amylase, and wheat lectin agglutinins, which may influence or modulate intestinal permeability and/or a non-specific immune or effector cell degranulation within the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, further metabolic effects with direct or indirect influence on the intestinal flora are currently discussed.In addition to subjectively reported changes in symptoms that may affect variably intestinal, as well as extra-intestinal and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms, some studies suggest that there is little reproducibility of complaints from gluten exposure. For a definitive diagnosis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, structured (blinded) challenge tests with wheat or gluten are mandatory as well as re-challenge after a defined time of gluten avoidance to establish non-celiac disease gluten sensitivity as a persistent disease entity.},

   abstract = {Background. The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition endorses serological diagnosis (SD) for pediatric celiac disease (CD). The objective of this study was to pilot SD and to prospectively evaluate gastrointestinal permeability and mucosal inflammation at diagnosis and after one year on the gluten-free diet (GFD). We hypothesized that SD would be associated with similar short term outcomes as ED. Method. Children, 3-17 years of age, referred for possible CD were eligible for SD given aTTG level >/=200 U/mL, confirmed by repeat aTTG and HLA haplotypes. Gastrointestinal permeability, assessed using sugar probes, and inflammation, assessed using fecal calprotectin (FC), at baseline and after one year on a GFD were compared to patients who had ED. Results. Enrolled SD (n = 40) and ED (n = 48) patients had similar demographics. ED and SD groups were not different in baseline lactulose: mannitol ratio (L : M) (0.049 versus 0.034; p = 0.07), fractional excretion of sucrose (%FES; 0.086 versus 0.092; p = 0.44), or fecal calprotectin (FC; 89.6 versus 51.4; p = 0.05). At follow-up, urine permeability improved and was similar between groups, L : M (0.022 versus 0.025; p = 0.55) and %FES (0.040 versus 0.047; p = 0.87) (p > 0.05). FC improved but remained higher in the SD group (37.1 versus 15.9; p = 0.04). Conclusion. Patients on the GFD showed improved intestinal permeability and mucosal inflammation regardless of diagnostic strategy. This prospective study supports that children diagnosed by SD have resolving mucosal disease early after commencing a GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: While adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) is essential for effective control of celiac disease, the level of adherence to GFD may vary. We assessed the level of adherence to GFD and identified barriers to adherence in patients with celiac disease. METHODS: Both treatment-naive and follow up patients with celiac disease were recruited from a celiac disease clinic. All the patients were assessed for symptom improvement using celiac symptom index (CSI), weight, and hemoglobin; adherence to GFD using detailed dietary history and food-labeled quiz questionnaire; identification of barriers to GFD using a self-administered 36-point questionnaire; and quality of life using a standard 36-item short form (SF36) questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the patients who were already on GFD, only 53.3% maintained an excellent or good level of adherence, which increased to 92.4% at 6 months with repeated counseling. Among the treatment-naive patients, 64.8% maintained either excellent or good compliance at 1 month after first counseling, which increased to 96.3% at 6 months with repeated counseling. The most common barrier to adherence was non-availability of GFD. Certain barriers could be modified with repeated counseling and education. Response to GFD, as measured by CSI, gain in weight, and improvement in hemoglobin, was better in those having either excellent or good compliance to GFD compared to those who remained poorly adherent. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated counseling increased the level of adherence to GFD.},

   abstract = {Gluten proteins in wheat, rye and barley cause celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine, which affects approximately 1% of the world population. Gluten is comprised of prolamin and glutelin. Since avoidance of dietary gluten is the only option for celiac patients, a sensitive gluten detection and quantitation method is warranted. Most regulatory agencies have set a threshold of 20 ppm gluten in foods labeled gluten-free, based on the currently available ELISA methods. However, these methods may exhibit differences in gluten quantitation from different gluten-containing grains. In this study, prolamin and glutelin fractions were isolated from wheat, rye, barley, oats and corn. Intact and pepsin-trypsin (PT)-digested prolamin and glutelin fractions were used to assess their immunoreactivity and gluten recovery by three sandwich and two competitive ELISA kits. The Western blots revealed varied affinity of ELISA antibodies to gluten-containing grain proteins and no reactivity to oat and corn proteins. ELISA results showed considerable variation in gluten recoveries from both intact and PT-digested gluten fractions among different kits. Prolamin fractions showed higher gluten recovery compared to their respective glutelin fractions. Among prolamins, barley exhibited higher recovery compared to wheat and rye with most of the ELISA kits used. Hydrolysis resulted in reduced gluten recovery of most gluten fractions. These results suggest that the suitability of ELISA for accurate gluten quantitation is dependent upon various factors, such as grain source, antibody specificity, gluten proteins and the level of their hydrolysis in foods.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although celiac disease (CeD) affects 1% of people in the northern part of India, it is believed to be uncommon in the southern and northeastern parts because of significant differences in dietary pattern and ethnicity. We estimated the prevalence of CeD in these three populations. In a subset, we also investigated differences in the prevalence of HLA-DQ 2/8 allelotype and dietary grain consumption. METHODS: A total of 23,331 healthy adults were sampled from three regions of India-northern (n=6207), northeastern (n=8149), and southern (n=8973)-and screened for CeD using IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody. Positive tests were reconfirmed using a second ELISA. CeD was diagnosed if the second test was positive and these participants were further investigated. A subsample of participants was tested for HLA-DQ2/-DQ8 and underwent detailed dietary evaluation. RESULTS: Age-adjusted prevalence of celiac autoantibodies was 1.23% in northern, 0.87% in northeastern, and 0.10% in southern India (P<0.0001). Prevalence of CeD and latent CeD, respectively, was 8.53/1,000 and 3.70/1,000 in northern, 4.66/1,000 and 3.92/1,000 in northeastern, and 0.11/1,000 and 1.22/1,000 in the southern part. The population prevalence of genes determining HLA-DQ2 and/or -DQ8 expression was 38.1% in northern, 31.4% in northeastern, and 36.4% in southern India. Mean daily wheat intake was highest in northern (455 g) compared with northeastern (37 g) or southern part (25 g), whereas daily rice intake showed an inverse pattern. CONCLUSIONS: CeD and latent CeD were most prevalent in northern India and were the least in southern India. The prevalence correlated with wheat intake and did not reflect differences in the genetic background.},

OBJECTIVE: To study the adherence to a gluten-free diet of Mexican individuals with celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity at the time of their first medical and nutritional consultation at a tertiary referral center. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed. A specific questionnaire was used to gather information on demographics, clinical condition, and self-reported adherence to a gluten-free diet, and to determine strict compliance and intentional or inadvertent gluten consumption. All questionnaires were applied by a nutritionist with expertise in gluten-related disorders. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with celiac disease and 24 with non-celiac gluten sensitivity were included. Overall, 46 (57.5%) subjects perceived themselves as strictly adherent; however, inadvertent gluten intake was frequent in both celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity patients (39.2 vs. 33.3%; p = 0.2). Intentional consumption was more prevalent in subjects with celiac disease (48.8 vs. 29.1%; p = 0.048) and individuals with non-celiac gluten sensitivity showed better adherence (37.5 vs. 12.5%; p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The importance of a gluten-free diet is underestimated by Mexican patients with celiac disease. The role of a team with expertise in gluten-related disorders is essential to identify inadvertent gluten intake.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) has been reported in a number of patients with celiac disease (CD), it is not clear if this is primarily a functional or a structural defect. We studied pancreatic structural abnormalities by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in adult CD patients with EPI. METHODS: Pancreatic exocrine function was prospectively assessed in 36 recently diagnosed CD patients (mean age: 29.8 years) by measuring fecal elastase. Pancreatic structural changes were assessed in CD patients with EPI by EUS and elastography. Exocrine functions were reassessed after 3 months of gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Of the 36 CD patients included, 30 (83%) had anemia, 21 (58%) diarrhea, and 7 (19%) hypothyroidism. Ten (28%) patients had EPI with mean elastase levels of 141.6 mug/g of stool, of whom only one had a history of recurrent acute pancreatitis while the rest 9 patients had no history of acute or chronic pancreatitis. Of these 10 patients, 8 (80%) had diarrhea, 8 (80%) anemia, and 2 (20%) hypothyroidism. EUS was done in 8 patients which showed: normal pancreas in 5 (50%), hyperechoic strands in 3 (30%), and hyperechoic foci without shadowing in 2 (20%) patients. None had lobularity or parenchymal calcification. All patients except the patient with recurrent pancreatitis had normal strain ratio. Follow-up fecal elastase was within normal range in 6 of 7 (86%) patients. CONCLUSION: EPI, assessed by fecal elastase levels in adult CD patients, possibly does not relate to structural alterations in the pancreatic parenchyma and may be reversible by following a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disease characterized by permanent gastrointestinal tract sensitivity to gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. It has varied clinical manifestations, ranging from gastrointestinal to extraintestinal, including neurological, skin, reproductive and psychiatric symptoms, which makes its diagnosis difficult and challenging. Known neurological manifestations of CD include epilepsy with or without occipital calcification, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and ataxia, headache, neuropathies and behavior disorders. We present the case of a 14-year-old female with headaches and blurred vision for 1 year; she was noted to have papilledema on ophthalmic examination with increased cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure on lumber puncture and was diagnosed as a case of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC). Meanwhile her workup for chronic constipation revealed elevated tissue transglutaminase IgA and antiendomysial IgA antibodies. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CD. The patient was started on a gluten-free diet, leading to resolution of not only gastrointestinal symptoms but also to almost complete resolution of symptoms of PTC. This report describes the correlation of CD and PTC as its neurological manifestation.},

SOURCES OF INFORMATION: MEDLINE was searched from 2000 to 2015 for English-language guidelines on the diagnosis and management of CD published by professional gastroenterological organizations. MAIN MESSAGE: To screen patients for CD, measurement of the immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase antibody is the preferred test. Total serum IgA level should be measured to exclude selective IgA deficiency and to avoid false-negative test results. Patients with positive serologic test results should be referred to a gastroenterologist for endoscopic small intestinal biopsies to confirm the diagnosis. Testing for human leukocyte antigens DQ2 and DQ8 can help exclude the diagnosis. A gluten-free diet should not be started before confirming the diagnosis of CD. CONCLUSION: Serologic testing is very useful for screening patients with suspected CD. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent complications of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Isotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid) is a metabolite of vitamin A and has anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects; however, a recent publication by DePaolo et al. demonstrated that in the presence of IL-15, retinoic acid can act as an adjuvant and promote inflammation against dietary proteins. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of overt and latent celiac disease (CD) among users of isotretinoin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medical records of patients from 1995 to 2011 who had a mention of isotretinoin in their records (N = 8393) were searched for CD diagnosis using ICD-09CM codes. Isotretinoin exposure was compared across overt CD patients and their age- and gender-matched controls from the same pool. To evaluate the risk of latent CD with isotretinoin exposure, patients were overlapped with a community-based list of patients with waste serum samples that were tested for CD serology, excluding those with overt CD (2006-2011). Isotretinoin exposure was defined as the use of isotretinoin prior to CD diagnosis or serology. RESULTS: Of 8393 patients, 25 had a confirmed CD diagnosis. Compared to matched controls (N = 75), isotretinoin exposure was not significantly different between overt CD patients versus controls (36% versus 39%, respectively; P = 0.712). Likewise, latent CD defined as positive serology was not statistically different between isotretinoin exposed (N = 506) versus non-exposed (N = 571) groups (1.8% versus 1.4%, respectively; P = 0.474). CONCLUSIONS: There was no association between isotretinoin use and risk of either overt or latent CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a common inflammatory disorder with a prevalence of 1-2 % in which a distinct dietary wheat, rye, and barley component, gluten, induces small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and inflammation. The small-bowel mucosal damage can be reversed by a strict lifelong gluten-free diet, which is currently the only effective treatment for the condition. A key player in the pathogenetic process leading to the enteropathy is played by a protein called transglutaminase 2 (TG2), which is able to enzymatically modify gluten-derived gliadin peptides. The TG2-catalyzed deamidation of the gliadin peptides results in their increased binding affinity to the disease-predisposing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 and DQ8 molecules, thus enabling a strong immune response to be launched. Blocking the enzymatic activity of TG2 has thus been suggested as a suitable novel pharmacological approach to treat celiac disease. By virtue of its transamidation capacity, TG2 is also able to cross-link gliadin peptides to itself, this resulting in the generation of TG2-gliadin peptide complexes whose presence might provide an explanation for the generation of the TG2 autoantibodies characteristic of celiac disease. Due to their excellent specificity for the disorder, the TG2-targeted autoantibodies are widely used in the diagnostics as a first-line test to select patients for gastrointestinal endoscopy. More recently, it has come to be appreciated that these autoantibodies and also the TG2-specific B cells might play an active role in the disease pathogenesis. In this review, we assess the role of TG2, TG2-specific B cells, and autoantibodies in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a common cause of chronic liver disease. Celiac disease alters intestinal permeability and treatment with a gluten-free diet often causes weight gain, but so far there are few reports of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with celiac disease. METHODS: Population-based cohort study. We compared the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosed from 1997 to 2009 in individuals with celiac disease (n = 26,816) to matched reference individuals (n = 130,051). Patients with any liver disease prior to celiac disease were excluded, as were individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol-related disorder to minimize misclassification of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Cox regression estimated hazard ratios for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were determined. RESULTS: During 246,559 person-years of follow-up, 53 individuals with celiac disease had a diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (21/100,000 person-years). In comparison, we identified 85 reference individuals diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease during 1,488,413 person-years (6/100,000 person-years). This corresponded to a hazard ratio of 2.8 (95% CI 2.0-3.8), with the highest risk estimates seen in children (HR = 4.6; 95% CI 2.3-9.1). The risk increase in the first year after celiac disease diagnosis was 13.3 (95% CI 3.5-50.3) but remained significantly elevated even beyond 15 years after the diagnosis of celiac disease (HR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.0-5.9). CONCLUSION: Individuals with celiac disease are at increased risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease compared to the general population. Excess risks were highest in the first year after celiac disease diagnosis, but persisted through 15 years after diagnosis with celiac disease.},

Although DH is mostly asymptomatic, all patients exhibit small bowel villous atrophy or at least coeliac-type inflammatory changes. Deposition of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the papillary dermis is a key diagnostic feature of DH. Epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) is the antigen for IgA deposited in the skin, and tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is the antigen for IgA deposited in the small bowel mucosa. Clinically silent, but immunologically active coeliac disease in the gut appears to result in IgA TG3 antibody complexes aggregated into DH skin. The prevalence of DH in northern Europe is high (30-75/100,000), but its incidence is decreasing, possibly due to increased recognition of subclinical coeliac disease. The rash and small bowel heal on a gluten-free diet, which is a life-long treatment. The risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is increased, but in patients with DH who adhere strictly to a gluten-free diet long-term prognosis is excellent.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is triggered by partially digested gluten proteins. Enzyme therapies that complete protein digestion in vivo could support a gluten-free diet, but the barrier to completeness is high. Current options require enzyme amounts on the same order as the protein meal itself. In this study, we evaluated proteolytic components of the carnivorous pitcher plant (Nepenthes spp.) for use in this context. Remarkably low doses enhance gliadin solubilization rates, and degrade gliadin slurries within the pH and temporal constraints of human gastric digestion. Potencies in excess of 1200:1 (substrate-to-enzyme) are achieved. Digestion generates small peptides through nepenthesin and neprosin, the latter a novel enzyme defining a previously-unknown class of prolyl endoprotease. The digests also exhibit reduced TG2 conversion rates in the immunogenic regions of gliadin, providing a twin mechanism for evading T-cell recognition. When sensitized and dosed with enzyme-treated gliadin, NOD/DQ8 mice did not show intestinal inflammation, when compared to mice challenged with only pepsin-treated gliadin. The low enzyme load needed for effective digestion suggests that gluten detoxification can be achieved in a meal setting, using metered dosing based on meal size. We demonstrate this by showing efficient antigen processing at total substrate-to-enzyme ratios exceeding 12,000:1.},

   abstract = {At present there is a degree of uncertainty regarding when, how and in what form gluten should be introduced into the infant diet. For years the recommendations of the ESPGHAN Committee on Nutrition have prevailed, which include avoiding early introduction, before 4 months, and late, after 7 months, and gradually introducing gluten into the diet while the infant is being breastfed, with the aim of reducing the risk of celiac disease, diabetes and gluten allergy. However, 2 independent studies published in The New England Journal of Medicine in October 2014 reached the conclusion that the age of introduction of gluten does not modify the risk of developing celiac disease, and that breastfeeding at any age does not confer protection against celiac disease development. On the other hand, according to available scientific evidence, the introduction of foods other than breast milk or formula into the infants diet is generally recommended around 6 months of age, since the introduction before 4 months could be associated with an increased risk of food allergy and autoimmune diseases, and delaying it beyond 7 months would not have a protective effect. In this context, a group of experts has considered it appropriate to produce a consensus document based on the current scientific evidence and present general recommendations for daily clinical practice on the introduction of gluten into the diet.},

The development and use of the Immunochip genotyping platform paved the way for the discovery of 39 non-HLA loci associated to CeD, and for follow-up functional genomics studies that pinpointed new disease genes, biological pathways and regulatory elements. By combining information from genetics with gene expression data, it has become clear that CeD is a disease with a dysregulated immune response, which can probably occur in a variety of immune cells. This type of information is crucial for our understanding of the disease and for providing leads for developing alternative therapies to the current gluten-free diet. In this review, we place these genetic findings in a wider context and suggest how they can assist the clinical care of CeD patients.},

RCD1 usually responds to a continued GFD, nutritional support, and therapeutic agents such as corticosteroids. In contrast, clinical response in RCD2 is incomplete and prognosis is often poor. RCD (particularly RCD2) is associated with serious complications, such as ulcerative jejunitis and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). Strict clinical and laboratory criteria should be used to diagnose RCD and specialized tests for aberrancy and clonality should be interpreted in the context of their sensitivity and specificity. Adequate nutritional support and anti-inflammatory treatment may even allow patients with RCD2 to attain a clinical remission.},

   abstract = {Gluten ataxia (GA) has customarily been considered to be the main neurological manifestation of celiac disease (CD). In recent years, the condition of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has been defined, which includes some patients who are not considered "true celiacs." We performed a comparative clinicopathological study of these three entities. We studied 31 GA, 48 CD and 37 NCGS patients, prospectively in the same center for a period of 7 years. The protocol study included two serological determinations for gluten sensitivity [anti-gliadin IgA and IgG (AGA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (TG) antibodies], HLA-DQ2 typing, and duodenal histological assessment. Demographics and investigative findings were compared. Females were 55 % in GA, 75 % in CD (p < 0.001), and 47 % in NCGS (N.S.). GA patients were older (59 +/- 14 years) than CD (43 +/- 13 years) and NCGS (41 +/- 8 years) groups (p < 0.001). AGA positivity was higher in GA (100 %) than in CD (48 %) groups (p < 0.001), but similar to NCGS patients (89 %; N.S.); TG positivity was lower in GA (3.2 %) than in CD (33.3 %; p < 0.001), but similar to NCGS (2.7 %; N.S.). DQ2 (+) was lower in GA (32.2 %) than in CD (89.6 %; p < 0.001), but similar to NCGS (29.7 %; N.S.). Lymphocytic enteritis (Marsh type 1) was lower in GA (9.6 %) than in CD (66.7 %; p < 0.001), but similar to NCGS (10.8 %; N.S.). The other gluten sensitivity-related characteristics measured were different to CD patients, but very close to NCGS. We conclude that GA patients are better classified within the NCGS group, than within CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) has a negative impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of affected patients. Although HRQL and its determinants have been examined in Spanish CD patients specifically recruited in hospital settings, these aspects of CD have not been assessed among the general Spanish population. METHODS: An observational, transversal study of a non-randomized, representative sample of adult celiac patients throughout all of Spain's Autonomous Regions. Subjects were recruited through celiac patient associations. A Spanish version of the self-administered Celiac Disease-Quality of Life (CD-QOL) questionnaire was used. Determinant factors of HRQL were assessed with the aid of multivariate analysis to control for confounding factors. RESULTS: We analyzed the responses provided by 1,230 patients, 1,092 (89.2%) of whom were women. The overall mean value for the CD-QOL index was 56.3 +/- 18.27 points. The dimension that obtained the most points was dysphoria, with 81.3 +/- 19.56 points, followed by limitations with 52.3 +/- 23.43 points; health problems, with 51.6 +/- 26.08 points, and inadequate treatment, with 36.1 +/- 21.18 points. Patient age and sex, along with time to diagnosis, and length of time on a gluten-free diet were all independent determinant factors of certain dimensions of HRQL: women aged 31 to 40 expressed poorer HRQL while time to diagnosis and length of time on a gluten-free diet were determinant factors for better HRQL scores. CONCLUSIONS: The HRQL of adult Spanish celiac subjects is moderate, improving with the length of time patients remain on a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether celiac disease (CD) associated with type 1 diabetes increases the risk of microvascular complications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (n = 56,514) aged >10 years with diabetes duration <20 years from 392 centers in Germany and Austria were assigned to one of three categories (n): no CD (50,933), biopsy-confirmed CD (812), or suspected CD (4,769; clinical diagnosis or positive antibodies). The confirmed and suspected groups were combined and analyzed for retinopathy or nephropathy. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for potential confounders (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], age at diabetes onset, sex, smoking, dyslipidemia, and hypertension). RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that retinopathy and nephropathy occurred earlier in the presence versus absence of CD: retinopathy at age 26.7 years (95% CI 23.7-30.2) in 25% of patients with CD vs. age 33.7 years (33.2-34.4) in 25% without CD and microalbuminuria at age 32.8 years (29.7-42.5) vs. 42.4 years (41.4-43.3). The adjusted risk for both retinopathy (hazard ratio 1.263 [95% CI 1.078-1.481]) and nephropathy (1.359 [1.228-1.504]) was higher in patients with diabetes and CD versus those without CD. Cox regression revealed CD as an independent risk factor for microvascular complications after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: CD is an independent risk factor for retinopathy and nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes. Our study therefore supports the recommendation for regular serologic testing for CD, even in the absence of clinical CD. Further prospective studies are required to investigate whether a gluten-free diet might reduce the risk of microvascular disorders in patients with diabetes and CD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Consumption of gluten proteins leads to an enteropathy characterised by lymphocytic infiltration of mucous membrane, crypts hypertrophy, and atrophy of villi. Enteropathy leads to disturbances in the immune system as well as secondary deficiency of vitamin E. AIM: Analysis of the concentration of vitamin E in erythrocytes of patients with celiac disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three experimental groups were distinguished among 77 patients with histologically confirmed celiac disease (mean age: 17 years): those who strictly respected gluten-free diet (group I, n = 48), patients breaking dietary recommendations (group II, n = 22), and those with newly diagnosed disease (group III, n = 7). Additionally, a control group consisting of healthy individuals with negative serological markers of celiac disease was formed (group IV, n = 20). Vitamin E concentration was determined by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detector. RESULTS: Significantly lower average concentration of vitamin E was demonstrated in erythrocytes in all examined groups of patients with celiac disease compared to the control group. Among the patients with celiac disease, the highest average concentration of vitamin E in erythrocytes was observed in the group who respected the gluten-free diet, a little lower in patients who violated dietary recommendations, and lowest among patients with newly diagnosed disease. These relationships, however, were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with celiac disease are at risk of vitamin E deficiency irrespective of their diet. Vitamin supplementation should be considered in their case, especially immediately after diagnosis of the disease and in case of breaking a gluten-free diet regime.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because of its technical characteristics (i.e. 8-fold magnification, capability to inspect the entire small bowel) and minimal invasiveness, videocapsule endoscopy (VCE) has been proposed as a useful tool for managing patients with celiac disease (CD). KEY MESSAGES: Although VCE has been found to be highly sensitive and specific in identifying CD endoscopic markers, it is still inadequate to replace esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies in the diagnosis of CD. Nevertheless, it represents a reliable alternative in patients unable or unwilling to undergo EGD. Up to now, available studies have failed to identify any correlation between the length of small bowel involvement and the severity of symptoms. The available evidence on the use of VCE in diagnosing CD in equivocal cases (patients with positive serology and negative or nonspecific histology or those with negative serology and histologically proven villous atrophy) is limited, and its role is still under discussion. In CD patients not improving on gluten-free diet, a complete workup is necessary. In patients with nonresponsive (NRCD) or refractory CD (RCD), VCE has been shown to be able not only to detect significant findings, driving further management, but also to rule out major complications. Nevertheless, in this setting, the inability of VCE to take tissue samples and the risk of capsule retention can represent major limitations. CONCLUSIONS: At the present time, for diagnostic purposes, VCE can be proposed only in patients unable or unwilling to undergo EGD, whereas it could be useful in some equivocal cases. Conversely, there is no room for VCE either to estimate the length of the small bowel affected by villous atrophy or to follow up patients improving on gluten-free diet. In patients with NRCD or RCD, VCE can play a role, but it should be combined with other diagnostic techniques.},

AIM: To demonstrate that gluten is the trigger of symptoms in a subgroup of patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), which presented with lymphocytic enteritis, positive celiac genetics and negative celiac serology. METHODS: Double-blind randomized clinical trial of gluten vs placebo rechallenge. INCLUSION CRITERIA: >18 years of age, HLA-DQ2/8+, negative coeliac serology and gluten-dependent lymphocytic enteritis, and GI symptoms, with clinical and histological remission at inclusion. Eighteen patients were randomised: 11 gluten (20 g/day) and 7 placebo. Clinical symptoms, quality of life (GIQLI), and presence of gamma/delta+ cells and transglutaminase deposits were evaluated. RESULTS: 91% of patients had clinical relapse during gluten challenge versus 28.5% after placebo (p = 0.01). Clinical scores and GIQLI worsened after gluten but not after placebo (p<0.01). The presence of coeliac tissue markers at baseline biopsy on a gluten-free diet allowed classifying 9 out of the 18 (50%) patients as having probable 'coeliac lite' disease. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study indicates that gluten is the trigger of symptoms in a subgroup of patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for NCGS.

   abstract = {Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is a chronic, generalised pain condition usually accompanied by several associated symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, headache, irritable bowel syndrome and mood disorders. Different medical treatments are used to treat fibromyalgia and the recent guidelines suggest that the optimal treatment consists in a multidisciplinary approach with a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment modalities. Among non-pharmacological treatment, nutrition is a promising tool for FM patients. The aim of this review is to update the present knowledge about fibromyalgia and nutrition by means of a systematic search performed on Medline from January 2000 to December 2014. Nutritional deficiencies have been described in FM patients and the benefits of specific diet and nutritional supplementation are shown. Obesity and overweight, often present in FM patients, are related to the severity of FM worsening the quality of life in terms of higher pain, fatigue, worsened sleep quality and higher incidence of mood disorders. Weight control is thus an effective tool to improve the symptoms. Moreover, it seems reasonable to eliminate some foods from the diet of FM patients, for example excitotoxins. Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity is increasingly recognised as a frequent condition with similar manifestations which overlap with those of FM. The elimination of gluten from the diet of FM patients is recently becoming a potential dietary intervention for clinical improvement. In summary, this review reveals the potential benefit of specific dietary interventions as non-pharmacological tools as part of a multidisciplinary treatment for FM patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) results from an alteration in the oral tolerance to dietary gluten. The response to gluten is normally tightly regulated and involves the secretion of TGF-beta and IL-10 from different subtypes of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Interestingly, in addition to proinflammatory cytokines, the inflamed CD mucosa also contains high levels of T cell-derived IL-10 compared with treated CD patients or normal donors. Furthermore, most studies describe an increase in the number of Foxp3+ Tregs in the small intestinal mucosa in CD patients compared to controls. This paradoxical condition suggests that regulatory mechanisms might operate to counterbalance the abnormal gliadin-triggered immune activation in untreated mucosa. Indeed, addition of exogenous IL-10 to mucosal cultures from treated CD patients can suppress gliadin-induced T cell activation. Considering the central role of adaptive immunity in CD, the development of strategies to stimulate these mechanisms is a primary goal of efforts to restore gluten tolerance. Key Messages: Different immunomodulatory strategies have been explored. NexVax2, a desensitizing vaccine that uses three dominant gluten peptides administered subcutaneously to induce a tolerogenic response in CD patients, is under development. Alternatively, the potential of substituted, cyclic or dimeric peptide analogues as blockers to prevent HLA from binding to the immunodominant gliadin epitopes has been demonstrated in vitro. In line with these results, we recently found that modified (transamidated) gliadins influenced the immune response in intestinal biopsy samples from CD patients with overt disease by drastically reducing the production of IFN-gamma. Notably, in a mouse model, transamidated gliadins reverted the phenotype of the gliadin-inducible immune response from an inflammatory phenotype to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Various approaches are currently under investigation to recover gluten tolerance based on the use of both modified and native antigen molecules. More specific studies are now required to test the efficacy of such strategies for preventing CD.},

   abstract = {There are overwhelming reports and descriptions about celiac associated disorders. Although there is a clear genetic association between celiac disease (CD) and some gastrointestinal disorders, there are controversial reports claiming an association between CD and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Different studies indicated the possible association between lymphocytic gastritis and both CD and H. pylori infection, although this evidence is not consistently accepted. Also it was shown that an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes count is associated with both H. pylori infection and celiac disease. Therefore the following questions may raise: how far is this infection actually related to CD?, which are the underlying patho-mechanisms for these associations? what are the clinical implications? what is the management? and what would be the role of gluten free diet in treating these conditions? PubMed (PubMed Central), Ovid, ISI of web knowledge, and Google scholar were searched for full text articles published between 1985 and 2015. The associated keywords were used, and papers described particularly the impact of pathological and clinical correlation between CD and H. pylori infection were identified. In this review we tried to answer the above questions and discussed some of the recent developments in the pathological and clinical aspects of CD and H. pylori infection.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are little data on patient factors that impact diagnosis rates of celiac disease. This study aims to evaluate the association between patient socioeconomic status and the symptoms at diagnosis of celiac disease. METHODS: A total of 872 patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease were categorized based on the presence or absence of (1) diarrhea and (2) any gastrointestinal symptoms at diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the association between socioeconomic status and symptoms. RESULTS: Patients without diarrhea at presentation had a higher mean per capita income (US$34,469 versus US$32,237, p = 0.02), and patients without any gastrointestinal symptoms had a higher mean per capita income (US$36,738 versus US$31,758, p < 0.01) compared with patients having such symptoms. On multivariable analysis adjusting for sex, age, autoimmune or psychiatric comorbidities, and income, per capita income remained a significant predictor of diagnosis without gastrointestinal symptoms (odds ratio: 1.71, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-2.50, p < 0.01), and it showed a trend towards significance in diagnosis without diarrhea (odds ratio: 1.40, 95% confidence interval: 0.98-2.02, p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with nonclassical symptoms of celiac disease are less likely to be diagnosed if they are of lower socioeconomic status. Celiac disease may be under-recognized in this population due to socioeconomic factors that possibly include lower rates of health-seeking behavior and access to healthcare.},

   abstract = {The importance of the gut microbiota (GM) in disease development has recently received increased attention, and numerous approaches have been made to better understand this important interplay. For example, metabolites derived from the GM have been shown to promote atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and to increase CVD risk factors. Popular interest in the role of the intestine in a variety of disease states has now resulted in a significant proportion of individuals without coeliac disease switching to gluten-free diets. The effect of gluten-free diets on atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk factors is largely unknown. We therefore investigated the effect of a gluten-free high-fat cholesterol-rich diet, as compared to the same diet in which the gluten peptide gliadin had been added back, on atherosclerosis and several cardiovascular risk factors in apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe-/-) mice. The gluten-free diet transiently altered GM composition in these mice, as compared to the gliadin-supplemented diet, but did not alter body weights, glucose tolerance, insulin levels, plasma lipids, or atherosclerosis. In parallel, other Apoe-/- mice fed the same diets were treated with ampicillin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic known to affect GM composition. Ampicillin-treatment had a marked and sustained effect on GM composition, as expected. Furthermore, although ampicillin-treated mice were slightly heavier than controls, ampicillin-treatment transiently improved glucose tolerance both in the absence or presence of gliadin, reduced plasma LDL and VLDL cholesterol levels, and reduced aortic atherosclerotic lesion area. These results demonstrate that a gluten-free diet does not seem to have beneficial effects on atherosclerosis or several CVD risk factors in this mouse model, but that sustained alteration of GM composition with a broad-spectrum antibiotic has beneficial effects on CVD risk factors and atherosclerosis. These findings support the concept that altering the microbiota might provide novel treatment strategies for CVD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: A gluten-free diet (GFD) has been reported to negatively impact the quality of life (QoL) of coeliac disease (CD) patients. The gut-brain axis hormones ghrelin and leptin, with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), may affect QoL of CD patients undergoing GFD. Our aims were to evaluate whether: (a) the circulating concentrations of leptin, ghrelin and BDNF in CD patients were different from those in healthy subjects; (b) GFD might induce changes in their levels; (c) BDNF Val66Met polymorphism variability might affect BDNF levels; and (d) serum BDNF levels were related to dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as a neurotrophin modulator. METHODS: Nineteen adult coeliac patients and 21 healthy controls were included. A QoL questionnaire was administered, and serum concentrations of ghrelin, leptin, BDNF and red blood cell membrane DHA levels were determined at the enrolment and after 1 year of GFD. BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was analysed. RESULTS: Results from the questionnaire indicated a decline in QoL after GFD. Ghrelin and leptin levels were not significantly different between groups. BDNF levels were significantly (p = 0.0213) lower in patients after GFD (22.0 +/- 2.4 ng/ml) compared to controls (31.2 +/- 2.2 ng/ml) and patients at diagnosis (25.0 +/- 2.5 ng/ml). BDNF levels correlated with DHA levels (p = 0.008, r = 0.341) and the questionnaire total score (p = 0.041, r = 0.334). CONCLUSIONS: Ghrelin and leptin seem to not be associated with changes in QoL of patients undergoing dietetic treatment. In contrast, a link between BDNF reduction and the vulnerability of CD patients to psychological distress could be proposed, with DHA representing a possible intermediate.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extending the scope of practice of allied health professionals has been a strategy adopted in the United Kingdom to address issues within the health system. Australia's health system is currently undermined by similar issues, heightening government interest in adopting the extended scope health care model. The aim of the current study was to describe the activities and outcomes of a dietitian-led gastroenterology clinic which operated under an extended scope of practice model in an outpatient gastroenterology department at a tertiary hospital in regional Queensland, Australia, and to assess patient satisfaction with the initiative. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional case series undertaken over 50 clinics involving 82 category 2 and 3 patients with suspected/confirmed coeliac disease or inflammatory bowel disease; low haemoglobin; gastroesophageal reflux disease, or; malnutrition. Data was analysed using Microsoft Excel 2010, and presented as descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Sixty out of 82 selected patients (median age 51 years) attended an initial appointment with the dietitian. Twenty-four review appointments were attended. Average waiting period for an initial appointment was 148 days (range 31-308 days). A total of 149 management strategies were provided, and 94 (63 %) of these involved the dietitian utilising extended scope of practice. The dietitian managed 47 (78 %) patients without need for gastroenterologist referral, and 25 (42 %) were discharged after dietetic management. Patients reported high levels of satisfaction with the clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Seventy-eight percent of category 2 and 3 patients referred to the gastroenterologist could be managed exclusively in the dietitian-led clinic. This extended scope model of care could potentially benefit the efficiency and acceptability of Australia's public health system.},

As selenium deficiencies in celiac disease are observed, the aim of the study was to determine the selenium content in 27 grain gluten-free products available on the European Union (EU) market. Moreover, selenium content in products based on popular gluten-free cereals like corn, rice, and buckwheat and in relatively new or less popular products based on oat, amaranth, teff, and quinoa was compared. Selenium content in the tested products ranged from 0.9 to 24.5 mug/100 g. The average content of selenium in products based on popular gluten-free cereals was 2.8 mug/100 g and in products based on oat, amaranth, teff, and quinoa was 10.8 mug/100 g. It indicates that products based on less popular grains, especially on oat, should be more frequently chosen as a source of selenium by people on gluten-free diet than traditionally consumed gluten-free grains.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore a possible significance of the presence of anti-ganglioside and anti-sulfatide antibodies in sera of adult patients with celiac disease (CD) in different clinical scenario. METHODS: We selected 22 adult patients with newly diagnosed CD and 20 age-sex matched non-CD controls. Patients' serum was tested - before and after at least 6 months on a gluten-free diet (GFD) - for anti-GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GD3, GT1a, GT1b, GQ1b and sulfatide IgM, IgG and IgA auto-antibodies, by means of a dot blot technique and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: We found the presence of auto-antibodies in untreated patients. In particular, anti-sulfatide IgG antibodies were present in 8 (36%) patients independently of the presence of neurological symptoms. Anti-sulfatide IgA antibodies were present in 3 (19%) patients. During GFD, anti-sulfatide IgG disappeared in all the patients, whereas IgA were observed in 2 patients. Anti-sulfatide, anti-GM1 and anti-GM2 IgM antibodies were also observed in 2 patients on a GFD. All the other auto-antibodies were absent and no demographic or clinical parameters were associated. Non-CD controls did not present any auto-antibody. CONCLUSIONS: We found anti-sulfatide IgG antibodies in CD patients on a gluten-containing diet. Anti-sulfatide IgA antibodies persisted during GFD together with the occurrence of other IgM auto-antibodies. These data suggest a possible link between gluten and IgG auto-antibodies.},

   abstract = {The aim of this metaanalysis was to evaluate the risk of the development of obstetric complications in women with celiac disease. We searched electronic databases from their inception until February 2015. We included all cohort studies that reported the incidence of obstetric complications in women with celiac disease compared with women without celiac disease (ie, control group). Studies without a control group and case-control studies were excluded. The primary outcome was defined a priori and was the incidence of a composite of obstetric complications that included intrauterine growth restriction, small for gestational age, low birthweight, preeclampsia and preterm birth. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, preeclampsia, small for gestational age, and low birthweight. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015017263) before data extraction. All authors were contacted to obtain the original databases and perform individual participant data metaanalysis. Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed in the aggregate data analysis and in the individual participant data metaanalysis. We included 10 cohort studies (4,844,555 women) in this metaanalysis. Four authors provided the entire databases for the individual participant data analysis. Because none of the included studies stratified data for the primary outcome (ie, composite outcome), the assessment of this outcome for the aggregate analysis was not feasible. Aggregate data analysis showed that, compared with women in the control group, women with celiac disease (both treated and untreated) had a significantly higher risk of the development of preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.66), intrauterine growth restriction (odds ratio, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-4.67), stillbirth (odds ratio, 4.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-21.75), low birthweight (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.51), and small for gestational age (odds ratio, 4.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-20.08); no statistically significant difference was found in the incidence of preeclampsia (odds ratio, 2.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.90-6.70). The risk of preterm birth was still significantly higher both in the subgroup analysis of only women with diagnosed and treated celiac disease (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.48) and in the subgroup analysis of only women with undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease (odds ratio, 2.50; 95% confidence interval; 1.06-5.87). Women with diagnosed and treated celiac disease had a significantly lower risk of the development of preterm birth, compared with undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.99). The individual participant data metaanalysis showed that women with celiac disease had a significantly higher risk of composite obstetric complications compared with control subjects (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.94). Our individual participant data concurs with the aggregate analysis for all the secondary outcomes. In summary, women with celiac disease had a significantly higher risk of the development of obstetric complications that included preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, low birthweight, and small for gestational age. Since the treatment with gluten-free diet leads to a significant decrease of preterm delivery, physicians should warn these women about the importance of a strict diet to improve obstetric outcomes. Future studies calculating cost-effectiveness of screening for celiac disease during pregnancy, which could be easily performed, economically and noninvasively, are needed. In addition, further studies are required to determine whether women with adverse pregnancy outcomes should be screened for celiac disease, particularly in countries where the prevalence is high.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (IH) require variable doses of calcium and 1-alpha-(OH)D. The reasons for such variability are not clear. As autoimmune mechanisms may play a role in IH, there is a possibility of coexistent coeliac disease with calcium/vitamin D malabsorption. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the prevalence of coeliac disease and antitissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (anti-tTGAbs) in IH and analysed the effect of a gluten-free diet on calcaemic control. METHOD: A total of 171 patients with IH and 126 healthy controls were screened for anti-tTGAb. IH patients with anti-tTGAb >20 RU/ml underwent duodenoscopy and intestinal biopsy; those with biopsy-proven coeliac disease were followed up on a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Eleven of 171 (6.4%) patients with IH and seven of 126 (5.6%) controls had anti-tTGAb (P = 0.81). There was no difference in the clinical and biochemical parameters at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up of 7.2 +/- 4.8 year (mean serum total calcium = 1.88 +/- 0.16 vs 1.82 +/- 0.36 mmol/l, P = 0.52; phosphorus = 1.81 +/- 0.17 vs 1.87 +/- 0.36 mmol/l, P = 0.53) in IH patients with and without anti-tTGAb. Although CaSRAb positivity was comparable in the two groups, IH patients with anti-tTGAb had higher TPOAb positivity (45.5% vs 12.8%, P = 0.02). Coeliac disease was diagnosed in only 2/9 patients with IH on biopsy, both of whom showed improved calcaemic control with a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of coeliac autoimmunity (6.4%) and coeliac disease (1.2%) in patients with IH seems to be similar to that in the general population. Notwithstanding this modest prevalence, it is important to be aware of the potential occurrence of coeliac disease with IH and the beneficial effect of a gluten-free diet on calcium control.},

Despite this, few studies have combined such data for use in ongoing intervention development. PURPOSE: To assess the acceptability and feasibility of an online intervention to improve gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence in coeliac disease, and to examine the relationships with participant characteristics, attrition, and effectiveness to inform ongoing intervention developments to ultimately reduce attrition and improve the reach and effectiveness of the programme. METHODS: All participants completed measures of GFD adherence, theory of planned behaviour variables, psychological symptoms, and demographic and disease characteristics. Acceptability and feasibility ratings were obtained at the conclusion of each of the six intervention modules. Chi-square analyses were used to examine differences between completers and non-completers, and Spearman's correlations were used to determine the relationships between participant characteristics, effectiveness, and acceptability and feasibility. RESULTS: Participants who rated the early modules less favourably were more likely to drop-out of the intervention. Acceptability and feasibility ratings were also associated with the presence of psychological symptoms, use of adaptive coping strategies, GFD duration, and attitude change. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that changes to the structure and implementation of the intervention may be useful in minimising attrition and maximising effectiveness for future dissemination in a wider coeliac disease population.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether changes in theory of planned behaviour (TPB) constructs could predict intention and gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence following participation in an online theory-based intervention designed to improve adherence in coeliac disease. DESIGN: Theory-based process evaluation of the mechanisms of change over the course of a six-week online intervention. Measures of GFD adherence and TPB variables were administered at baseline and follow-up (immediate post-intervention: n = 74; three-month: n = 68; six-month: n = 65). Hierarchical regression analyses using residualised change scores were conducted at each time point (dependent variables: intention and adherence). RESULTS: Baseline intention and GFD adherence were the strongest predictors of follow-up intention and adherence, respectively. Change in attitude accounted for significant variance in intention. Change in intention accounted for significant variance in GFD adherence immediately post-intervention; by the six-month follow-up change in perceived behavioural control was the stronger predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Partial support for the hypotheses suggests that, for certain behaviours, the TPB may be relevant in explaining the mechanism of action responsible for changes in intention and behaviour following participation in a behaviour change intervention. Additional predictive pathways are also likely to exist and, in the area of GFD adherence, may include habit strength and actual behavioural control.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The gluten-free diet has traditionally been accepted as a healthy diet, but there are articles advocating that it may have some nutritional deficiencies. The current study assesses whether there was any change in the contributions of calories, essential elements, proportion of fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and fiber in children who were diagnosed with celiac diseases, comparing the diet with gluten prior one year after diagnosis with the diet without gluten to the year of diagnosis. The level of clinical or analytical impact that nutritional deficits could have was also assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective,descriptive, observational study in which information was collected from a dietary survey, anthropometric and analytical data at pre-diagnosis of celiac disease and following a gluten diet and one year after celiac disease diagnosis, under gluten-free diet. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients meet the study criteria. A decrease in the intake of saturated fatty acids was found, with an increase of monounsaturated fatty acids and an increase in the intake of phosphorus in the diet without gluten. A deficient intake of vitamin D was found in both diets. Clinically, at year of gluten-free diet there was an improvement in weight and size. Analytically, there was an improvement in hemoglobin, ferritin, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone in plasma. CONCLUSION: The gluten-free diet has minimal deficiencies, similar to those present in the diet with gluten, with an improvement in the lipid profile by increasing the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids to the detriment of saturated fatty acids.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a cutaneous form of celiac disease affecting approximately 17% of celiac disease patients. The aim was to determine how often celiac disease precedes the development of DH, and what is the impact of gluten-free diet (GFD) in this phenotype change. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our prospectively collected DH series from 1970 comprised 514 patients. We analyzed all DH patients who at least 2 years earlier had been diagnosed with celiac disease. DH diagnosis was confirmed by showing immunoglobulin A deposits in dermis. Serological and small bowel mucosal findings were analyzed, and the strictness of GFD treatment before and after the diagnosis of DH was evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty (4%) DH patients had a prior diagnosis of celiac disease. The median time interval between celiac disease and DH detection was 9.5 years. Before DH appeared 4 patients had been on a normal gluten-containing diet, 10 had dietary lapses on a GFD, and 6 were on a strict GFD. Celiac autoantibodies were positive in 7 out of 19 patients, and 5 out of 7 undergoing small bowel biopsy had partial villous atrophy. Following DH diagnosis the rash was controlled after a median of 6 months on a strict GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with celiac disease may develop DH by time. This is most often an indicator of poor adherence to GFD, and a rigorous dietary intervention is necessary. In the majority of cases, DH will be detected without prior celiac disease diagnosis, but the physicians should recognize this phenotype alteration.},

AIMS: To investigate the correlations between serum TG3 antibodies and clinical and histological manifestations of celiac disease and to assess gluten-dependency of TG3 antibodies. METHODS: Correlations between serum TG3 antibody levels measured from 119 adults and children with untreated coeliac disease and the demographic data, clinical symptoms, celiac antibodies, histological data and results of laboratory tests and bone mineral densities were tested. TG3 antibodies were reinvestigated in 97 celiac disease patients after 12 months on a gluten-free diet (GFD). RESULTS: TG3 antibody titers were shown to correlate with the age at celiac disease diagnosis. Further, negative correlation with TG3 antibodies and intestinal gammadelta+ cells at diagnosis and on GFD was detected. Correlations were not detected with the clinical manifestation of celiac disease, TG2 or endomysial autoantibodies, laboratory values, severity of mucosal villous atrophy, associated diseases or complications. TG3 antibody titers decreased on GFD in 56% of the TG3 antibody positive patients. CONCLUSION: Serum TG3 antibody positivity in celiac disease increases as the diagnostic age rises. TG3 antibodies did not show similar gluten-dependency as TG2 antibodies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-triggered autoimmune disorder of the small intestine. A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only approved treatment; however, strict adherence is difficult and many suffer from inadvertent gluten exposure. Oral egg yolk anti-gliadin antibody (AGY) is a novel treatment to neutralize gluten and may improve the efficacy of the GFD. AIMS: To determine the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of AGY in patients with CD. METHODS: This 6-week, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in adults with biopsy-proven CD on a GFD. Safety measures included adverse events, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Additional measures included a daily Celiac Symptom Index, Health-Related Quality of life, anti-tissue transglutaminase and anti-gliadin IgA/IgG, and lactulose/mannitol excretion ratio (LMER). A 2-week run-in period to assess questionnaire compliance and acceptability of baseline safety laboratory results was followed by a 4-week treatment period with two AGY capsules taken before meals. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study (mean age 43.4 years, nine female). All followed a GFD for at least 6 months (mean 5 years). No safety concerns were identified. Most patients had fewer celiac symptoms (especially tiredness, headache, and bloating), improved quality of life, lowered antibodies, and lowered LMER when taking AGY compared to the run-in period. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, AGY was safe and potentially associated with improved CD-related outcome measures in patients on a GFD. A larger study powered for further safety and efficacy evaluation is planned.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a frequent chronic inflammatory enteropathy caused by gluten in genetically predisposed individuals that carry disease susceptibility genes (HLA-DQ2/8). These genes are present in about 30-40% of the general population, but only a small percentage of carriers develops CD. Gluten is the key environmental trigger of CD, but its intake does not fully explain disease onset; indeed, an increased number of cases experience gluten intolerance in late adulthood after many years of gluten exposure. Consequently, additional environmental factors seem to be involved in CD. Epidemiological studies indicate that common perinatal and early postnatal factors influence both CD risk and intestinal microbiota structure. Prospective studies in healthy infants at risk of developing CD also reveal that the HLA-DQ genotype, in conjunction with other environmental factors, influences the microbiota composition. Furthermore, CD patients have imbalances in the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis), which are not fully normalized despite their adherence to a gluten-free diet. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the disease can promote dysbiosis that aggravates CD pathogenesis, and dysbiosis, in turn, can initiate and sustain inflammation through the expansion of proinflammatory pathobionts and decline of anti-inflammatory mutualistic bacteria. Studies in experimental models are also contributing to understand the role of intestinal bacteria and its interactions with a predisposed genotype in promoting CD. Advances in this area could aid in the development of microbiome-informed intervention strategies that optimize the partnership between the gut microbiota and host immunity for improving CD management.},

STUDY DESIGN: This was a multinational cross-sectional study performed from 2014 to 2015. Patients 4-18 years of age with CD on gluten-free diet for longer than 6 months were recruited from pediatric CD clinics in US and Italy. Control groups included siblings of children with CD (with normal tissue transglutaminase levels) and unrelated controls. Subjects or parents completed the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III. RESULTS: Children (n = 289) were recruited (55% US, 45% Italy): 96 children with CD, 96 sibling controls, and 97 unrelated controls. Chronic AP was present in 30 (30.9%) subjects with CD, 22 (22.7%) sibling controls, and 21 (21.6%) unrelated controls (P = .26 patients with CD vs siblings; P = .18 patients with CD vs unrelated; P = .96 siblings vs unrelated). AP-FGIDs were present in 8 (8.2%) subjects with CD, 8 (8.2%) sibling controls, and 2 (2.1%) unrelated controls (P = 1.00 subjects with CD vs sibling controls; P = .06 subjects with CD vs unrelated controls; P = .06 sibling controls vs unrelated controls). CONCLUSION: This multinational study evaluated the prevalence of chronic abdominal pain and AP-FGIDs in the pediatric population with CD. We found that subjects with CD and controls have a similar prevalence of chronic AP and AP-FGIDs. This suggests that not all types of gastrointestinal inflammation result in AP-FGIDs in children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oral conditions and dental disorders are frequent in childhood. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common inflammatory condition characterized by painful recurrent, single or multiple ulcerations of the oral mucosa induced by genetic and environmental factors. Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic small intestinal immunemediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals pathogenetically related to oral condition. The aim of the study was to evaluate the different prevalence of oral conditions in CD patients compared to a control group. METHODS: From January 2013 to June 2013, 166 patients, between 2 and 17 years of age and of both genders, were examined in order to evaluate the presence and the medical history of oral conditions. Clinical features of patients affected by CD were compared with those of a control group with similar socio-demographic features. RESULTS: We found that the more common lesions in both groups were RAS (69% in CD patients vs. 43% in the control group), followed by dental disorders (76% in CD patients vs. 65% in the control group). Prevalence of RAS between the two groups was significantly different (P<0.0006). Prevalences of caries and dental abnormalities were the same in the two groups (45% vs. 45% and 16% vs. 16% respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In celiac patients there was a significant higher prevalence of RAS compared to a control group. These findings could be possibly associated with common pathogenetic mechanisms.},

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in which an online questionnaire was sent to all families registered in the Saudi celiac patients support group. We included only children (age 18 years of age and younger) with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease (CD). RESULTS: A total of 113 children were included in the final analysis, the median age was 9.9 years; 62.8% were females. One hundred (88.5%) of the participating families reported that GFD food was not easily available in their areas, 17% of them reported that it was not available at all in their area. One hundred and six (93.8%) reported that the price of GFD food was very expensive and 70 (61.9%) families that the diet was heavily affecting their family budget. Significant social difficulties were reported among the participating families and their children including interference with the child's interaction with other children (49.6%), the families' ability to attend social gatherings (60.2%), the families' ability to eat in restaurants (73.5%), and the families' ability to travel (58.4%). CONCLUSION: There is significant negative socio-economic impact of GFD on children with CD & their families. Health care providers should be aware of these psycho-social difficulties and be well trained to provide a proper education and psychological support for these patients and their families.},

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted, in which all the families registered in the Saudi Celiac Patients Support Group were sent an online survey. Only families with children 18 years of age and younger with biopsy-confirmed CD were included. RESULTS: The median age of the 113 included children was 9.9 years, the median age at symptom onset was 5.5 years and the median age at diagnosis was 7 years, the median time between the presentation and the final diagnosis was 1 year. Sixty two of the involved children were females. Ninety two percent of the patients were symptomatic at the diagnosis while eight percent were asymptomatic. The commonest presenting symptoms included: chronic abdominal pain (59.3%), poor weight gain (54%), abdominal distention, gases, bloating (46.1%) and chronic diarrhea (41.6%). Sixty percent of the involved children were reported to be strictly adherent to GFD. Younger age at diagnosis and shorter duration since the diagnosis were associated with a better adherence rate. CONCLUSION: CD has similar clinical presentations among Saudi children compared to other parts of the ward; however, the adherence to GFD is relatively poor. Younger age at diagnosis and shorter duration since the diagnosis were associated with a better adherence rate.},

Among genetic risk factors, the strongest association is with the HLA class II DQ region; nevertheless at least 39 non-HLA loci are associated with CD. Gluten is the main environmental trigger of the disease. In addition, infant feeding and weaning practices as well as timing of gluten introduction in the diet have been suggested to contribute to CD risk. Furthermore a role for infectious agents and microbiota composition in disease development has also been proposed.Aim of this short review is to discuss the current knowledge on both genetic and environmental risk factors for the development of CD; moreover we will provide a brief overview of the possible strategies that could be envisaged to prevent this condition, at least in the population at-risk.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically review evidence concerning disordered eating practices in dietary-controlled gastrointestinal conditions. Three key questions were examined: a) are disordered eating practices a feature of GI disorders?; b) what abnormal eating practices are present in those with GI disorders?; and c) what factors are associated with the presence of disordered eating in those with GI disorders? By exploring these questions, we aim to develop a conceptual model of disordered eating development in GI disease. METHODS: Five key databases, Web of Science with Conference Proceedings (1900-2014) and MEDLINE (1950-2014), PubMed, PsycINFO (1967-2014) and Google Scholar, were searched for papers relating to disordered eating practices in those with GI disorders. All papers were quality assessed before being included in the review. RESULTS: Nine papers were included in the review. The majority of papers reported that the prevalence of disordered eating behaviours is greater in populations with GI disorders than in populations of healthy controls. Disordered eating patterns in dietary-controlled GI disorders may be associated with both anxiety and GI symptoms. Evidence concerning the correlates of disordered eating was limited. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of disordered eating behaviours is greater in populations with GI disorders than in populations of healthy controls, but the direction of the relationship is not clear. Implications for further research are discussed.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The need for dietary management in coeliac disease may lead to the development of disordered eating. This study examined the prevalence of disordered eating and factors predicting disordered eating in women with coeliac disease, compared with other dietary-controlled conditions. METHODS: A cross-sectional, online survey assessing psychological well-being, disordered eating behaviours (Eating Attitudes Test 26 (EAT-26); Binge Eating Scale (BES)) was distributed using online forums, to those with coeliac disease (N = 157), inflammatory bowel disease (N = 116), type two diabetes (N = 88) and healthy controls (N = 142). Hierarchical regressions were conducted to explore and compare the predictors of EAT-26 and BES scores across all groups. Within the coeliac disease group, a cluster analysis was conducted to examine types of disordered eating. RESULTS: Higher EAT-26 scores were found in those with coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease compared with healthy controls and type two diabetes; participants with a chronic health condition had higher BES than healthy control participants. The factors associated with EAT-26 scores differed across the dietary-controlled health conditions, with dietary management being important for those with coeliac disease. Psychological distress was associated with binge-eating behaviour across all groups. Cluster analyses found two types of disordered eating in coeliac disease; a binge eating type and a restrictive type. CONCLUSIONS: Disordered eating attitudes and behaviours are more prevalent in participants with chronic health conditions relative to healthy controls. The presence of binge eating behaviours in coeliac disease may be related to non-coeliac disease specific factors such as the distress associated with dietary-controlled illness. EAT-26 scores in coeliac disease are associated with disease specific factors, unique to following the gluten-free diet. These factors are important for identifying and supporting those with coeliac disease and disordered eating.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It remains unclear as to what are the clinical characteristics associated with the presence of anemia at celiac disease diagnosis, and how these are affected by a gluten-free diet. We investigated these issues in a prospective study. METHODS: Clinical and demographic data, small-bowel mucosal histology, serology, and laboratory parameters, body mass index (BMI), and bone mineral density (BMD) both at diagnosis and after 1 year on a gluten-free diet were investigated in 163 adults with celiac disease. Gastrointestinal symptoms and psychological well-being were evaluated by validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and Psychological General Well-Being questionnaires. All study variables were compared between participants with and without anemia at celiac disease diagnosis. RESULTS: Altogether, 23% of the patients had anemia at diagnosis. Anemic patients were more often women (P=0.001) and had more gastrointestinal symptoms (P=0.004) and were less often screen detected (P=0.009). Further, they had higher celiac antibody values (P=0.007) and a lower total iron (P<0.001), BMI (P=0.003), and density of mucosal gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (P=0.033). After 1 year on a gluten-free diet, the anemia group had a lower mucosal villous height-crypt depth ratio (P=0.008) and BMI (P=0.050), and higher antibody values (P=0.012) and densities of CD3 (P=0.008) and alphabeta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (P=0.022). There was no significant difference between the groups in their bone mineral density, Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and Psychological General Well-Being. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac patients with anemia had more severe disease than nonanemic patients in terms of the serology and a lower BMI. Further, they evinced a slower histologic response to the dietary treatment. An early diagnosis and careful follow-up are important in these patients.},

   abstract = {Gluten intolerance is an umbrella term for gluten-related disorders manifested in health decline as a result of the gluten ingestion. The spectrum of gluten-related disorders includes three major groups: autoimmune (mainly, Celiac Disease, CD, also known as Celiac Sprue, dermatitis herpetiformis, or gluten-sensitive ataxia), allergic (wheat allergy, WA), and non-autoimmune non-allergic (non-celiac gluten sensitivity, NCGS, or gluten sensitivity, GS). Pathogenesis and diagnostics of CD and WA are well established in contrast to NCGS, pathogenicity of which is still poorly understood and its symptoms are frequently misdiagnosed since most of the NCGS cases are currently identified via the process of CD and WA exclusion. By now, the only one proven effective way for CD treatment is gluten-free diet (GFD). However, such an increasingly gaining popularity diet is apparently unsuitable for NCGS treatment because in this case gluten does not always arise as the major or exclusive culprit of gastrointestinal disorder. Furthermore, it is some physicians' opinion that GFD can be deficient in fiber and in other vitamins and minerals. In many cases, GFD is commercially inaccessible for the most needy, whereas strict adherence to the diet is complicated by the presence of small amounts of the gluten components in some foods and even medicines. In this regard, a number of research groups and pharmaceutical companies are extensively developing alternative medicinal approaches to GFD for effective gluten intolerance treatment. This review summarizes our understanding of gluten-related disorders, possible mechanisms of gluten intolerance activation and advantages of gluten intolerance medicinal treatment using novel drug candidates obtained with a proper pharmaceutical design.},

A total of 37 pediatric patients who were diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) and 29 healthy children were enrolled in this prospective study. We evaluated the IMA, total oxidant status, total antioxidant capacity, sulfhydryl, and advanced oxidation protein products in all of the subjects. We also compared the levels at the time of the diagnosis, and following a gluten-free diet (GFD) in the children with CD. While the IMA and the other oxidant marker levels were significantly higher in the patient group compared to the control group, the antioxidant marker levels were found to be significantly lower in the patient group, compared to the control group. We also determined that the tissue transglutaminase IgA showed a highly positive correlation, and that the IMA showed a moderately positive correlation with the Marsh-Oberhuber histopathological stage. Additionally, the IMA and other oxidant marker levels were significantly lower, while the antioxidant marker levels were significantly higher after the GFD, compared to the pre-diet period. We detected that oxidative stress played a role in the pathogenesis of CD, and that this could be evaluated using oxidative stress markers, which would regress after the GFD. We also detected that IMA is a marker that shows a correlation with the histopathological stage, and may be used in the diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-celiac wheat sensitivity is an emerging wheat-related syndrome showing peak prevalence in Western populations. Recent studies hypothesize that new gliadin alleles introduced in the human diet by replacement of ancient wheat with modern varieties can prompt immune responses mediated by the CXCR3-chemokine axis potentially underlying such pathogenic inflammation. This cultural shift may also explain disease epidemiology, having turned European-specific adaptive alleles previously targeted by natural selection into disadvantageous ones. METHODS: To explore this evolutionary scenario, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of genes pivotal in the CXCR3-inflammatory pathway on individuals diagnosed for non-celiac wheat sensitivity and we applied anthropological evolutionary genetics methods to sequence data from worldwide populations to investigate the genetic legacy of natural selection on these loci. RESULTS: Our results indicate that balancing selection has maintained two divergent CXCL10/CXCL11 haplotypes in Europeans, one responsible for boosting inflammatory reactions and another for encoding moderate chemokine expression. CONCLUSIONS: This led to considerably higher occurrence of the former haplotype in Western people than in Africans and East Asians, suggesting that they might be more prone to side effects related to the consumption of modern wheat varieties. Accordingly, this study contributed to shed new light on some of the mechanisms potentially involved in the disease etiology and on the evolutionary bases of its present-day epidemiological patterns. Moreover, overrepresentation of disease homozygotes for the dis-adaptive haplotype plausibly accounts for their even more enhanced CXCR3-axis expression and for their further increase in disease risk, representing a promising finding to be validated by larger follow-up studies.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy initiated and sustained by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. It is caused by a dysregulated immune response toward both dietary antigens, the gluten proteins of wheat, rye, and barley, and autoantigens, the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (TG2). The small intestine is the target organ. Although routine immunochemical protocols for a laboratory diagnosis of CD are available, faster, easier-to-use, and cheaper analytical devices for CD diagnosis are currently unavailable. This review focuses on biosensors, consisting of a physicochemical transducer and a bioreceptor, as promising analytical tools for diagnosis of CD and other diseases. Examples of recently developed biosensors as well as expectations for future lines of research and development in this field are presented.},

   abstract = {Purified wheat starch (WSt) is commonly used in gluten-free products for celiac disease (CD) patients. It is mostly well-tolerated, but doubts about its safety for CD patients persist. One reason may be that most ELISA kits primarily recognize the alcohol-soluble gliadin fraction of gluten, but insufficiently target the alcohol-insoluble glutenin fraction. To address this problem, a new sensitive method based on the sequential extraction of gliadins, glutenins, and gluten from WSt followed by gel-permeation high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (GP-HPLC-FLD) was developed. It revealed that considerable amounts of glutenins were present in most WSt. The gluten contents quantitated by GP-HPLC-FLD as sum of gliadins and glutenins were higher than those by R5 ELISA (gluten as gliadin content multiplied by a factor of 2) in 19 out of 26 WSt. Despite its limited selectivity, GP-HPLC-FLD may be applied as confirmatory method to ELISA to quantitate gluten in WSt.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The presentation of celiac disease (CD) has changed over the past decades. We aimed to describe the incidence of CD and its complications at diagnosis in a historical cohort in a well-defined population in Denmark. METHODS: We included all patients aged 15+ years, who lived in Aarhus County, Denmark, and who were diagnosed with CD between January 2008 and August 2013. Data regarding gastrointestinal symptoms, anthropometrics, biochemistry, and bone mineral density were retrieved from patient records. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients with a valid CD diagnosis were identified, corresponding to an incidence rate of 6.4 per 100,000 person-years. At diagnosis, diarrhea and weight loss occurred in 54% and 47% patients, respectively. In total, 30% had anemia; 40%, iron deficiency; 20%, folate deficiency; and 17%, vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency was present in 34%. In 28%, bone mineral density was determined during the first year after diagnosis. Of these, 54% had osteopenia and 12% osteoporosis. After introduction of a gluten-free diet, 28% had normalized transglutaminase antibody levels after 6 months, and 56% did after 12 months. Diabetes mellitus type 1 was present in 7%; dermatitis herpetiformis, in 3%; and thyroid dysfunction, in 5%. CONCLUSIONS: Only half of newly diagnosed CD patients presented with classic gastrointestinal symptoms. Anemia and vitamin deficiencies were common. Bone mineral density was determined in less than a third of the patients, and osteoporosis occurred in 12% of these. Serologic markers of CD normalized in approximately half of patients during the first year after the diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease occurs as a result of a T-cell-dependent immune reaction on gluten peptides. It is a complex genetic disorder that is mediated by an unknown number of genes, of which more than 50 have been identified in whole genome association studies. The genetic component helps identify oligosymptomatic or even subclinical celiacs by screening first-degree relatives and patients suffering from other autoimmune diseases. To offer sensitive as well as specific diagnostics for celiac disease (serology and small intestinal histology) some general rules should be followed including performing diagnostics only when patients are on a gluten-containing diet or after an appropriate re-exposition. Established treatment is currently restricted to a gluten-free diet. However, future treatment options might include endopeptidase-mediated inactivation of gluten peptides, stabilization of the epithelial barrier, tissue-transglutaminase inhibition or vaccination.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is induced by the consumption of gluten containing cereals (wheat, spelt, barley, rye). With a prevalence of ~ 1 %, it is the most common non-infectious chronic inflammatory intestinal disease worldwide. It manifests in all age groups, either classically with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and growth failure or weight loss, more commonly with indirect consequences of malabsorption, such as anaemia and osteoporosis, or with associated autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis or dermatitis herpetiformis. The pathogenesis of celiac disease is well explored. Gluten, the cereal storage protein, is not completely digested and reaches the intestinal mucosa where it activates inflammatory T cells, which cause atrophy of the resorptive villi. This Tcell activation requires a genetic predisposition (the molecules HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 on antigen-presenting immune cells). Moreover, the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (TG2) which is released in the mucosa increases the immunogenicity of the gluten peptides by a deamidation reaction. The test for serum antibodies to the autoantigen TG2 is one of the best diagnostic markers in medicine, which in combination with endoscopically obtained biopsies, secures the diagnosis of celiac disease. Despite these tools celiac disease is severely underdiagnosed, with 80-90 % of those affected being undetected. The untreated condition can lead to grave complications. These include the consequences of malabsorption, cancers (especially intestinal Tcell lymphoma), and likely also the promotion of autoimmune diseases. The therapy of celiac disease, a strict gluten-free diet, is difficult to maintain and not always effective. Alternative, supporting pharmacological therapies are urgently needed and are currently in development.},

   abstract = {Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is a form of coeliac disease (CD) resistant to gluten-free diet and associated with elevated risk of complications. Many effector cytokines over-produced in the gut of patients with RCD are supposed to amplify the tissue-destructive immune response, but it remains unclear if the RCD-associated mucosal inflammation is sustained by defects in counter-regulatory mechanisms. The aim of the present study was to determine whether RCD-related inflammation is marked by high Smad7, an intracellular inhibitor of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1 ) activity. Smad7 was evaluated in duodenal biopsy samples of patients with RCD, patients with active CD, patients with inactive CD and healthy controls by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. In the same samples, TGF-beta1 and phosphorylated (p)-Smad2/3 were evaluated by ELISA and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was evaluated in RCD samples cultured with Smad7 sense or antisense oligonucleotide. Smad7 protein, but not RNA, expression was increased in RCD compared with active and inactive CD patients and healthy controls and this was associated with defective TGF-beta1 signalling, as marked by diminished p-Smad2/3 expression. TGF-beta1 protein content did not differ among groups. Knockdown of Smad7 in RCD biopsy samples reduced interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha expression. In conclusion, in RCD, high Smad7 associates with defective TGF-beta1 signalling and sustains inflammatory cytokine production. These results indicate a novel mechanism by which the mucosal cytokine response is amplified in RCD and suggest that targeting Smad7 can be therapeutically useful in RCD.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a global disease, and the only currently available treatment is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Although conceptually simple, the diet changes are substantial and have a profound effect on a patient's life. Untreated coeliac disease is associated with complications, including excess mortality, most of which can be avoided with a strict GFD. However, there are many barriers, including availability, cost and safety of gluten-free foods, and gluten cross-contamination. The GFD can be restrictive in social situations, leading to poor quality of life and, ultimately, nonadherence. As the number of patients with coeliac disease increases worldwide, clinicians need to be aware of the challenges patients face. Heightened awareness by physicians, dietitians and other providers can help maximize successful treatment, improve outcomes, and reduce health-care costs and disease burden. Routine follow-up is necessary to reinforce the need for a GFD, provide social and emotional support, and achieve mucosal healing, leading to reduced risk of complications. Unfortunately, there is wide variation in follow-up practices. The objective of this Review is to increase awareness of the challenges, management and follow-up of patients with coeliac disease to help them achieve GFD adherence and prevent complications whilst preserving their quality of life.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) are autoimmune conditions in which dietary gluten has been proven or suggested to play a pathogenic role. In CD; gluten is established as the instigator of autoimmunity; the autoimmune process is halted by removing gluten from the diet; which allows for resolution of celiac autoimmune enteropathy and subsequent normalization of serological markers of the disease. However; an analogous causative agent has not yet been identified for T1D. Nevertheless; the role of dietary gluten in development of T1D and the potentially beneficial effect of removing gluten from the diet of patients with T1D are still debated. In this review; we discuss the comorbid occurrence of CD and T1D and explore current evidences for the specific role of gluten in both conditions; specifically focusing on current evidence on the effect of gluten on the immune system and the gut microbiota.},

   abstract = {Over recent years we have seen rising many clinical and scientific innovations about celiac disease (CE), however the most important innovation that will contribute to change the future of the research and clinic in this field is the natural history of the disease. For many years it has been though that a genetic predisposition and the exposure to gluten were necessary and sufficient to develop CE. Recent studies, however, suggest that the loss of tolerance to gluten may occur in any moment of life upon certain conditions. Furthermore, several environmental factors known to play a role in shaping the intestinal microflora have also been considered related to the development of CE. Delivery mode, the infant diet and the use of antibiotics are included among these factors. To this day no large scale studies have determined if and how the microbiome composition and its metabolomic profile may influence the loss of tolerance to gluten and the consequent development of CE. In this paper we describe a prospective, multi-centric and longitudinal study on infants at risk for CE that will use different techniques to better understand the role of the microbome during the first steps in the development of the autoimmune disease.},

The only effective treatment of CD and NCGS requires removal of gluten sources from the diet. Since required adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is difficult to accomplish, efforts to develop alternative treatments have been intensifying in recent years. In this study, the non-human primate model of CD/NCGS, e.g., gluten-sensitive rhesus macaque, was utilized with the objective to evaluate the treatment potential of reduced gluten cereals using a reduced gluten (RG; 1% of normal gluten) barley mutant as a model. Conventional and RG barleys were used for the formulation of experimental chows and fed to gluten-sensitive (GS) and control macaques to determine if RG barley causes a remission of dietary gluten-induced clinical and immune responses in GS macaques. The impacts of the RG barley diet were compared with the impacts of the conventional barley-containing chow and the GFD. Although remission of the anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) serum responses and an improvement of clinical diarrhea were noted after switching the conventional to the RG barley diet, production of inflammatory cytokines, e.g., interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) by peripheral CD4+ T helper lymphocytes, persisted during the RG chow treatment and were partially abolished only upon re-administration of the GFD. It was concluded that the RG barley diet might be used for the partial improvement of gluten-induced disease but its therapeutic value still requires upgrading-by co-administration of additional treatments.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that affects approximately three million people in the United States. Furthermore, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) affects an estimated additional 6% of the population, e.g., 20 million in the U.S. The only effective treatment of CD and NCGS requires complete removal of gluten sources from the diet. While required adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is extremely difficult to accomplish, efforts to develop additional supportive treatments are needed. To facilitate these efforts, we developed a gluten-sensitive (GS) rhesus macaque model to study the effects of novel therapies. Recently reported results from phase one of this project suggest that partial improvement-but not remission-of gluten-induced disease can be accomplished by 100-fold reduction of dietary gluten, i.e., 200 ppm-by replacement of conventional dietary sources of gluten with a mutant, reduced gluten (RG) barley (lys3a)-derived source. The main focus of this (phase two) study was to determine if the inflammatory effects of the residual gluten in lys3a mutant barley grain could be further reduced by oral supplementation with a prolylendopeptidase (PE). Results reveal that PE supplementation of RG barley diet induces more complete immunological, histopathological and clinical remission than RG barley diet alone. The combined effects of RG barley diet and PE supplementation resulted in a further decrease of inflammatory mediators IFN-gamma and TNF secretion by peripheral lymphocytes, as well as decreased plasma anti-gliadin and anti-intestinal tissue transglutaminase (TG2) antibodies, diminished active caspase production in small intestinal mucosa, and eliminated clinical diarrhea-all comparable with a gluten-free diet induced remission. In summary, the beneficial results of a combined RG barley and PE administration in GS macaques may warrant the investigation of similar synergistic approaches.},

   abstract = {Autoimmunity, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and schizophrenia have been associated with one another for a long time. This paper reviews these connections and provides a context by which multiple risk factors for schizophrenia may be related. Epidemiological studies strongly link schizophrenia with autoimmune disorders including enteropathic celiac disease. Exposure to wheat gluten and bovine milk casein also contribute to non-celiac food sensitivities in susceptible individuals. Co-morbid GI inflammation accompanies humoral immunity to food antigens, occurs early during the course of schizophrenia and appears to be independent from antipsychotic-generated motility effects. This inflammation impacts endothelial barrier permeability and can precipitate translocation of gut bacteria into systemic circulation. Infection by the neurotropic gut pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, will elicit an inflammatory GI environment. Such processes trigger innate immunity, including activation of complement C1q, which also functions at synapses in the brain. The emerging field of microbiome research lies at the center of these interactions with evidence that the abundance and diversity of resident gut microbiota contribute to digestion, inflammation, gut permeability and behavior. Dietary modifications of core bacterial compositions may explain inefficient gluten digestion and how immigrant status in certain situations is a risk factor for schizophrenia. Gut microbiome research in schizophrenia is in its infancy, but data in related fields suggest disease-associated altered phylogenetic compositions. In summary, this review surveys associative and experimental data linking autoimmunity, GI activity and schizophrenia, and proposes that understanding of disrupted biological pathways outside of the brain can lend valuable information regarding pathogeneses of complex, polygenic brain disorders.},

   abstract = {Several studies have shown that a large number of patients who are fulfilling the criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are sensitive to gluten. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a gluten-free diet on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS. In this double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 148 IBS patients fulfilling the Rome III criteria were enrolled between 2011 and 2013. However, only 72 out of the 148 commenced on a gluten-free diet for up to six weeks and completed the study; clinical symptoms were recorded biweekly using a standard visual analogue scale (VAS). In the second stage after six weeks, patients whose symptoms improved to an acceptable level were randomly divided into two groups; patients either received packages containing powdered gluten (35 cases) or patients received placebo (gluten free powder) (37 cases). Overall, the symptomatic improvement was statistically different in the gluten-containing group compared with placebo group in 9 (25.7%), and 31 (83.8%) patients respectively (p < 0.001). A large number of patients labelled as irritable bowel syndrome are sensitive to gluten. Using the term of IBS can therefore be misleading and may deviate and postpone the application of an effective and well-targeted treatment strategy in gluten sensitive patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) is 10-12% in the general population worldwide. Among various disorders co-existing with AITD, the concomitance of celiac disease (CD) with AITD results in poor absorption of thyroid medications and results in higher doses of the same. Institution of gluten-free diet (GFD) in this cohort helps reduce medication doses. AIM: To screen patients with AITD for the presence of celiac autoimmunity (CA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 280 consecutive patients with AITD attending the thyroid Out-patient Department of a tertiary care hospital were screened for the presence of tissue transglutaminase antibodies (immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase). Those with a positive titer (but < 10 times the upper limit of normal) underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal mucosal biopsy for the diagnosis of CD, followed by institution of GFD in confirmed cases. RESULTS: Of a total of 280 (182 females and 98 males) patients with AITD screened, 24 (8.6%) turned out to be positive for CA. Of 24 (8.6%), 15 (8.24%) females and 9 (9.18%) males were positive for CA. There was no statistically significant difference in the thyroxine doses required for normalization of thyroid function and the weight of the patients in CA positive and CA negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CD in patients with AITD is much greater than in the general population. This forms the basis for screening patients with AITD for presence of CD.},

   abstract = {Gluten ingestion causes immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy or celiac disease in sensitive individuals, and a strict gluten-free diet greatly limits food choices. Immunoassays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are used to quantify gluten to ensure labeling compliance of gluten-free foods. Anti-gluten antibodies may not exhibit equal affinity to gluten from wheat, rye, and barley. Moreover, because wheat gluten is commonly used as a calibrator in ELISA, accurate gluten quantitation from rye and barley contaminated foods may be compromised. Immunoassays utilizing grain-specific antibodies and calibrators may help improve gluten quantitation. In this study, polyclonal antibodies raised against gluten-containing grain-specific peptides were characterized for their immunoreactivity to gluten from different grain sources. Strong immunoreactivity to multiple gluten polypeptides from wheat, rye, and barley was observed in the range 34 to 43 kDa with anti-gliadin, 11 to 15 and 72 to 95 kDa with anti-secalin, and 30 to 43 kDa with anti-hordein peptide antibodies, respectively. Minimal or no cross-reactivity with gluten from other grains was observed among these antibodies. The anti-consensus peptide antibody raised against a repetitive amino acid sequence of proline and glutamine exhibited immunoreactivity to gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and oat. The antibodies exhibited similar immunoreactivity with most of the corresponding grain cultivars by ELISA. The high specificity and minimal cross-reactivity of grain-specific antibodies suggest their potential use in immunoassays for accurate gluten quantitation.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of CD among patients presenting for pediatric rheumatology evaluation. METHODS: A total of 2125 patients presenting for initial evaluation by the Division of Pediatric Rheumatology at the Hospital for Special Surgery between June 2006 and December 2013 were screened for CD as a part of the standard initial serologic evaluation. The charts of these patients were evaluated retrospectively at the end of this period. RESULTS: 36 patients (30 girls, 6 boys, mean age 9.4 +/- 4.3 years, range 2-16 years) received a diagnosis of CD after serologic testing and evaluation by pediatric gastroenterology. Eight additional patients with known diagnoses of CD presented during this time period. The total prevalence of CD over this 6.5-year period was 2.0%. The most common presenting complaints among patients diagnosed with CD were myalgias, arthralgias, and rash. Less frequently, patients reported gastrointestinal complaints including abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. All patients reported improvement or complete resolution of their musculoskeletal symptoms after initiation of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 36 new cases of CD among children presenting for rheumatology evaluation, for an overall prevalence rate of 2.0%. The majority of patients who ultimately received a diagnosis of CD presented with extraintestinal manifestations. These results underscore the importance of screening children presenting for rheumatology evaluation for CD.},

   abstract = {Wheat is a staple food throughout the temperate world and an important source of nutrients for many millions of people. However, the last few years have seen increasing concerns about adverse effects of wheat on health, particularly in North America and Europe, with the increasing adoption of wheat-free or gluten-free diets. This relates to two concerns: that wheat products are disproportionally responsible for increases in obesity and type 2 diabetes and that wheat gluten proteins cause a range of adverse reactions, including allergies, coeliac disease and 'non-coeliac gluten sensitivity'. The first concern has been refuted in previous publications, and we therefore focus on the second here. Current evidence indicates that allergy to ingested wheat and coeliac disease (and related intolerances) each occur in up to 1% of the population. The extent to which their prevalence has increased is difficult to quantify due to improved diagnosis and increased awareness. However, neither appears to be increasing disproportionally when compared with other immunologically mediated adverse reactions to food. Other adverse reactions to wheat are more difficult to define as their mechanisms are not understood and they are therefore difficult to diagnose. In particular, 'non-coeliac wheat sensitivity' has been reported to occur in 6% or more of the population in the US. However, the application of more rigorous diagnostic criteria is likely to give substantially lower estimates of prevalence. It is therefore unlikely that the health of more than a small proportion of the population will be improved by eliminating wheat or gluten from the diet. In fact, the opposite may occur as wheat is an important source of protein, B vitamins, minerals and bioactive components.},

BACKGROUND: There have been considerable advances in evidence synthesis concerning management of IBS in the last five years, with guidelines for its management in primary care published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional web-based questionnaire survey of 275 primary care physicians. We emailed a link to a SurveyMonkey questionnaire, containing 18 items, to all eligible primary care physicians registered with three clinical commissioning groups in Leeds, UK. Participants were given one month to respond, with a reminder sent out after two weeks. FINDINGS: One-hundred and two (37.1%) primary care physicians responded. Among responders, 70% believed IBS was a diagnosis of exclusion, and >80% checked coeliac serology often or always in suspected IBS. Between >50% and >70% believed soluble fibre, antispasmodics, peppermint oil, and psychological therapies were potentially efficacious therapies. The respondents were less convinced that antidepressants or probiotics were effective. Despite perceived efficacy of psychological therapies, 80% stated these were not easily available. Levels of use of soluble fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil were in the range of 40% to >50%. Most primary care physicians obtained up-to-date evidence about IBS management from NICE guidelines. Most primary care physicians still believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and many are reluctant to use antidepressants or probiotics to treat IBS. More research studies addressing diagnosis and treatment of IBS based in primary are required.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A gluten-free diet is the only recommended treatment for coeliac disease. AIM: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of reactions to gluten among persons with coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Adults with biopsy proven, newly diagnosed coeliac disease were prospectively enrolled. A survey related to diet adherence and reactions to gluten was completed at study entry and 6 months. The Coeliac Symptom Index, Coeliac Diet Assessment Tool (CDAT) and Gluten-Free Eating Assessment Tool (GF-EAT) were used to measure coeliac disease symptoms and gluten-free diet adherence. RESULTS: Of the 105 participants, 91% reported gluten exposure <1 per month and median CDAT score was 9 (IQR 8-11), consistent with adequate adherence. A suspected symptomatic reaction to gluten was reported by 66%. Gluten consumption was unsuspected until a reaction occurred (63%) or resulted from problems ordering in a restaurant (29%). The amount of gluten consumed ranged from cross-contact (30%) to a major ingredient (10%). Median time to symptom onset was 1 h (range 10 min to 48 h), and median symptom duration was 24 h (range 1 h to 8 days). Common symptoms included abdominal pain (80%), diarrhoea (52%), fatigue (33%), headache (30%) and irritability (29%). CONCLUSIONS: Reactions to suspected gluten exposure are common among patients with coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet. Eating at restaurants and other peoples' homes remain a risk for unintentional gluten exposure. When following individuals with coeliac disease, clinicians should include questions regarding reactions to gluten as part of their assessment of gluten-free diet adherence.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between self-reported adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and the ability to determine correctly the appropriateness of particular foods in a GFD. METHODS: Persons with celiac disease were recruited through clinics and support groups. Participants completed a questionnaire with items related to GFD information sources, gluten content of 17 common foods (food to avoid, food allowed, and food to question), GFD adherence, and demographic characteristics. Diagnosis was self-reported. RESULTS: The 82 respondents (88% female) had a median of 6 y GFD experience. Most (55%) reported strict adherence, 18% reported intentional gluten consumption and 21% acknowledged rare unintentional gluten consumption. Cookbooks, advocacy groups, and print media were the most commonly used GFD information sources (85-92%). No participant identified correctly the gluten content of all 17 foods; only 30% identified at least 14 foods correctly. The median score on the Gluten-Free Diet Knowledge Scale (GFD-KS) was 11.5 (interquartile ratio, 10-13). One in five incorrect responses put the respondent at risk of consuming gluten. GFD-KS scores did not correlate with self-reported adherence or GFD duration. Patient advocacy group members scored significantly higher on the GFD-KS than non-members (12.3 versus 10.6; P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Self-report measures which do not account for the possibility of unintentional gluten ingestion overestimate GFD adherence. Individuals who believe they are following a GFD are not readily able to correctly identify foods that are GF, which suggests ongoing gluten consumption may be occurring, even among patients who believe they are "strictly" adherent. The role of patient advocacy groups and education to improve outcomes through improved adherence to a GFD requires further research.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A gluten-free diet (GFD) requires tremendous dedication, involving substantive changes to diet and lifestyle that may have a significant impact upon quality of life. The present study aimed io assess dietary adherence, knowledge of a GFD, and the emotional and lifestyle impact of a GFD. METHODS: Community dwelling adults following a GFD completed a questionnaire with items related to reasons for avoiding gluten, diagnostic testing, GFD adherence, knowledge and sources of information about a GFD, the Work and Social Adjustment Scale, and the effect of a GFD diet on lifestyle, feelings and behaviours. RESULTS: Strict GFD adherence among the 222 coeliac disease (CD) patients was 56%. Non-CD individuals (n = 38) were more likely to intentionally ingest gluten (odds ratio = 3.7; 95% confidence interval = 1.4-9.4). The adverse impact of a GFD was modest but most pronounced in the social domain. Eating shifted from the public to the domestic sphere and there were feelings of social isolation. Affective responses reflected resilience because acceptance and relief were experienced more commonly than anxiety or anger. Non-CD respondents were less knowledgeable and less likely to consult health professionals. They experienced less anger and depression and greater pleasure in eating than CD respondents. CONCLUSIONS: The findings obtained in the present suggest there is good potential for positive adaptation to the demands of a GFD; nevertheless, there is a measurable degree of social impairment that merits further study. The GFD may be a viable treatment option for conditions other than CD; however, education strategies regarding the need for diagnostic testing to exclude CD are required.},

In addition, it aimed to examine the relations of depression level and life quality with adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Twenty-five children with CD and 25 healthy controls were included. The Depression Scale for Children and the General Purpose Health-Related Quality of Life Scale for Children were performed on patients before and after receiving recommendations to follow a GFD. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the depression scores between the patients and the control subjects (P > 0.05). In contrast, total scores and scores of the emotional well-being subscale of the measure of Quality of Life Scale for Children were significantly lower in patients with CD compared with the control group (P < 0.05). No significant improvements were observed in depression or life quality scores of the total subsample of celiac patients, all of whom received a recommendation to follow a GFD (P > 0.05). Significant decrease was observed in the depression scores, however, of celiac patients who were able to actually adhere to the GFD compared with nonadherent patients. CONCLUSIONS: CD negatively affected quality of life in children. Adherence to GFD was associated with reduction in depression symptoms. Improving the adherence of celiac patients to a GFD may have a favorable effect on their depression symptoms.},

   abstract = {Background. Patients treated with interferon (IFN) based therapies may develop exacerbation of autoimmune disease. We herein present the case of a 53-year-old female patient who developed celiac disease (CD) as a result of triple therapy (interferon, ribavirin, and boceprevir) for chronic HCV. Case. 53-year-old Caucasian female with past medical history of IV drug abuse was referred for abnormal LFTs. Laboratory data showed HCV RNA of 4,515,392 IU/mL, HCV genotype 1a, with normal LFTs. She was treated with 4 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin, followed by triple therapy using boceprevir for a total of 28 weeks. Approximately 4 weeks after initiation of triple therapy patient developed loose nonbloody bowel movements and was also found to have anemia. Biopsies from first and second portions of the duodenum were consistent with CD. The patient was treated with a gluten-free diet. Her intestinal symptoms improved and the hemoglobin returned to normal. Conclusion. Chronic HCV patients being treated with interferon alfa can develop celiac disease during or after therapy. For patients with positive autoantibodies, all-oral-IFN-free regimens should be considered. Celiac disease should be considered in patients who develop CD-like symptoms while on and shortly after cessation of interferon alfa therapy.},

   abstract = {GOALS: We reviewed our celiac disease (CeD) database to study if anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody (ab) titers correlate with severity of villous abnormalities in Indian patients and to find out a cutoff value of anti-tTG ab fold-rise, which could best predict CeD. BACKGROUND: Guidelines for diagnosing CeD suggest that biopsy could be avoided in some patients with high anti-tTG ab titer. STUDY: We reviewed a cohort of 366 anti-tTG ab-positive individuals in whom duodenal biopsies were performed. Anti-tTG ab was obtained before initiation of gluten-free diet. Anti-tTG ab results were expressed in terms of fold-rise by calculating ratio of observed values with cutoff value. CeD was diagnosed if in addition to positive serology, patients had villous atrophy (>Marsh grade 2) and unequivocal response to gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The mean anti-tTG fold-rise in groups with Marsh grade </=2 was 2.6 (+/-2.5), grade 3a was 4.0 (+/-3.9), 3b was 5.7 (+/-5.1), and 3c was 11.8 (+/-8.0). The positive likelihood ratio for diagnosing CeD was 15.4 and 27.4 at 12- and 14-fold-rise of anti-tTG ab titer, respectively. The positive predictive value of diagnosis of CeD was 100% when anti-tTG ab titer was 14-fold higher over the cutoff value. Fifty-seven (43.9%) individuals with anti-tTG titer rise <2-fold high also had CeD. CONCLUSIONS: As severity of villous abnormality increases, titer of anti-tTG also rises. Presence of villous atrophy can be predicted at very high anti-tTG ab titer. In contrast to emerging belief, mucosal biopsies should be performed even if anti-tTG ab titer is <2 times, because many patients with CeD have low titers.},

   abstract = {GOALS: We retrospectively studied all seropositive Marsh 1 patients seen at 2 tertiary care hospitals in the last 15 years to determine their clinical, serological, and histologic outcomes. BACKGROUND: Patients with positive celiac serologies and Marsh 1 histology represent an understudied subgroup of patients, and it is unclear whether they should be advised to adopt a gluten-free diet (GFD). STUDY: Subjects were identified based on positive celiac serologies and Marsh 1 histology while on a full-gluten diet. Clinical presentation and baseline laboratory data were noted. Clinical course, repeat serologies, and histology were determined. RESULTS: Of 620 patients with positive celiac serologies and abnormal duodenal histology, we identified 36 (5.8%) with positive tissue transglutaminase and/or antiendomysial antibodies and Marsh 1 lesions who had adequate follow-up. Abdominal pain was the commonest (47.2%) presenting symptom. Twenty-eight patients were advised to adopt GFD, whereas 8 were not. Among patients treated with GFD, 88.9% improved symptomatically and 95% normalized serology. In contrast, among patients who continued to consume gluten, 85.7% remained symptomatic and 80% had persistently positive serologies. Among the 8 patients on normal diet, 5 underwent repeat biopsy, and 4 of them had the same or worse histology, with 3 patients progressing to Marsh 3c. Among the 28 patients on GFD, 5 underwent repeat biopsy and all improved to normal histology. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with positive celiac serology and Marsh 1 lesions benefit from GFD and, if not treated, a majority will continue to be symptomatic and remain at risk of progressing to villous atrophy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the prevalence of coeliac disease among children with short stature at a tertiary care centre and to define the predictors for coeliac disease, if any, in them. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed the case records of children and adolescents with growth retardation attending the Paediatric Endocrinology Clinic from January 2008 to June 2011. All patients underwent the multi-tier stratified diagnostic protocol for complete evaluation of short stature. Coeliac disease was screened using IgA-anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody. The diagnosis of coeliac disease was made on the basis of the modified European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria. RESULTS: Of 432 patients (238 boys) who presented with short stature, 72 (16.7%) had physiological, while 360 (83.3%) had pathological causes. Endocrine causes were growth hormone deficiency (86 patients, 19.9%), hypopituitarism (31, 7.2%), hypothyroidism (22, 5.1%) and others (7, 1.6%). The systemic causes were: coeliac disease (47, 10.9%), haematological diseases (14, 3.2%), renal diseases (11, 2.5%) and others (24, 5.6%). Chronic diarrhoea (OR 15.7, 95% CI 7.8-31.5) and anaemia (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.9-12.7]) were significant predictors for coeliac disease in patients with short stature. There was a definite response to gluten-free diet in them and the mean (SD) growth velocity measured over at least 6 months of gluten-free diet was 8.1 (3.0) cm/year. CONCLUSION: Nearly 11% of patients presenting with short stature have coeliac disease. In these patients chronic diarrhoea and anaemia were significant predictors of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The condition non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is clinically similar to coeliac disease, but lack objective diagnostic criteria. Symptom relief on gluten-free diet followed by gluten containing food challenge may confirm the condition in clinical settings. AIM: To describe the results of an open bread challenge in patients with suspected NCGS, and to compare the results with recently suggested cut-offs for symptom change. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-six patients (12 males) self-instituted on gluten-free diet with negative coeliac disease diagnostics were examined for NCGS by an open bread challenge. Symptoms were reported by Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, IBS-version (GSRS-IBS) and visual analogue scale (VAS). Results were retrospectively compared to the Salerno and Monash cut-offs for symptom change. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were diagnosed with NCGS. Total GSRS-IBS score and overall symptoms by VAS increased significantly in NCGS (p < .001), but not in non-NCGS patients (p < .12 and p = .08, respectively). Total GSRS-IBS challenge score and overall symptoms by VAS were significantly higher in NCGS than in non-NCGS patients (53 vs. 37, p = .004 and 76 vs. 39 mm, p = .02, respectively). Applying the Salerno and Monash cut-offs, 63 and 75% would be classified with NCGS, respectively. According to total GSRS-IBS absolute agreement was lowest between clinician's diagnosis and Salerno cut-off (63%) and highest between Salerno and Monash cut-offs (88%). CONCLUSION: Clinician diagnosed 85% with NCGS. The proportion of NCGS was lower according to the Salerno and Monash cut-offs. The Salerno cut-off should be the starting point for a common definition of symptom change.},

   abstract = {Fibromyalgia syndrome is characterized by chronic generalized pain accompanied by a broad symptomatologic spectrum. Besides chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances, headaches and cognitive dysfunction that are extensively described in the literature, a considerable proportion of patients with fibromyalgia experience gastrointestinal symptoms that are commonly overlooked in the studies that are not specifically dedicated to evaluate these manifestations. Nevertheless, various attempts were undertaken to explore the gastrointestinal dimension of fibromyalgia. Several studies have demonstrated an elevated comorbidity of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among patients with fibromyalgia. Other studies have investigated the frequency of presentation of gastrointestinal symptoms in fibromyalgia in a nonspecific approach describing several gastrointestinal complaints frequently reported by these patients such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia and bowel changes, among others. Several underlying mechanisms that require further investigation could serve as potential explanatory hypotheses for the appearance of such manifestations. These include sensitivity to dietary constituents such as gluten, lactose or FODMAPs or alterations in the brain-gut axis as a result of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or subclinical enteric infections such as giardiasis. The gastrointestinal component of fibromyalgia constitutes a relevant element of the multidisciplinary pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying fibromyalgia that need to be unveiled, as this would contribute to the adequate designation of relevant treatment alternatives corresponding to these manifestations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia is a chronic musculoskeletal pain syndrome characterized by a broad spectrum of manifestations. Patients with fibromyalgia frequently suffer from manifestations similar to those experienced by patients with gluten-related disorders raising the possibility that some patients with fibromyalgia could suffer from underlying gluten sensitivity. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess whether avoiding gluten among patients with fibromyalgia and gluten sensitivity is beneficial. METHODS: Adult patients with fibromyalgia presenting gluten sensitivity symptoms are randomly allocated to receive gluten-free diet or hypocaloric diet for 24 weeks. The primary outcome measure is the mean change in the number of experienced gluten sensitivity symptoms. Secondary outcome measures include the mean changes in the body mass index, Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Brief Pain Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory-II, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Short-Form Health Survey and Patient Global Impression Scale of Severity. Other secondary outcome measures include the frequency of potential adverse events and the proportion of responders according to the Patient Global Impression Scale of Improvement. DISCUSSION: Previous studies assessing dietary interventions in fibromyalgia primarily evaluated their effects on the severity and impact of fibromyalgia symptoms and pain. The current study is the first to evaluate the effects of gluten-free diet on the gluten sensitivity symptoms experienced by patients with fibromyalgia. The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the potential role of gluten sensitivity in fibromyalgia.},

   abstract = {Accurate and reliable quantification methods for gluten in food are necessary to ensure proper product labeling and thus safeguard the gluten sensitive consumer against exposure. Immunochemical detection is the method of choice, as it is sensitive, rapid and relatively easy to use. Although a wide range of detection kits are commercially available, there are still many difficulties in gluten detection that have not yet been overcome. This review gives an overview of the currently commercially available immunochemical detection methods, and discusses the problems that still exist in gluten detection in food. The largest problems are encountered in the extraction of gluten from food matrices, the choice of epitopes targeted by the detection method, and the use of a standardized reference material. By comparing the available techniques with the unmet needs in gluten detection, the possible benefit of a new multiplex immunoassay is investigated. This detection method would allow for the detection and quantification of multiple harmful gluten peptides at once and would, therefore, be a logical advancement in gluten detection in food.},

   abstract = {AIM: Because of increasing awareness of variations in the use of pancreatic exocrine replacement therapy, the Australasian Pancreatic Club decided it was timely to re-review the literature and create new Australasian guidelines for the management of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI). METHODS: A working party of expert clinicians was convened and initially determined that by dividing the types of presentation into three categories for the likelihood of PEI (definite, possible and unlikely) they were able to consider the difficulties of diagnosing PEI and relate these to the value of treatment for each diagnostic category. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Recent studies confirm that patients with chronic pancreatitis receive similar benefit from pancreatic exocrine replacement therapy (PERT) to that established in children with cystic fibrosis. Severe acute pancreatitis is frequently followed by PEI and PERT should be considered for these patients because of their nutritional requirements. Evidence is also becoming stronger for the benefits of PERT in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. However there is as yet no clear guide to help identify those patients in the 'unlikely' PEI group who would benefit from PERT. For example, patients with coeliac disease, diabetes mellitus, irritable bowel syndrome and weight loss in the elderly may occasionally be given a trial of PERT, but determining its effectiveness will be difficult. The starting dose of PERT should be from 25,000-40,000 IU lipase taken with food. This may need to be titrated up and there may be a need for proton pump inhibitors in some patients to improve efficacy.},

Little is known about their characteristics and their role in the disease. In this study, using high-throughput sequencing of the IgH V region (IGHV) genes, we have studied features of TG2-specific PCs and their related B cell clones in peripheral blood. We found that TG2-specific PCs from both untreated and treated patients have acquired lower number of somatic hypermutation and used focused IGHV repertoire with overrepresentation of the IGHV3-48, IGHV4-59, IGHV5-10-1, and IGHV5-51 gene segments. Furthermore, these PCs were clonally expanded and showed signs of affinity maturation. Lineage trees demonstrated shared clones between gut PCs and blood memory B cells, primarily IgAs. Some trees also involved IgG cells, suggesting that anti-TG2 IgA and IgG responses are related. Similarly to TG2-specific PCs, clonally related memory IgA B cells of blood showed lower mutation rates with biased usage of IGHV3-48 and IGHV5-51. Such memory cells were rare in peripheral blood, yet detectable in most patients assessed by production of anti-TG2 Abs in vitro following stimulation of cells from patients who had been on a long-term gluten-free diet. Thus, the Ab response to TG2 in CD, while maintaining its IGHV gene usage, is dynamically regulated in response to gluten exposure with a low degree of maintenance at both PC and memory B cell levels in patients in remission.},

Establishing a robust diagnosis is critical for improved quality of life and prevention of co-morbidities, although treatment is associated with a substantial life-long burden of care for patients and families. Unfortunately, CD remains a challenging diagnosis. As awareness of the disease increases, more diagnoses of CD are being made by primary care physicians. In fact, many patients may not present to a gastroenterologist because their symptoms are not clearly linked to a gastrointestinal pathology. Also, many patients are starting a gluten-free diet without prior testing, a circumstance that leads to even more confusion. Lastly, the number of serologic and genetic tests, and the role of endoscopy, can be confusing. The purpose of this review is to examine diagnostic testing strategies, focusing on published guidelines, for the evaluation of patients with suspected CD.},

   abstract = {Motivated by the necessity of new and efficient methods for dietary gluten control of celiac patients, we have developed a simple and highly sensitive SPR biosensor for the detection of gluten peptides in urine. The sensing methodology enables rapid and label-free quantification of the gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) by using G12 mAb. The overall performance of the biosensor has been in-depth optimized and evaluated in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility, reaching a limit of detection of 0.33 ng mL(-1). Besides, the robustness and stability of the methodology permit the continuous use of the biosensor for more than 100 cycles with excellent repeatability. Special efforts have been focused on preventing and minimizing possible interferences coming from urine matrix enabling a direct analysis in this fluid without requiring extraction or purification procedures. Our SPR biosensor has proven to detect and identify gluten consumption by evaluating urine samples from healthy and celiac individuals with different dietary gluten conditions. This novel biosensor methodology represents a novel approach to quantify the digested gluten peptides in human urine with outstanding sensitivity in a rapid and non-invasive manner. Our technique should be considered as a promising opportunity to develop Point-of-Care (POC) devices for an efficient, simple and accurate gluten free diet (GFD) monitoring as well as therapy follow-up of celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a multifactorial and polygenic disease with autoimmune features. The disease is caused by an inappropriate immune response to gluten. Elimination of gluten from the diet leads to disease remission, which is the basis for today's treatment of the disease. There is an unmet need for new alternative treatments. KEY MESSAGES: Genetic findings point to adaptive immunity playing a key role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. MHC is by far the single most important genetic factor in the disease. In addition, a number of non-MHC genes, the majority of which have functions related to T cells and B cells, also contribute to the genetic predisposition, but each of them has modest effect. The primary MHC association is with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. These HLA molecules present gluten epitopes to CD4+ T cells which can be considered to be the master regulators of the immune reactions that lead to the disease. The epitopes which the T cells recognize are usually deamidated, and this deamidation is mediated by the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Celiac disease patients have disease-specific antibodies. In addition to antibodies to gluten, these include autoantibodies to TG2. Antibodies to deamidated gluten are nearly as specific for celiac disease as the anti-TG2 antibodies. Both types of antibodies appear only to be produced in subjects who are HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 when they are consuming gluten. CONCLUSION: It is hardly coincidental that TG2 is implicated in T-cell epitope formation and at the same time a target for autoantibodies. Understanding this connection is one of the major challenges for obtaining a complete understanding of how gluten causes tissue destruction and remodeling of the mucosa in the small bowel.},

   abstract = {Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) of childhood. Only a minority of patients with FAP seek medical attention, often presenting to the primary care physician while symptoms are still evolving. The bio-psychosocial model of treatment not only aims to alleviate the illness symptoms but also identifies and remedies the psychological comorbidities and social factors that contribute to illness behavior. Many patients with a mild illness can be managed in the primary care setting. However those with chronic, severe, frequently relapsing, and disabling illness usually are referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist. One of the reason for referral is to exclude organic disorders such as peptic ulcer disease, celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease which can present with chronic abdominal pain. Recent data suggest that psychological therapy is very effective in alleviating symptoms, a subset of patients may require dietary modification and medications as an adjunct to psychological treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disease of the small intestine caused by an immunologic hypersensitivity reaction to dietary wheat gluten. OBJECTIVES: We sought to clone, express, and perform IgA epitope mapping of a CD-specific wheat antigen and to study its usefulness for identifying patients with CD and monitoring adherence to a gluten-free diet. METHODS: A synthetic gene coding for gamma-gliadin 1 (GG1) was expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant gamma-gliadin 1 (rGG1) was purified and characterized biochemically, structurally, and immunologically by using sera from patients with CD and control subjects. Overlapping GG1 peptides were synthesized for IgA and IgG epitope mapping. GG1 and peptide-specific antibodies were raised for tracing GG1 in cereals and dietary wheat products and to study its resistance to digestion. RESULTS: rGG1 was expressed and purified. rGG1-based IgA ELISAs performed in populations of patients with CD and control subjects showed a specificity of 92.9%, which was higher than that of gliadin extract (e). Furthermore, it allowed monitoring of adherence to a gluten-free diet in patients. A 26-amino-acid peptide from the proline-glutamine-rich repetitive N-terminal region was identified as the immunodominant IgA epitope. GG1-related antigens were found in rye, barley, and spelt but not in oat, rice, or maize. GG1 was detected in dietary wheat products after baking, and in particular, the major IgA epitope-containing region was resistant against digestion. CONCLUSIONS: rGG1 and its epitope might be useful for identifying patients with CD, monitoring treatment, and studying the pathomechanisms of CD and development of preventive and therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic, small intestinal inflammatory disease mediated by dietary gluten and related prolamins. The only current therapeutic option is maintenance of a strict life-long gluten-free diet, which implies substantial burden for CD patients. Different treatment regimes might be feasible, including masking of toxic celiac peptides with blocking antibodies or fragments thereof. The objective of this study was therefore to select and produce a recombinant avian single-chain fragment variable (scFv) directed against peptic-tryptic digested gliadin (PT-Gliadin) and related celiac toxic entities. RESULTS: Gluten-free raised chicken of same age were immunized with PT-Gliadin. Chicken splenic lymphocytes, selected with antigen-coated magnetic beads, served as RNA source for the generation of cDNA. Chicken VH and VL genes were amplified from the cDNA by PCR to generate full-length scFv constructs consisting of VH and VL fragments joined by a linker sequence. ScFv constructs were ligated in a prokaryotic expression vector, which provides a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. ScFvs from several bacterial clones were expressed in soluble form and crude cell lysates screened for binding to PT-Gliadin by ELISA. We identified an enriched scFv motif, which showed reactivity to PT-Gliadin. One selected scFv candidate was expressed and purified to homogeneity. Polyclonal anti-PT-Gliadin IgY, purified from egg yolk of immunized chicken, served as control. ScFv binds in a dose-dependent manner to PT-Gliadin, comparable to IgY. Furthermore, IgY competitively displaces scFv from PT-Gliadin and natural wheat flour digest, indicating a common epitope of scFv and IgY. ScFv was tested for reactivity to different gastric digested dietary grain flours. ScFv detects common and khorasan wheat comparably with binding affinities in the high nanomolar range, while rye is detected to a lesser extent. Notably, barley and cereals which are part of the gluten-free diet, like corn and rice, are not detected by scFv. Similarly, the pseudo-grain amaranth, used as gluten-free alternative, is not targeted by scFv. This data indicate that scFv specifically recognizes toxic cereal peptides relevant in CD. CONCLUSION: ScFv can be of benefit for future CD treatment regimes.},

   abstract = {A hallmark of the gluten-driven enteropathy celiac disease is autoantibody production towards the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) that catalyzes the formation of covalent protein-protein cross-links. Activation of TG2-specific B cells likely involves gluten-specific CD4 T cells as production of the antibodies is dependent on disease-associated HLA-DQ allotypes and dietary intake of gluten. IgA plasma cells producing TG2 antibodies with few mutations are abundant in the celiac gut lesion. These plasma cells and serum antibodies to TG2 drop rapidly after initiation of a gluten-free diet, suggestive of extrafollicular responses or germinal center reactions of short duration. High antigen avidity is known to promote such responses, and is also important for breakage of self-tolerance. We here inquired whether TG2 avidity could be a feature relevant to celiac disease. Using recombinant enzyme we show by dynamic light scattering and gel electrophoresis that TG2 efficiently utilizes itself as a substrate due to conformation-dependent homotypic association, which involves the C-terminal domains of the enzyme. This leads to the formation of covalently linked TG2 multimers. The presence of exogenous substrate such as gluten peptide does not inhibit TG2 self-cross-linking, but rather results in formation of TG2-TG2-gluten complexes. The celiac disease autoantibody epitopes, clustered in the N-terminal part of TG2, are conserved in the TG2-multimers as determined by mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation analysis. TG2 multimers are superior to TG2 monomer in activating A20 B cells transduced with TG2-specific B-cell receptor, and uptake of TG2-TG2-gluten multimers leads to efficient activation of gluten-specific T cells. Efficient catalytic self-multimerization of TG2 and generation of multivalent TG2 antigen decorated with gluten peptides suggest a mechanism by which self-reactive B cells are activated to give abundant numbers of plasma cells in celiac disease. Importantly, high avidity of the antigen could explain why TG2-specific plasma cells show signs of an extrafollicular generation pathway.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an increasingly common disease of the small intestine that occurs in genetically susceptible subjects by ingestion of cereal gluten proteins. Gluten is highly abundant in the modern diet and well tolerated by most individuals. In CD, however, an erroneous but highly specific, adaptive immune response is mounted toward certain parts of the gluten proteome. The resulting intestinal destruction is reversible and resolved upon removal of gluten from the diet. Post-translational modification (deamidation) of gluten peptides by transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is essential for the peptides to act as HLA-DQ-restricted T-cell antigens. Characteristically, deamidated gluten and the self-protein TG2 both become targets of highly disease specific B-cell responses. These antibodies share several peculiar characteristics despite being directed against vastly different antigens, which suggests a common mechanism of development. Importantly, no clear function has been ascribed to the antibodies and their contribution to disease may relate to their function as antigen receptors of the B cells rather than as soluble immunoglobulins. Adaptive immunity against gluten and TG2 appears not to be sufficient for establishment of the disease lesion, and it has been suggested that stress responses in the intestinal epithelium are essential for the development of full-blown disease and tissue damage. In this review we will summarize current concepts of the immune pathology of CD with particular focus on recent advances in our understanding of disease specific B-cell responses.},

   abstract = {GOALS: To estimate the frequency and cause of nonresponsive celiac disease (CD). BACKGROUND: Treatment of CD is based on life-long adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Some celiac patients experience persistence of symptoms despite a GFD. This condition is defined as nonresponsive CD. STUDY: Celiac patients on a GFD for at least 12 months underwent diet compliance assessment, laboratory tests, breath tests, endoscopic, and histologic evaluations according to the symptoms/signs reported. RESULTS: Seventy of 321 (21.8%) patients had persistent or recurrent symptoms/signs. The cause of symptom persistence was evaluated in 56 of 70 patients. Thirteen of 56 (23%) patients were antiendomysial antibody positive. Among the patients with negative serology, 1 had fibromyalgia, and 3 had evidence that disproved the diagnosis of CD. The remaining 39 patients with negative serology underwent duodenal biopsy sampling, which evidenced histologic alterations in 24 patients. Among the 15 patients with normal histology 3 were lactose intolerant, 9 had irritable bowel syndrome, 2 had gastroesophageal reflux disease, and in 1 patient a cause for the persistent symptom was not identified. In patients with confirmed diagnosis of CD, exposure to dietary gluten was the main cause of persistence of symptoms/signs, and consistently after dietary modification, symptoms resolved in 63% of the patients at later time points during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Nonresponsive CD occurs in nearly one fifth of celiac patients on GFD and its occurrence suggests further investigations to optimize the management of celiac patients.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Post-translational modifications of proteins can generate antigenic conformations that may cause autoimmune diseases in persons with specific HLA-haplotypes. Monocytes and macrophages, attracted to an inflamed site, can release post-translationally acting enzymes, such as transglutaminases and peptidylarginine deiminases. In vivo, the activation of these enzymes is crucial for the further course of event. Our hypothesis is that zinc modulates the activation of these calcium-dependent thiol-enzymes. Persons with celiac disease carry antibodies against deamidated dietary gluten and against transglutaminase type 2. Similarly, antibodies against citrulline-containing peptides and against peptidylarginine deiminase are detected in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, in two major autoimmune diseases, antibodies are detected against post-translationally modified proteins and against the thiol-enzymes responsible for catalyzing the modifications. In vitro, physiological concentrations of zinc reversibly inhibit the calcium-dependent activation of transglutaminases. Zinc attenuates the calcium-induced increase in affinity between transglutaminase 2 and serum from patients with celiac disease. Peptidylarginine deiminases are also inhibited by zinc. Moreover, zinc is rapidly redistributed in animals when an infection is induced. This pathway starting with an unspecific inflammation and ending up with an immune reaction against a specific tissue constitutes a theme with variations in other autoimmune diseases, such as dermatitis herpetiformis, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes. Inhibitors against transglutaminases and peptidylarginine deiminases have a great pharmacological potential. Interestingly, a large portion of the population may have been exposed to such an inhibitor. The primary metabolite of ethanol, acetaldehyde, can probably function as an irreversible inhibitor of these enzymes by forming a hemithioacetal with the thiol group of the active site. Not surprisingly, epidemiological studies have shown that alcohol is beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis. We predict that a similar situation will be observed in multiple sclerosis. The affinity of chelators such as EDTA and EGTA for Zn(2+) is three orders of magnitude greater than that for Ca(2+). This frequently overlooked complication imposes problems in biomedical research since a restoration of the zinc level can never be achieved in a blood sample which has been anti-coagulated by calcium chelators. The new synthetic direct thrombin inhibitors may offer a better way of preventing coagulation in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Post-translational modifications are of potential interest in autoimmune diseases. The in vivo activation of calcium-dependent thiol-enzymes catalyzing these alterations, such as the transglutaminases and the peptidylarginine deiminases, is crucial for this pathway. According to our hypothesis, zinc is the modulator of this key function.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: In patients with positive results from serologic tests for celiac disease, analysis of tissues samples from the duodenal bulb, in addition to those from other parts of the small bowel, might increase the diagnostic yield. However, biopsies are not routinely collected from the duodenal bulb because of concerns that villous atrophy detected there could be caused by other disorders (Brunner glands or peptic duodenitis, gastric metaplasia, shorter villi, or lymphoid follicles). We investigated whether analysis of biopsies from duodenal bulbs of all patients undergoing endoscopy (a population with a low probability for celiac disease) increases diagnoses of celiac disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 679 patients (63% female; mean age, 50 years) from whom duodenal bulb and small bowel biopsies were collected during endoscopy at 3 Mayo Clinic sites, from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. Records were reviewed for age, sex, pathology findings, serology test results (HLA DQ2 or DQ), indications for biopsy analyses, and adherence to a gluten-free diet. Patients with celiac disease were identified on the basis of increased intraepithelial lymphocytosis, with or without villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia, and results from serology tests. Findings from duodenal bulbs were compared with diagnoses using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Of all patients undergoing endoscopy, 16 patients (2%) were found to have celiac disease. Analysis of the duodenal bulb biopsies identified 1 patient (0.1%) with celiac disease limited to this region. Of 399 patients whose celiac serology was not known before endoscopic examination, only 2 patients had histologic changes consistent with celiac disease but not limited to duodenal bulb. Abnormal duodenal histology was detected in 265 patients (39%), most commonly in the bulb (n = 241; P < .0001). Of abnormal bulb histologies, chronic peptic duodenitis was most common (observed in 114 patients, 47%). In patients with a normal distal duodenum (n = 576), the duodenal bulb had abnormal histology in 162 (28%). CONCLUSIONS: In a low pretest probability cohort, separate sampling of the duodenal bulb had minimal effect on celiac disease detection. Abnormal histologic findings are more commonly detected in the duodenal bulb; although they do not seem to impair identification of celiac disease, their clinical implications are unclear.},

He also had elevated antibody markers for celiac disease. He was diagnosed with the rare, but well-described syndrome of celiac disease, epilepsy, and cerebral calcifications (CEC). He failed a brief trial of gluten-free diet and went on to have a right temporal lobectomy with sustained freedom from disabling seizures. This case is an example of the growing recognition of neurologic disorders associated with celiac disease. It also provides an example of the characteristic radiographic sign associated with CEC.},

   abstract = {Beside digesting nutrients and absorbing solutes and electrolytes, the intestinal epithelium with its barrier function is in charge of a tightly controlled antigen trafficking from the intestinal lumen to the submucosa. This trafficking dictates the delicate balance between tolerance and immune response causing inflammation. Loss of barrier function secondary to upregulation of zonulin, the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions, leads to uncontrolled influx of dietary and microbial antigens. Additional insights on zonulin mechanism of action and the recent appreciation of the role that altered intestinal permeability can play in the development and progression of chronic inflammatory disorders has increased interest of both basic scientists and clinicians on the potential role of zonulin in the pathogenesis of these diseases. This review focuses on the recent research implicating zonulin as a master regulator of intestinal permeability linked to the development of several chronic inflammatory disorders.},

   abstract = {Iron deficiency is not just anemia; it can be responsible for a long list of other manifestations. This topic is of great importance, especially in infancy and early childhood, for a variety of reasons. Firstly, iron need is maximum in this period. Secondly, diet in infancy is usually deficient in iron. Thirdly and most importantly, iron deficiency at this age can result in neurodevelopmental and cognitive deficits, which may not be reversible. Hypochromia and microcytosis in a complete blood count (CBC) makes iron deficiency anemia (IDA) most likely diagnosis. Absence of response to iron should make us look for other differential diagnosis like beta thalassemia trait and anemia of chronic disease. Celiac disease is the most important cause of true IDA not responding to oral iron therapy. While oral ferrous sulphate is the cheapest and most effective therapy for IDA, simple nonpharmacological and pharmacological measures can go a long way in prevention of iron deficiency.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The only current treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet. The ubiquitous presence of gluten in groceries, however, makes the diet burdensome and difficult to maintain, and alternative treatment options are thus needed. Here, the important role of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in the pathogenesis of celiac disease makes it an attractive target for drug development. AREAS COVERED: The present paper gives an overview of TG2 and addresses its significance in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. Moreover, the article summarizes preclinical studies performed with TG2 inhibitors and scrutinizes issues related to this therapeutic approach. EXPERT OPINION: Activation of TG2 in the intestinal mucosa is central in celiac disease pathogenesis and researchers have therefore suggested TG2 inhibitors as a potential therapeutic approach. However, a prerequisite for such a drug is that it should be specific for TG2 and not affect the activity of other members of the transglutaminase family. Such compounds have already been introduced and tested in vitro, but a major obstacle to further development is the lack of a well-defined animal model for celiac disease. Nonetheless, with encouraging results in preclinical studies clinical trials with TG2 inhibitors are eagerly awaited.},

Very few large series of lymphocytic colitis of childhood occurrence are available in the medical literature. Ten cases each of lymphocytic colitis and of colonic lymphocytosis of other diagnosis, all with duodenal disaccharidases analysis data, were collected from the files of our institution. The electronic medical records were reviewed and multiple variables were analyzed. The ten patients with lymphocytic colitis presented with diarrhea. Of these, three had abdominal pain. The age range was 2-18 years. Nearly all patients were Caucasian (90%) and 70% were female. Endoscopically, most had normal appearing colonic mucosa. Significant past medical history, family medical history and associated comorbidities included celiac disease, Down syndrome, juvenile arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the most revealing observation was that the majority of cases (80%) were associated with lactase deficiency and, for the most part, gastrointestinal symptoms improved simply by treatment with Lactaid or avoidance of dairy products. This association is statistically significant. Our clinicopathological study indicates that the typical pediatric patient is a female Caucasian. A large of portion of the patients had associated lactase deficiency and improved on Lactaid supplement alone.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The results of studies assessing whether patients with Down syndrome have increased risk of coeliac disease are contradictory. The prevalence of coeliac disease in patients with Down syndrome is estimated at a wide range between 1% to as much as 18.6%. AIM: To assess coeliac disease prevalence in patients with Down syndrome in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study enrolled 301 patients with Down syndrome from six centres in Poland (Wroclaw, Sandomierz, Rzeszow, Grudziadz, Katowice, and Bydgoszcz). We measured the concentration of anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies and anti-deamidated gliadin peptide IgG antibodies in all patients. Patients with abnormal positive (> 10 U/ml) or inconclusive (7-10 U/ml) result of the serological test were offered endoscopic biopsy of the small intestine in the main centre. RESULTS: In 31 (10.3%) patients increased concentrations of the investigated antibodies were found, including 19 (6.3%) patients with increased tTg-IgA concentration, 27 (8.97%) patients with increased concentration of DGP-IgG, and 15 (4.98%) patients with increased concentration of both types of antibodies. Endoscopic biopsy of the small intestine was planned for all 31 patients with abnormal results of at least one antibody test and for 2 patients with inconclusive results. One of them suffered from previously diagnosed and histologically confirmed coeliac disease. Biopsy was not conducted in 9 patients due to contraindications, lack of their consent, or introduction of a gluten-free diet by the parents before the examination. In a group of 23 patients who underwent endoscopic biopsy of the small intestine, in 15 patients the histopathological picture of the small intestinal mucosa was typical for coeliac disease, 2 patients were diagnosed with lesions of grade 1 according to the classification by Marsh-Oberhuber, 1 patient was diagnosed with focal shortening of villi and hypertrophy of the crypts with no intraepithelial lymphocytosis (remains under gastrological observation), 2 patients were diagnosed with mucosal inflammation of the duodenum, and 3 patients were found to have a normal histopathological picture of the small intestine. Analysis of the data included in the questionnaires of all patients showed no statistically significant differences in the body height, body mass index, prevalence of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipations, recurrent stomatitis, enamel hypoplasia, thyroid diseases, or hypertransaminasaemia between the groups of patients with normal and abnormal serological test results. Significantly higher prevalence of abdominal flatulence (p < 0.05) and epilepsy (p < 0.05) was found in the group of patients whose serological test results were negative. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Down syndrome are a high-risk group for coeliac disease in the Polish population, with an estimated prevalence of at least 5.4%. Serological tools based on tTG-IgA and DGP-IgG tests are useful for the diagnosis of coeliac disease in Down syndrome patients. tTG-IgA test may be superior to DGP-IgG test in patients with normal total IgA level. Tests for coeliac disease should be carried out in all Polish patients with Down syndrome, regardless of the clinical picture.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition recommended in 2008, based on observational data, to avoid both early (<4 months) and late (>/=7 months) introduction of gluten and to introduce gluten while the infant is still being breast-fed. New evidence prompted ESPGHAN to revise these recommendations. OBJECTIVE: To provide updated recommendations regarding gluten introduction in infants and the risk of developing coeliac disease (CD) during childhood. SUMMARY: The risk of inducing CD through a gluten-containing diet exclusively applies to persons carrying at least one of the CD risk alleles. Because genetic risk alleles are generally not known in an infant at the time of solid food introduction, the following recommendations apply to all infants, although they are derived from studying families with first-degree relatives with CD. Although breast-feeding should be promoted for its other well-established health benefits, neither any breast-feeding nor breast-feeding during gluten introduction has been shown to reduce the risk of CD. Gluten may be introduced into the infant's diet anytime between 4 and 12 completed months of age. In children at high risk for CD, earlier introduction of gluten (4 vs 6 months or 6 vs 12 months) is associated with earlier development of CD autoimmunity (defined as positive serology) and CD, but the cumulative incidence of each in later childhood is similar. Based on observational data pointing to the association between the amount of gluten intake and risk of CD, consumption of large quantities of gluten should be avoided during the first weeks after gluten introduction and during infancy. The optimal amounts of gluten to be introduced at weaning, however, have not been established.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is caused due to intake of gluten, a protein component in wheat, barley, and rye. The only treatment currently available for CD is strict lifetime adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) which is a diet that excludes wheat, barley, and rye. There is limited information on barriers to following a GFD. The present study aimed to investigate the compliance with a GFD, barriers to compliance, and the impact of compliance on the quality of life (QOL) in Iranian children and adolescents suffering from CD. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 65 known cases of CD (both males and females), diagnosed in Namazi Hospital, a large referral center in south of Iran, selected by census were studied in 2014. Dietary compliance was assessed using a questionnaire. A disease-specific QOL questionnaire for children with CD (the celiac disease DUX [CDDUX]) was used. Comparisons between categorical variables were performed using chi-square test. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients, 38 females (58.5%) and 27 (41.5%) males, were surveyed. Mean (+/- standard deviation [SD]) age of the respondents was 11.3 (+/-3.8) years. Dietary compliance was reported by 35 (53.8%) patients. The mean (+/- SD) CDDUX score was higher in dietary-compliant patients (33.5 [+/-19.4] vs 26.7 [+/-13.6], respectively, P=0.23). The score of CDDUX in parents of patients in dietary-compliant group was more than the noncompliant patients (28.1 [+/-13.5] vs 22.1 [+/-14], respectively, P=0.1). Barriers to noncompliance were poor or unavailability (100%), high cost (96.9%), insufficient labeling (84.6%), poor palatability (76.9%), and no information (69.23%). CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the patients with CD reported dietary compliance. Poor or unavailability was found to be the most important barrier contributing to noncompliance. The QOL was better in compliant patients. Proposed strategies to improve compliance are greater availability of gluten-free products, better food labeling, and better education about the diet and condition.},

   abstract = {AIM: This study was aimed to evaluate symptomatic as well as histopathologic response to GFD in patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathies including celiac disease, lymphocytic duodenosis and non-specific duodenitis. BACKGROUND: Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the main treatment of celiac disease. However, its impact on other disorders of gluten sensitivity spectrum is less clear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective observational study in Modarres hospital Tehran, Iran, 35 patients with chronic manifestations including low BMI, diarrhea, greasy stool and bloating were evaluated using serology for anti-tTG, endoscopy and histopathology. Patients were categorized in three diagnostic groups accordingly including celiac disease (CD), lymphocytic doudenosis (LD) and non-specific duodenitis (NSD). All patients were put on a GFD for 6 months, and subjective symptomatic response, serology, endoscopy and histopathologic tests were repeated and compared with baselines and among groups. RESULTS: Of the total 35 patients, 5 had CD (14.3%), 9 had LD (25.7%) and 21 (60%) had NSD. Bloating was the most common symptom followed by diarrhea. Majority of patients (80%) had low BMI. All symptoms alleviated following a GFD but bloating was the only significant one. A significant increase was found in total mean BMI (17.3+/-0.7 v.s. 17.9+/-0.9). Histopathologic examination showed a complete resolution in 48.5% (n=17) patients, 10 in NSD group, 4 in LD group and 3 in CD group. Final prevalence of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (LD and NSD cases that responded to GFD) was 46.6%. CONCLUSION: GFD may have more implications other than celiac disease. Other gluten-sensitive enteropathies, like LD and NSD, might also respond to this treatment particularly in patients with low BMI.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a well-defined condition that is estimated to affect approximately 1% of the population worldwide. Noncoeliac gluten sensitivity is a condition that is less well defined, but is estimated to affect up to 10% of the population, and is often self-diagnosed. At present, the only remedy for both conditions is a lifelong gluten-free diet. A gluten-free diet is often expensive, high in fat and low in fibre, which in themselves can lead to adverse health outcomes. Thus, there is an opportunity to use novel plant breeding strategies to develop alternative gluten-free grains. In this work, we describe the breeding and characterization of a novel ultra-low gluten (ULG) barley variety in which the hordein (gluten) content was reduced to below 5 ppm. This was achieved using traditional breeding strategies to combine three recessive alleles, which act independently of each other to lower the hordein content in the parental varieties. The grain of the initial variety was shrunken compared to wild-type barleys. We implemented a breeding strategy to improve the grain size to near wild-type levels and demonstrated that the grains can be malted and brewed successfully. The ULG barley has the potential to provide novel healthy foods and beverages for those who require a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Prior studies have shown that dietary gluten avoidance (DGA) is relatively common in children without previously diagnosed celiac disease (CD), and several clinical predictors of DGA have been found. However, available data on predictors of DGA in adults without diagnosed CD are limited. The aim of this study was to determine the independent predictors of DGA in this population. METHODS: We performed a structured medical record review of 376 patients, ages >/= 20 y, who had never been formally diagnosed with CD, presenting for an initial CD evaluation (ICD-9-CM 579.0) between January 2000 and December 2010 at two large Boston teaching hospitals. We collected data including demographic characteristics, medical history, history of CD serology before referral, and self-reported DGA. Predictors of DGA were determined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 47 (SD = 17) years. We found that 41 patients (10.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9-14.5) had avoided gluten at some time in their lives. Most patients had subjective abdominal complaints or bowel movement changes. History of CD seropositivity before referral was noted in 14%. Independent predictors of DGA (P < 0.05) were lactose intolerance (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1-7.5), food allergy (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.04-13.7), and history of positive serology of less-specific CD markers before the referral (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.9). CONCLUSIONS: Gluten avoidance is common in a clinic population of adults without prior CD diagnosis. The recognized predictors suggest that DGA may associate with conditions presenting with nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints and perhaps with the perceived benefits of DGA among patients with prior history of positive CD serology.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a systemic autoimmune disease that can be associated with gastrointestinal findings (diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, anorexia, lactose intolerance, abdominal distention, and irritability) and/or highly variable non-gastrointestinal findings (iron deficiency anemia, dermatitis herpetiformis, chronic fatigue, joint pain/inflammation, migraines, depression, attention-deficit disorder, epilepsy, osteoporosis/osteopenia, infertility and/or recurrent fetal loss, vitamin deficiencies, short stature, failure to thrive, delayed puberty, dental enamel defects, and autoimmune disorders). Classic celiac disease, characterized by mild to severe gastrointestinal symptoms, is less common than non-classic celiac disease, characterized by absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. The diagnosis of celiac disease relies on characteristic histologic findings on small-bowel biopsy and clinical and/or histologic improvement on a gluten-free diet. Most individuals with celiac disease have celiac disease-associated antibodies; for celiac disease to develop, specific allelic variants of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 must be present. Because 30% of the general population has one or more of the celiac disease-associated alleles and only 3% of these individuals develop celiac disease, presence of celiac disease-associated HLA alleles is not diagnostic of celiac disease; however, their absence essentially excludes the diagnosis. Treatment of manifestations: Lifelong adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (avoidance of wheat, rye, and barley); treatment of nutritional deficiencies (iron, zinc, calcium, fat-soluble vitamins, folic acid); standard treatment of osteoporosis. Prevention of primary manifestations: Lifelong gluten-free diet. Surveillance: For symptomatic individuals responsive to a gluten-free diet, periodic physical examination and assessment of growth, nutritional status, and non-gastrointestinal disease manifestations; repeat small-bowel biopsy one to three years following diagnosis. For symptomatic individuals unresponsive to a gluten-free diet, periodic evaluation for refractory celiac disease, ulcerative enteritis, T-cell lymphoma, and other gastrointestinal cancers. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dietary gluten. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing of first-degree relatives of a proband (including young children) to monitor those with known celiac disease-susceptibility alleles for early evidence of celiac disease in order to institute gluten-free diet early in the disease course. Celiac disease is a multifactorial disorder resulting from the interaction of HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 allelic variants known to be associated with celiac disease susceptibility, less well-recognized variants in non-HLA genes, gliadin (a subcomponent of gluten), and other environmental factors. Some empiric risk data for at-risk relatives are available.},

A complete management and differential diagnosis of such disease includes food intolerances, intestinal infections, and irritable bowel syndrome. We describe an 8-years-old adoptive girl from Congo with negative medical history. Patient followed for recurrent abdominal pain and diarrhea associated to Giardia infection, unresponsive to antiparasitic therapy. Persistence of symptoms despite antiparasitic therapy, prompted us to perform: 1- Blood screening of Celiac disease, which was negative; 2- Genetic evaluation of celiac disease, which revealed the presence of HLA-DQ2 heterodimer; and 3- Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which showed duodenal villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia, associated with Helicobacter Pylori infection. The child was treated in accordance with international recommendations using a Gluten-free diet and specific antibiotics, which lead to the resolution of the symptoms. Our patient's clinical history seems peculiar, considering that, recurrent Giardiasis may mimic the symptoms of Celiac disease and may simulate clinical and histological picture of active Celiac disease. Early diagnosis may help prevent the complications of untreated celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. CD-related enteropathy leads to multiple nutritional deficiencies involving macro- and micronutrients. Currently, medical nutrition therapy consisting of the gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only accepted treatment for CD. KEY MESSAGES: The GFD is the cornerstone of treatment for CD. Prior published studies have concluded that maintenance of the GFD results in improvement of the majority of nutritional deficiencies. In the past, counseling for CD focused mainly on the elimination of gluten in the diet. However, the GFD is not without its inadequacies; compliance to the GFD may result in certain deficiencies such as fiber, B vitamins, iron, and trace minerals. Paucity of fortified gluten-free foods may be responsible for certain deficiencies which develop on the GFD. Weight gain and obesity have been added to the list of nutritional consequences while on the GFD and have been partially attributed to hypercaloric content of commercially available gluten-free foods. Follow-up of patients diagnosed with CD after starting the GFD has been reported to be irregular and, hence, less than ideal. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of the nutritional status using blood tests and use of appropriate gluten-free supplementation are integral components in the management of CD. The ideal GFD should be nutrient-dense with naturally gluten-free foods, balanced with macro- and micronutrients, reasonably priced, and easily accessible. Rotation of the pseudo-cereals provides a good source of complex carbohydrates, protein, fiber, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. Fortification/enrichment of commonly consumed gluten-free commercial grain products should be encouraged. Dietitians specializing in CD play a critical role in the education and maintenance of the GFD for patients with CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disorder triggered by ingested gluten, causing immune-mediated damage to the small-intestinal mucosa. Gluten proteins are strikingly similar in amino acid composition and sequence to proline-rich proteins (PRPs) in human saliva. On the basis of this feature and their shared destination in the gastrointestinal tract, we hypothesized that salivary PRPs may modulate gluten-mediated immune responses in CD. Parotid salivary secretions were collected from CD patients, refractory CD patients, non-CD patients with functional gastrointestinal complaints, and healthy controls. Structural similarities of PRPs with gluten were probed with anti-gliadin antibodies. Immune responses to PRPs were investigated toward CD patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in a humanized transgenic HLA-DQ2/DQ8 mouse model for CD. Anti-gliadin antibodies weakly cross-reacted with the abundant salivary amylase but not with PRPs. Likewise, the R5 antibody, recognizing potential antigenic gluten epitopes, showed negligible reactivity to salivary proteins from all groups. Inflammatory responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were provoked by gliadins whereas responses to PRPs were similar to control levels, and PRPs did not compete with gliadins in immune stimulation. In vivo, PRP peptides were well tolerated and nonimmunogenic in the transgenic HLA-DQ2/DQ8 mouse model. Collectively, although structurally similar to dietary gluten, salivary PRPs were nonimmunogenic in CD patients and in a transgenic HLA-DQ2/DQ8 mouse model for CD. It is possible that salivary PRPs play a role in tolerance induction to gluten early in life. Deciphering the structural basis for the lack of immunogenicity of salivary PRPs may further our understanding of the toxicity of gluten.},

Knowledge of patients' attitudes toward these therapies is limited. The aim of this study was to determine attitudes about novel therapies in securely diagnosed patients with CD on a GFD and to correlate factors associated with these attitudes. METHODS: A survey was created with two scenarios: a novel therapy that protects against cross contamination while on a GFD and one that allows intentional gluten consumption. The survey also included the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test and the CD Quality of Life (QOL) surveys. RESULTS: A total of 182/284 (64%) CD patients completed the survey. Significantly more respondents would take a novel therapy to protect against cross contamination compared with one that allows intentional gluten consumption (87% vs. 65%; P<0.001). This difference was significant among women but not men. In both scenarios, protection against bowel inflammation was significantly more important than symptom control, and side effects were more important than cost. For a novel therapy that would allow intentional gluten consumption, a one-time injection was preferred over a daily pill, and patients willing to take this therapy had significantly lower QOL scores. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients on a GFD are interested in novel therapies. There were notable differences in attitudes by gender and QOL. Considering patient preferences, drugs with daily or less frequent dosing that protect against bowel inflammation from gluten cross contamination would be best accepted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Indications to double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) are not standardized in celiac disease (CD). GOALS: To evaluate the clinical usefulness of DBE in complicated CD. STUDY: DBE findings in celiac patients with suspected small bowel (SB) complications were retrospectively evaluated in 2 tertiary referral centers (Milan and Sheffield). Demographic data of the studied cohort were compared with a database of 1000 noncomplicated CD patients. RESULTS: Twenty-four CD cases (12 males, P=0.01 vs. controls) were reviewed. Mean age at CD diagnosis (y+/-SD) was 37+/-20 versus 27+/-18 and at SB evaluation 47+/-15 versus 38+/-13 (P<0.01 compared with controls). Indications for DBE were refractory CD (#9), gastrointestinal symptoms (#6), severe iron-deficiency anemia (#6), and long standing poor dietary adherence (#3). Two jejunal adenocarcinomas and an ileal neuroendocrine tumor were detected in presence of iron-deficiency anemia. Three type I and 3 type II refractory CD patients showed jejunal ulcerations; 2 of type II presented small white raised patches. Patchy atrophy was observed in nonadherent patients and in 2 on a gluten-free diet for a short time. Therapy was planned in 33% of patients after DBE. No adverse events were detected at follow-up [21 mo (range, 0 to 60 mo)]. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest international study on the outcomes of DBE in CD demonstrating its usefulness to exclude/confirm malignant or premalignant conditions, associated with even minor lesions. Studies are needed to understand the clinical relevance of the SB endoscopic features and to optimize DBE indications.},

We aimed for assessment of parental information at disease diagnosis to help us develop a tailored coeliac information package. METHODS: Children and teenagers referred for endoscopy and duodenal biopsy, with the sole indication for the diagnosis of CD, were prospectively recruited to the study. Parents were asked information and concerns regarding use of GFD. RESULTS: Sixty-three children (median 6.9 yrs (IQR 3.71-10.94)) and families were prospectively recruited in the study. The parents were very knowledgeable with an impressive 98% of the parents understanding that GFD is the treatment of CD; 95% knowing that this treatment is for life. However, specific dietary information was lacking with one-third correctly identifying all the Gluten containing foods. Internet (70.6%) was the most common source of information. Knowing someone with CD (p = 0.038), particularly in the same household in the family (p = 0.013) and researching about the disease (p = 0.001) rather than level of parental education (p = ns) was predictive of better parental knowledge. CONCLUSION: Internet is a major influence to parental knowledge in today's age but there is a continued need for hospitals regarding provision of accurate information and alleviating anxieties regarding use of GFD.},

METHODS: The CDDUX was cross-culturally adapted according to international consensus guidelines. HRQOL was assessed in coeliac members of the Madrid Coeliac Association ages 8 to 18 years using the adapted CDDUX. Cronbach alpha coefficient was determined as a measure of intraquestionnaire reliability and intraclass correlation coefficients as a measure of reliability between scores awarded by children and parents. Demographic and clinical variables associated with HRQOL were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 1602 children of 3122 registered Madrid Coeliac Association members ages 8 to 18 years were invited to participate. The questionnaire was completed by 480 families (30%): 214 only by parents, 214 by parents and their children, and 52 only by children. Cronbach alpha coefficient for the total score for parents was 0.90, and for children 0.88 (0.75-0.90 by scales). Mean total (standard deviation [SD]) HRQOL scores in children and parents were 55.5 (SD 12.7) and 53.89 (SD 12.19), respectively, with no differences detected in paired comparisons between the 2 groups. Significantly worse HRQOL scores were recorded in children showing a nonclassical clinical presentation, in those not adhering to treatment and in those reporting difficulties in following the diet. CONCLUSIONS: The CDDUX questionnaire emerged as reliable for use in Spanish children with celiac disease. Overall, both children and parents felt the disease had no substantial negative impacts on patient HRQOL.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that weight changes are common in patients with coeliac disease after starting a gluten-free diet (GFD), but data on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in this population are still scarce. AIMS: To assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with CD at diagnosis and 1 year after starting GFD. METHODS: We enrolled all consecutive patients with newly diagnosed coeliac disease (CD) who were referred to our third-level CD Unit. For all patients we collected: waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure, lipid profile (HDL cholesterol, triglycerides) and levels of blood glucose. Diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was made according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria for European countries. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was re-assessed after 12 months of GFD. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients with CD were assessed, two patients with CD (2%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome at diagnosis and 29 patients (29.5%) after 12 months of GFD (P < 0.01; OR: 20). With regard to metabolic syndrome sub-categories 1 year after GFD compared to baseline respectively: 72 vs. 48 patients exceeded waist circumference cut-off (P < 0.01; OR: 2.8); 18 vs. 4 patients had high blood pressure (P < 0.01; OR: 5.2); 25 vs. 7 patients exceeded glycemic threshold (P = 0.01; OR: 4.4); 34 vs. 32 patients with CD had reduced levels of HDL cholesterol (P = 0.7); and 16 vs. 7 patients had high levels of triglycerides (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with coeliac disease show a high risk of metabolic syndrome 1 year after starting a gluten-free diet. We suggest that an in-depth nutritional assessment is undertaken for all patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Gluten is one of the most abundant and widely distributed components of food in many areas. It can be included in wheat, barley, rye, and grains such as oats, barley, spelt, kamut, and triticale. Gluten-containing grains are widely consumed; in particular, wheat is one of the world's primary sources of food, providing up to 50% of the caloric intake in both industrialized and developing countries. Until two decades ago, celiac disease (CD) and other gluten-related disorders were believed to be exceedingly rare outside of Europe and were relatively ignored by health professionals and the global media. In recent years, however, the discovery of important diagnostic and pathogenic milestones led CD from obscurity to global prominence. In addition, interestingly, people feeding themselves with gluten-free products greatly outnumber patients affected by CD, fuelling a global consumption of gluten-free foods with approximately $2.5 billion in United States sales each year. The acknowledgment of other medical conditions related to gluten that has arisen as health problems, providing a wide spectrum of gluten-related disorders. In February 2011, a new nomenclature for gluten-related disorders was created at a consensus conference in London. In this review, we analyse innovations in the field of research that emerged after the creation of the new classification, with particular attention to the new European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines for CD and the most recent research about non-celiac gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: To evaluate changes in growth and bone metabolism during consumption of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in children with coeliac disease (CD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven children with CD (mean age of 8.8 +/- 4.6 years, 21 girls) were enrolled. Anthropometric measurements, bone mineral density (BMD) in lumbar 2-4 vertebrae, and serum alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and phosphorus levels at diagnosis and at follow-up were recorded. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 3.5 +/- 2.3 years. The BMD of patients was significantly lower than that of control subjects at the time of diagnosis but not after 1 year of the GFD. Incidence of low BMD with respect to z-scores for chronological age (CA) was significantly higher than z-scores for height age (HA) (P = 0.006). At the first year of GFD, BMD, BMD z-score, height-for-age z-scores, and weight-for-age z-scores were significantly increased compared with the baseline, but not after 1 year of the GFD. CONCLUSION: In CD, the first year of GFD is important in weight gain, linear growth, and improvement of BMD. A considerable relation of low BMD in children with CD, with respect to z-scores for CA, may be a result of misinterpretation of low BMD due to short stature.},

   abstract = {Medical descriptions of celiac disease date to the first century BC, and the first modern description was published in 1888. Further insights were gained throughout the 1900s, culminating in the identification of the dietary component, the major genetic determinant, and the autoantigen by the turn of the century. Understanding of the age of onset, population prevalence, and the extent of subclinical celiac disease developed in tandem. Thanks to advances in genomics, currently established loci account for over 50 % of the genetic risk. Nonetheless, much remains to be discovered. Advances in high-throughput genomic, biochemical, and cell analyses, as well as the bioinformatics needed to process the data, promise to deepen our understanding further. Here we present a primer of celiac disease, viewing the condition in turn from the historical, epidemiological, immunological, molecular, and genetic points of view. Research into any ailment has specific requirements: study subjects must be identified and relevant tissue samples collected and stored with the appropriate timing and conditions. These requirements are summarized. To conclude, a short discussion of future prospects is presented.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Wheat gluten and related proteins can trigger an autoimmune enteropathy, known as coeliac disease, in people with genetic susceptibility. However, some individuals experience a range of symptoms in response to wheat ingestion, without the characteristic serological or histological evidence of coeliac disease. The aetiology and mechanism of these symptoms are unknown, and no biomarkers have been identified. We aimed to determine if sensitivity to wheat in the absence of coeliac disease is associated with systemic immune activation that may be linked to an enteropathy. DESIGN: Study participants included individuals who reported symptoms in response to wheat intake and in whom coeliac disease and wheat allergy were ruled out, patients with coeliac disease and healthy controls. Sera were analysed for markers of intestinal cell damage and systemic immune response to microbial components. RESULTS: Individuals with wheat sensitivity had significantly increased serum levels of soluble CD14 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein, as well as antibody reactivity to bacterial LPS and flagellin. Circulating levels of fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2), a marker of intestinal epithelial cell damage, were significantly elevated in the affected individuals and correlated with the immune responses to microbial products. There was a significant change towards normalisation of the levels of FABP2 and immune activation markers in a subgroup of individuals with wheat sensitivity who observed a diet excluding wheat and related cereals. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a state of systemic immune activation in conjunction with a compromised intestinal epithelium affecting a subset of individuals who experience sensitivity to wheat in the absence of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Objective Delayed gastric emptying has been frequently detected in patients with untreated celiac disease. According to several studies, gluten withdrawal showed to be effective in normalizing the gastric emptying rate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the gastric emptying rate of solids in patients with celiac disease before and after a gluten-free diet. Methods Twelve adult patients with celiac disease (age range 20-57 years) and 30 healthy controls (age range 30-54 years) underwent a (13)C-octanoic acid breath test to measure gastric emptying. Half emptying time (t1/2) and lag phase (tlag) were calculated. After at least 12 months of a gluten-free diet, celiac patients underwent a new (13)C-octanoic acid breath test. A symptom score was utilized to detect dyspeptic and malabsorption symptoms in all the patients. Results The gastric motility parameters, t1/2 and tlag, were significantly longer in patients than in controls. On a gluten-free diet, surprisingly, the gastric emptying did not normalize despite an improvement of symptom score. No significant correlation between abnormal gastric emptying and specific symptom patterns, anthropometric parameters or severity of histological damage was found. Conclusions This finding supports the hypothesis that gluten-driven mucosal inflammation might determine motor abnormalities by affecting smooth muscle contractility or impairing gut hormone function. The persistence of these abnormalities on a gluten free diet suggests the presence of a persistent low-grade mucosal inflammation with a permanent perturbation of the neuro-immunomodulatory regulation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal diet during pregnancy has been proposed to increase the risk of autoimmune diseases. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the association between maternal consumption of gluten-containing foods during late pregnancy and subsequent risk of celiac disease in the offspring. DESIGN: Genetically susceptible children prospectively followed from birth were screened annually for tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGAs). Children testing persistently positive for tTGAs were further evaluated for celiac disease. Diagnosis of celiac disease was confirmed by intestinal biopsy or was considered likely if the mean tTGA concentration was >100 units in 2 consecutive samples. A questionnaire on the mother's diet in late pregnancy was completed by 3-4.5 mo postpartum. Mothers were divided into 3 groups based on the tertiles of their consumption of gluten-containing foods (servings/d). The association between maternal gluten-containing food consumption and the risk of celiac disease was studied by using a time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: At the time of analysis, 359 (5%) of the 6546 children developed celiac disease. Compared with the middle category of maternal gluten-containing food consumption (servings/d), low (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.13; P = 0.296) and high (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.09; P = 0.202) consumption was not associated with risk of celiac disease in the child after adjustment for country, human leukocyte antigen genotype, family history of celiac disease, maternal education, and sex of the child. Median maternal daily consumption frequency of gluten-containing foods was higher (P < 0.0001) in Finland (5.3; IQR: 3.9-6.9), Germany (4.3; IQR: 3.1-5.5), and Sweden (3.7; IQR: 2.8-4.9) than in the United States (3.4; IQR: 2.3-4.9). No significant interaction was found between country of residence and the mothers' consumption of gluten-containing foods in relation to risk of celiac disease. CONCLUSION: The frequency of gluten-containing food consumption during late pregnancy is not associated with risk of celiac disease in the offspring.},

   abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests an association between food sensitivity and gut microbiota in children with nephrotic syndrome. Diminished proteinuria resulted from eliminating cow's milk and the use of an oligoantigenic diet which excluded gluten, especially in patients with immune-related conditions, i.e., celiac disease and nephrotic syndrome. The mechanisms underlying the association of diet, gut microbiota, and dysregulation of the immune system are unknown. Gut microbiota is influenced by a number of factors including diet composition and other environmental epigenetic exposures. The imbalance in gut microbiota may be ameliorated by gluten-free and dairy-free diets. Gluten-free diet increased the number of unhealthy bacteria while reducing bacterial-induced cytokine production of IL-10. Thus, gluten-free diet may influence the composition and immune function of gut microbiota and should be considered a possible environmental factor associated with immune-related disease, including nephrotic syndrome. Furthermore, the imbalance of gut microbiota may be related to the development of cow's milk protein allergy. Investigations are needed to fill the gaps in our knowledge concerning the associations between the gut microbiome, environmental exposures, epigenetics, racial influences, and the propensity for immune dysregulation with its inherent risk to the developing individual.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To study whether breastfeeding and breastfeeding status during gluten introduction influences the age at diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). In addition to study, whether the timing of gluten introduction influences the age at diagnosis of CD. METHODS: It was a hospital based observational study. Total 198 patients diagnosed with CD as per modified European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (2012) criteria, aged between 6 months to 6 years were included. Detail history taken with special emphasis on breastfeeding and age of gluten introduction. Standard statistical methods used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Mean+/-standard deviation age of onset and diagnosis of CD in breastfed cases was 2.81+/-1.42 years and 3.68 +/-1.55 years respectively as compared to 1.84+/-1.36 years and 2.70+/-1.65 years respectively in not breastfed cases (p<0.05). Those who had continued breastfeeding during gluten introduction and of longer duration had significantly delayed onset of disease. The age at onset of CD was under one year in 40.42% of the cases, who had started gluten before 6 months of age compared to only 12.58% of those who had started gluten later (p<0.001). The proposed statistical model showed that two variables, i.e., breast feeding status during gluten introduction and age at gluten introduction positively influencing the age at diagnosis of CD. CONCLUSION: Delayed gluten introduction to infant's diet along with continuing breastfeeding, delays symptomatic CD. However, it is not clear from our study that these infant feeding practices provide permanent protection against the disease or merely delays the symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The only treatment for celiac disease is the gluten-free diet. Few studies have assessed the nutritional adequacy of this diet, especially of B vitamins related to homocysteine metabolism. The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional status and serum concentrations of B vitamins involved in homocysteine metabolism, and to determine whether the dietary intake of these vitamins are meeting Dietary Reference Intakes in celiac patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study enrolled a total of 20 celiac patients (36.3 +/- 13.7 years old; 65% women), following strict gluten-free diet (GFD) and 39 healthy controls matched by sex and age. The dietary intake was assessed by 3-day food records, and serum concentrations of homocysteine and vitamins B6, B12, and folate were determined after overnight fasting. Comparisons between the two groups were performed by Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U-test, for continuous variables. Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables. An alpha level of 5% were considered significant. RESULTS: Celiac patients had lower serum folate concentrations (7.7 +/- 3.5 ng/mL, P < 0.05) than controls. All celiac patients had folate intake below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) (130.8 +/- 53.6 mug/d). However, only a small proportion of celiac patients had hyperhomocysteinemia. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac patients treated with GFD presented inadequacy of dietary folate intake and low-serum concentrations of folate, suggesting that more attention should be given to the quality of the nutrients offered by the GFD, as it constitutes a lifelong treatment.},

   abstract = {Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is still an undefined syndrome whose triggering mechanisms remain unsettled. This study aimed to clarify how cultured peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC) obtained from NCGS patients responded to contact with wheat proteins. Results demonstrated that wheat protein induced an overactivation of the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL10 in PBMC from NCGS patients, and that the overactivation level depends on the cereal source from which proteins are obtained. CXCL10 is able to decrease the transepithelial resistance of monolayers of normal colonocytes (NCM 460) by diminishing the mRNA expression of cadherin-1 (CDH1) and tight junction protein 2 (TJP2), two primary components of the tight junction strands. Thus, CXCL10 overactivation is one of the mechanisms triggered by wheat proteins in PBMC obtained from NCGS patients. This mechanism is activated to a greater extent by proteins from modern with respect to those extracted from ancient wheat genotypes.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a food-related disease caused by certain gluten peptides containing T-cell stimulating epitopes from wheat, rye, and barley. CD-patients have to maintain a gluten-free diet and are therefore dependent on reliable testing and labeling of gluten-free products. So far, the R5-ELISA is the approved method to detect if food products can be labeled gluten-free. Because the R5-ELISA detects gluten in general, there is a demand for an improved detection method that quantifies specifically CD-epitopes. Therefore, we developed a new method for detection and quantification of CD-epitopes, based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. This method enables targeted label free comparative analysis of the gluten proteins present in different wheat varieties and species, and in wheat-based food products. We have tested our method by analyzing several wheat varieties that vary in CD-epitope content, as was shown before using immunoblotting and specific monoclonal antibodies. The results showed that a modern bread wheat variety Toronto contained the highest amounts of CD immunogenic peptides compared with the older bread wheat variety Minaret and the tetraploid wheat variety Dibillik Sinde. Our developed method can detect quantitatively and simultaneously multiple specific CD-epitopes in a high throughput manner.},

This is an unfortunate development from the perspective of human health because oats have a high nutritional value and contain many compounds, including beta-glucan, polyphenols, vitamins, and unsaturated fatty acids that are able to maintain or may even improve consumer's health. In addition, oats fit into a gluten-free diet of celiac disease patients because they lack the T-cell stimulating epitopes from wheat, rye, and barley. We focused on the presence of health-related compounds in oats and how their levels vary among varieties in response to the type of soil. Ten oat varieties were grown in the Netherlands in sandy and clay soil and were analyzed for the presence and concentration of healthy compounds (beta-glucan, fatty acids, vitamin E, and antioxidant activity), avenin composition, total protein and starch content, and agronomical characteristics. Principal component analysis showed that genetic background influenced the levels of all analyzed components. Protein, starch, beta-glucan, and antioxidants were also affected by the type of soil. The obtained results showed that this kind of analysis can be used to profile oat varieties in general and enables the selection of specific varieties with specific compound characteristics.},

These dental and oral manifestations are often seen in patients with coeliac disease, although most of them are nonspecific. This is not the case for the symmetric enamel defects described by Aine and colleagues, which are very specific for coeliac disease. Early diagnosing of coeliac disease is important to prevent complications by (vitamin) deficiencies or rare (pre) malignant forms of coeliac disease. There seems to be a role for dentists in early diagnosing of coeliac disease.},

Yet the actual prevalence is not well established. METHODS: Between April 2015 and March 2016, unselected adults visiting marketplaces, dental practices and a university in The Netherlands were asked to complete a modified validated questionnaire for self-reported gluten sensitivity (srGS). RESULTS: Among the 785 adults enquired, two had celiac disease. Forty-nine (6.2%) reported symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food. These individuals were younger, predominantly female and lived more frequently in urban regions compared with the other respondents. Symptoms reported included bloating (74%), abdominal discomfort (49%) and flatulence (47%). A total of 23 (47%) srGS individuals reported having had tried a gluten-free or gluten-restricted diet. Abdominal discomfort related to fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP)-containing food was more often reported in srGS individuals compared with the other respondents (73.5% vs. 21.7%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Self-reported GS is common in The Netherlands, especially in younger individuals, females and urban regions, although the prevalence was lower than in a comparable recent UK study. It cannot be excluded that FODMAPs are in part responsible for these symptoms.},

   abstract = {A small subset of patients with coeliac disease become refractory to a gluten-free diet with persistent malabsorption and intestinal villous atrophy. The most common cause of this condition is inadvertent gluten exposure, but concomitant diseases leading to villous atrophy should also be considered and excluded. After exclusion of these conditions, patients are referred to as having refractory coeliac disease, of which two categories are recognized based on the absence (type I) or presence (type II) of a clonal expansion of premalignant intraepithelial lymphocyte population with a high potential for transformation into an overt enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Type I disease usually has a benign course that can be controlled by mild immunosuppressive treatment, but type II can be more severe with cladribine with or without autologous stem cell transplantation effective as treatment. Patients who fail to respond to cladribine therapy, however, still have a high risk of malignant transformation. Insights into the immunophenotype of these cells and the recognition that type II disease is a low-grade, no-mass lymphoma opens avenues for new treatment strategies, including chemotherapeutic and immunomodulating strategies. This Review will provide an overview of refractory coeliac disease, discussing mechanisms, diagnosis and management.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is associated with an increased risk of major depressive disorder, possibly due to deficiencies in micronutrients in the gluten-free diet. We aimed to investigate whether essential amino acids (i.e., the precursors of serotonin, dopamine and other neurotransmitters) are depleted in the diet and serum of CD patients with major depressive disorder. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study we assessed dietary intake of amino acids and serum levels of amino acids, in 77 CD patients on a gluten-free diet and in 33 healthy controls. Major depressive disorder was assessed with structured interviews (using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus). Dietary intake was assessed using a 203-item food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 55 years and 74% were women. The intake of vegetable protein was significantly lower in CD patients than in healthy controls (mean difference of 7.8 g/d; 95% CI: 4.7-10.8), as were serum concentrations of tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan (all p < 0.005). However, within the CD patient group, the presence of major depressive disorder (n = 42) was not associated with intake or serum levels of essential amino acids. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD on a long-term gluten-free diet, with good adherence, consume significantly less vegetable protein than controls, and their serum levels of several essential amino acids were also lower. Despite its potential adverse effect, intake and serum levels of essential amino acids were not related to major depression.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is caused by inflammatory T-cell responses against the insoluble dietary protein gliadin. We have shown that, in humanized mice, oral tolerance to deamidated chymotrypsin-digested gliadin (CT-TG2-gliadin) is driven by tolerogenic interferon (IFN)-gamma- and interleukin (IL)-10-secreting type 1 regulatory T-like cells (Tr1-like cells) generated in the spleen but not in the mesenteric lymph nodes. We aimed to uncover the mechanisms underlying gliadin-specific Tr1-like-cell differentiation and hypothesized that proteolytic gliadin degradation by splenic macrophages is a decisive step in this process. In vivo depletion of macrophages caused reduced differentiation of splenic IFN-gamma- and IL-10-producing Tr1-like cells after CT-TG2-gliadin but not gliadin peptide feed. Splenic macrophages, rather than dendritic cells, constitutively expressed increased mRNA levels of the endopeptidase Cathepsin D; macrophage depletion significantly reduced splenic Cathepsin D expression in vivo and Cathepsin D efficiently degraded recombinant gamma-gliadin in vitro. In response to CT-TG2-gliadin uptake, macrophages enhanced the expression of Il27p28, a cytokine that favored differentiation of gliadin-specific Tr1-like cells in vitro, and was previously reported to increase Cathepsin D activity. Conversely, IL-27 neutralization in vivo inhibited splenic IFN-gamma- and IL-10-secreting Tr1-like-cell differentiation after CT-TG2-gliadin feed. Our data infer that endopeptidase mediated gliadin degradation by macrophages and concomitant IL-27 production drive differentiation of splenic gliadin-specific Tr1-like cells.},

The sites of sensitization and symptoms do not necessarily overlap. Food allergy, which is the theme of this paper, is often confused with other adverse reactions to food of both animmune (e.g., celiac disease) and non-immune (e.g., lactose intolerance) nature. To reliably diagnose food allergy, a careful history (immediate-type reactions) needs to be complemented with demonstration of specific IgE (immune mechanism) and confirmed by an oral challenge. Co-factors such as exercise, medication, and alcohol may help trigger food allergy and further complicate accurate diagnosis. Where food extract-based diagnostic tests are poorly correlated to symptom severity, new generation molecular diagnostics that measure IgE against individual food allergens provide clinicians and patients with more reliable symptom severity risk profiles. Molecular diagnostics also support establishing whether food sensitization originates directly from exposure to food or indirectly (cross-reactivity) from pollen sensitization. Epidemiological surveys have indicated that allergy to peach primarily originates from peach consumption in Europe, whereas in China it is the result of primary sensitization to mugwort pollen, in both cases mediated by an allergen molecule from the same family. Epidemiological surveys give insight into the etiology of food allergy, the size of the problem (prevalence), and the risk factors involved, which together support evidence-based strategies for prevention. Over the past decade, food allergy has increased in the affluent world. Economic growth and urbanization in upcoming economies are likewise expected to lead to increased prevalence of food allergies, sometimes to different foods due to dietary habits. Molecular allergology and biotechnology now offer the possibility to combat the increasing burden of food allergy by developing safe immunotherapies for food allergy, using hypoallergenic mutant recombinant molecules. The first clinical trials to evaluate such approaches are underway. Last but not least, the identification and clinical risk characterization of a more and more complete list of food allergens additionally provides the allergenicity risk assessment of genetically modified foods a firmer basis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is a rare non-Hodgkin lymphoma that may complicate coeliac disease and typically occurs in patients with refractoriness to the gluten-free diet. The majority of these patients harbour a clonal expansion of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) with an aberrant phenotype in the small intestine which are thus considered as the 'precursor' lymphoma cells. We describe a 51-year-old female patient with refractory coeliac disease (RCD) who developed an EATL with manifestations in the proximal small intestine and in a mesenteric lymph node that did not evolve from regular type 'aberrant' alphabeta-T-cells but rather from a clonal expansion of gammadelta-T-cells. METHODS: Duodenal biopsies and lymphoma tissue from a patient with refractory coeliac disease whom developed an EATL were extensively studied by immunophenotypical, T-cell receptor immunogenetic and chromosomal analysis. RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis of duodenal IELs revealed an unusual large clonal expansion of CD30 negative gammadelta-T-cells in a patient with RCD. When the patient clinically deteriorated 18 months later, a substantial part (30%) of this cell population did express CD30. In addition, identical immunogenetic aberrancies had developed in a prehepatic lymph node. CONCLUSIONS: We here report on a case of extraintestinal EATL that originated from a clonal gammadelta-IEL population rather than from aberrant IEL. This EATL displayed a distinctive pattern of immunophenotypical, T-cell receptor immunogenetic and chromosomal aberrancies as compared to classical EATL, defining this lymphoma as a novel variant of EATL.},

Through the development of cooking, the human being has produced high- gluten-content food, so that it could make the most of its nutritional properties. Wheat is becoming one of the key elements of the Mediterranean diet. Amongst gluten- intake-related pathologies- gluten is present mainly in wheat, barley and rye- celiac disease (CD) is the most well-known. CD is a chronic inflammatory condition which affects gastrointestinal tract which develops in genetically predisposed individuals. The most common manifestation of CD is nutrients malabsorption. This protein trigger other pathology, wheat allergy (WA), which is an adverse immunological effect to gluten due to E immunoglobulin. A recent increased in non celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has also been noticed, defined as the emergence of a range of gluten-intake related symptoms in patients for which celiac disease and wheat allergy have been ruled out. This article discusses these three conditions with their phatogenic mecanisms and the different clinic manifestations.},

   abstract = {We sometimes see manufactured bakery products on the market which are labelled as being gluten free. Why is the content of such gluten proteins of importance for the fabrication of bakery industry and for the products? The gluten proteins represent up to 80 % of wheat proteins, and they are conventionally subdivided into gliadins and glutenins. Gliadins belong to the proline and glutamine-rich prolamin family. Its role in human gluten intolerance, as a consequence of its harmful effects, is well documented in the scientific literature. The only known therapy so far is a gluten-free diet, and hence, it is important to develop robust and reliable analytical methods to quantitatively assess the presence of the identified peptides causing the so-called coeliac disease. This work describes the development of a new, fast and robust micro ion pair-LC-MS analytical method for the qualitative and quantitative determination of 30-mer toxic gliadin peptides in wheat flour. The use of RapiGest SF as a denaturation reagent prior to the enzymatic digestion showed to shorten the measuring time. During the optimisation of the enzymatic digestion step, the best 30-mer toxic peptide was identified from the maximum recovery after 3 h of digestion time. The lower limit of quantification was determined to be 0.25 ng/muL. The method has shown to be linear for the selected concentration range of 0.25-3.0 ng/muL. The uncertainty related to reproducibility of measurement procedure, excluding the extraction step, has shown to be 5.0 % (N = 12). Finally, this method was successfully applied to the quantification of 30-mer toxic peptides from commercial wheat flour with an overall uncertainty under reproducibility conditions of 6.4 % including the extraction of the gliadin fraction. The results were always expressed as the average of the values from all standard concentrations. Subsequently, the final concentration of the 30-mer toxic peptide in the flour was calculated and expressed in milligrams per gram unit. The determined, calculated concentration of the 30-mer toxic peptide in the flour was found to be 1.29 +/- 0.37 mug/g in flour (N = 25, s y = 545,075, f = 25 - 2 (t = 2.069), P = 95 %, two-sided).},

This study investigated the initial presentation, the diagnostic process, follow-up evaluations, and adherence to a gluten-free diet in CeD patients in a real-life setting in Switzerland from a patient's perspective. METHODS: We performed a large patient survey among unselected CeD patients in Switzerland. RESULTS: A total of 1689 patients were analyzed. The vast majority complained of both gastrointestinal and nonspecific symptoms (71.5%), whereas 1.8% reported an asymptomatic disease course. A total of 35.8% CeD patients were diagnosed by a nongastroenterologist. The diagnostic process differed between nongastroenterologists and gastroenterologists, with the latter more often using duodenal biopsy alone or in combination with serology (94.7% vs. 63.0%) and nongastroenterologists more frequently establishing the diagnosis without endoscopy (37.0% vs. 5.3%, P<0.001). Follow-up serology after 6 months was performed only in half of all patients (49.4%), whereas 69.9% had at least 1 follow-up serology within the first year after diet initiation. About 39.7% had a follow-up endoscopy with duodenal biopsies (after a median of 12 mo; range, 1 to 600 mo). The likelihood of receiving any follow-up examination was higher in patients initially diagnosed by a gastroenterologist. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of CeD patients are diagnosed by nongastroenterologists. Under the diagnostic lead of the latter, more than a third of the patients receive their diagnosis on the basis of a positive serology and/or genetics only, in evident violation of current diagnostic guidelines, which may lead to an overdiagnosis of this entity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is mostly recognized among subjects with a Caucasian ethnic ancestry. No studies have explored conditions predisposing Amerindians to CD. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess environmental, genetic and serological conditions associated with CD among members of the Toba native population attending a multidisciplinary sanitary mission. METHODS: An expert nutritionist determined daily gluten intake using an established questionnaire. Gene typing for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles was performed on DNA extracted from peripheral blood (HLA DQ2DQ8 haplotype). Serum antibodies were immunoglobulin (Ig) A tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and the composite deamidated gliadin peptidestTG Screen test. Positive cases were tested for IgA endomysial antibodies. RESULTS: A total of 144 subjects (55% female) were screened. The estimated mean gluten consumption was 43 gday (range 3 gday to 185 gday). Genetic typing showed that 73 of 144 (50.7%) subjects had alleles associated with CD; 69 (94.5%) of these subjects had alleles for HLA DQ8 and four had DQ2 (5.5%). Four and six subjects had antibody concentrations above the cut-off established by the authors' laboratory (>3 times the upper limit of normal) for IgA tTG and deamidated gliadin peptidestTG screen, respectively. Four of these had concomitant positivity for both assays and endomysial antibodies were positive in three subjects who also presented a predisposing haplotype. CONCLUSION: The present study was the first to detect CD in Amerindians. The native Toba ethnic population has very high daily gluten consumption and a predisposing genetic background. We detected subjects with persistent CD autoimmunity and, at least, three of them fulfilled serological criteria for CD diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is the clinical term used to describe gastrointestinal (GI) and/or extraintestinal symptoms associated with gluten ingestion. The prevalence of NCGS is unknown. The condition has clinical features that overlap with those of celiac disease (CD) and wheat allergy (WA). The pathophysiologic process in NCGS is thought to be through an innate immune mechanism, whereas CD and WA are autoimmune- and allergen-mediated, respectively. However, dietary triggers other than gluten, such as the fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, have been implicated. Currently, no clinical biomarker is available to diagnose NCGS. Exclusion of CD and WA is necessary in the evaluation of a patient suspected to have NCGS. The onset of symptoms in patients with NCGS can occur within hours or days of gluten ingestion. Patients with NCGS have GI and extraintestinal symptoms that typically disappear when gluten-containing grains are eliminated from their diets. However, most patients suspected to have NCGS have already initiated a gluten-free diet at the time of an evaluation. A gluten elimination diet followed by a monitored open challenge of gluten intake to document recurrence of GI and/or extraintestinal symptoms can sometimes be helpful. If NCGS is strongly suggested, then a skilled dietitian with experience in counseling on gluten-free diets can provide proper patient education. Additional research studies are warranted to further our understanding of NCGS, including its pathogenesis and epidemiology, and to identify a biomarker to facilitate diagnosis and patient selection for proper management.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic, small intestinal, immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Currently, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only available treatment. However, GFD alone is not sufficient to relieve symptoms, control small intestinal inflammation and prevent long-term complications in many patients. The GFD has its challenges including issues related to adherence, lifestyle restrictions and cost. As a result, there is growing interest in and a need for non-dietary therapies to manage this condition. In recent years, different targets in the immune-mediated cascade of CD have been identified in clinical and pre-clinical trials for potential therapies. This review will discuss the latest non-dietary therapies in CD, including endopeptidases, modulators of enterocyte tight junctions and agents involved in gluten tolerization and immunomodulation. We will also discuss the potential implications of approved therapeutics on CD clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Several studies point towards alteration in gut microbiota composition and function in coeliac disease, some of which can precede the onset of disease and/or persist when patients are on a gluten-free diet. Evidence also exists that the gut microbiota might promote or reduce coeliac-disease-associated immunopathology. However, additional studies are required in humans and in mice (using gnotobiotic technology) to determine cause-effect relationships and to identify agents for modulating the gut microbiota as a therapeutic or preventative approach for coeliac disease. In this Review, we summarize the current evidence for altered gut microbiota composition in coeliac disease and discuss how the interplay between host genetics, environmental factors and the intestinal microbiota might contribute to its pathogenesis. Moreover, we highlight the importance of utilizing animal models and long-term clinical studies to gain insight into the mechanisms through which host-microbial interactions can influence host responses to gluten.},

   abstract = {Liver abnormalities that normalize during infancy as well an enteropathy are reported in Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS). The pathogenesis of both conditions is unknown. We report two SDS cases with autoimmune-like (antismooth muscle and/or antinuclear antibody positivity) liver disease and antigliadin antibody positive inflammatory enteropathy. Hypertransaminasemia did not resolve after immunosuppressive therapy and/or a gluten-free diet. These transient autoimmune phenomena and gut-liver axis perturbations may have played a role in transient SDS hepatopathy and enteropathy. Our report may stimulate other studies to define the relationship between the SDS genetic defect and intestinal permeability as the pathogenic mechanism underlying SDS related liver and intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The only available treatment for celiac disease (CD) is lifelong adherence to gluten free (GF)-diet. However, GF-diet may lead to possible nutrient unbalance resulting in improper nutritional quality of diet. The aim of this study is to evaluate the nutritional quality of GF-diet. METHODS: MEDLINE(R)/PubMed and Cochrane Library were electronically searched for articles published between 1990/01/01 and 2015/09/01. RESULTS: GF-diet was found to be poor in alimentary fiber due in particular to the necessary avoidance of several kinds of foods naturally rich in fiber (i.e. grain) and the low content of fiber of GF product that are usually made with starches and/or refined flours. Micronutrients are also found to be poor, in particular Vit. D, Vit. B12 and folate, in addition to some minerals such as iron, zinc, magnesium and calcium. Moreover, an inadequate macronutrient intake was reported related above all to the focus on the avoidance of gluten that often leaving back the importance of nutritional quality of the choice. In particular, it was found a higher content of both saturated and hydrogenated fatty acids and an increase in the glycemic index and glycemic load of the meal. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the GF-diet is necessary in celiac disease treatment and the attention is on gluten avoidance, the evaluation of nutritional quality of the diet must be considered. Moreover, educational strategies based on the relationship between nutrients and food and human health could be developed to optimize the therapeutic approach in celiac patients.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet is one of the main drivers of the composition and function of the gut microbiota. The scope of this review is to summarize recent studies assessing the role of gut microbiota in clinical pediatric conditions and to review studies using nutritional approaches to favorably modify the gut microbiota to improve health outcomes in children. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies underscore that breastfeeding and infant diet impact the gut microbiome and metagenome. A comprehensive study using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, suggests that the cessation of breastfeeding rather than the introduction of solid foods, drives the functional maturation of the infant gut microbiome toward an adult-like state. There is further support for the view that a disturbed early gut microbiota is implicated in allergic and autoimmune diseases. New studies using prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in various pediatric disorders have yielded promising results, yet the evidence for specific guidelines on their use is still low. SUMMARY: Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with several pediatric disorders but a cause-effect relationship remains to be clearly demonstrated in most conditions. Future studies using new systems biology approaches are anticipated to provide further insight into the functional capacities of the gut microbiome and its establishment in childhood. This may then lay the ground for improved treatment and prevention strategies targeting the gut microbiota.},

The degree of hydrolysis was carried out in each protease digest, and the higher degree of hydrolysis was observed in pepsin digestion. Gluten-free (GF) bread was formulated by using buckwheat flour (BWF), rice flour (RF) and chickpea flour (CPF) (70:20:10) and GMPH were added in the range of 0-20% in the GF bread for enrichment with GMPH. Radar plot of the electronic nose analysis showed that the sensors P30/2, T30/1 and T70/2 had a higher response to the GF bread and GMPH. Consequently, the peptide sequence was obtained manually by ESI-MS spectra of GMPH (KGYSSYICDK) and F-II (SSYCIVKICDK). Flavour quality was 97% discriminately comparable to the GMPH and F-II fractions. Mussel flavoured GF bread can be included in the celiac diet.},

There is a paucity of data on long-term adherence to the gluten-free diet in the adult population. AIMS: To determine the long-term adherence to the gluten-free diet and potential associated factors in a large coeliac disease referral centre population. METHODS: We performed a mailed survey of adults with clinically, serologically and histologically confirmed coeliac disease diagnosed >/=5 years prior to survey. The previously validated Celiac Disease Adherence Test was used to determine adherence. Demographic, socio-economic and potentially associated factors were analysed with adherence as the outcome. RESULTS: The response rate was 50.1% of 709 surveyed, the mean time on a gluten-free diet 9.9 +/- 6.4 years. Adequate adherence (celiac disease adherence test score <13) was found in 75.5% of respondents. A higher level of education was associated with adequate adherence (P = 0.002) even after controlling for household income (P = 0.0220). Perceptions of cost, effectiveness of the gluten-free diet, knowledge of the gluten-free diet and self-effectiveness at following the gluten-free diet correlated with adherence scores (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet was adequate in >75% of respondents. Perceived cost remains a barrier to adherence. Perceptions of effectiveness of gluten-free diet as well as its knowledge, are potential areas for intervention.},

Here, we evaluate the risk of gluten cross-contact of GF pizzas in relation to the preparation procedures, thus aiming at identifying a safe procedure for cooking GF pizzas. Our results show that, when specific requirements are complied with, the simultaneous cooking of GF and WB pizzas is a procedure as safe as having an oven dedicated to GF pizzas or the alternate cooking of GF and WB pizzas in the same oven.},

   abstract = {Though children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are often tall at the time of diagnosis, they may experience growth retardation, pubertal delay or both, which may be due to poor glycemic control, associated diseases or chronic complications. Factors affecting growth include: gender, genetic environment, age at diagnosis, diabetes duration, puberty, metabolic control, and status of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), and IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). Insulin regulates expression of hepatic GH receptors, affects IGFs and IGFBPs synthesis by modulating GH postreceptor events, and significantly increases IGF-I bioactivity. Low portal insulin seen in T1DM leads to GH hypersecretion, low circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3, and high circulating IGFBP-1. Newly diagnosed T1DM patients have decreased GHBP which can be restored with insulin therapy. Growth velocity should be appropriate for the age of the child/adolescent, and the mid-parental height. Height, weight and blood pressure (BP) should be measured and plotted on a growth chart at least 2-3 times a year. Puberty should also be assessed annually. Following precautions are to be taken in T1DM children: checking for pubertal onset and ensuring it is not delayed, testing early when growth falters (hypothyroidism/celiac disease/puberty/other conditions), aiming for best possible metabolic control (multidose regimens, regardless of type of insulin), and encouraging dietary calcium and protein, exposure to sunlight, Vitamin D supplements and exercise.},

Awareness is important for early diagnosis and treatment so as to avoid long-term morbidity as well as irreversible complications. However, the key for resolution of the disease is good compliance to a gluten-free diet. Unfortunately, the current scenario in India is that either gluten free foods are not easily available or are expensive and often not tested. This is especially true in schools and colleges and smaller towns. In addition, the stigma attached to gluten-free food makes it socially undesirable, and this is made worse by the lack of knowledge among peers, family members, advisors, and even health care providers. We need to make a strong pitch to overcome the confusion regarding the disease as well as the diet to avoid psychological and medical complications.},

AIM: To define the prevalence and features of seronegative compared to seropositive celiac disease, and to establish whether celiac disease is a common cause of seronegative villous atrophy. METHODS: Starting from 810 celiac disease diagnoses, seronegative patients were retrospectively characterized for clinical, histological and laboratory findings. RESULTS: Of the 810 patients, fourteen fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for seronegative celiac disease based on antibody negativity, villous atrophy, HLA-DQ2/-DQ8 positivity and clinical/histological improvement after gluten free diet. Compared to seropositive, seronegative celiac disease showed a significantly higher median age at diagnosis and a higher prevalence of classical phenotype (i.e., malabsorption), autoimmune disorders and severe villous atrophy. The most frequent diagnosis in the 31 cases with seronegative flat mucosa was celiac disease (45%), whereas other diagnoses were Giardiasis (20%), common variable immunodeficiency (16%) and autoimmune enteropathy (10%). CONCLUSIONS: Although rare seronegative celiac disease can be regarded as the most frequent cause of seronegative villous atrophy being characterized by a high median age at diagnosis; a close association with malabsorption and flat mucosa; and a high prevalence of autoimmune disorders.},

The pathogenesis involves immune-mediated mechanisms requiring further research. Symptoms disappear in a few hours or days after gluten withdrawal and recur rapidly after gluten ingestion. Besides gluten, other wheat proteins as well as fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) may contribute to this syndrome. This syndrome occurs mainly in young women, being rare in children. Its prevalence ranges from 0.6% to 6%, based on primary or tertiary care center estimates. No biomarker is available, but half of patients tests positive for IgG anti-gliadin antibodies, which disappear quickly after gluten-free diet together with symptoms. Also, genetic markers are still undefined. Although currently limited to a research setting, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial strategy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is based on dietary restriction with special care to nutrient intake.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Individuals with potential celiac disease have serologic and genetic markers of the disease with little or no damage to the small intestinal mucosa. We performed a prospective study to learn more about disease progression in these people. METHODS: We collected data from 77 adults (59 female; median age, 33 years) diagnosed with potential celiac disease (on the basis of serology and HLA type) at Bologna University in Italy from 2004 through 2013. The subjects had normal or slight inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa. Clinical, laboratory, and histologic parameters were evaluated at diagnosis and during a 3-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (46 female; median age, 36 years) showed intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, whereas the remaining 16 (13 female; median age, 21 years) were completely asymptomatic at diagnosis. All subjects tested positive for immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody and tissue transglutaminase antibody, except for 1 patient with immunoglobulin A deficiency; 95% of patients were carriers of HLA-DQ2. Duodenal biopsies from 26% patients had a Marsh score of 0, and 74% had a Marsh score of 1. A higher proportion of symptomatic patients had autoimmune disorders (36%) and antinuclear antibodies (41%) than asymptomatic patients (5% and 12.5%, respectively), and symptomatic patients were of older age at diagnosis (P < .05). Gluten withdrawal led to significant clinical improvement in all 61 symptomatic patients. The 16 asymptomatic patients continued on gluten-containing diets, and only 1 developed mucosal flattening; levels of anti-endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies fluctuated in 5 of these patients or became undetectable. CONCLUSIONS: In a 3-year study of adults with potential celiac disease, we found most to have symptoms, but these improved on gluten withdrawal. Conversely, we do not recommend a gluten-free diet for asymptomatic adults with potential celiac disease because they do not tend to develop villous atrophy.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Non-coeliac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCG/WS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms occurring a few hours or days after the ingestion of gluten and wheat proteins in patients testing negative for coeliac disease and wheat allergy. Areas covered: The present review deals with recent scientific acquisitions of this gluten-related syndrome, including pathogenetic mechanisms, clinical picture, symptom score, biomarkers and double-blind placebo-controlled trial for diagnosis, and treatment. The methodology used was a literature search on NCG/WS using Medline and Premedline from 1970 to August 2016. Expert commentary: We discussed the pathogenesis of symptom generation and altered gut physiology in NCG/WS. Possible mechanisms include innate and adaptive immune activation, impaired intestinal epithelial barrier and changes in gut microbiome. These interlinked factors may be exploited for their clinical relevance as possible biomarkers. A systemic immune response to microbial and wheat antigens, together with intestinal cell damage, occurs in patients with NCG/WS. Due to the lack of established biomarkers, it is mandatory to validate the diagnosis of the syndrome by means of a well-defined work-up involving dietary challenge. Finally, dietary and other therapeutic indications have been thoroughly reviewed.},

   abstract = {A 62-year-old woman complaining of severe malabsorption was diagnosed with celiac disease based on the findings of flat, small intestinal mucosa and HLA-DQ2 positivity, although celiac serology was negative. This diagnosis was questioned due to the lack of clinical and histological improvement after a long period of strict gluten-free diet. The detection of enterocyte autoantibodies guided to the correct diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy, leading to a complete recovery of the patient following an appropriate immunosuppressive treatment. Autoimmune enteropathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of malabsorption with severe villous atrophy, including those cases with negative celiac-related serology.},

   abstract = {A tight link exists between dietary factors and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), one of the most common functional syndromes, characterized by abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating and alternating bowel habits. Amongst the variety of foods potentially evoking "food sensitivity", gluten and other wheat proteins including amylase trypsin inhibitors represent the culprits that recently have drawn the attention of the scientific community. Therefore, a newly emerging condition termed non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or nonceliac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) is now well established in the clinical practice. Notably, patients with NCGS/NCWS have symptoms that mimic those present in IBS. The mechanisms by which gluten or other wheat proteins trigger symptoms are poorly understood and the lack of specific biomarkers hampers diagnosis of this condition. The present review aimed at providing an update to physicians and scientists regarding the following main topics: the experimental and clinical evidence on the role of gluten/wheat in IBS; how to diagnose patients with functional symptoms attributable to gluten/wheat sensitivity; the importance of double-blind placebo controlled cross-over trials as confirmatory assays of gluten/wheat sensitivity; and finally, dietary measures for gluten/wheat sensitive patients. The analysis of current evidence proposes that gluten/wheat sensitivity can indeed represent a subset of the broad spectrum of patients with a clinical presentation of IBS.},

Although a gluten-free diet has a positive effect on the health of the celiac patient, prevention would be even more beneficial. In this article we outline the different possibilities for primary and secondary prevention of celiac disease. Results of recent prospective studies show that at this moment primary prevention is not possible, but secondary preventive strategies can be applied to decrease the morbidity associated with this disease; mass screening is one option. Results of recent studies concerning this topic will be discussed.},

   abstract = {Gluten-related disorders such as coeliac disease, wheat allergy and noncoeliac gluten sensitivity are increasingly being diagnosed in children. Coeliac disease occurs frequently, affecting 1-3% of the Western population. The condition manifests at a very young age, more so in girls, and is related to the HLA genotype. Coeliac disease might be considered a public health problem and, as primary prevention is not possible, the debate on mass screening should be reopened. Wheat proteins, including gluten, are responsible for one of the most common food allergies in children: wheat allergy. Unlike coeliac disease and wheat allergy, noncoeliac gluten sensitivity is an unclear and controversial entity. These three gluten-related disorders are treated with a gluten-free diet. In coeliac disease, the diet should be strictly followed, whereas wheat allergy only requires wheat elimination and in noncoeliac gluten sensitivity occasional trials of gluten reintroduction can be done. A good diagnostic work-up is important for gluten-related disorders in childhood to avoid unnecessary restrictive diets in children. In this Review, we provide an overview of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of the most common gluten-related disorders in children.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine whether exocrine pancreatic function is impaired in patients with coeliac disease (CD) in our population and to evaluate its clinical importance. METHODS: Pancreatic exocrine function was determined by measuring faecal elastase-1 (FE) concentration. CD was diagnosed by serological testing using IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (IgAtTg) and small bowel biopsy using the Marsh classification. MRI of the pancreas was performed to evaluate any morphological changes. The study took place from January 2012 to December 2013. RESULTS: 90 patients (73 women and 17 men) of mean age 43.8+/-17.7 years (range 20-80) were included in the study. Mean time from CD confirmation was 5.8+/-0.7 years (range 1-25). Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) was diagnosed in four (4.4%) patients (one with mild EPI and three with severe EPI). MRI showed no morphological changes in any of the four patients. In all patients with EPI at least one serological nutritional marker was below the lower limit of normal. CONCLUSIONS: EPI is present in a small number of patients with CD. EPI should be excluded in all patients with CD in the presence of overt malnutrition or in cases of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms despite a gluten-free diet. Measurement of a serum nutritional panel, regardless of the presence of clinical symptoms of EPI, can be of clinical importance. MRI should be performed to exclude any morphological change in the pancreas.},

METHOD: In a multi-centre study, 259 female adolescents with CD and without a chronic condition were analysed regarding their eating disorder (ED) status, depression, personality, coping strategies and quality of life. RESULTS: Patients with CD and comorbid EDs were older and more often non-compliant with their diet and had a higher body mass index (BMI) and higher levels of depression. Differences in personality features disappear when controlling for age and depression. Higher ill-being and lower joy in life were reported by patients with CD and ED compared with patients without EDs, even when controlling for age and depression levels. No differences between patients (with CD) with and without EDs in coping strategies were found. BMI and lower self-directedness predicted ED status. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of EDs in patients with CD is suggested and should include BMI and personality factors.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Patients suffering from a chronic condition such as coeliac disease (CD) need to develop coping strategies in order to preserve emotional balance and psychosocial functioning while adhering to their obligatory life-long gluten free diet (GFD). However, this can be particularly challenging for adolescents and may lead to dietary transgressions. Little is currently known about the influence of coping strategies and personality factors on dietary compliance. This study aims to explore these factors for the first time in adolescents with biopsy-proven CD. STUDY DESIGN: We included 281 adolescents with CD and 95 healthy controls. We classified patients according to their GFD adherence status (adherent vs. non-adherent) and assessed coping strategies using the KIDCOPE and personality traits using the Junior-Temperament and Character Inventory (J-TCI). RESULTS: Adolescents with CD adherent to GFD used less emotional regulation and distraction as coping strategies than non-adherent patients. In terms of personality traits, adherent patients differed from non-adherent patients with respect to temperament, but not with respect to character, showing lower scores in novelty seeking, impulsivity and rule transgressions and higher scores in eagerness with work and perfectionism compared to non-adherent patients. No differences were found between healthy controls and adherent CD patients across these personality traits. CONCLUSIONS: Coping strategies and personality traits differ in adolescent patients with CD adherent to GFD from those not adherent, and may therefore relate to risk or protective factors in adherence. Targeting coping and temperament using psychological interventions may therefore be beneficial to support adolescents with CD and optimise their adherence to GFD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac crisis is a serious life threatening complication of celiac disease characterized by profuse diarrhoea, severe dehydration and metabolic disturbances leading to neuromuscular weakness, cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. It has been described as rare condition and not well documented in the literature. To improve awareness and facilitate diagnosis of this condition, we studied risk factors, pattern of presentation and management plans of celiac crisis. METHODS: It was a descriptive cross sectional study. Patients presenting in emergency room(ER) with profuse diarrhoea leading to severe dehydration, neuromuscular weakness, and metabolic acidosis and electrolyte abnormalities enrolled in the studies after positive serology and small bowel biopsy suggestive of celiac disease. RESULTS: Total 126 patients out of 350 fulfilled the criteria including 54 (42.8%) male and 71 (56.3%) female. The mean age at presentation was 5.25+/-1.18 years. Risk factors were poor social status (97.60%), consanguinity (96.77%), early weaning with gluten contained diet (93.54%), and Presenting complaints were loose motion (100%), loss of neck holding (96.77%), dehydration (96.77%), polyuria (95.96%), inability to walk (67.74%), abdominal distension (85.86%). Electrolytes imbalances were hypokalaemia (2.4+/-0.55), hypocalcaemia (7.29+/-0.66), hypomagnesaemia (1.89+/-0.50), hypophosphatemia (2.8+/-0.68), hypoalbuminemia (3.05+/-0.48) and metabolic acidosis (96%). One hundred & twenty patients were stabilized with GFD and correction of dehydration, acidosis and electrolyte imbalance. Six patients needed parenteral steroids ant total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Recovery time from crisis was mean 5.4+/-2.73 days (range 3-20 days). CONCLUSIONS: Celiac crisis is a common but under recognized problem in developing countries. Commonest presenting feature is neuromuscular paralysis and biochemical abnormality is hypokalaemia.},

The vagus nerve connects the visceral organs and central nervous system, and the gastric-derived orexigenic peptide ghrelin transmits its starvation signals to the hypothalamus via the vagal afferent nerve. Here we investigated the inflammatory response in vagal afferent neurons and the hypothalamus in mice following one day of HFD feeding. This treatment increased the number of macrophages/microglia in the nodose ganglion and hypothalamus. Furthermore, one-day HFD induced expression of Toll-like receptor 4 in the goblet cells of the colon and upregulated mRNA expressions of the proinflammatory biomarkers Emr1, Iba1, Il6, and Tnfalpha in the nodose ganglion and hypothalamus. Both subcutaneous administration of ghrelin and celiac vagotomy reduced HFD-induced inflammation in these tissues. HFD intake triggered inflammatory responses in the gut, nodose ganglion, and subsequently in the hypothalamus within 24 h. These findings suggest that the vagal afferent nerve may transfer gut-derived inflammatory signals to the hypothalamus via the nodose ganglion, and that ghrelin may protect against HFD-induced inflammation.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is common in Caucasians, but thought to be rare in Asians. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of CD in Chinese patients with chronic diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D).From July 2010 to August 2012, 395 adult patients with IBS-D and 363 age and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Xiaogan Central Hospital in Hubei province, central China. Patients with IBS-D were diagnosed according to the Rome III criteria. Serum Immunoglobulin (IgA/IgG) anti-human tissue transglutaminase (anti-htTG)-deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) antibodies were measured in a single ELISA (QUANTA Lite h-tTG/DGP Screen). Upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsies and HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genotyping were performed in seropositive subjects and a gluten-free diet was prescribed.Seven IBS-D patients (7/395, 1.77%) and 2 healthy controls (2/363, 0.55%), were positive for anti-htTG/DGP antibodies. Of these 9 cases, 1 was lost to follow-up, 3 were suspected to have CD and 5 were eventually diagnosed as CD with intestinal histological lesions classified as Marsh Type II in 2 and Type III in 3. Of these 5 diagnosed CD patients, 4 (4/395, 1.01%) were from the IBS-D group and 1 (1/363, 0.28%) from the healthy control had asymptomatic CD. Two Type III CD patients with relatively high titers in the serologic assay were homozygous and heterozygous for haplotype HLA-DQA1*03-DQB1*03:03 (HLA-DQ9.3), respectively.In the present study, CD was present in 1.01% of patients with IBS-D and in 0.28% of the control group. We like to suggest that the haplotype HLA-DQA1*03-DQB1*03:03 (HLA-DQ9.3), which is common in Chinese, is a new susceptibility factor for CD in China. Larger screening and genetic studies are needed in the Chinese population of different regions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by a permanent intolerance to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Cholecystokinin (CCK) release from the proximal small intestine and gallbladder emptying in response to a fatty meal are greatly reduced in celiac patients before they start the gluten-free diet, showing a genetic predisposition to gallstones. METHODS: To elucidate the complex pathophysiological mechanisms determining the biliary characteristic of celiac disease, we investigated the effect of the absence of endogenous CCK on cholesterol crystallization and gallstone formation in mice fed a lithogenic diet for 28 days. KEY RESULTS: Fasting gallbladder volumes were increased and the response of gallbladder emptying to the high-fat diet was impaired in CCK knockout (KO) mice compared to wild-type mice. Because of the absence of CCK, small intestinal transit time was prolonged and intestinal cholesterol absorption was increased. During 28 days of feeding, elevated biliary cholesterol concentrations and gallbladder stasis promoted the growth and agglomeration of solid cholesterol crystals into microlithiasis and stones. Thus, cholesterol crystallization and gallstone formation were accelerated in CCK KO mice. In contrast, daily intraperitoneal administration of CCK-8 reduced gallstone formation in CCK KO mice even on the lithogenic diet. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The lack of endogenous CCK enhances susceptibility to gallstones by impairing gallbladder contractile function and small intestinal motility function. These findings show that celiac disease is an important risk factor for gallstone formation and the gallbladder motility function should be routinely examined by ultrasonography and gallbladder stasis should be prevented in celiac patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is a common comorbidity of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Long-term consequences of CD are not completely understood, and adhering to a gluten-free diet is a burden for many patients. We investigated the effect of CD on vascular risk factors in a large cohort of T1D patients aged <20 yr. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Within the longitudinal Diabetes Patienten Verlaufsdokumentation (DPV)-diabetes registry, data were analyzed from 59,909 < 20-yr-old T1D patients treated at 392 centers in Germany and Austria. A total of 974 patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease (BPCD) were compared with 28,398 patients without CD with respect to blood pressure (BP), lipids, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c ), body mass index (BMI), and reported smoking behavior. RESULTS: Patients with T1D and BPCD showed significantly lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels [median (interquartile range): 53.0 (43.0-62.6) mg/dL] than patients without CD [55.0 (45.0-66.0) mg/dL; p < 0.01; p < 0.001 after adjustment for confounding variables]. Systolic BP was lower in patients with CD [105.5 (100.0-112.5) mmHg] than in patients without CD [110.0 (102.0-117.0) mmHg; p < 0.0001; p < 0.001 after adjustment]. There were no significant differences regarding smoking behavior, BMI, or HbA1c . In a subgroup of 335 patients with BPCD, HDL cholesterol was measured 1 yr after diagnosis of CD:HDL increased by 8% (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Young people with T1D and CD have lower HDL cholesterol values than patients without CD. As low HDL cholesterol is associated with vascular risk, our findings support screening for CD and monitoring of HDL cholesterol in young people with T1D.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence after 1 year of follow-up in children with screening-detected celiac disease (CD) in a general population. METHODS: A total of 18,325 twelve-year-olds were invited to participate in a population-based CD screening (Exploring the Iceberg of Celiacs in Sweden), of whom 13,279 participated. In 240 children, CD was detected through elevated anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies 2 (TG2-IgA) and verified by a small-intestinal biopsy. This substudy included 210 children with TG2-IgA, evaluated both at the initial biopsy occasion and at 1-year follow-up. GFD adherence was evaluated by a combination of TG2-IgA measurements and self-reported adherence (n = 193). RESULTS: After 1 year, 85% (179/210) had normalized TG2-IgA levels (<5 U/mL). Among those who had >50 U/mL at diagnosis, 25% (16/63) still had elevated TG2-IgA, but for the majority their initial values were more than halved. Most reported a high level of GFD adherence ("always" 82% [158/193] and "often" 16% [30/193]), and 75% [145/193] reported always adhering combined with normalized TG2-IgA. Although reporting that they were always adherent, 13 (6.7%) had not yet normalized their TG2-IgA levels completely; however, a majority of these initially had the highest TG2-IgA levels. CONCLUSIONS: GFD adherence is high in adolescents with CD detected by screening of the general population of Swedish 12-year-olds. Almost all of them had normalized serology and reported GFD adherence at the 1-year follow-up. A few adolescents who reported GFD adherence, however, had elevated TG2-IgA levels, suggesting more severe disease and/or nonadherence.},

We present a patient with weight loss and signs of malassimilation secondary to villous atrophy and jejunal ulcerations complicating known CD. We demonstrate a stepwise approach to the diagnosis and subtyping of RCD and to rule out important alternative causes of jejunal ulcerations. RCD can be classified as type I based on the absence or as type II based on the presence of an aberrant intestinal mucosal lymphocyte population. RCD type I shows a more benign course as these patients usually improve on a treatment consisting of nutritional support and immunosuppressive therapies such as budesonide or azathioprine. In contrast, clinical response to standard therapies in RCD type II is less certain and the prognosis is poor. Several groups suggest that RCD type II should be regarded as low-grade intraepithelial lymphoma which frequently transforms into an aggressive enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma with a high mortality rate. Therefore, a rapid differentiation of RCD type I and RCD type II is a major clinical challenge to early initiate appropriate treatment modalities.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of nutritional deficiencies and thyroid dysfunction in children with celiac disease (CD) and during follow-up after initiation of a gluten-free diet. Laboratory investigations of hemoglobin, ferritin, calcium, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and thyroid function are regularly ordered in children with CD despite sufficient evidence for these. STUDY DESIGN: Between 2009 and 2014, test results of hemoglobin, ferritin, folate, vitamin B12, calcium, vitamin D (25[OH]D), free thyroxin, and thyroid stimulating hormone of children with CD regularly seen at the Leiden University Medical Center were investigated. Laboratory reference ranges were used to define abnormal results. Pearson chi(2) test for trend, unpaired t test, and 1-way ANOVA were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of the 182 children evaluated, 119 were newly diagnosed. On average, 17% of results per year were missing because of incomplete blood investigations. Iron deficiency (28%) and iron deficiency anemia (9%) were found at the time of diagnosis of CD. Folate (14%), vitamin B12 (1%), and vitamin D deficiencies (27%) were also seen. No hypocalcemia or thyroid dysfunction was found. At follow-up, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, and folate and vitamin D deficiency were observed in 8%, 2%, 3%, and 25% of patients, respectively. Vitamin B12 deficiency, hypocalcemia, and thyroid disease were not found. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary blood investigations are relevant at the time of diagnosis of CD but have little diagnostic yield during follow-up visits once the patient is placed on a gluten-free diet. Thus, we recommend that these variables only be assessed on indication, such as fatigue or abnormal growth.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammation is strongly associated with approximately one-fifth of all human cancers. Arising from combinations of factors such as environmental exposures, diet, inherited gene polymorphisms, infections, or from dysfunctions of the immune response, chronic inflammation begins as an attempt of the body to remove injurious stimuli; however, over time, this results in continuous tissue destruction and promotion and maintenance of carcinogenesis. Here, we focus on intestinal inflammation and its associated cancers, a group of diseases on the rise and affecting millions of people worldwide. Intestinal inflammation can be widely grouped into inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and celiac disease. Long-standing intestinal inflammation is associated with colorectal cancer and small-bowel adenocarcinoma, as well as extraintestinal manifestations, including lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. This article highlights potential mechanisms of pathogenesis in inflammatory bowel diseases and celiac disease, as well as those involved in the progression to associated cancers, most of which have been identified from studies utilizing mouse models of intestinal inflammation. Mouse models of intestinal inflammation can be widely grouped into chemically induced models; genetic models, which make up the bulk of the studied models; adoptive transfer models; and spontaneous models. Studies in these models have lead to the understanding that persistent antigen exposure in the intestinal lumen, in combination with loss of epithelial barrier function, and dysfunction and dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Transcriptional changes in this environment leading to cell survival, hyperplasia, promotion of angiogenesis, persistent DNA damage, or insufficient repair of DNA damage due to an excess of proinflammatory mediators are then thought to lead to sustained malignant transformation. With regard to extraintestinal manifestations such as lymphoma, however, more suitable models are required to further investigate the complex and heterogeneous mechanisms that may be at play.},

Understanding the factors that influence compliance could help inform management and also guide support. With a particular focus on adolescence, this narrative review critiques current literature on the burdens associated with following a GFD and the factors associated with adherence. Studies highlight a variety of burdens faced by individuals with coeliac disease, including the cost, access and availability of gluten-free (GF) foods, as well as the dilemmas experienced when eating out, travelling and socialising with friends. A number of studies report that adolescents face stigmatisation and feel isolated in social situations and at school. Additional burdens that are highlighted are a lack of knowledge regarding CD and GFD difficulties in interpreting food labels, as well as dissatisfaction with the organoleptic properties of GF foods. Factors associated with poor adherence in adolescence include older age, an absence of immediate symptoms, difficulties eating out and poor palatability of GF foods. Conversely, better emotional support and stronger organisation skills have been associated with superior adherence. Significant associations have been reported between HRQoL measures and adherence, although the findings are inconsistent. Limitations in research methodologies exist and data are restricted to just a few countries. Further research specific to adolescence is required to identify independent predictors of adherence.},

   abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders represent a diverse and heterogeneous array of conditions unified by the variable presence of specific behaviours impacting social and communicative functions (social affect) alongside other presentation. Common overt characteristics may come about as a consequence of several different genetic and biological processes differentially manifesting across different people or groups. The concept of plural 'autisms' is evolving, strengthened by an increasingly important evidence base detailing different developmental trajectories across the autism spectrum and the appearance of comorbidity variably interacting with core symptoms and onwards influencing quality of life. Reports that dietary intervention, specifically the removal of foods containing gluten and/or casein from the diet, may impact on the presentation of autism for some, complement this plural view of autism. Evidence suggestive of differing responses to the use of a gluten- and casein-free diet, defined as best- and non-response, has combined with some progress on determining the underlying genetic and biological correlates potentially related to such dietary elements. The preliminary suggestion of a possible diet-related autism phenotype is the result. This review will highlight several pertinent aspects onwards to an effect of food in some cases of autism including research on the pharmacological activity of food metabolites, immune response, issues with gut barrier function and some contribution from the gut microbiota. These represent promising areas in need of far greater research inspection in order to potentially define such a diet-related subgroup on the autism spectrum.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Refractory celiac disease type II (RCDII) and EATL (Enteropathy Associated T-cell Lymphoma) are (pre)malignant complications of celiac disease (CD). Data on malnutrition and intestinal absorption is lacking in these patients. Therefore, the aim of the study is to comprehensively assess nutritional status and intestinal absorption capacity of patients with RCDII and EATL, compared with data of newly diagnosed CD patients. METHODS: Observational study in tertiary care setting in RCDII (n = 24, 63.8 +/- 8.2 y), EATL (n = 25, 62.3 +/- 5.7 y) and CD patients (n = 43, 45.6 +/- 14.8 y). At diagnosis, anthropometry (BMI, unintentional weight loss, fat-free mass index (FFMI), handgrip strength (HGS), nutritional intake, fecal losses and Resting Energy Expenditure (REE)) were assessed. RESULTS: Low BMI (<18.5) was more often observed in RCDII patients than in CD or EATL patients (in 33%, 12% and 12%, respectively, p = 0.029). EATL patients more frequently had unintentional weight loss (>10%) than CD or RCDII patients (in 58%, 19% and 39% of patients, respectively; p = 0.005/0.082). Energy malabsorption (<85%) was detected in 44% and 33% of RCDII and EATL patients, vs 21.6% in CD (NS). Fecal energy losses were higher in RCDII than in CD patients (589 +/- 451 vs 277 +/- 137 kcal/d, p = 0.017). REE was underestimated by predicted-REE with>10% in 60% of RCDII, 89% of EATL, and 38% of CD patients (p = 0.006). Low FFMI and HGS were detected in one third and two thirds of all patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The nutritional status of patients with RCDII and EATL is inferior compared with untreated naive CD patients at presentation. Both malabsorption as well as hypermetabolism contribute to malnutrition.},

   abstract = {Three experiments were done to better assess the gastrointestinal (GI) site(s) of action of GLP-1 on food intake in rats. First, near-spontaneous nocturnal chow meal size (MS), intermeal intervals (IMI) length and satiety ratios (SR = MS/IMI) were measured after infusion of saline, 0.025 or 0.5 nmol/kg GLP-1 into the celiac artery (CA, supplying the stomach and upper duodenum), cranial mesenteric artery (CMA, supplying small and all of the large intestine except the rectum), femoral artery (FA, control) or portal vein (PV, control). Second, infusion of 0.5 nmol/kg GLP-1 was tested after pretreatment with the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) antagonist exendin-4(3-39) via the same routes. Third, the regional distribution of GLP-1R in the rat GI tract was determined using rtPCR. CA, CMA and FA GLP-1 reduced first MS relative to saline, with the CMA route more effective than the others. Only CMA GLP-1 prolonged the IMI. None of the infusions affected second MS or later eating. CA and CMA GLP-1 increased the SR, with the CMA route more effective than the CA route. CMA exendin-4 (3-39) infusion reduced the effect of CMA GLP-1. Finally GLP-1R expression was found throughout the GI tract. The results suggest that exogenous GLP-1 acts in multiple GI sites to reduce feeding under our conditions and that GLP-1R in the area supplied by the CMA, i.e., the small and part of the large intestine, plays the leading role.},

   abstract = {AIM: We investigated phenotypes of milk hypersensitivity among schoolchildren aged 11-12 in Northern Sweden. METHODS: In a population-based cohort, 1824 (98%) children aged 11-12 participated in a questionnaire survey, skin prick testing, interviews on food hypersensitivity and assessment of body mass index (BMI). Of the 265 children reporting milk hypersensitivity, milk avoidance and no coeliac disease, 236 (89%) participated in a structured interview and blood samples for analyses of milk-specific Immunoglobulin E. The children were then categorised into milk hypersensitivity phenotypes according to preset criteria. RESULTS: In all, 14.5% reported milk hypersensitivity. Of these, 3% were categorised as current milk allergy, 23% as outgrown milk allergy, 40% as probable lactose intolerance and 11% as nondefinable. Furthermore, 23% had discontinued their elimination diet. Milk allergy was associated with other atopic disorders and lower BMI, with an odds ratio of 0.82 and 95% confidence interval of 0.80-0.98. Only 2% had previously undergone an oral challenge. CONCLUSION: The most common symptom phenotypes among Swedish children aged 11-12 with self-reported milk hypersensitivity and milk avoidance were probable intolerance and outgrown milk allergy, while current milk allergy was uncommon. Children with milk allergy had a lower BMI and most lacked a challenge-proven diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation triggered by gliadin, a component of dietary gluten. Oral administration of proteases that can rapidly degrade gliadin in the gastric compartment has been proposed as a treatment for celiac disease; however, no protease has been shown to specifically reduce the immunogenic gliadin content, in gastric conditions, to below the threshold shown to be toxic for celiac patients. Here, we used the Rosetta Molecular Modeling Suite to redesign the active site of the acid-active gliadin endopeptidase KumaMax. The resulting protease, Kuma030, specifically recognizes tripeptide sequences that are found throughout the immunogenic regions of gliadin, as well as in homologous proteins in barley and rye. Indeed, treatment of gliadin with Kuma030 eliminates the ability of gliadin to stimulate a T cell response. Kuma030 is capable of degrading >99% of the immunogenic gliadin fraction in laboratory-simulated gastric digestions within physiologically relevant time frames, to a level below the toxic threshold for celiac patients, suggesting great potential for this enzyme as an oral therapeutic for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunofluorescence assays of antibodies against endomysium (EmA) on primate oesophagus sections represent the gold standard in serological testing for coeliac disease (CD). As alternative immunofluorescence technique, staining of primate liver tissue is in use. We compared performance and predictive power of IgA- and IgG-EmA on primate oesophagus and primate liver sections. METHODS: Sera of 298 paediatric biopsy-proven CD patients under gluten-containing diet and 574 disease controls were investigated. Samples were collected between 2004 and 2013 in six children's hospitals. The antibodies were assayed blinded to diagnoses and histological data. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated for different assays. RESULTS: (Oesophagus vs liver): For IgA-EmA, sensitivity (0.953 vs 0.956) and specificity (0.981 vs 0.972) as well as PPV (0.963 vs 0.947) and NPV (0.976 vs 0.979) were comparable on both tissues. IgG-EmA on liver showed significantly higher sensitivity (0.520 vs 0.631; p=0.006) but significantly lower specificity (0.995 vs 0.963; p=0.002) and PPV (0.981 vs 0.899; p=0.0002) than on oesophagus. NPV on liver was higher than NPV on oesophagus, however, the difference was not statistically significant (0.799 vs 0.834; p=0.099). CONCLUSION: Primate liver can be used as alternative, equally well functioning substrate for IgA-EmA testing.},

   abstract = {Intestinal inflammation and symptoms of celiac disease (CD) usually respond well to gluten withdrawal, but rare cases are refractory to diet. Two types of refractory CD are discriminated on the basis of the presence or absence of an atypical population of mucosal lymphocytes that may progress to enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Challenges remain in the secure diagnosis of both types of refractory disease, and evidence on which to base treatment recommendations is flawed by the small numbers of reported patients and the use of different diagnostic strategies. Recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of the condition in conjunction with the development of immunomodulatory agents for managing other inflammatory diseases are helping to shape future approaches to targeted therapy. Progression will depend on collaboration and recruitment to trials. In the meantime, there is evidence to suggest that earlier diagnosis and better follow-up and management of CD may prevent the development of refractoriness.},

   abstract = {Despite tremendous growth in the consumption of gluten-free (GF) foods, there is a lack of evaluation of their nutritional profile and how they compare with non-GF foods. The present study evaluated the nutritional quality of GF and non-GF foods in core food groups, and a wide range of discretionary products in Australian supermarkets. Nutritional information on the Nutrition Information Panel was systematically obtained from all packaged foods at four large supermarkets in Sydney, Australia in 2013. Food products were classified as GF if a GF declaration appeared anywhere on the product packaging, or non-GF if they contained gluten, wheat, rye, triticale, barley, oats or spelt. The primary outcome was the 'Health Star Rating' (HSR: lowest score 0.5; optimal score 5), a nutrient profiling scheme endorsed by the Australian Government. Differences in the content of individual nutrients were explored in secondary analyses. A total of 3213 food products across ten food categories were included. On average, GF plain dry pasta scored nearly 0.5 stars less (P< 0.001) compared with non-GF products; however, there were no significant differences in the mean HSR for breads or ready-to-eat breakfast cereals (P>/= 0.42 for both). Relative to non-GF foods, GF products had consistently lower average protein content across all the three core food groups, in particular for pasta and breads (52 and 32% less, P< 0.001 for both). A substantial proportion of foods in discretionary categories carried GF labels (e.g., 87% of processed meats), and the average HSR of GF discretionary foods were not systematically superior to those of non-GF products. The consumption of GF products is unlikely to confer health benefits, unless there is clear evidence of gluten intolerance.},

   abstract = {The mechanisms underlying diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) are poorly understood, but increased intestinal permeability is thought to contribute to symptoms. A recent clinical trial of gluten-free diet (GFD) demonstrated symptomatic improvement, relative to gluten-containing diet (GCD), which was associated with reduced intestinal permeability in non-celiac disease IBS-D patients. The aim of this study was to characterize intestinal epithelial tight junction composition in IBS-D before and after dietary gluten challenge. Biopsies from 27 IBS-D patients (13 GFD and 14 GCD) were examined by H&E staining and semiquantitative immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC), MLC kinase, claudin-2, claudin-8 and claudin-15. Diet-induced changes were assessed and correlated with urinary mannitol excretion (after oral administration). In the small intestine, epithelial MLC phosphorylation was increased or decreased by GCD or GFD, respectively, and this correlated with increased intestinal permeability (P<0.03). Colonocyte expression of the paracellular Na+ channel claudin-15 was also markedly augmented following GCD challenge (P<0.05). Conversely, colonic claudin-2 expression correlated with reduced intestinal permeability (P<0.03). Claudin-8 expression was not affected by dietary challenge. These data show that alterations in MLC phosphorylation and claudin-15 and claudin-2 expression are associated with gluten-induced symptomatology and intestinal permeability changes in IBS-D. The results provide new insight into IBS-D mechanisms and can explain permeability responses to gluten challenge in these patients.},

Symptoms and disease activity are incompletely controlled by the gluten-free diet, which is currently the only available therapy. Although no therapies are yet approved, there is a growing field of candidates and an improving understanding of the regulatory pathway. In this review, we briefly discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and current treatment paradigm for CeD. We also review the major classes of therapies being considered for CeD and discuss extensively what is known and can be surmised regarding the regulatory pathway for approval of a CeD therapeutic. The coming years will see an increasing number and diversity of potential therapies entering clinical trials and hopefully the first approved agents targeting this significant unmet medical need. Although biomarkers including histology and serology will always be important in therapeutic clinical trials, they currently lack the necessary evidence linking them to improved patient outcomes required for use as primary outcomes for drug approval. For this reason, patient-reported outcomes will likely be primary end points in Phase III CeD trials for the foreseeable future.},

In adults, however, it is extremely rare. A systematic review was applied to identify the details of IPH in adults. METHODS: Articles of English or Chinese language published between 2000 and 2015 were included. Data were extracted on the clinical features, examinations, treatments, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: A total of 37 cases of adult-onset IPH were included (13 females and 24 males). IPH combined with coeliac disease was found in five patients, three of whom received gluten-free diet (GFD) only and got full remission. Upon diagnosis, median age was 34 years. The main manifestations were: hemoptysis (n=30, 81%), dyspnea (n=23, 64%), anemia (n=20, 54%). Most patients were treated by corticosteroids initially. The mortality rage was 14% on acute phase. CONCLUSION: The adult patients in this study showed some differences from the previously characterized IPH. It is characterized by immunologically mediated, middle-age onset, male dominance, absence of anemia, high mortality on acute phase. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) actually have undiagnosed celiac disease. These patients often undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to determine the etiology and severity of GERD. Performing routine duodenal biopsy analysis during an EGD could identify patients with celiac disease. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of this approach. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the MEDLINE database to identify publications through March 2014 on patients who underwent a duodenal biopsy analysis during an EGD for GERD. Data collected were used to construct a decision tree to calculate the cost effectiveness of an EGD with and without celiac disease tests. RESULTS: Among 10,000 patients with refractory GERD who underwent an EGD, we predicted a biopsy strategy would detect 70% of patients with celiac disease if the prevalence of celiac disease was 1% in this cohort. Biopsy analysis at the start of the EGD procedure would increase the remaining quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.0032, and increase the lifetime cost by $389/patient. Compared with no biopsy, the biopsy strategy cost $55,692.86/case of celiac disease detected, and $121,875/QALY gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the biopsy strategy met the threshold of less than $50,000/QALY when 1 of the following parameters was met: when the utility of living with GERD was less than 0.88, when the prevalence of celiac disease in patients with refractory GERD was greater than 1.8%, when biopsy analysis detected celiac disease with more than 98.1% specificity, when the cost of a gluten-free diet was less than $645.85/y, or if the cost of proton pump inhibitor therapy was more than $5874.01/y. CONCLUSIONS: Based on base-case values, it is not cost effective to perform a biopsy analysis to detect celiac disease in patients undergoing an EGD for refractory GERD. However, the approach becomes cost effective when the prevalence of celiac disease in this population is 1.8% or greater.},

   abstract = {Idiopathic portal hypertension is a disorder that has various clinical features. It is mostly characterized by bleeding oesophageal varices, obvious splenomegaly, anaemia and, occasionally, jaundice and ascites. Here we described an interesting case of idiopathic portal hypertension caused by coeliac disease in a 38-year-old woman. By putting this patient on a gluten-free diet, liver function tests became normal and portal vein diameter returned to normal range. This report indicates that, in coeliac disease, repetitive stimulation by antigens along the portal vein-and immune responses to them-can result in the development of idiopathic portal hypertension.},

   abstract = {Our aim in this study was to determine soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) levels in celiac disease, and their association with the gluten diet and autoantibodies. Eighty patients with celiac diagnosis and 80 healthy control individuals with similar age, gender and body mass index to the patient group were included in the study. Serum sTWEAK and IL-17A levels were measured by the serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The median IL-17A (117.5 pg/mL vs. 56.7 pg/mL; P = 0.001) level in celiac patients was higher than in the control group, while the median sTWEAK (543 pg/mL vs. 643 pg/mL; P = 0.016) level in patients was determined to be lower. In the patient group, patients who complied with the gluten diet had a lower level of median IL-17A (98.1 pg/mL vs. 197.5 pg/mL; P = 0.034) and a higher level of sTWEAK (606 pg/mL vs. 522.8 pg/mL; P = 0.031) than those who did not adhere. Furthermore, the IL-17A level was higher and the sTWEAK level was lower in celiac patients with positive antibody than those with negative antibody. A positive correlation was determined among anti-gliadin antibody IgA, anti-gliadin antibody IgG, anti-tissue transglutaminase IgG levels and the IL-17A level, and a negative correlation was determined with the sTWEAK level. In celiac disease, the sTWEAK and IL-17A levels differ between patients who cannot adapt to the gluten diet and who are autoantibody positive, and patients who adapt to the diet and are autoantibody negative. We believe that sTWEAK and IL-17A are associated with the inflammation in celiac pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {Patients with active celiac disease (CD) are more likely to have osteoporosis and increased risk of fractures. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) permits three-dimensional exploration of bone microarchitectural characteristics measuring separately cortical and trabecular compartments, and giving a more profound insight into bone disease pathophysiology and fracture. We aimed to determine the volumetric and microarchitectural characteristics of peripheral bones-distal radius and tibia-in an adult premenopausal cohort with active CD assessed at diagnosis. We prospectively enrolled 31 consecutive premenopausal women with newly diagnosed CD (median age 29 years, range: 18-49) and 22 healthy women of similar age (median age 30 years, range 21-41) and body mass index. Compared with controls, peripheral bones of CD patients were significantly lower in terms of total volumetric density mg/cm(3) (mean +/- SD: 274.7 +/- 51.7 vs. 324.7 +/- 45.8, p 0.0006 at the radius; 264.4 +/- 48.7 vs. 307 +/- 40.7, p 0.002 at the tibia), trabecular density mg/cm(3) (118.6 +/- 31.5 vs. 161.9 +/- 33.6, p<0.0001 at the radius; 127.9 +/- 28.7 vs. 157.6 +/- 15.6, p < 0.0001 at the tibia); bone volume/trabecular volume ratio % (9.9 +/- 2.6 vs. 13.5 +/- 2.8, p<0.0001 at the radius; 10.6 +/- 2.4 vs. 13.1 +/- 1.3, p < 0.0001 at the tibia); number of trabeculae 1/mm (1.69 +/- 0.27 vs. 1.89 +/- 0.26, p 0.009 at the radius; 1.53 +/- 0.32 vs. 1.80 +/- 0.26, p 0.002 at the tibia); and trabecular thickness mm (0.058 +/- 0.010 vs. 0.071 +/- 0.008, p < 0.0001 at the radius with no significant difference at the tibia). Cortical density was significantly lower in both regions (D comp mg/cm(3) 860 +/- 57.2 vs. 893.9 +/- 43, p 0.02; 902.7 +/- 48.7 vs. 932.6 +/- 32.6, p 0.01 in radius and tibia respectively). Although cortical thickness was lower in CD patients, it failed to show any significant inter-group difference (a-8% decay with p 0.11 in both bones). Patients with symptomatic CD (n = 22) had a greater bone microarchitectural deficit than those with subclinical CD. HR-pQCT was used to successfully identify significant deterioration in the microarchitecture of trabecular and cortical compartments of peripheral bones. Impairment was characterized by lower trabecular number and thickness-which increased trabecular network heterogeneity-and lower cortical density and thickness. In the prospective follow-up of this group of patients we expect to be able to assess whether bone microarchitecture recovers and to what extend after gluten-free diet.},

Moreover, patients with CD are more likely to have osteoporosis and fragility fractures, especially of the distal radius. Although still controversial, we recommend DXA screening in all celiac disease patients, particularly in those with symptomatic CD at diagnosis and in those who present risk factors for fracture such as older age, menopausal status, previous fracture history, and familial hip fracture history. Bone microarchitecture, especially the trabecular network, may be deteriorated, explaining the higher fracture risk in these patients. Adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation are also recommended to optimize bone recovery, especially during the first years of gluten free diet (GFD). If higher fracture risk persists after 1 or 2 years of GFD, specific osteoactive treatment may be necessary to improve bone health.},

   abstract = {We have recently identified a significant deterioration of bone microarchitecture in premenopausal women with newly diagnosed celiac disease (CD) using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT). The aim of this work was to assess changes in bone microarchitecture after 1 year on a gluten-free diet (GFD) in a cohort of premenopausal women. We prospectively enrolled 31 consecutive females at diagnosis of CD; 26 of them were reassessed 1 year after GFD. They all underwent HRpQCT scans of distal radius and tibia, areal BMD by DXA, and biochemical tests (bone-specific parameters and CD serology) at both time points. Secondary, we compared 1-year results with those of a control group of healthy premenopausal women of similar age and BMI in order to assess whether the microarchitectural parameters of treated CD patients had reached the values expected for their age. Compared with baseline, the trabecular compartment in the distal radius and tibia improved significantly (trabecular density, trabecular/bone volume fraction [BV/TV] [p < 0.0001], and trabecular thickness [p = 0.0004]). Trabecular number remained stable in both regions. Cortical density increased only in the tibia (p = 0.0004). Cortical thickness decreased significantly in both sites (radius: p = 0.03; tibia: p = 0.05). DXA increased in all regions (lumbar spine [LS], p = 0.01; femoral neck [FN], p = 0.009; ultradistal [UD] radius, p = 0.001). Most parameters continued to be significantly lower than those of healthy controls. This prospective HRpQCT study showed that most trabecular parameters altered at CD diagnosis improved significantly by specific treatment (GFD) and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. However, there were still significant differences with a control group of women of similar age and BMI. In the prospective follow-up of this group of patients we expect to be able to assess whether bone microarchitecture attains levels expected for their age.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether symptoms in non-coeliac patients (non-CD) meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are specifically triggered by gluten. AIM: To assess gluten sensitivity in patients diagnosed with NCGS. METHODS: We studied 35 non-CD subjects (31 females) that were on a gluten-free diet (GFD), in a double-blind challenge study. Participants were randomised to receive either gluten-containing flour or gluten-free flour for 10 days, followed by a 2-week washout period and were then crossed over. The main outcome measure was their ability to identify which flour contained gluten. Secondary outcome measures were based upon Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS) scores. RESULTS: The gluten-containing flour was correctly identified by 12 participants (34%), who were classified as having NCGS. Their mean GSRS dimension scores were significantly higher following gluten challenge compared to baseline. The scores were: pain, 1.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.6 +/- 1.0; reflux, 1.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.9; indigestion, 1.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.2 +/- 1.1; diarrhoea, 1.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.9 +/- 1.5 and constipation, 1.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 2.9 +/- 1.3. Seventeen participants (49%) erroneously considered the gluten-free flour to contain gluten. Their mean GSRS dimension scores were significantly higher following gluten-free flour challenge compared to baseline. The scores were: pain, 1.6 +/- 0.9 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.9; reflux, 1.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.3 +/- 1.1; indigestion, 2.0 +/- 1.1 vs. 3.7 +/- 1.1; diarrhoea, 1.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.0 +/- 1.2 and constipation, 1.6 +/- 0.9 vs. 2.6 +/- 1.3. The other six participants (17%) were unable to distinguish between the flours. CONCLUSION: Double-blind gluten challenge induces symptom recurrence in just one-third of patients fulfilling the clinical diagnostic criteria for non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.},

The aim of our study was to assess whether complete restitutio ad integrum could be achieved by adopting a restrictive diet (Gluten Contamination Elimination Diet, GCED) or may depend on time of exposure to GFD. Two cohorts of CD patients, with persisting Marsh II/Grade A lesion at duodenal biopsy after 12-18 months of GFD (early control) were identified. Patients in Cohort A were re-biopsied after a three-month GCED (GCED control) and patients in Cohort B were re-biopsied after a minimum of two years on a standard GFD subsequent to early control (late control). Ten patients in Cohort A and 19 in Cohort B completed the study protocol. There was no change in the classification of duodenal biopsies in both cohorts. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, TCRgammadelta+ (T-Cell Receptor gamma delta) T cell and eosinophils significantly decreased at GCED control (Cohort A) and at late control (Cohort B), compared to early control. Duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytosis persisting in CD patients during GFD is not eliminated by a GCED and is independent of the length of GFD. [NCT 02711696].},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To assess safety of prolonged daily administration of Triticum monococcum (Tm) using clinical, serological and histological criteria. Tm is an ancient wheat suitable for production of palatable baked goods that contains gluten devoid of strongly immunostimulatory epitopes and potentially safe for celiac disease (CD) patients as suggested by in vitro and ex vivo studies. METHODS: Protocol involved 60-day administration of 100 g/day Tm water biscuits to CD patients in remission on gluten-free diet. Symptoms Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire (GSRS) and CD-related serology were assessed at time (T) 0, T30 and T60 days, and duodenal biopsy was obtained at T0 and T60. RESULTS: Eight patients (F/M: 6/2, median age 26) were enrolled. One patient was excluded at T0 because of positive serology, and two patients dropped out because of symptoms recurrence. In the five patients completing the study, there was no difference in GSRS score at T0 to T60. All patients had Marsh II lesion at T0, four had Marsh III and one had recurrence of dermatitis herpetiformis at T60. CD-related antibodies converted from negative to positive at T60 in three patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that Tm is toxic for CD patients as judged on histological and serological criteria, but it was well tolerated by the majority of patients, suggesting that Tm is not a safe cereal for celiacs, but that it may be of value for patients with gluten sensitivity or for prevention of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The existence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity has been debated. Indeed, the intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms of many patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but without celiac disease or wheat allergy have been shown to improve on a gluten-free diet. Therefore, this study set out to evaluate the effects of gluten on IBS symptoms. METHODS: We performed a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled rechallenge trial in a tertiary care hospital with IBS patients who fulfilled the Rome III criteria. Patients with celiac disease and wheat allergy were appropriately excluded. The participants were administered a gluten-free diet for 4 weeks and were asked to complete a symptom-based questionnaire to assess their overall symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating, wind, and tiredness on the visual analog scale (0-100) at the baseline and every week thereafter. The participants who showed improvement were randomly assigned to one of two groups to receive either a placebo (gluten-free breads) or gluten (whole cereal breads) as a rechallenge for the next 4 weeks. RESULTS: In line with the protocol analysis, 60 patients completed the study. The overall symptom score on the visual analog scale was significantly different between the two groups (P<0.05). Moreover, the patients in the gluten intervention group scored significantly higher in terms of abdominal pain, bloating, and tiredness (P<0.05), and their symptoms worsened within 1 week of the rechallenge. CONCLUSIONS: A gluten diet may worsen the symptoms of IBS patients. Therefore, some form of gluten sensitivity other than celiac disease exists in some of them, and patients with IBS may benefit from gluten restrictions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors (ATIs) are nutritional activators of innate immunity, via activation of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on myeloid cells. We aimed to characterize the biologic activity of ATIs in various foods and their effect on intestinal inflammation. METHODS: We selected 38 different gluten-containing and gluten-free products, either unprocessed (such as wheat, rye, barley, quinoa, amaranth, soya, lentils, and rice) or processed (such as pizza, pasta, bread, and biscuits). ATIs were extracted and their biological activities determined in TLR4-responsive mouse and human cell lines. Effects of oral ATIs on intestinal inflammation were determined in healthy C57BL/6 mice on a gluten-free or ATI-free diet and in mice given low-level polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid or dextran sodium sulfate to induce colitis. Parameters of innate and adaptive immune activation were determined in duodenum, ileum, colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes. RESULTS: Modern gluten-containing staples had levels of TLR4-activating ATIs that were as much as 100-fold higher than in most gluten-free foods. Processed or baked foods retained ATI bioactivity. Most older wheat variants (such as Emmer or Einkorn) had lower bioactivity than modern (hexaploid) wheat. ATI species CM3 and 0.19 were the most prevalent activators of TLR4 in modern wheat and were highly resistant to intestinal proteolysis. Their ingestion induced modest intestinal myeloid cell infiltration and activation, and release of inflammatory mediators-mostly in the colon, then in the ileum, and then in the duodenum. Dendritic cells became prominently activated in mesenteric lymph nodes. Concentrations of ATIs found in a normal daily gluten-containing diet increased low-level intestinal inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-containing cereals have by far the highest concentrations of ATIs that activate TLR4. Orally ingested ATIs are largely resistant to proteases and heat, and increase intestinal inflammation by activating gut and mesenteric lymph node myeloid cells.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the methylation rate of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) promoter and expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in food-induced rat hypothalamus. METHODS: 16 male SD rats were divided into high fat diet induced group (8 rats) and normal control group (8 rats) feeding for 12 weeks. Body mass, mass of celiac fat, celiac fat/body mass were measured. Methylation of Tsc1 promoter, mRNA and protein expression of mTOR were detected by bisulfite sequencing method, RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: Mass of celiac fat, celiac fat/body mass were higher in food-induced rat than that in control group. There were 11 methylation sites in SD rat hypothalamus. Obese group has significantly higher methylation rates (94.50% +/- 4.66%) than that of control group (86.60% +/- 3.49%) (P<0.002). The mRNA and protein expression of mTOR were noted lower in control group than in obese group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The increased methylation rate of Tsc1 promoter in food-induced rat hypothalamus and up-regulated expression of mTOR, downstream gene of Tsc1 may promote the obesity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is evidence that food components beyond gluten cause symptoms in patients with gluten sensitivity without celiac disease (nonceliac gluten sensitivity [NCGS]). We investigated the diets and nutritional characteristics of patients with NCGS. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study of 29 patients with NCGS seen at the outpatient clinic for celiac disease and other food intolerances of the University of Salerno in Italy from September 2015 through April 2016. Our study also included 37 control subjects. An experienced dietitian administered a validated food frequency questionnaire (from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) to collect information on amounts of common foods consumed. Patients and control subjects also completed the Eating Attitudes Test for diet-related disorders. Patients with NCGS completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2-I questionnaire. Differences in frequencies between patients and control subjects were calculated using chi-square test, whereas differences between continuous variables were calculated using Student t test. All tests were 2-tailed with significance level set at P < .05. RESULTS: Comparing the mean value of food daily eaten, we found that patients with NCGS ate smaller amounts of bread, rice, pasta, and cheese than control subjects. The patients ingested lower mean amounts of carbohydrates (P < .001), proteins (P = .001), fiber (P = .002), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (P = .01). More patients with NCGS than control subjects reported avoiding fruit, vegetables, milk, and dairy products, as well as snacks and mixed spices that are traditionally considered unsafe for people with gastrointestinal symptoms. Seven patients and 3 control subjects with scores >/=20 on the Eating Attitudes Test were invited for a psychological consultation; it did not confirm the presence of altered eating behaviors. Patients with NCGS had scores >65 from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, indicating a high level of concern for their health. CONCLUSIONS: In an observational study, we found that patients with NCGS eat different foods than healthy individuals; patients consume lower levels of proteins, carbohydrates, fiber, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Their diets should be routinely analyzed and possibly corrected to avoid nutritional deficiencies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Consumption of milk has been declining sharply in recent decades, particularly in developed countries. One of the reasons for this decline is the diagnosis or perception of lactose intolerance. The aim of this study was to investigate average consumption of milk and dairy products in the Campania region of Italy, one of the main producers of dairy products in the country. METHODS: Individuals aged 18 to 75 y and living in Campania were invited to answer an online questionnaire regarding their average consumption of milk and dairy products. The questionnaire was posted on the public access hospital site, as well as on several Facebook pages of friends and hospital personnel. RESULTS: The study found that 22.2% (260 of 1173) of responders from Campania do not drink milk, and 18.1% (213 of 1173) drink lactose-free milk, mainly because of gastrointestinal symptoms. The vast majority of the sample population chose to avoid consuming milk without undergoing the breath test for lactose intolerance or consulting a doctor. Women and underweight people drink more lactose-free milk than milk containing lactose. The population sample does not avoid dairy products; rather, they seem to be consumed quite frequently. CONCLUSION: The data support the need for mandatory implementation of a nutritional campaign to increase understanding regarding, for example, unnecessary avoidance of milk and excessive consumption of cheese.},

We found that a 4-week period of drinking gluten-containing beer did not provoke significant changes in the intestinal mucosa of this patient with coeliac disease nor did it elicit any relevant symptoms. Serum antibody levels rose but did not reach a pathological threshold. However, a more prolonged gluten challenge may have led to clinically relevant changes in IgA antitransglutaminase titres. This case demonstrates how important individual sensitivity to gluten in a patient with coeliac disease is in determining symptoms, immunological response and intestinal mucosa damage.},

The effect of the gluten free diet on these psychological aspects of the disease is still unclear. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this article is to review the literature on psychological morbidity of celiac disease. METHODS: We performed a PubMed search for the time period from 1900 until June 1, 2014, to identify papers on psychological aspects of celiac disease looking specifically at quality of life, anxiety, depression and fatigue. RESULTS: Anxiety, depression and fatigue are common complaints in patients with untreated celiac disease and contribute to lower quality of life. While aspects of these conditions may improve within a few months after starting a gluten-free diet, some patients continue to suffer from significant psychological morbidity. Psychological symptoms may affect the quality of life and the dietary adherence. CONCLUSION: Health care professionals need to be aware of the ongoing psychological burden of celiac disease in order to support patients with this disease.},

Due to the absence of reliable biomarkers no exact prevalence rates are known and estimations range between 0,5-6 %. Soon after ingestion of wheat, patients complain of intestinal symptoms mainly bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea or nausea which improve fast under glutenfree diet. Often extraintestinal manifestation as tiredness, muscle or joint pain, headache and depression are reported. Actually, there are no serological markers and no intestinal mucosal damage was found in patients. The underlying mechanism of the disease is completely unknown and beside of gluten other wheat proteins as well as amylase-trypsin-inhibitor or short chain sugars are discussed as triggers. In addition, the involvement of the intestinal microbiome in pathology of glutensensitivity must be considered.},
