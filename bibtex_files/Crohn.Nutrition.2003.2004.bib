   abstract = {The abundance of the oligopeptide transporter (Pept-1) in the brush-border membrane of the intestinal epithelium is the central mechanism for regulation of transport of products of protein digestion (dipeptides and tripeptides) and peptidomimetic drugs (for example, beta-lactam antibiotics). Within the past few years, there has been substantial progress in identifying the factors controlling this regulation and the mechanisms of their actions. The purpose of this report is to review this progress. The studies of individual substrates and hormones in a human intestinal cell line (Caco-2) have shown that dipeptides, certain amino acids, insulin, and leptin increase and epidermal growth factor and triiodothyronine decrease the membrane population of Pept-1. In the case of dipeptides, epidermal growth factor, and thyroid hormone, there are parallel changes in the gene expression brought about by alteration of transcription and/or stability of Pept-1 mRNA. In contrast, the treatment with insulin and leptin does not induce any alteration in the Pept-1 gene expression, and the mechanism of increased protein expression appears to be increased trafficking from a preformed cytoplasmic pool to the apical membrane. In vivo studies in rats have shown modulation of protein and gene expressions of the intestinal oligopeptide transporter during the day and during development and in nutritional and metabolic alterations, such as high-protein diet, fasting, and diabetes. Patients with intestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and short-bowel syndrome, may have induction of the Pept-1 expression in their colon. Finally, pharmacological studies have shown that the expression of Pept-1 can be upregulated by agents such as 5 fluorouracil and downregulated by agents such as cyclosporine. In conclusion, the above studies have produced a wealth of new information on regulation of a key transporter in the intestine. This information may have useful applications in nutritional and pharmacological treatments, for example, in diabetic patients needing enteral nutrition or in ulcerative colitis patients needing the suppression of the intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic debilitating disorder affecting a child's physical and emotional well-being. Recent emphasis on 'quality of life' (QOL) has led to re-evaluation of available medical treatments. AIM: To assess prospectively change in QOL, clinical disease activity and intestinal mucosal inflammation in active paediatric Crohn's disease after treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition. In addition, we evaluated whether change in QOL could predict changes in paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) and mucosal inflammation (endoscopic and histologic). METHODS: The IMPACT II questionnaire was used prospectively and longitudinally in 26 consecutively recruited children [16 males (67%), median 14 years, s.d. = 1.7 years] with active Crohn's disease (PCDAI > 20). They were treated with a new polymeric enteral feed (ACD004, Nestle) for a period of 8 weeks. All had PCDAI, QOL and endoscopic assessment at the time of diagnosis and after 8 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 26 children achieved a clinical remission at 8 weeks, with improvement in the QOL scores (P < 0.05). The change in QOL score after treatment was predictive of achieving a clinical remission, but not of histological improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Although children may find dietary restrictions difficult, this study confirms a clear improvement in QOL after treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition. However, improvement in QOL scores is not reflected by improvement in mucosal inflammation. Whilst improving QOL remains a core principal in patient management, the long-term consequences of ongoing mucosal inflammation must be better understood before relying only on short-term QOL measures to dictate treatment choices.},

This is despite inactive or mildly active disease and maintenance therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate in these patients the effects of antioxidant vitamin supplementation on oxidative stress. METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial where stable but oxidatively stressed CD subjects (n = 57) were supplemented with vitamins E (800 IU) and C (1000 mg) or their placebo for 4 wk. Oxidative stress measured by breath pentane and ethane output, plasma lipid peroxides, and F2-isoprostane was assessed at baseline and at 4 wk. Disease activity was also monitored by measuring CD activity index and plasma orosomucoid. RESULTS: During supplementation, plasma vitamin C and alpha-tocopherol increased and all indices of oxidative stress decreased significantly. Disease activity remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, vitamin E and C supplementation resulted in a significant reduction in oxidative stress. This suggests that patients with inactive or mildly active CD can be oxidatively stressed and have increased requirement in antioxidant vitamins.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abnormal linear growth and deficient bone mineral acquisition may coexist in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Traditionally, bone mineral assessment by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) involves comparison to age- and gender-matched reference ranges, and these studies in children with IBD show a high prevalence of osteopenia. AIMS: To compare the prevalence of osteopenia using two methods of interpretation; one adjusted for age and gender and the other adjusted for bone size and gender. PATIENTS: Forty-seven patients with Crohn disease (CD) and 26 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) with a median age of 13.5 years (range, 5.5-18.2 years) were evaluated. METHODS: Lumbar spine (LS) and total body (TB) bone mineral content (BMC) were measured by DXA and converted to bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm) corresponding to BMC divided by the bone area. Age and gender-matched BMD standard deviation scores (SDS) were based on reference data providing age- and gender-matched BMC and bone area. These data also allowed calculation of percentage of predicted bone area for age and gender (ppBone Area) and percentage of predicted BMC for Bone Area (ppBMC). RESULTS: Patients with CD were shorter than those with UC (median height, SDS, -0.9 v 0, P < 0.05). Median ppBone Area for LS and TB for the whole group was 85% (10th centile, 68; 90th centile 99) and 81% (10th centile 66; 90th centile, 97), respectively. The ppBone Area at both sites was directly related to height SDS and BMI SDS (r > 0.5; P < 0.005). Median BMD SDS for LS and TB was -1.6 (10th centile -3.6; 90th centile, -0.2) and -0.9 (10th centile, -2.4; 90th centile, 0.4), respectively. Median ppBMC for LS and TB was 98% (10th centile, 84%; 90th centile, 113%) and 101% (10th centile 94%; 90th centile, 107%), respectively. The ppBMC showed no relationship to ppBone Area (r = 0.1, NS). Failure to account for bone area led to a label of moderate or severe osteopenia in 65% of cases. After adjustment for bone area, the proportion of children with osteopenia fell to 22%. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that children with IBD often have small bones for age because they have growth retardation. When DXA data are interpreted with adjustment for bone size, most children were found to have adequate bone mass. Correct interpretation of DXA is important for identifying children who may be at a real risk of osteoporosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease may be refractory to conventional treatments such as corticosteroids, enteral nutrition and immuno-suppressive agents. A number of patients with the disease may also become steroid-dependent leading to increased risk of developing steroid-related adverse effects. Recent studies suggest that TNF-a blocking agents may be effective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of TNF-a blocking agents in inducing remission in patients with active Crohn's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE (1966-June 2003), EMBASE (1984-June 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2003) and the IBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register. We hand-searched the articles cited in each publication obtained. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised controlled trials in which patients with active Crohn's disease (defined by a validated Crohn's disease activity index) were randomly allocated to receive a TNF-a blocking agent in the treatment arm, or to receive placebo or another treatment in the comparison arm. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of the methodological quality of each trial were independently performed by two reviewers. Any disagreement among reviewers was resolved by consensus. Outcome measures reported in the primary studies included clinical remission, clinical response and changes in disease activity index. MAIN RESULTS: Ten studies were identified of which 4 met the inclusion criteria. The included studies either differed in the type of TNF-a blocking agent used or in the way outcomes were assessed to such an extent that we considered it inappropriate to combine the data statistically. There is evidence from one randomised controlled trial that suggests that a single intravenous infusion of the monoclonal antibody cA2, infliximab, may be effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. There was no difference in response rates among infliximab doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg. The results of two other trials suggested that CDP571, the genetically engineered human TNF monoclonal antibody, may also be effective in reducing disease activity index at 2 weeks after an infusion. We did not find any evidence to support the use of etanercept in Crohn's disease. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from one randomized controlled trial suggests that a single infusion of infliximab may be effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Based on this study, we can recommend a dose of 5 mg/kg. There is also some evidence that CDP571 may be effective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease. We did not find any evidence that supports the use of etanercept in Crohn's disease. The period of follow up for the patients in these studies was probably too short to allow adequate assessment of recently reported serious adverse effects such as tuberculosis and lymphoma.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of unknown etiology. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that dietary fatty acids, linoleic acid (LA) and oleic acid (OA), could be involved in the inflammatory response through stimulation of the neutrophil chemokine, IL-8. METHODS: Human intestinal smooth muscle (HISM) cells were isolated from normal patients and patients with Crohn's disease and cultured for 24h with LA or OA in the presence or absence of oxidative stress. The concentrations of IL-8 were measured in the media and cellular oxidative stress was quantitated by measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs). RESULTS: Spontaneous production of IL-8 was significantly higher in HISM cells isolated from Crohn's bowel compared to control bowel. LA caused a marked, nine-fold, increase in IL-8 secretion by Crohn's cells, an effect that could be simulated in normal HISM cells by co-incubation of LA with an oxidizing solution (Ox) composed of hypoxanthine+xanthine oxidase+FeSO(4) (OxLA). These effects were inhibited by vitamins C and E. Treatment of Crohn's cells with OxLA did not further increase IL-8 over that of LA alone. The effect of LA alone was not associated with an increase in cellular oxidative stress as quantitated by TBARSs. In contrast to the results with LA, treatment with OA or OxOA did not increase IL-8 in either normal or Crohn's cells. In addition, OA protected Crohn's cells from the increase in TBARSs induced by Ox. In contrast to IL-8, spontaneous production of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) was significantly lower in Crohn's HISM cells as compared to normal cells and exposure to OxLA did not increase its production. CONCLUSIONS: LA, but not OA, increased the production of IL-8 by HISM cells. These results suggest that replacement of LA by OA in the diet of Crohn's patients and increased intake of a diet rich in antioxidants could be beneficial in decreasing inflammatory activity in Crohn's disease.},

Assessment of nutritional status should be routinely carried out in these patients and, in case of severe malnutrition, artificial nutrition should be used. In ulcerative colitis and in Crohn disease localized to colonic segments both Parenteral Nutrition (PN) and Enteral Nutrition (EN) have similar results as support treatments but they have no primary therapeutic effects and then they are indicated only in case of severe malnutrition and/or when a surgical procedure is planned. Some theoretical advantages derived from supplementation of short chain fatty acids and omega3-series is still debated. More evident are the advantages of nutritional support in Crohn enteritis. Both PN and EN have a role as a primary therapy capable to induce remission although these results are not prolonged in time when nutrition is not associated with pharmacological treatments. Experiments of pharmaco-nutrition with glutamine and fish fatty acid have to be validated in the clinical practice. In case of integrity of the small bowel and tolerance of the patient, EN is preferable to PN for its lower costs and reduced related complications. PN is still indicated in more severe cases or in acute phase when the need of restoring rapidly the hydroelectrolitic and nitrogen/caloric balance prevails.},

Although the disease has been well-described in adults, the true prevalence and clinical phenotype in children is unknown. AIM: To compare the clinical course and nutritional impact of CD in children with and without proximal small bowel involvement. METHODS: Patients with either Crohn's jejunitis or JI with or without colonic involvement were identified through a clinical database (1996--2002). All radiologic studies were reviewed by an experienced radiologist blinded to the clinical diagnosis. Thirty-six patients with CD without histologic or radiologic signs of proximal small bowel involvement were used for comparison. All medical, surgical, and hematologic parameters were compared in both disease groups. RESULTS: Among the 134 patients with CD, 23 (17%) had radiologic signs of JI, including intestinal fold thickening (57%), luminal narrowing (31%), and skip lesions (13%). Enteric fistula (6%) and strictures (6%) were less common. Patients with JI were likely to be stunted at the time of diagnosis, require surgical intervention (P < 0.03) and nutritional therapy in the form of nasogastric tube feeds (P < 0.03). Nutritional therapy was also associated with an improvement in height in patients with proximal small bowel disease (OR:5.87). DISCUSSION: JI is a relatively common disease phenotype in children with CD that requires aggressive nutritional and surgical intervention. Future studies are required to determine if the early detection and use of immune modulators may lessen the morbidity associated with proximal small bowel disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the diagnosis and treatment of colovaginal fistulas from various causes. DATA SOURCES: Papers on colovaginal fistulas were identified using Ovid and PubMed. The search terms used were as follows: colovaginal fistulas, rectovaginal fistulas, diverticular disease and fistulas. METHODS OF STUDY: Articles were selected based on their relevance to colovaginal fistulas and were then further subdivided into epidemiology, etiology, presentation, diagnosis and management. RESULTS: English-language papers were selected based on their relevance to all aspects of colovaginal fistulas. CONCLUSION: Optimizing nutrition is paramount prior to surgery. Medical management rarely corrects the problem. Diverticular colovaginal fistulas arise in patients who have previously undergone a hysterectomy. Radiation-related fistulas often involve the distal sigmoid colon and rectum, and recurrent cancer must be ruled out. Often symptoms are associated with radiation cystitis and terminal ileitis. When indicated, restoration of intestinal continuity is preferred. Malignant fistulas carry a poor prognosis, and when surgical removal is not practical, they are treated palliatively with fecal diversion or an endoluminal stent. Those arising from inflammatory bowel disease most frequently arise due to Crohn's disease, and extirpation of diseased bowel and associated abscess will successfully treat the condition. Fistulas arising from ulcerative colitis can be malignant. There remains a small role for colostomy as a nondefinitive procedure to alleviate symptoms. Colovaginal fistulas require a multidisciplinary approach and focused diagnostics, successful treatment can dramatically improve the patient's quality of life.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a single infusion of infliximab in the treatment of pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: A total of 21 pediatric CD patients were enrolled at seven study centers and randomized to receive a single infusion of infliximab 1 mg/kg (n = 6), 5 mg/kg (n = 7), or 10 mg/kg (n = 8) over at least 2 hrs at week 0 in this multicenter, open-label, dose-blinded trial. Efficacy assessments, including the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), modified CDAI, C-reactive protein concentration (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) determinations, were made at screening and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. Adverse events were assessed throughout study participation. RESULTS: Improvements in the PCDAI, modified CDAI, ESR, and CRP were observed with all infliximab doses, beginning at week 1. On average, all treated patients experienced approximately 50% improvement in the PCDAI by week 2. By week 12, the PCDAI remained approximately 30% improved from baseline. During the study, all 21 patients (100%) achieved a clinical response, and 10 patients (48%) achieved clinical remission. There were no infusion reactions in any of the treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial suggest that infliximab may be safe and effective as short-term therapy of medically refractory moderate to severe CD in a pediatric population.},

   abstract = {Delayed puberty frequently complicates the clinical course of young patients with inflammatory bowel disease, more often in Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis. Undernutrition has been thought to be the main reason for delayed puberty in these patients. However, puberty may be delayed despite a normal nutritional status. Observations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in rats with experimental colitis suggest that inflammatory mediators may have a direct adverse influence, independent of undernutrition, on the onset and progression of puberty. Serum androgens are consistently reported to be reduced in patients with delayed puberty and inflammatory bowel disease. This reduction is not necessarily secondary to a reduction in gonadotrophins as serum concentrations of gonadotrophins have been reported to be normal or even increased in some studies. Management of delayed puberty involves calorie supplements to correct undernutrition and treatment of inflammation. Observations in boys with delayed puberty and controlled studies in experimental models of intestinal inflammation suggest that testosterone therapy can accelerate puberty.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although an elemental diet has been established as the primary treatment for patients with Crohn's disease, the influence of dietary fat on the elemental diet remains unclear. We have designed the first randomized, controlled trial for elemental diets containing different fat percentages in patients with active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Each patient was randomized to receive one of three dose levels of fat in an elemental diet (Elental) for 4 weeks: 10 patients received low fat (3.06 g/day), 10 patients received medium fat (16.56 g/day) and eight patients received high fat (30.06 g/day). The additional fat was composed of long-chain fatty acids. All patients were evaluated using the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease rating, plus C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which were measured at weekly intervals. RESULTS: Although the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease rating, C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the low-fat group decreased, the values in the medium- and high-fat groups fluctuated during the study. The remission rate after 4 weeks in each group was 80%, 40% and 25% for patients in the low-, medium- and high-fat groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When the fat consisted of long-chain triglycerides, a high amount of this fat in the elemental diet formula decreased its therapeutic effect against active Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Exclusive enteral feeding reduces inflammation and improves well being, nutrition and growth in children with active Crohn disease. Whether improved growth and increases in growth-related proteins are a consequence of improved nutrition or a reduced inflammation is not known. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that changes in growth-related proteins are related to decreased inflammation, rather than improvement in nutritional status. METHODS: Twelve children with active Crohn disease treated for 6-weeks with exclusive enteral feeding were studied at days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56. The Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), weight, triceps skinfold thickness, and midupper arm circumference were recorded. C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), IGF-binding protein (IGFBP-3), and leptin were measured at each visit. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to compare day 0 with follow-up data. RESULTS: Significant improvements (P < 0.05) occurred by day 3 in inflammatory parameters (ESR, IL-6) and by day 7 in PCDAI, CRP, and IGF-I. These changes preceded any significant changes in nutritional parameters (weight-for-age Z score and midupper arm circumference day 14, triceps skinfold thickness day 21). CONCLUSIONS: Early increases in IGF-I during treatment of Crohn disease are attributable to the anti-inflammatory effect of the enteral feed rather than nutritional restitution.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by periods of relapse and remission. Treatment is aimed at reducing symptoms during relapse and prolonging the duration of remissions. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its prodrug azathioprine (AZA) are commonly used to prolong clinical remissions. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are two widely used laboratory markers of inflammation. The authors observed an unexplained discordance between ESR and CRP in children with asymptomatic IBD who were being treated with AZA or 6-MP. OBJECTIVE: To characterize children with IBD in remission treated with 6-MP or AZA who have persistently elevated ESR but normal CRP. METHODS: All patients seen in Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2002, with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis who received AZA or 6-MP continuously for at least 6 months were identified and their medical records reviewed. RESULTS: One hundred twenty patients met the eligibility criteria. Twelve had an ESR >18 mm/hour on at least three occasions during at least 12 consecutive months with a simultaneous CRP <0.8 mg/dL. Eleven of these 12 had no signs or symptoms of active disease and had Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index scores <10 for at least 12 consecutive months while the ESR was elevated. Disease duration was similar in the 11 children with asymptomatic disease and with discordant ESR and CRP and in 108 children with concordant ESR and CRP (69.2 + 22.5 months v 54.3 +/- 40.1 months, P = 0.0709). Duration of AZA or 6-MP therapy was greater in the 11 children with asymptomatic disease and discordant ESR and CRP than in those with or without symptoms and with concordant ESR and CRP (58.1 +/- 16.4 months v 36.6 +/- 24.1 months, P = 0.0043). There were no differences between the groups with respect to diagnosis, location of disease, or age at onset of symptoms. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was somewhat larger in the children with discordant ESR and CRP than in the children with concordant ESR and CRP (91.4 +/- 6.97 fL v 87.0 +/-7.07 fL, respectively, P = 0.0373); however, in both groups, the MCV was in the normal range. There were no significant differences in hematocrit, white blood cell count, serum albumin, total serum protein, or estimated serum globulin between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that among children treated with AZA or 6-MP, CRP may be a more reliable indirect indicator of inflammation than ESR. This report alerts clinicians that some children taking AZA or 6-MP may have persistent elevation of the ESR with a normal CRP and have no clinical evidence of active disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rheumatic joint pain is a common extra-intestinal complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because the high ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids (FAs) of the Western diet might promote rheumatic disorders, we sought to compare the effects of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil and n-6-rich soy oil on IBD-related joint pain. METHODS: Nineteen patients with IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 9 had Crohn disease and 10 had ulcerative colitis. Ten millilitres seal oil (n = 10) or soy oil (n = 9) was self-administered through a nasoduodenal feeding tube 3 times daily for 10 days. RESULTS: Compared with soy oil treatment, seal oil significantly reduced the duration of morning stiffness (P = 0.024), number of tender joints (P = 0.035), intensity of pain (P = 0.025) and the doctor's scoring of rheumatic disease activity (P = 0.025) at the end of the 10-day treatment period. Analysis of the effects as area under the curve (area between the curve and baseline, zero) for the entire period from start of treatment until 6 months' post-treatment suggested a long-lasting beneficial effect of seal oil administration on joint pain, whereas soy oil tended (not significantly) to aggravate the condition. Consistently, the serum ratios of n-6 to n-3 FAs (P < 0.01) and arachidonic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid (P < 0.01) were reduced after treatment with seal oil. CONCLUSION: The results suggest distinctive, differential prolonged effects on IBD-related joint pain of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil (significant improvement) and n-6-rich soy oil (tendency to exacerbation).},

All the children were taking calcium and vitamin D, during all the follow-up. RESULTS: Osteoporosis (Z-score < or = -2.5 S.D.) was found in 38% of the children, and osteopenia in 38% (Z-score between -1 and -2.5 S.D.). Low bone mineral density was correlated with age, suggesting it begins with puberty. Daily corticosteroid exposure was significantly higher for patients with osteoporosis. Disease severity measured with Harvey-Bradshaw index and exposure to immunosuppressive drugs were almost statistically significant. Sex, height, duration and site of disease, nutritional assistance exposure were not associated with low bone mineral density. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the high frequency of low bone mineral density in children with Crohn's disease, mainly during puberty. Corticosteroid exposure is a risk factor, and the disease severity, a probable one (non significant). New treatment strategy has to be defined to prevent and to treat this complication.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To determine whether chronic intestinal inflammation alters glutamine utilization, six 31 +/- 6 yr-old patients with Crohn's disease and an age-matched group of 6 healthy subjects received 7-h intravenous infusions of L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine, along with an infusion of L-[1-13C]glutamine delivered intravenously for the first 3.5 h, and via a nasogastric tube for the subsequent 3.5 hrs. None of the patients was receiving any nutritional supplement or antiinflammatory drug. All were in remission (Crohn's disease activity index < 150) and in a near-normal nutritional status. METHODS: We used plasma 2H3-alpha-ketoisocaproate to determine leucine appearance rate (Ra), and plasma 13C-glutamine and breath 13CO2 to determine glutamine Ra and oxidation, respectively. The fraction of enteral glutamine undergoing uptake in the splanchnic bed was determined from the difference in plasma 13C-glutamine enrichments between the intravenous and nasogastric 13C-glutamine infusion periods. RESULTS: Neither leucine Ra, nor plasma glutamine concentration (526 +/- 40 vs. 530 +/- 50 micromol/l), glutamine Ra (364 +/- 19 vs. 355 +/- 24 micromol kg(-1) h(-1)), or splanchnic glutamine uptake (61 +/- 5 vs. 65 +/- 2%) differed between groups. In both groups, glutamine oxidation rose when the glutamine tracer was supplied enterally, compared with the intravenous route (70 +/- 6 vs. 39 +/- 2% in patients; 69 +/- 2 vs. 38 +/- 1% in controls), but did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: When in remission, patients with Crohn's disease have normal rates of proteolysis, and glutamine production, utilization, oxidation, and splanchnic uptake. The data suggest there is no obvious requirement for glutamine in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although it is widely recognized that the intake of so-called probiotic microorganisms is beneficial in chronic mucosal inflammation and topical allergic disease, the immunologic details explaining how such bacteria can exert these effects remain obscure. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether Lactobacillus rhamnosus can modulate T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. DESIGN: In vitro, human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) matured in the presence of L. rhamnosus were used to instruct naive CD4+ T cells; subsequently, the T cell response was assessed with the use of CD3/CD28 and interleukin (IL) 2. Cytokine production by ex vivo-stimulated naive cells and memory T cells was measured before and after oral supplementation with L. rhamnosus in 6 healthy volunteers and 6 patients with Crohn disease. RESULTS: A decreased T cell proliferation and cytokine production, especially of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10, was observed in CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells derived from L. rhamnosus-matured DCs. This T cell hyporesponsiveness was associated with enhanced DC-T cell interaction and normal responsiveness of T cells for IL-2. In vivo oral supplementation of L. rhamnosus for 2 wk induced a similar T cell hyporesponsiveness, including impaired ex vivo T helper subsets 1 and 2 responses without up-regulation of immunoregulatory cytokines in cohorts of both healthy volunteers and patients with Crohn disease. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that L. rhamnosus modulates DC function to induce a novel form of T cell hyporesponsiveness; this mechanism might be an explanation for the observed beneficial effects of probiotic treatment in clinical disease.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder with a relapsing and remitting course. Once remission is achieved, the main aim of the management of Crohn's disease is maintenance of that remission. Significant advances have been made into understanding the aetiology and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. With these advances in understanding come increasing numbers of new agents and therapies, aimed both at active disease and the subsequent maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Current therapeutic strategies in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease include 5-aminosalicylates (e.g. sulfasalazine, mesalazine), thiopurines (e.g. azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine [mercaptopurine]), methotrexate and infliximab. The 5-aminosalicylates appear to have efficacy limited to either surgically induced remission and/or limited small bowel Crohn's disease. The immunomodulators now have an established role in Crohn's maintenance. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are effective in chronic active disease and corticosteroid-dependent Crohn's disease. Methotrexate has similar indications, although it appears to be an alternative in patients who are intolerant of, or resistant to, the thiopurines. The most recent breakthrough has been in the field of biological therapy for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Treatment of patients with the anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antibody infliximab has been shown already to be effective in inducing remission. Recent studies have now confirmed a role for infliximab in delaying relapse and maintaining remission in patients responsive to infliximab induction therapy. However, results with soluble TNF alpha receptors have been disappointing. A number of other biological and nonbiological agents have shown potential, though trials of the 'newer' biological agents have thus far been disappointing, in the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. The evidence for theses agents is currently limited, in many cases to treating active disease; however, these data are discussed in this article in order to provide an overview of future potential therapies. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with an insight into current and emerging therapeutic agents for the maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease.},

A detailed literature review (from 1950 through February 2004) of English-language articles was undertaken to find articles showing a relationship between probiotic use and medical conditions. Medical conditions that have been reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive, hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary tract infections, and others.

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article describes the clinical papers published in 2002 and early 2003 on nutritional and metabolic derangement in inflammatory bowel disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Insulin-like growth factor 1 and Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 are decreased in inflammatory bowel disease, and disease therapy hardly reverses this situation. There are promising data on recombinant human growth hormone therapy in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Several papers have added some fuel to the debate on the prevalence and pathogenesis of metabolic bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease. Articles have been published investigating the role of dietary fat in the therapeutic action of enteral feeding in Crohn's disease. Low-fat diets are particularly useful, and adding medium-chain triglycerides does not impair the effectiveness of these diets. Balanced amounts of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat should probably be used. Relevant contributions on the usefulness of probiotic preparations (VSL#3) in the treatment and prevention of pouchitis have been published. Other papers deal with the effects of medical and surgical therapy on body composition and metabolism in the inflammatory bowel disease, the treatment of oxidative stress of these patients, and the possible role of some vitamin deficiencies on thrombotic risk in the condition. SUMMARY: Inflammatory bowel disease therapy hardly reverses growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor 1 disturbances of patients. The role of inflammation and steroid therapy of metabolic bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease is still controversial. Low-fat diets, with added amounts of medium-chain triglycerides, are useful in decreasing gut inflammation in the condition. The search for the optimal dietary fatty acid composition deserves further investigations. The use of probiotics and prebiotics opens new therapeutic perspectives for the disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory Bowel Diseases--ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease--are chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases of unknown etiology. Decreased oral intake, malabsorption, accelerated nutrient losses, increased requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions cause nutritional and functional deficiencies that require proper correction by nutritional therapy. The goals of the different forms of nutritional therapy are to correct nutritional disturbances and to modulate inflammatory response, thus influencing disease activity. Nutritional intervention may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the costs and complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted. Total parenteral nutrition has been used to correct and prevent nutritional disturbances and to promote bowel rest during active disease, mainly in cases of digestive fistulae with a high output. Its use should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing clinical remission of disease in adults and promoting growth in children. Recent research has focused on the use of specific nutrients as primary treatment agents. Although some reports have indicated that glutamine, short-chain fatty acids, antioxidants and immunonutrition with omega-3 fatty acids are an important therapeutic alternative in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases, the beneficial reported effects have yet to be translated into the clinical practice. The real efficacy of these nutrients still need further evaluation through prospective and randomized trials.},

   abstract = {Surgery plays a key role in the management of both acute and, less frequently, chronic intestinal failure. Acute intestinal failure frequently requires surgical treatment when it arises as a consequence of intestinal fistulation or obstruction. In specialised clinical practice approximately 50% of acute intestinal failure is associated with intestinal fistulas and in approximately 50% of patients, this condition arises as part of the natural history or complicating treatment for Crohn's disease. A considerable proportion of such patients have abdominal infection and present complex nutritional and metabolic problems. The most important aspect of the surgical management of patients with acute intestinal failure associated with intra-abdominal infection is management of sepsis, since recovery is unlikely in the presence of active infection. Moreover, effective nutritional support and restoration of body composition is not possible if sepsis remains unresolved. Surgical strategies to deal with intra-abdominal infection may involve percutaneous drainage, laparotomy and resection of fistulating segments of intestine and, when infection is persistent and contamination extensive, laparostomy (a technique in which the abdomen is left open and allowed to heal by secondary intention). Surgical treatment should not only be timely and effective, but also aimed at preventing secondary damage to the small intestine, in order to minimise the risk of short bowel syndrome. In some cases a proximal defunctioning stoma may be required, with prolonged nutritional support, using either home total parenteral nutrition or feeding via the defunctioned distal gut (fistuloclysis), pending restoration of intestinal continuity. The role of surgical treatment for patients with short bowel syndrome is less clear. While surgery is frequently required for the management of complications of short bowel syndrome (including gallstones and possibly peptic ulcer disease), the role of intestinal lengthening and tapering procedures (to increase functional intestinal length), and artificial valves, reversed segments and colonic interposition (to reduce intestinal transit) remains controversial. For some patients with short bowel syndrome and, in particular, those with combined intestinal and hepatic failure, intestinal transplantation may become the treatment of choice as long-term results continue to improve.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Discrimination between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD) may be difficult on ileo-colonoscopy alone because of a lack of definitive lesions. Retrospective studies show upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may be helpful in confirming diagnosis in such cases. AIMS: To prospectively determine importance of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and assess factors predictive of upper gastrointestinal involvement in IBD. METHODS: All pediatric patients were enrolled prospectively and consecutively over a 2-year period and investigated with an ileo-colonoscopy and barium meal follow-through. Children with procto-sigmoiditis, later confirmed histologically to be typical of UC, were excluded from the study. The remainder underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The protocol and methodology were determined a priori. RESULTS: 65 children suspected of IBD underwent colonoscopy. Of the total, 11 had recto-sigmoiditis with typical macroscopic appearances of UC; once this was confirmed on histology these patients were excluded from the study. Of the 54 children (males, 31; median age, 11.1 years) remaining, 23 were initially diagnosed with CD on ileo-colonoscopy and 18 (33%) were diagnosed with UC. The diagnosis remained ambiguous in 13 (six colonic, four ileo-colonic, three normal colon) on clinical, radiologic and histologic grounds. Upper GI endoscopy helped to confirm CD in a further 11 (20.4%). Two patients were diagnosed with indeterminate colitis. Upper gastrointestinal inflammation was seen in 29 of 54 (22 CD; 7 UC ). Epigastric and abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, weight loss and pan-ileocolitis were predictive of upper gastrointestinal involvement (P < 0.05). However, 9 children with upper gastrointestinal involvement were asymptomatic at presentation (31%). Overall upper gastrointestinal tract inflammation was most common in the stomach (67%), followed by the esophagus (54%) and duodenum (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy should be part of the first-line investigation in all new cases suspected of IBD. Absence of specific upper gastrointestinal symptoms do not preclude presence of upper gastrointestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of infliximab in children with severe Crohn disease (CD), the authors prospectively monitored 21 children aged 15 +/- 2 years with severe CD who they treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg) on days 0, 15, and 45. One patient received only one injection. Eighteen patients were corticosteroid dependent, and 6 were receiving parenteral nutrition. Three patients were corticoid resistant (1 mg/kg/d >15 days). Sixteen had perianal disease. RESULTS: The Harvey-Bradshaw index (HB) decreased from 8 +/- 3 on day 0 to 1 +/- 2 on day 45 (P = 0.001). The inflammation factors decreased (P = 0.001), and albumin increased (P = 0.002). Nineteen children were in complete remission (HB < 4) on day 45, and 2 had improved (HB = -6 points). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in the stools (n = 16) decreased (P = 0.04). All perianal fistulas (n = 12) were closed by day 90. Fourteen of 21 patients had stopped taking steroids at 3 months, and all had stopped parenteral nutrition. Growth velocity was significantly greater after infliximab administration (Z score, +0.5) than before (-0.45; P = 0.004). Nineteen of 21 patients had relapsed (90%) at 1 year despite continued immunosuppressors. Seven had surgery because of an uncontrolled relapse ( 5), stenosis ( 1), or fistula ( 1). Six patients developed antinuclear antibodies (1/40-1/640e), and two had anti-DNA antibodies. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) values increased (>100-fold) in eight patients. One child developed an anaphylactic reaction to the medication, and one had a catheter-related sepsis. CONCLUSION: Infliximab produces spectacular results for children with severe CD and is well tolerated. However, its effect is transitory for many (90%), with frequent relapses despite continued immunosuppressors. Long-term management with infliximab should be tested despite its worrying side effects.},

   abstract = {Anastomotic leaks following colorectal surgery may be divided into those which are clinically significant and those which are not. Leakage occurs in 3.4-6% of all colorectal cases. It is most commonly associated with rectal anastomoses, being clinically significant in 2.9-15.3% of cases. Mortality following a leak may be 6.0-39.3%. There is no evidence that preoperative bowel preparation reduces the rate and consequences of leaks. There is no evidence for the use of drains when an anastomosis has been made outside the pelvis, but pelvic drainage may be important after anterior resection. The use of covering stomas has not been shown to reduce leak rate but does mitigate the clinical effects of leaks. Prompt diagnosis and further laparotomy can reduce mortality following leakage. Intra-abdominal abscesses can in most cases be treated by radiologically guided drainage. Anastomotic leaks are the most common cause of anastomotic strictures and are also associated with increased rates of local recurrence of cancer.},

   abstract = {Emergency complications of IBD are rare, but may be life-threatening, require surgery, and result in permanent end organ damage. The most common complications associated with UC are fulminant colitis, toxic megacolon, and bleeding. Each of these complications may resolve with aggressive medical therapy but often result in a total proctocolectomy. The most common complications associated with CD are abscesses and intestinal obstruction. Although initial treatment includes medical treatment, these Crohn's-related complications usually require a surgical intervention and intestinal resection. Finally, the most common extraintestinal manifestations that present as an emergency include thromboembolic events, ocular complications, and hepatobiliary disease. Some of these complications may parallel the course of the underlying disease and respond to IBD treatment, but thromboemboli, uveitis, and PSC do not. In the last decade there has been an explosion of knowledge and discovery into the pathogenesis of IBD. These findings have led to better and earlier treatment of IBD that it is hoped will alter the natural course of disease and prevent many of the complications outlined in this article.},

   abstract = {Current smoking protects against ulcerative colitis and, after onset of the disease, improves its course, decreasing the need for colectomy. However, smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease and worsens its course, increasing the need for steroids, immunosuppressants and reoperations. Smoking cessation aggravates ulcerative colitis and improves Crohn's disease. The effects of smoking are the sum of contradictory effects of various substances, including nicotine and carbon monoxide, and are modulated by gender, genetic background, disease location and activity, cigarette dose and nicotine concentration. Smokers with ulcerative colitis should not be discouraged from stopping smoking but encouraged to stop, to reduce their risk of cardiopulmonary tobacco-related diseases. In Crohn's disease, smoking cessation has become a major therapeutic goal, particularly in young women and in patients with ileal involvement. A large amount of supportive information, use of nicotine-replacement therapies and antidepressants, and individual counselling might aid the patient in quitting.},

AIM: To determine the rate of reactions in children following infliximab infusions, and to identify variables that might be predictive of those reactions. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all infliximab infusions performed at Columbus Children's Hospital from December 1998 through September 2001. RESULTS: Fifty-seven children received 361 infusions. Three hundred and fifty-five of the 361 infusions (98.3%) were completed. Fifty children had 304 repeat infusions. There were a total of 35 infusion related reactions. Female gender and the use of immunosuppressive medications for less than 4 months were risk factors for a reaction to infusion number 2. A reaction to infusion 2 and immunosuppressive use for less than 4 months were risk factors for infusion number 3. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of infusion reactions in children receiving infliximab is similar to that in adults. Female gender, immunosuppressive use for less than 4 months and prior infusion reactions may be risk factors for subsequent infusion reactions in children.},

   abstract = {6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its prodrug azathioprine (AZA) are well known for their lymphocytotoxic and bone marrow suppressive effects in the management of patients with leukemia. Although their immunosuppressive properties are mediated by the active AZA antimetabolite 6-thioguanine (6-TG), its mechanism of action is largely unknown. In IBD, a significant inverse correlation has been shown between erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite levels and disease activity, further supporting the proposed immunosuppressive role for 6-TG. Since leukocytes possess quantitatively different purine metabolic pathways compared to erythrocytes, this study aims to measure lymphocyte DNA 6-TG metabolites and correlate levels with the INF-gamma and IL-10 cytokine profile in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Forty-six adult patients with CD, either naive (17) or on long-term (>4-month) AZA therapy (29), had erythrocyte and lymphocyte DNA 6-TG levels measured by reverse-phase HPLC under UV detection (6-TG, 340 nm). Lymphocyte DNA 6-TG was expressed as picomoles per milligram of DNA. Lymphocyte DNA 6-TG metabolite levels were correlated with INF-gamma and IL-10 cytokine profiles using the OptEIA kit (Pharmigen). Lymphocyte DNA 6-TG metabolite levels correlate with erythrocyte 6-TG levels (P < 0.03) but not total patient leukocyte levels. Erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite levels correlated (P < 0.01) inversely with INF-gamma but not IL-10 cytokine levels. This study suggests a preferential dampening of the TH1 response on exposure to 6-TG and a possible immunosuppressive mechanism of action for AZA. Future studies are needed to determine if cytokine profiles can be used to predict recalcitrant CD to AZA therapy.},

   abstract = {Pancreatic surgery has advanced considerably during the past decades. Recent studies report reduced morbidity rates and virtually no mortality after resection. However, postoperative complications are still a formidable menace. In this chapter we discuss the management of postoperative bleeding and leakages which are considered the most feared complications, and discuss the advent of minimal invasive methods for management of these complications. Patients who develop postoperative bleeding almost always present with septic complications and a sentinel bleed before onset of bleeding. These patients should undergo early diagnostic angiography followed by embolisation. If this does control the bleeding an emergency laparotomy should be performed as last resort. Patients who develop pancreatic leakage are generally managed conservatively by means of percutaneous drainage. Aggressive surgery should be performed at the first sign of severe sepsis. The condition of the pancreatic remant found during reoperation dictates the type of surgical intervention best performed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical experience with the anti-tumor necrosis factor chimeric monoclonal antibody, infliximab, in pediatric patients with Crohn disease in The Netherlands. DESIGN: Descriptive. METHODS: Clinical response and adverse effects of infliximab were recorded for pediatric patients with Crohn disease treated from October 1992 to January 2003. RESULTS: Thirty patients (aged 7-18 years) with refractory Crohn disease (with or without severe fistulas) were treated with infliximab. Patients were treated with up to 30 infusions. Mean follow-up was 25.3 months. A total of 212 infusions were administered. Thirteen patients had refractory Crohn disease without fistulas. Six patients showed good long-term response to infliximab treatment (defined as clinical index < or =10 points). Sixteen patients had refractory Crohn disease with draining fistulas. Nine showed good long-term response (closure or nonproductiveness of fistulas). One patient with metastatic Crohn disease in the skin had a good long-term response. Six patients developed an allergic reaction during infusion. In one patient, the allergic reaction occurred after an infliximab-free interval of 9 years. One patient died of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab was an effective therapy in 53% of patients with refractory pediatric Crohn disease, with or without fistulas. Approximately half of the patients become unresponsive to infliximab therapy. Randomized controlled studies are mandatory to assess long-term efficacy and safety to define the optimal therapeutic strategy of infliximab therapy in children with Crohn disease.},

Twenty massive intestinal resections were performed. The causes of bowel resection were: intestinal infarction (11 cases), Crohn's disease (5 cases), small bowel volvulus (4 cases). All intestinal resections were more than 50-60% of the intestinal length. In eighteen patients intestinal anastomosis was performed immediately. In all the patients postoperative therapy with parenteral nutrition (PN) was performed. The operative morbidity and thirty-day mortality were respectively 30% (6 cases) and 35% (7 cases). The diarrhea was the dominant symptom. The average weight was 20% lower compared to the initial weight. The length of residual small bowel and type of anastomosis strongly affect survival of patients underwent massive intestinal resections. Parenteral nutrition (PN) has great importance in postoperative treatment. A useful treatment, in severe short bowel syndrome, can be small bowel transplantation.},

We aimed to study the pattern of antibody change and the prognosis of selected outcomes by baseline (at time of diagnosis) and serial antibody measurements in pediatric CD patients. METHODS: Serum ASCA and p-ANCA antibodies were measured at baseline (n = 154) and repeated during follow-up (n = 61) using standard techniques in a cohort of patients identified at Hopital Sainte-Justine between 1996 and 1998. Clinical information was abstracted from medical charts. Antibody patterns were examined using mixed modeling techniques. The prognostic ability of antibodies for selected outcomes was evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Fifteen (24.5%), 18 (29.5%), and 11 (18%) patients with serial antibody measurements changed their ASCA-IgA, ASCA-IgG, and p-ANCA status (positivity), respectively. No distinct patterns in the evolution of antibody titers were noted. Baseline ASCA-IgA positivity significantly predicted relapses during disease course (IgA: odds ratio [OR], 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-6.35). Serial antibody measurements did not predict the occurrence of clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline serum antibodies were predictive of a more relapsing disease course in pediatric CD. However, the limited variability in the antibodies over time and the inability of serial measurements to predict clinical outcomes may limit their use in the establishment of intervention strategies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Intestinal resection is the most frequent surgical procedure for bowel stenoses in Crohn's disease (CD). Recurrence of strictures, particularly with ileocolonic disease, often requires resection of lengthy segments of bowel, potentially resulting in short bowel syndrome. Different techniques of strictureplasty, such as those described by Mikulicz, Finney and Michelassi, are used in adults. However, these procedures are uncommon in pediatric surgery. The authors report their experience with different techniques of strictureplasty and with their modified Michelassi technique for the surgical treatment of long intestinal strictures caused by CD. METHODS: Five adolescents (2 boys; 3 girls; mean age, 16 age; range, 14 to 20 years) with severe ileocolonic stenoses and intestinal obstruction, not responsive to medical and nutritional therapy, were treated with different strictureplasty techniques. In 3 of them the modified side-to-side Michelassi technique was used. RESULTS: No postoperative complications occurred. After a mean follow-up of 20.5 months (range, 6 to 28 months), patients are free of symptoms with good nutritional status and off steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Strictureplasty is a good and effective surgical option for sparing bowel length in CD patients with extensive intestinal strictures.},

   abstract = {The intestinal flora play an important role in experimental colitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using colonic explant cultures from 132 IBD and control subjects, we examined tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) production in vitro in response to bacterial activators. Unstimulated TNF-alpha release was increased significantly in rectal biopsies from involved IBD tissue, correlating with inflammation severity. Whereas lipopolysaccharide (LPS) only moderately stimulated TNF-alpha production from inflamed tissue, pokeweed mitogen (PWM) induced its release in all groups, with a stronger response in involved IBD tissue. Superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) had a similar, but weaker effect. SEB was observed to be the strongest inducer of TNF-alpha for all groups, again with a more marked response in inflamed tissue. Stimulated release of IL-1 was considerably less than for TNF-alpha. The superantigens' superior potency over LPS was not as marked for IL-1 as it was for TNF-alpha. In addition to IL-1, IL-1RA release was also triggered by the bacterial products. The net effect of activation on the IL-1RA/IL-1 ratio was relatively modest. Release of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1, as well as that of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1RA was increased by incubation of colonic tissue with bacterial factors. TNF-alpha production and release was increased significantly in involved colonic explants from IBD. SEB was even capable of inducing TNF-alpha release from uninvolved colonic tissue.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of osteopenia among patients with Crohn's disease (CD). There is some evidence that a deficiency of certain bone-active nutrients (including vitamins K and D) may have a partial role in this bone loss. AIMS: To compare the intake and the status of vitamin K in CD patients, currently in remission, with age- and sex-matched controls, and furthermore to investigate the relationship between vitamin K status and bone turnover in these patients. SUBJECTS: CD patients (n = 44; mean age: 36.9 yr) and matched controls (n = 44) were recruited from the Cork University Hospital and Cork City area, respectively. METHODS: Bloods were analyzed for the total and undercarboxylated (Glu)-osteocalcin and urine analyzed for cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx). Vitamin K(1) intake was estimated by food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Vitamin K(1) intake in CD patients tended to be lower than that of controls (mean (SD), 117 (82) vs 148 (80) mug/d, respectively; p= 0.059). Glu and NTx concentrations in CD patients were higher than controls (mean (SD), 5.1 (3.1) vs 3.9 (2.1) ng/ml, respectively; p= 0.03 for Glu; and 49 (41) vs 25.8 (19.5) nM BCE/mM creatinine, respectively; p= 0.001 for NTx). In CD patients, Glu was significantly correlated with NTx (r= 0.488; p < 0.001), even after controlling for age, gender, vitamin D status, calcium intake, and corticosteroid use. CONCLUSION: Vitamin K status of CD patients was lower than that of the healthy controls. Furthermore, the rate of bone resorption in the CD was inversely correlated with vitamin K status, suggesting that it might be another etiological factor for CD-related osteopenia.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Budesonide is a corticosteroid with low systemic bioavailability because of its high first-pass metabolism in the liver. In this paediatric, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, controlled, multicentre trial, the safety and efficacy of budesonide versus prednisolone were evaluated in children with active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Forty-eight children, aged 6-16 years, with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index > 200) involving ileum and/or ascending colon were randomized to receive budesonide (9 mg/day for 8 weeks, 6 mg/day for 4 weeks) or prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, tapering for 8 weeks). RESULTS: The groups were comparable for age, sex, pubertal stage, disease activity and disease duration. Mean morning plasma cortisol concentration was significantly higher in the budesonide group (200 nmol/l) than in the prednisolone group (98 nmol/l) after 8 weeks, reflecting less adrenal suppression by budesonide (difference -102 nmol/l; 95% CI -226, -52; P = 0.0028). Glucocorticosteroid side effects such as moon face and acne occurred significantly less frequently in the budesonide group. Remission (Crohn's Disease Activity Index < or = 150) was seen at 8 weeks in 12/22 (55%) patients treated with budesonide and in 17/24 (71%) patients receiving prednisolone (difference -16%; 95% CI -45,13; P = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Significantly fewer side effects and less adrenal suppression were observed in the children receiving budesonide. Remission rates were not significantly different in the two groups. However, there was a trend for prednisolone to be more effective for inducing remission.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Patients frequently ask questions about the lifetime prognosis of Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to describe the outcomes of Crohn's disease more than 20 years after diagnosis. METHODS: Data from all patients with Crohn's disease whose diagnosis had been performed before 1st January 1978 were analyzed. All referred patients filled in a medical and health-related quality-of-life questionnaire. RESULTS: Among 273 patients with Crohn's disease diagnosed more than 20 years ago, 141 (52%) patients answered our questionnaire, 45 (16%) patients were alive but did not wish to answer our questionnaire, 51 (19%) could not be traced and 36 (13%) died before July 1998. At the end of follow-up, 25.7 (20.0-59.3) years after diagnosis, 24% had a relapse in the previous 12 months, and 48% and 28% had quiescent disease with and without treatment, respectively. These ratios were not different from those observed three years after Crohn's disease diagnosis. Sixteen patients died within 20 years after CD diagnosis, including 11 from CD-related causes. The risk of death estimated by Kaplan-Meier life-tables analysis was non-significantly higher if death was related to CD. An ileal or colic adenocarcinoma was noted in 6 (3.4%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease activity does not burn out with time, and roughly one-quarter of the patients had active disease 20 years after diagnosis.},

The records of all patients with IBD who were receiving temporary home TPN between June 1996 and July 2000 were reviewed. A quality-of-life phone interview was conducted at the time of review. Fifteen patients (11 men and 4 women) were identified whose average age was 35 years. The underlying diagnosis was Crohn's disease in 10 and ulcerative colitis in five. The indications for home TPN were complex internal fistulas and resolving sepsis in two, postoperative septic complications (anastomotic leak/enterocutaneous fistula) in five, high-output proximal stomas in four, prolonged ileus/partial obstruction in three, and spontaneous enterocutaneous fistula in one. The average duration of home TPN was 75 days (range 7 to 240 days). Two patients (13%) failed home TPN (1 with uncontrolled sepsis; 1 with dehydration) and were readmitted to the hospital. Home TPN was discontinued in one patient whose enterocutaneous fistula failed to heal with nonoperative treatment. Home TPN was successful in 12 patients (80%): eight (53%) who underwent planned definitive surgery and four (27%) whose conditions resolved without surgery. Complications of home TPN were line sepsis and pulmonary aspergillosis in one patient. All patients preferred home TPN to further hospitalization and reported good or excellent quality of life at home. Home TPN is a safe alternative to prolonged hospitalization or early surgery in patients with complicated IBD.},

Although none of this has been truly mold-breaking, there are sufficient new directions that a review is a worthwhile exercise. RECENT FINDINGS: The arguments in favor of parenteral feeding in acute pancreatitis continue to become weaker. Intravenous nutrition as an alternative to major surgery in Crohn disease should be considered. A series of new, and not so new, complications is reviewed, together with a range of means by which problems may be avoided. New approaches to the avoidance or treatment of the rare case of intravenous nutrition-associated liver disease are discussed. SUMMARY: The parenteral approach remains an important method of nutritional support: recent data help to ensure its safer and more effective implementation.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Limited information is available on the characteristics of longstanding Crohn's disease with onset in childhood or adolescence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 224 patients with pediatric-onset Crohn's disease were compared to a group of patients with disease diagnosed as adults. RESULTS: More than 50% of the patients in the pediatric-onset group were followed for more than a decade, with a mean follow-up of 12.2 years. There were 96 male (42.9%) and 128 female (57.1%) patients. Most had disease diagnosed in adolescence. The female predominance, similar to adult-onset disease, was noted only among patients with disease diagnosed in adolescence (13-19 years), not in childhood. Disease most often involved both ileum and colon (128 of 224; 57.1%). Isolated ileal or colonic disease was less common. Upper gastrointestinal tract disease was present in 42 of 224 (18.8%) patients. The incidence of strictures (28.6%) and penetrating complications (46.4%) was similar to that of adults followed for the same period of time. CONCLUSION: In pediatric-onset Crohn's disease, female-predominance emerges during adolescence. Pediatric-onset disease is more extensive than adult-onset disease. When followed for an extended period of time, it has high rates of disease complexity, with strictures and penetrating complications similar to adult-onset disease.},

There are few large-scale pediatric studies on the complications of infliximab therapy. METHODS: A retrospective review of all infliximab infusions administered to IBD patients at a tertiary children's hospital was undertaken. Data was obtained from an infliximab infusion database maintained in the section of Pediatric Gastroenterology, pharmacy records and patient charts. RESULTS: 594 infusions were administered to 111 IBD patients (88 CD and 23 UC; 55 male and 56 female; ages 4 to 20 years; mean age, 13.4 years). The number of infusions ranged from 1 to 24 with a mean of 5.4/patient. Infusion reactions occurred in 8.1% of patients (seven early and two delayed) and in 1.5% of all infusions. Reactions occurred more frequently in female patients (14% versus 2%; P = 0.03). All reactions were mild and responded rapidly to treatment. Four patients had infections deemed unusual, including three cutaneous tinea infections and one case of shingles. CONCLUSION: Infliximab is safe in pediatric IBD patients with a low incidence of generally mild reactions that respond rapidly to intervention. Infusion reactions are more common in female patients. Our patients had no serious infectious complications, although cutaneous tinea infection may represent a newly reported associated complication.},

Growth retardation, osteopenia and thromboembolic phenomena are some of the inflammatory bowel disease complications in which nutritional deficits are involved. Moreover, nutrients can play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease and, in some cases, can be a primary therapeutic tool. Enteral nutrition has proven to play a therapeutic role in Crohn's disease. The nutrient(s) responsible for this effect are not well identified but dietary fat appears to be a major factor. In ulcerative colitis, unabsorbable carbohydrates can modulate the intestinal microbial environment, thus contributing to improve colonic inflammation.},

   abstract = {Nutrients may be involved in the modulation of the immune response through at least three different mechanisms. First, the intestinal ecosystem plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, triggering the uncontrolled inflammatory response in genetically predisposed individuals. Nutrients, together with bacteria, are major components of, and can therefore influence, the intestinal environment. Second, as components of cell membranes, nutrients can mediate the expression of proteins involved in the immune response, such as cytokines, adhesion molecules and nitric oxide synthase. The composition of lipids in the cell membrane is modified by dietary changes and can influence cellular responses. Indeed, various epidemiological, experimental and clinical data suggest that the immune response may be sensitive to changes in dietary composition. Finally, suboptimal levels of micronutrients are often found in both children and adults with inflammatory bowel disease, although, with the exception of iron and folate, it is unusual to discover symptoms attributable to these deficits. However, subclinical deficits may have a pathophysiological significance, as they may favour the self-perpetuation of the disease (due to defects in the mechanisms of tissue repair), cause defective defence against damage produced by oxygen free radicals and facilitate lipid peroxidation. These events can occur even in clinically inactive or mildly active disease, as well as in the development of dysplasia in the intestinal mucosa. Some dietary manipulations have been attempted as primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and specially formulated diets for enteral nutrition have proved to be an effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Most trials, although lacking sufficient patient numbers, have demonstrated a role for dietary manipulation as primary therapy for inflammatory disease. Dietary lipids are one of the most active nutritional substrates modulating the immune response. Recently, it has been demonstrated that lipids may be a key factor explaining the therapeutic effect of clinical nutrition in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the short bowel syndromes (SBS) it is often difficult to grant a correct and sufficient alimentary supply only by ordinary natural nutrition. In the present research, we will study the prospective possibilities of integrating the nutritional supply making resort to artificial nutrition techniques in patients with SBS. METHODS: We have treated 7 patients with SBS, 6 males and 1 female, whose age was ranging from 29 and 70 years. They all underwent wide intestinal resection, 2 of them for massive infarct, 4 for Crohn's disease, 1 for bowel volvolus. An evaluation of nutritional and immunological conditions was performed on all of them, determining: albumin, transferrin, C-reactive protein, prealbumin, leukocyte count, skin test. In a second time, a protocol was implemented, based on total parenteral nutrition for the first 5 days, with scalar calorie supply up to a total of 35 kcal/kg/die; on day 6 after the operation, the parenteral caloric supply was reduced of 500 kcal/die, being compensated by the introduction of an equal caloric ration by nasointestinal tube with peristaltic pump having a flow of 20 mL/h. In the following days, the parenteral caloric supply was reduced of 500 cal each 48 hours, being substituted with an equal enteral supply in order to progressively reach a complete abandonment of parenteral nutrition. RESULTS: All the patients have a follow-up of 2 to 5 years; today they follow a high-calorie hyperglycidic, hypolipidic diet; no signs of malnutrition are shown by clinical and laboratory analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In the light of the data in our possession, it can be understood that nutritional therapy is the main treatment for SBS; parenteral subministration has to be abandoned during the postoperatory course to give way to enteral nutrition, in order to create a physiological stimulus able to make the digestive system rapidly adapt to the new situation.},

   abstract = {Major advances in the understanding of the aetio-pathogenesis and genetics of inflammatory bowel disease have been accompanied by an escalation in the sophistication of immunomodulatory inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics. However, the basic 'triple' therapy (5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, azathioprine) and nutrition have maintained their central role in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease over recent decades. This review provides an overview of the supportive and therapeutic perspectives of nutrition in adult inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of supportive nutrition is to correct malnutrition in terms of calorie intake or specific macro- or micronutrients. Of particular clinical relevance is deficiency in calcium, vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and zinc. There is justifiably a growing sense of unease amongst clinicians and patients with regard to the long-term use of corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. This, rather than arguments about efficacy, should be the catalyst for revisiting the use of enteral nutrition as primary treatment in Crohn's disease. Treatment failure is usually related to a failure to comply with enteral nutrition. Potential factors that militate against successful completion of enteral nutrition are feed palatability, inability to stay on a solid-free diet for weeks, social inconvenience and transient feed-related adverse reactions. Actions that can be taken to improve treatment outcome include the provision of good support from dietitians and clinicians for the duration of treatment and the subsequent 'weaning' period. There is evidence to support a gradual return to a normal diet through exclusion-re-introduction or other dietary regimen following the completion of enteral nutrition to increase remission rates. We also review the evidence for emerging therapies, such as glutamine, growth factors and short-chain fatty acids. The future may see the evolution of enteral nutrition into an important therapeutic strategy, and the design of a 'Crohn's disease-specific formulation' that is individually tailored, acceptable to patients, cost-effective, free from adverse side-effects and combines enteral nutrition with novel pre- and pro-biotics and other factors.},

   abstract = {The management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to garner vast amounts of attention among physicians who care for adults. However, there is an increasing awareness of the fact that this disease, as well as several other lifelong digestive diseases (i.e. Crohn's disease) may actually have their origins in childhood. Paediatric gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) is likely to share a similar pathophysiology to adult GER, and mounting evidence from published preliminary data suggests a genetic susceptibility to GERD. However, further studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In children, GER has a distinct presentation from that in adults, with the diagnostic work-up based upon the patient's age as well as their presenting signs and symptoms. Like their adult counterparts, the early detection and treatment of GER in children may result in a better long-term outcome, improved quality-of-life, and a reduction in overall healthcare burden. While the treatment of GER in infants tends to be conservative (i.e. positioning during feeding, smaller feedings), its management in older children parallels that of adults and includes lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapy. However, with persistent symptoms, acid suppression is the mainstay of GERD management in both children and adults. Several studies in children have verified that acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor is superior to histamine-2 receptor antagonists. Among the proton pump inhibitors, both lansoprazole and omeprazole have been the subject of published adult and paediatric studies demonstrating their short and long-term safety, in addition to their efficacy in a variety of oesophageal and supra-oesophageal GERD related conditions. These two proton pump inhibitors are manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be emptied into soft foods or liquids without compromising their pharmacological effects or pharmacokinetic properties. Lansoprazole is also available as a strawberry-flavoured suspension that is acceptable to children and as an oral disintegrating tablet.},

   abstract = {Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. Speculation on the underlying mechanism of action has moved away from the presentation of nitrogen and towards the fat content of the various enteral feeds. Evidence is accumulating that additional long-chain triglyceride in such feeds impairs the response rate in active Crohn's disease, whereas no deleterious effects of additional medium-chain triglyceride have been identified. It has been proposed that long-chain triglycerides composed from n-6 fatty acids may be the most harmful, since such fatty acids are substrates for inflammatory eicosanoid production. However, recent studies comparing different enteral feeds are not consistent in identifying which additional fatty acids impair response rates to the greatest extent. Despite meta-analyses concluding that polymeric diets (typically containing large amounts of fat) are as effective as elemental diets, it would seem sensible to use enteral feeds with minimal fat content when treating active Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Low serum zinc concentrations have been reported in Crohn's disease (CD) and overt zinc deficiency has been described, but little is known about the effect of CD on zinc metabolism in adolescents. The aim of this study was to measure zinc absorption, endogenous fecal zinc excretion, urinary zinc excretion, and zinc balance in children with stable CD and in matched controls. Subjects were 15 children, ages 8-18 y, with stable CD, and 15 healthy matched controls. Subjects were adapted to diets providing 12 mg/d elemental zinc for 2 wk, and then admitted for a 6-d metabolic study. Stable zinc isotopes were given intravenously and orally, and urine and feces collected for 6 d. Fractional zinc absorption, endogenous fecal zinc excretion, and zinc balance were calculated using established stable isotope methods. In subjects with CD, zinc absorption (10.9% +/- 6.1 versus 23.4 +/- 15.8, p = 0.008) and plasma zinc concentration (0.85 mg/dL +/- 0.15 versus 1.25 +/- 0.35, p = 0.004) were significantly reduced, compared with controls. Despite this, there were no significant differences in endogenous fecal zinc excretion (2.0 mg +/- 1.5 versus 1.5 +/- 1.5, p = 0.34) or urinary zinc excretion (0.9 mg +/- 0.7 versus 1.0 +/- 0.7, p = 0.47). Zinc balance was significantly lower in CD (-1.5 mg +/- 1.5) than in controls (+0.6 mg +/- 3.1, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, adolescents with CD have significantly reduced zinc absorption. Despite this, they were unable to reduce endogenous fecal zinc excretion to restore normal zinc balance and had a significantly worse zinc balance and lower plasma zinc concentration than controls.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our purpose was to study the concordance of serological tests for inflammatory bowel disease with clinical diagnosis established by traditional testing in children. METHODS: All children seen in our division who had IBD Diagnostic System (ie, pANCA, ASCA IgA, and ASCA IgG) performed over a 21-month period (June 1998 to February 2000) were identified. Their medical records were reviewed for basic demographics, test results (endoscopy, histology, and radiology), IBD Diagnostic System results, and patient symptoms/medications. Results of the IBD Diagnostic System were compared with several patient characteristics including age, sex, absence/presence of symptoms, medication use, disease activity and duration. RESULTS: One hundred seven patients were divided into 6 groups based on clinical diagnosis and IBD Diagnostic System results. The sensitivity, specificity and +/- predictive values of the IBD Diagnostic System for ulcerative colitis were 69.2, 95.1, 90.0, and 87.1%, respectively, and for Crohn's disease were 54.1, 96.8, 90.9, and 80.8%, respectively. Overall, the results of the IBD Diagnostic System were concordant with the clinical diagnosis in 76 of the 107 (71%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the specificity of IBD Diagnostic System is better than the sensitivity; the sensitivity is better for ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease (69.2% vs 54.1%). The low sensitivity, especially for Crohn's disease, precludes the possibility that the IBD Diagnostic System can replace traditional studies when evaluating for inflammatory bowel disease. Though we do not exclude inflammatory bowel disease solely by IBD Diagnostic System results, it is reassuring to note that all patients without clinical evidence of inflammatory bowel disease also had negative IBD Diagnostic System results.},

It remains unclear whether it is the body fat mass or the lean tissue mass that is reduced. OBJECTIVE: We compared body-composition values in patients who had undergone small-intestinal resection with reference values obtained in healthy volunteers, and we studied the relation between body-composition estimates and the net intestinal absorption of energy. DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, we included 20 men and 24 women who had undergone small-intestinal resection and had malabsorption of energy > 2000 kJ/d. Diagnoses were Crohn disease (n = 37) and other conditions (n = 7). Body composition was estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and data were compared with those from a reference group of 173 healthy volunteers. Energy absorption was measured during 48-h balance studies by using bomb calorimetry, and individual values were expressed relative to the basal metabolic rate. RESULTS: Body weight and body mass index in patients were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the reference values. Fat mass was 6.4 kg (30%) lower (95% CI: -8.8, -3.9 kg), but lean tissue mass was only slightly and insignificantly lower (1.5 kg, or 3.3%; 95% CI: -3.7, 0.60 kg). Weight, body mass index, and body-composition estimates by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry did not correlate significantly with the net energy absorption relative to the basal metabolic rate, expressed as a percentage. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had undergone small-intestinal resection had significantly lower body weights and body mass indexes than did healthy persons, and they had significant changes in body composition, mainly decreased body fat mass.},

We evaluated the spinal, hip, and forearm bone mass density longitudinally in a cohort of 75 patients receiving HPN. METHODS: A total of 943 regional dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans, 335 spinal, 318 hip, and 290 forearm, obtained between 1995 and 2003 in 75 patients receiving HPN, were used for the analysis of the annual changes in BMD. The average (SD) number of scans per patients was 4.4 (2.9), and follow-up time was 4.1 (1.9) years. Diagnoses were Crohn's disease (n = 35) and other conditions (non-Crohn's diseases; n = 40). Data were analyzed using a linear random coefficient model. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant overall decline over time in spinal, hip, and forearm BMD, corresponding roughly to a 1% annual loss (p < .005); however, the loss was not significantly larger than that of age and sex-matched healthy subjects. In Crohn's disease patients, model estimates of spinal and hip BMD on the initiation of HPN therapy were significantly reduced compared with normal, whereas values were not significantly reduced in non-Crohn's disease patients. CONCLUSIONS: With the current protocols for HPN treatment, the annual decline in BMD is moderate and not significantly larger than in age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. A considerable part of the metabolic bone disease in these patients is related to the underlying disease for which the HPN was indicated.},

Progress in IBD management strategies has led to optimized approaches for achieving the two primary clinical goals of therapy: induction and maintenance of remission. Although surgery is indicated to treat refractory disease or specific complications, pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of IBD management. The efficacy of aminosalicylates for induction of remission in mild to moderate UC and CD is well established, as is their role for maintenance of remission in UC. The sulfa-free mesalamine formulation offers an adverse effect profile similar to that of placebo, enabling the administration of higher, more effective doses. Although corticosteroids provide potent anti-inflammatory effects, their benefits are countermanded by the risk of intolerable and serious adverse effects, and they are ineffective for maintenance therapy. Other agents effective in inducing or maintaining remission are azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, infliximab, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and antibiotics. Ongoing clinical trials of experimental therapies will generate new tools for IBD treatment. Currently, a broad range of options allows physicians to tailor treatment to each patient's needs and preferences. Such considerations are essential for maximizing adherence to therapy.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The past year has brought forth several controversies regarding the treatment of ulcerative colitis along with several potentially important clinical advances. The aim of this review is to provide the practicing gastroenterologist with a summation of these recent developments, with particular emphasis on advances that have already moved toward acceptance into clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Controversies remain regarding the optimal formulations and doses of aminosalicylates. At the same time, the potential for chemoprotective effects in patients using maintenance therapy with mesalamine derivatives has been expanded. In addition, advances in biologic therapy for Crohn disease are beginning to be formally evaluated in ulcerative colitis, although the benefits of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy in this condition remain to be established. Biologic therapies are beginning to be explored as adjunctive therapy for steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis, where trials of calcineurin inhibitors are also advancing clinical practice for this poor prognostic subgroup of patients. Finally, after surgery for ulcerative colitis, the treatment and prevention of pouchitis has become the one established indication for probiotic therapy. SUMMARY: Despite some inroads into the medical therapy of ulcerative colitis, controversies remain regarding the optimal dosing and delivery systems of the most fundamental therapies, and how to optimize therapy for severe ulcerative colitis. Clinical research will continue to investigate new biologic agents that inhibit tumor necrosis factor and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, and ongoing trials with leukocyte apheresis are currently under way.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effect of different treatment regimens on antibody responses to infliximab and their clinical significance was examined by using data from ACCENT I. METHODS: Patients with Crohn's disease (n = 573) received 5 mg/kg infliximab (week 0) and then were randomly assigned to blinded infusions at weeks 2 and 6 and every 8 weeks until week 46 of placebo (group I), 5 mg/kg infliximab (group II), or 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 2 and 6, followed by 10 mg/kg thereafter (group III). At week 14 or later, patients losing response could cross over to episodic infliximab treatment increased by 5 mg/kg. Samples for antibody determination were collected before the first infusion and at weeks 14, 22, 54, 62, 72, and, if applicable, before and after crossover. RESULTS: Through week 72, antibodies to infliximab were detected in 30%, 10%, and 7% of groups I, II, and III, respectively (P < 0.0001). Patients receiving immunomodulators had a lower incidence of antibodies compared with patients receiving infliximab alone (10% and 18%, respectively; P = 0.02). Antibodies were associated with a 12% absolute increase in infusion reactions but no increase in serious infusion reactions or serum sickness-like reactions. In the overall population, similar proportions of antibody-positive and antibody-negative patients achieved clinical response (64% and 62%, respectively; P = NS) or clinical remission (41% and 39%, respectively; P = NS) at week 54. Notably, 86% of patients responded to retreatment, and 63% were in clinical response at week 54; however, fewer antibody-positive group I patients attained clinical remission (31%) compared with those who were antibody negative (37%) or antibody inconclusive (54%) (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced antibody formation and greater clinical benefit were observed with an induction regimen followed by maintenance treatment compared with a single dose followed by episodic retreatment in Crohn's disease patients treated with infliximab.},

Both sulfasalazine and newer derivatives are effective in preventing relapses. It remains to be determined whether certain high-risk groups of patients may benefit from higher doses of mesalamine induction or maintenance therapy. Mesalamine derivatives are also of benefit in the treatment of Crohn's disease. Sulfasalazine is likely not effective in the maintenance of Crohn's disease, although other mesalamine formulations continue to show some prophylactic activity after mesalamine induced remissions and for patients with disease of the ileum who have undergone surgical resection.},

An intra-abdominal abscess was suspected. Ultrasound and MRI failed to demonstrate the suspected abscess. Owing to ongoing pain and fever, the risk to the fetus of a CT scan were discussed with the patient, obstetricians and radiologists, with considerable debate about the possibility of other explanations for her symptoms. Ultimately, a CT scan revealed marked thickening of the distal ileum and confirmed diagnosis of an abscess in continuity with the inflamed bowel. INVESTIGATIONS: Ultrasound, MRI, CT scan, urinalysis, urine culture and liver function tests. DIAGNOSIS: Crohn's disease flare complicated by an intra-abdominal abscess. MANAGEMENT: Antibiotics (ceftizoxime, metronidazole and amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium), parenteral nutrition and ileocecectomy.},

It can affect people of any age, but is more commonly diagnosed in adolescence and young adulthood. Inflammation and ulceration occurs primarily in the terminal ileum and colon, although any portion of the intestinal tract can be affected. No etiology has been identified for Crohn's disease, although a number of factors contribute to its etiopathogenesis, including genetic, microbial, inflammatory, immune, and permeability abnormalities. Conventional medications are not curative but can contribute to resolution of acute flare-ups and help maintain remission. Because significant side effects are associated with many these medications, more natural interventions to help maintain remission should be considered. Associated nutrient deficiencies, dietary interventions, and nutrient and botanical supplementation are discussed.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Jejunoileitis might be a severe form of Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of the study was to evaluate clinical characteristics, therapeutics modalities and long-term outcome in CD patients with jejunoileitis (CDJI). METHODS: All patients with CDJI followed in the department of Gastroenterology from 1963 to 1999 were included and compared to matched (on Year of CD diagnosis) CD controls without jejunoileitis. Data were obtained from retrospective review of medical charts. RESULTS: Eighteen patients with CDJI were compared to 36 matched CD controls. Median follow-up was 7.65 Years in both groups. At time of CDJI diagnosis the following signs were significantly more frequent in patients with jejunoileal CD than in controls: malnutrition (39% vs 3%), pain suggesting obstruction (33% vs 8%), vomiting (28% vs 5%). Patients with CDJI were more frequently male: M/F ratio=2.0/1.1 (P=0.33). Upper digestive involvement (esophagus, stomach and duodenum) (67% vs 36%, P=0.04) and small intestine strictures (61% vs 19%, P=0.06) were more frequent in CDJI. Initial management was more "aggressive" in CDJI than in controls: steroids in 62% vs 30%, azathioprine in 39% vs 3%, total parenteral nutrition in 28% vs 8% and surgery in 33% vs 17%. During follow-up, the need for azathioprine therapy and surgery were more frequent in CDJI than in controls (extensive small bowel resection in two patients). In 10 of 18 patients, jejunoileitis involvement was diagnosed with a median delay of 3.6 Years (range: 0.5-14.5) after CD diagnosis and at time of CD diagnosis in the 8 others; outcome after CDJI diagnosis was similar in these 2 groups. CONCLUSION: The main revealing signs of jejunoileitis in CD patients are obstruction and malnutrition. Patients with CDJI require more often azathioprine and surgery than CD patients without jejunoileitis. Jejunoileitis is a severe form of CD more frequently complicated by extensive small bowel resection.},

   abstract = {Hemorrhoids are a common cause of perianal complaints and affect 1-10 million people in North-America and with similar incidence in Europe. Symptomatic hemorrhoids are associated with nutrition, inherited predisposition, retention of feces with or without chronic abuse of laxatives or diarrhea. Increased pressure and shearing force in the anal canal may lead to severe changes in topography with detachment of the hemorrhoids from the internal sphincter and fibromuscular network resulting in bleeding, itching, pain and disordered anorectal function, even incontinence. The significance of hemorrhoids for anal continence (corpus cavernosum) is recognized. In most instances, hemorrhoids are treated conservatively; the surgeon is contacted when conservative measures have failed or complications, e.g., thrombosis, have occurred. 4 degrees prolapsed internal hemorrhoids are the main indication for hemorrhoidectomy: high (Parks) or low (Milligan-Morgan) ligation with excision, closed hemorrhoidectomy (Ferguson) or stapler hemorrhoidectomy. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids are primary treated by incision and secondary by excision. Complications after operative treatment of external thrombosed hemorrhoids are rare. After standard hemorrhoidectomy for internal hemorrhoids approximately 10% may have a complicated follow-up (bleeding, fissure, fistula, abscess, stenosis, urinary retention, soiling, incontinence); there may be concomitant disease, e.g., perianal cryptoglandular infection, causing complex fistula/abscess, which is associated with an increased risk (30-80%) for complications, e.g., incontinence. Other treatment options, e.g., sphincterotomy, anal stretch, have been accused to cause more complications, e.g., incontinence in 30-50% of cases. However, incontinence is a complex phenomenon; it is evident that an isolated single injury is normally not a sufficient cause, e.g., injury of the internal sphincter. The majority of patients may present with prior obstetric injury, perianal infection or Crohn's disease and other comorbidity. Therefore all systemic and regional disorders, causing incontinence, should be excluded before starting manometric, neurophysiological and sonographic investigations. Variation and overlap in test results, patient-, instrument- or operator-dependent factors ask for cautious interpretation. There is vast evidence that the demonstration of muscle fibers in hemorrhoidectomy specimens is a normal feature. In conclusion, standard hemorrhoidectomy with proper indication is a safe procedure. If complications occur, it is in the interest of the patient and surgeon to perform a thorough investigation.},

The index case is a 10-year-old girl with a history of refractory Crohn's colitis treated with aggressive immunosuppressive therapy whose course subsequently was complicated by central nervous system aspergillosis. Additional evaluation showed a diagnosis of CGD, an underlying immunodeficiency in which phagocytes fail to produce microbicidal reactive oxygen intermediates because of inherited defects in the reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine phosphate dinucleotide (NADPH) oxidase. The diagnosis of a typically X-linked inherited disease in our female patient suggested that she had 1 of the 3 less common autosomal recessive forms of the disease. This was confirmed by studies showing the absence of the p47(phox) subunit of NADPH oxidase in her neutrophils and the presence of a homozygous dinucleotide deletion in the neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 gene that encodes p47(phox). Additional analyses of members of the patient's immediate family showed the same homozygous mutation in 2 siblings, 1 of whom also developed chronic colitis consistent with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. These 2 cases emphasize the importance of high clinical suspicion for an alternative diagnosis of immune deficiency in the setting of presumed inflammatory bowel disease and opportunistic infection.},

The number of IBD genes is currently unknown but it is expected to be equal or higher to 8. None of these genes are expected to be neither necessary nor sufficient for disease development. Among the candidate genes investigated to date, only CARD15/NOD2 has been definitively associated with Crohn Disease (CD) but not Ulcerative Colitis (UC). This gene explains about 20% of the genetic predisposition to CD. Because it is involved in the innate immunity, it allows to speculate that CD is the result of a defect in host-bacteria interaction. However, it is not known if CD is caused by specific bacteria or the gut flora as a whole.},

We examined the effects of postoperative nutritional therapy in patients with perforating type and non-perforating type Crohn's disease. METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively reviewed the records for 218 patients who underwent surgical interventions for Crohn's disease in our hospital between January 1, 1974 and September 30, 2001. They were divided into four groups: 92 patients in the non-perforating type (NP type) + Elemental Diet (ED) group had received ED therapy and nutritional education, 22 patients in the NP type + NoED group had not received ED therapy or nutritional education, 88 patients in the perforating type (P type) + ED group and 16 patients in P type + NoED group. We evaluated the incidence of reoperation rate for each group. RESULTS: Patients with a postoperative ED therapy demonstrated a significant decrease in the incidence of second resection. The incidence of second resection in the NP type + ED group was significantly lower than that of the other groups. The NP type + NoED group and the P type + ED group followed similar courses. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Crohn's disease postoperative ED therapy and nutritional education is effective in reducing the incidence of second resection. It appears that postoperative ED therapy and nutritional education is more important in patients with P type Crohn's disease.},

Since her plasma selenium level was found to be below the measurable level, we diagnosed this case as selenium deficiency. After intravenous administration of sodium selenite, her symptoms were reversed. Careful attention should be paid to selenium deficiency when a patient receives long-term TPN; supplementary administration of selenium via TPN may be required because selenium is often not routinely added to TPN formulations.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Weight loss and nutritional depletion are common features of inflammatory bowel disease. Our aim was to assess body composition in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and to evaluate possible differences between the patient groups and healthy subjects. METHODS: A total of 60 patients with CD, 60 patients with UC, and 60 healthy subjects were investigated. Each group consisted of 24 men and 36 women. Body composition was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and Z scores were obtained by comparison to age- and sex-matched normal values. RESULTS: Bone mineral content and lean body mass were significantly lower in patients with CD compared with patients with UC and healthy subjects. The body composition of CD men was more strongly affected than that of women. UC patients had significantly higher fat mass and body mass index than patients with CD and healthy subjects. There was no difference in the percentage of fat mass between the two patient groups. Corticosteroid treatment and smoking had a negative impact on bone mineral content and lean body mass in CD patients independently of each other. CONCLUSIONS: CD was associated with disturbances in body composition: both bone mineral content and lean body mass were significantly reduced, especially in men with CD. Corticosteroid therapy and smoking had a significant influence on body composition in patients with CD. When studying the effects of inflammatory bowel disease on body composition and nutritional status, patients with CD and UC should be evaluated separately.},

For some, such as celiac disease, both important genetic and environmental determinants have been identified as well as a specific treatment. For others, such as pernicious anemia and inflammatory bowel disease, animal models have provided important research advances. Two conditions, inflammatory bowel disease and sclerosing cholangitis, are strongly associated. Characteristic immunologic features of these diseases are critical for diagnosis. Although the majority of conditions are currently treated with nonselective anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, recent research has introduced novel biological agents, exemplified by the successful use of infliximab for Crohn's disease.},

The aim of this study was to characterize chemokine receptor expression in peripheral blood memory T cells in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and to correlate the expression with disease activity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 24 patients with CD, 30 patients with UC, 24 normal controls and 10 disease controls. PBMCs were stained by anti-CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO and beta 7 integrin, and the expression of the chemokine receptors were determined by flow cytometry. CCR4 expression on memory T cells was significantly lower in UC than in CD or normal controls, and that of memory CD4+ T and beta 7(high) memory CD4+ T cells was significantly higher in CD than in UC or normal controls. CCR4 expression on memory CD4+ T cells exhibited significant positive correlation with disease activity in CD, and this decreased significantly after treatment. Such a decrease was not found in the disease controls. CCR5 and CXCR3 expression on memory CD8+ T cells was significantly lower in CD than in normal controls. CXCR3 expression on beta 7(high) memory CD4+ T and CXCR3 expression on memory CD8+ T cells were lower in UC than in normal controls. These findings suggest that in peripheral blood memory T cells, chemokine receptor expression is different between CD and UC. Enhancement of CCR4 and suppression of CCR5 and CXCR3 seem to be the characteristic chemokine receptor profile in peripheral blood memory T cells of CD.},

   abstract = {The British Artificial Nutrition Survey 2001 recorded 507 home parenteral nutrition (HPN) patients (Crohn's disease 31.5%, vascular disease 19.7%, cancer 6.9%). Parenteral nutrition was administered via tunnelled central line (92%) and supplied by a commercial homecare company in 89% of cases. The majority of HPN patients live at home (95.5%) with an independent life (74%), normal activity (59.2%) and 92% survive 1 year. However, there is good evidence that the geographical distribution of HPN patients is uneven (prevalence no patients to thirty-six patients per million of the population) suggesting inequity of access. Patients are increasingly concerned about the distances travelled to main centres and variable standards of more local support. Funding issues continue to cause difficulties as commissioning of health care transfers from Health Authorities to Primary Care Trusts. The two nationally-funded intestinal failure units provide HPN services to 220 HPN patients. HPN-related readmissions have displaced those awaiting admission for intestinal failure treatment, for which the waiting list mortality in one unit has risen to 14%. The government has now recognised HPN as a specialised service distinct from intestinal failure and that existing medium-sized HPN units should be encouraged to take on HPN patients from intestinal failure units and smaller units. In Scotland a Managed Clinical HPN Network supported by the Scottish administration now cares for seventy-two patients under common protocols. The challenge for the future is how to provide high-quality care to all who need it in the rest of the UK.},

A relatively smaller number of patients receive dietary treatment as well.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a multifunctional cytokine whose net principle action is to diminish inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of IL-13 production has been proposed to contribute to intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Previous studies implicate IL-13 in IBD pathogenesis; however, they fail to accurately reflect in vivo intestinal IL-13 production. We evaluate IL-13, IL-6, and IL-1beta elaborations from colonic organ cultures of pediatric IBD patients METHODS: Endoscopic lamina propria biopsies or surgical specimens from pediatric patients with IBD were organ cultured and supernatants evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-13. RESULTS: IL-13 concentrations were significantly reduced in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients when compared with normal controls (P = 0.002) and Crohn disease (CD) patients (P = 0.001). End-stage UC patients at colectomy had lower intestinal IL-13 production than all other UC patients (P = 0.002). No significant correlation was found between IL-13 concentration and histologic disease severity (P = 0.134). CONCLUSIONS: Diminished intestinal IL-13 production is present in UC patients and wanes further with clinical disease progression. These findings suggest that UC patients may be differentiated from CD patients by intestinal IL-13 quantitation, and UC patients may benefit from IL-13 enhancing therapies.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Restorative proctocolectomy is the elective surgical procedure of choice for ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. Most patients have a satisfactory outcome, but at ten years 15 percent or more will have failed, needing indefinite defunctioning or excision of the pouch. There is little information on the morbidity of pouch excision. The study was designed to present the early results of surgical removal of the pouch after failed restorative proctocolectomy with reference to the indications and intermediate complications, particularly of the perineal wound. METHODS: Between 1977 and 2002, 996 patients underwent a restorative proctocolectomy at our hospital and 245 patients were referred for potential salvage. The pouch was excised in 58 and 10 patients respectively. There were 40 females and 28 males (median age, 34 (14-65) years) including 47 with ulcerative colitis, 10 with Crohn's disease, and 11 with familial adenomatous polyposis. The median follow-up was 79 (range, 3-312) months from excision. RESULTS: There was one (1.4 percent) postoperative death. The overall morbidity rate was 62.3 percent (immediate 30 days (25 percent), late (53.7 percent)). Thirty-six patients (53.7 percent) were readmitted on 67 occasions for a late complication. The risk of readmission from the time of pouch excision was 38 and 58 percent at one and five years, respectively. Surgical treatment was required during 48 of these readmissions. A persistent perineal sinus was the most common late complication. The perineal wound was not healed at 6 months in 27 patients (40 percent) and at 12 months in 7 patients (10 percent). No factor, including age at the time of pouch excision, gender, indication for excision, or final histologic diagnosis, was associated with an unhealed perineal wound. Two males (7 percent) had impotence. One female suffered from short-bowel syndrome with the need of permanent parenteral nutrition. The median overall hospital stay for all admissions was 20 (range, 8-220) days. CONCLUSIONS: Pouch excision is associated with high morbidity. Perineal wound-delayed healing is the commonest late complication and often requires further surgery.},

   abstract = {Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a global malabsorption syndrome that results from extensive intestinal resections. It used to be a typical complication of repetitive bowel resections in patients with Crohn's disease. However, due to improved medical and surgical therapies for these patients it currently occurs more frequently as a consequence of vascular disorders in adults (intestinal infarction) and congenital aberrations in children, respectively. Adequate therapy depends on the degree of (small) bowel losses and on resulting functional disturbances. Moreover, it must be adjusted to the postoperative adaptation process, which consists of three phases: The immediate acute phase lasts less than 4 weeks and serves to stabilise the patient. The subsequent year should be used to induce maximal adaptation by gradually increasing nutrient exposure. When maximal stimulation of nutrient absorption has been achieved, permanent maintenance nutrition treatment should be defined individually, dependent on extent and quality of nutritive deficits. In patients with Crohn's disease, optimal treatment of the underlying disease is of pivotal importance in order to avoid a further reduction of absorptive capacity or other complications. Current investigations aim at improving the adaptation process by administration of specific diets and growth hormones. With these, it appears possible to treat even some patients with very short bowel, i.e. less than 50 cm of small intestine left, with oral nutrition, only. Still, a considerable proportion of patients will need long-term parenteral nutrition. If young patients experience intolerable complications of parenteral nutrition, intestinal transplantation may be considered as a high risk therapy of last choice.},

Animal studies indicate that Paneth cell numbers, location and granule morphology are altered by infection and zinc status. We examined human tissue to determine whether Paneth cell numbers, distribution or granule morphology are altered in infective, inflammatory and nutritional disorders. Archival sections from infective disorders (giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, HIV, helminth infection) were compared with active inflammatory conditions (coeliac, Crohn's and graft-versus-host diseases) and histologically normal tissues. A subset of tissues was studied by electron microscopy and TUNEL staining for apoptosis. Human defensin-5 (HD5) peptide and mRNA was analysed by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sections from a tropical population cohort study were then analysed to determine the relationship of granule depletion to infection, nutritional status and plasma zinc concentration. In HIV-related cryptosporidiosis, but not other disorders, Paneth cells were reduced in number and markedly depleted of granules. Paneth cell granule depletion was associated with reduced HD5 immunoreactivity, but this was not due to apoptosis and there was no reduction in mRNA transcripts. In the tropical population studied, depletion of granules was associated with reduced body mass index, reduced plasma zinc levels and HIV infection. Paneth cell granules in human small intestine may be depleted in response to infective and nutritional stress. We postulate that this is one mechanism through which zinc status influences host susceptibility to intestinal infection.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) primarily affect young adults, but in 15%-25% of cases, the initial disease starts in childhood. Many aspects of inflammatory bowel disease, including initial evaluation, nutritional support, medical and surgical intervention, and the direction of future research, are encountered in both adult and pediatric patients. However, it is important to delineate issues specific to pediatric patients, especially growth velocity impairment, derangements in and treatment of abnormal bone mineralization, and transitional care issues; the lack of extensive randomized, controlled pediatric therapeutic trials is also a concern. This article reviews the epidemiology of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease incidence and prevalence worldwide, clinical issues (including impairments of growth velocity and bone density), diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, and psychosocial issues unique to pediatric patients. Future research directions defined by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and opportunities provided by existing pediatric research databases are highlighted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has long been believed that breastfeeding provides protection against ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. Studies designated to test this hypothesis were conducted without reaching conclusive results. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analysis was to examine the role of breastfeeding in preventing inflammatory bowel disease and to summarize the evidence gathered about this subject. DESIGN: A meta-analysis was performed on 17 relevant articles that were found by using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Internet, and articles' references. The publications were fully reviewed and divided, on the basis of their quality, into 3 groups. RESULTS: Studies showed heterogeneous results. The pooled odds ratios of all the 17 reviewed studies, calculated according to the random-effects model, were 0.67 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.86) for Crohn disease and 0.77 (0.61, 0.96) for ulcerative colitis. However, only 4 studies for Crohn disease and 4 for ulcerative colitis were eventually included in the highest quality group. In this group, the pooled odds ratio was 0.45 (0.26, 0.79) for Crohn disease and 0.56 (0.38, 0.81) for ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis support the hypothesis that breastfeeding is associated with lower risks of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. However, because only a few studies were graded to be of high quality, we suggest that further research, conducted with good methodology and large sample sizes, should be carried out to strengthen the validity of these observations.},

   abstract = {Intestinal failure and its most important cause, short-bowel syndrome (SBS), are rare clinical entities leading to a vast complex of symptoms and complications with significant morbidity and mortality. Both conditions occur as the result of a massive reduction in enteral nutrient absorptive capacity. Disease manifestation is based on aetiological and anatomical characteristics such as remaining intestinal length and the presence of a functionally intact colon. Congenital and perinatal conditions, for example, intestinal atresia, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and intestinal volvulus are the most important causes in children. The aetiology in adults is based on diseases inducing loss of intestinal function or loss of intestinal surface area after extensive surgical resections. The most frequent causes are mesenteric infarction, radiation enteritis and Crohn's disease. Knowledge of the epidemiology of intestinal failure and SBS is limited, being mainly based on the extrapolated figures of home parenteral nutrition centres and single-centre studies. At present, the incidence of SBS is estimated to be 2-5 per million.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We describe the prolonged clinical benefit of murine chimeric antitumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha monoclonal antibody, infliximab, on pediatric patients with Crohn's disease and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). METHODS: A retrospective review of patients originally diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, status post colectomy and IPAA, who developed findings compatible with Crohn's disease was undertaken. Refractory pouchitis developed in all patients as well as protracted symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, joint pain, and incontinence. All patients received infliximab. RESULTS: Four pediatric patients (2 males and 2 females) with mean age of 14.5 years (range 11-18 years) were studied. The development of perianal fistulas in 2 patients, granuloma on biopsy in 1 patient and perianal skin tag in 1 patient, led to a diagnosis change of CD. After failure to respond to antibiotics, aminosalicylates and immunomodulators such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), all patients were treated with infliximab. Patients received infliximab infusions at a dose of 5 mg/kg, initially at weeks 0, 2 and 6 and subsequently at 8 weeks intervals in combination with an immunomodulator drug. All patients showed marked improvement clinically, endoscopically, and histologically. CONCLUSION: Infliximab can be used successfully for the treatment of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease and IPAA who are refractory to conventional therapies.},

   abstract = {GOALS: To determine the significance of performing routine duodenal biopsies during upper intestinal endoscopy in a pediatric population and to evaluate their contribution to the overall diagnosis. BACKGROUND: Performing duodenal biopsy during every upper endoscopy regardless of the indication for endoscopy and the macroscopic findings, is a controversial topic. Advocates of performing routine biopsies argue that unexpected pathology such as villous atrophy, may have significant clinical implications. Opponents argue that the yield of performing a biopsy on an apparently normal mucosa is low. STUDY: Duodenal biopsies, routinely taken from 201 pediatric patients during upper endoscopy over a 26-month period were retrospectively reviewed. Duodenal biopsies taken during this period for suspected mucosal lesions were not included in the analysis. Indications for endoscopy included suspected peptic disease, gastroesophageal reflux, unexplained vomiting, abdominal pain, iron deficiency anemia and Crohn disease. RESULTS: Of the 201 sets of biopsies reviewed, 159 (79.1%) were normal, 7 had insufficient material for evaluation and 35 (17.4%) carried abnormalities that included: 10 Giardia lamblia (4.9%), 13 mild chronic inflammation (6.5%), and 8 increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (3.9%). Two biopsies showed mixed acute and chronic inflammation, 1 showed lymphatic dilatation and 1 had a mild mucosal lesion. The risk for microscopic pathology in the duodenum was higher when Helicobacter pylori was present in the gastric biopsy (25.98% vs. 12.16% P < 0.02). The negative predictive value of a normal appearing duodenal mucosa was 81.5%, implying that a normal appearing mucosa does not rule out pathology. No complications were encountered in our series. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the inclusion of routine duodenal biopsies as part of upper endoscopy in pediatric patients should be considered favorably. This practice may yield additional pathologic findings that otherwise could have been missed. It should be done regardless of the indication for endoscopy or the gross appearance of the mucosa. This practice does not increase the risk of the procedure.},

Approximately two thirds to three fourths of hospitalized patients with active disease and one fourth of outpatients with Crohn disease are malnourished. Malnutrition, which can be present even when Crohn disease is in remission, can affect growth, cellular and humoral immunity, bone density, and wound healing. Decreased nutrient intake, malabsorption, drug-nutrient interactions, anorexia, and protein-losing enteropathy can all contribute to the protein-calorie malnutrition and other specific nutrient deficiencies seen in Crohn disease. Therefore, by preventing and correcting nutrient deficiencies, nutritional therapy is an important component in the overall management of patients with Crohn disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of newly diagnosed pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a large population-based model. STUDY DESIGN: All pediatric gastroenterologists providing care for Wisconsin children voluntarily identified all new cases of IBD during a 2-year period. Demographic and clinical data were sent to a central registry prospectively for analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of IBD in Wisconsin children was 7.05 per 100,000, whereas the incidence for Crohn's disease was 4.56, more than twice the rate of ulcerative colitis (2.14). An equal IBD incidence occurred among all ethnic groups, and children from sparsely and densely populated counties were equally affected. The majority (89%) of new IBD diagnoses were nonfamilial. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel, prospective, and comprehensive information on pediatric IBD incidence within the United States. The surprisingly high incidence of pediatric IBD, the predominance of Crohn's disease over ulcerative colitis, the low frequency of patients with a family history, the equal distribution of IBD among all racial and ethnic groups, and the lack of a modulatory effect of urbanization on IBD incidence collectively suggest that the clinical spectrum of IBD is still evolving and point to environmental factors contributing to the pathogenesis.},

We evaluated short-term responsiveness and determined the minimal change in PCDAI score associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in disease activity. METHODS: Standardized effect size (SES) and standardized response mean (SRM) were calculated as measures of responsiveness among pediatric patients being treated for acute exacerbations of Crohn disease 1) in a regular clinical practice setting and 2) as part of a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the minimal PCDAI score change associated with significant clinical improvement used as the gold standard in 1) physician global assessment of change and in 2) change in adult Crohn disease activity index (CDAI). RESULTS: Among responders, the SES and SRM of the PCDAI were 1.78 and 1.41 (95% CI: 0.89-1.92) and 2.10 and 1.95 (95% CI: 1.70-2.20) in the clinical practice setting and RCT setting, respectively. The optimal minimal PCDAI change score associated with clinically significant change in physician global assessment was determined to be -12.5 (sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 92.3%). In the RCT setting a change in PCDAI of -10 corresponded to a change in CDAI of not greater-than-or-equal 70 points. CONCLUSIONS: The PCDAI is responsive to improvement in disease activity in Crohn disease patients over a short interval. As such, the PCDAI is an appropriate instrument to use in pediatric acute treatment trials.},

In a historical cohort study, we evaluated the usefulness of baseline gastric antral biopsies in the differentiation of pediatric chronic colitides. METHODS: During initial investigation for suspected inflammatory bowel disease, 39 children and adolescents with colitis but normal small bowel radiography underwent pretreatment upper endoscopy concurrently with colonoscopy. Two reviewers assigned a colonoscopic diagnosis (colonic CD, UC, or indeterminate colitis) based on the macroscopic and microscopic appearances of the colonic mucosa. Antral histological findings were compared between groups using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Five (14%) of colonoscopic diagnoses (four indeterminate, one UC) were changed to CD by the finding of granulomatous inflammation in antral biopsies. Nonspecific antral gastritis was found in similar proportions of children and adolescents with Crohn's colitis and UC (92% vs 75%). Focal antral gastritis was more common in patients with Crohn's colitis than UC (52% vs 8%). CONCLUSIONS: Nonspecific antral gastritis is common in all forms of chronic colitis. Nevertheless, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy is useful in the differentiation of inflammatory bowel disease confined to the colon, particularly when colonoscopic findings are indeterminate.},

The aim of this study is to clarify the selenium status in Crohn's disease (CD) on enteral nutrition. METHODS: We measured serum selenium concentrations in 53 patients with CD and compared them with those in 21 healthy controls. Twenty-nine patients were under the treatment by enteral nutrition (EN group), and the remaining 24 patients were free from formulated enteral nutrition (non-EN group). RESULTS: While the serum selenium concentration in the non-EN group was not decreased when compared to controls, the value in the EN group was significantly lower than those in the non-EN group and in controls. Clinical manifestations of selenium deficiency were found in a patient on exclusive enteral nutrition. In the EN group, the serum selenium concentration showed an inverse correlation with the duration and the daily dose of enteral nutrition. In the non-EN group, the serum selenium concentrations were inversely correlated with the Crohn's disease activity index. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that patients with CD on enteral nutrition are at risk for selenium deficiency and that even patients without enteral nutrition may develop selenium deficiency at the active phase of the disease.},

CD patients who scored 200-400 points in Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) in spite of receiving CM, including enteral nutrition, for at least 2 weeks were enrolled in our double series trial. Each series had 5 weekly M-GCAP and 2 follow-up weeks, and each M-GCAP treated 1,800 ml of patient's peripheral blood. After the 1st series, patients who decreased more than 50 points on the CDAI were deemed responders and enrolled in the second series. Patients with a CDAI score less than 150 points were considered in remission. The patients' quality of life was evaluated using an index (IBDQ) before and after the 1st series. The CDAI was significantly decreased comparing before and after the 1st series (258.2 +/- 36.2 vs. 166.5 +/- 16.6; P < 0.02). 50% of patients (3/6) responded to the therapy, and one case (16.7%) could be induced to remission.

A statistically significant improvement of IBDQ was revealed in the responders' group (162.3 +/- 17.2 vs. 189.3 +/- 11.5; P < 0.03). M-GCAP could be an effective adjunctive therapy for active CD patients unresponsive to CM allowing them to maintain a high QOL. However, it might be difficult to improve patients who could not be induced to remission after the 1st series by applying another series.},

   abstract = {Infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor-alpha, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of refractory Crohn's disease in adult patients, but experience in pediatrics is limited. This retrospective study included 88 children and adolescents, 39 girls and 49 boys, with a median age of 14 years (range 3.3-17.9). Infliximab was indicated for active disease (66%) and/or fistulas (42%) that were refractory to corticosteroids (70%), and/or other immunosuppressive (82%) agents, and/or parenteral nutrition (20%). Patients received 1 to 17 infusions (median 4) of 5 mg/kg (range 3.8-7.3) of infliximab during a median time period of 4 months (1-17 months). Infusion reaction was noted in 13 patients (15%), with a total of 16 reactions in 450 infusions (4%). At Day 90 after the first infusion of infliximab, symptoms improved in 49% of patients, whereas 29% of patients were in remission and 13% of patients relapsed. From Day 0 to Day 90, Harvey-Bradshaw score decreased from 7.5 to 2.8 (P < 0.001), C-reactive protein from 36 to 16 mg/L (P < 0.01), and 1-hour erythrocyte sedimentation rate from 35 to 17 mm (P < 0.01). Dosage of corticosteroids decreased from to 0.59 to 0.17 mg/kg/d (P < 0.001); 53% of patients could be weaned of corticosteroids and 92% of parenteral nutrition. Treatment with infliximab is well tolerated and effective in most children and adolescents with Crohn's disease that is refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapy. Nevertheless, long-term efficacy remains to be shown, and further studies are urgently needed to precisely determine the best modality of continuing treatment.},

METHODS: Ninety-four patients (65 females; mean age, 31 years) with active perianal Crohn's disease were treated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for more than 6 (median, 27) months (median azathioprine dose, 2 mg/kg/day). The evolution of perianal lesions during azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy was analyzed retrospectively. Patients who had a clear anatomic improvement (fistula closure, fissure healing, stricture dilatation) and who did not develop any perianal complications requiring an antibiotic course or surgical intervention were considered responders regarding their perianal disease. RESULTS: Three years after inclusion, the cumulative probabilities of remaining free of perianal complication and achieving a clear anatomic improvement were 0.47 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.36-0.58) and 0.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.29-0.53), respectively. On the whole, 27 patients (29 percent) were responders to azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy. The absence of fistula, duration of perianal disease shorter than 22 months, and aged 40 years or older at inclusion were three independent factors associated with response to azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy. There was no correlation between the response of perianal lesions and the achievement of intestinal remission with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. CONCLUSION: One-third of patients with perianal lesions of Crohn's disease demonstrated a clear improvement during azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy. Patients aged 40 years or older with a recent perianal disease and without fistula were the best responders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Treatment options for patients with Crohn disease (CD) have expanded, but the use of some of these options in pediatric patients remains controversial. The authors evaluate current trends in treatment and areas of consensus or controversy. METHODS: An international survey of certified pediatric gastroenterologists was conducted using an e-mail questionnaire in an attempt to evaluate management of active Crohn disease, attitudes toward four types of therapy, and prevalence of testing for osteopenia and 6-thioguanine levels. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven physicians from the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Israel were included. The majority of North American physicians (71%) prefer to use conventional steroids and azathioprine (AZA) before nutritional therapy or budesonide for patients with mild to moderately active disease, versus 21% of Western Europeans (P < 0.001). Western Europeans prefer nutritional therapy followed by budesonide or steroids for those with mild or moderate disease. Only 4% of North American gastroenterologists use nutritional therapy frequently versus 62% of their Western European colleagues (P < 0.001). Infliximab was thought to be effective for steroid-unresponsive disease by almost all physicians surveyed, although its efficacy as a maintenance therapy was rated higher by North American physicians than by their Western European and Israeli colleagues (P < 0.01). Bone mineral density is routinely evaluated by about 45% of physicians in Western Europe and North America. CONCLUSIONS: Attitudes toward current therapies vary significantly by region, with North Americans strongly favoring corticosteroids followed by immunomodulatory therapy, and Western Europeans favoring nutritional therapy or budesonide and the avoidance of conventional corticosteroids.},

The use of oral budesonide has not been prospectively evaluated in children with Crohn disease. Therefore, the authors initiated a trial to compare remission and tolerance to budesonide and prednisone in children with mild or moderately active Crohn disease. METHODS: A prospective randomized open controlled 12-week trial was carried out comparing pH modified release budesonide, 9 mg, versus prednisone, 40 mg, in children with active mild to moderate pediatric Crohn disease. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (20 boys and 13 girls; mean age, 14.3 years) enrolled and completed the study. The groups treated with budesonide and prednisone did not differ by age, onset of disease, location of disease, or disease activity. The remission rate at 12 weeks was 47% in the budesonide treatment group and 50% in the prednisone treatment group. Side effects occurred in 32% and 71% of patients treated with budesonide and prednisone, respectively (P< 0.05). Severity of cosmetic side effects was significantly lower in patients treated with budesonide (P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Remission rates for Crohn disease with budesonide and prednisone treatment in this study were similar. Pediatric patients treated with budesonide had significantly fewer side effects than patients treated with prednisone. Budesonide should be considered an alternative to prednisone in pediatric patients with mild to moderate disease activity.},

Since the discovery of sulfasalazine's efficacy in ulcerative colitis and the subsequent development of sulfa-free mesalamine delivery systems, aminosalicylates have evolved to become an integral part of our therapeutic armamentarium and are now first-line therapies for the treatment of mildly to moderately active inflammatory bowel disease and for maintenance of remissions after successful induction therapy. Despite the substantial body of evidence supporting the use of aminosalicylates in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, gaps in our evidence base and controversies surrounding aminosalicylates clinical application have emerged. In this review, issues of dose response and optimization of the treatment regimen in ulcerative colitis, the discrimination between oral mesalamine formulations in left-sided colitis, and their efficacy in active and quiescent Crohn's disease are discussed.},

   abstract = {Dietary microparticles are non-biological, bacterial-sized particles. Endogenous sources are derived from intestinal Ca and phosphate secretion. Exogenous sources are mainly titanium dioxide (TiO2) and mixed silicates (Psil); they are resistant to degradation and accumulate in human Peyer's patch macrophages and there is some evidence that they exacerbate inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD). However, whether their intake differs between those with and without CD has not been studied. We aimed to identify dietary microparticle sources and intakes in subjects with and without CD. Patients with inactive CD and matched general practice-based controls (ninety-one per group) completed 7 d food diaries. Intake data for dietary fibre and sucrose were compared as positive controls. All foods, pharmaceuticals and toothpastes were examined for microparticle content, and intakes of Ca and exogenous microparticles were compared between the two groups. Dietary intakes were significantly different between cases and controls for dietary fibre (12 (SD 5) v. 14 (SD 5) g/d; P=0.001) and sucrose (52 (SD 27) v. 45 (SD 18) g/d; P=0.04) but not for Ca. Estimated median TiO2 and Psil intakes (2.5 and 35 mg/individual per d respectively, totalling 10(12)-10(13) microparticles/individual per d) were broadly similar to per capita estimates and while there was wide variation in intakes between individuals there was no significant difference between subjects with CD and controls. Hence, if exposure to microparticles is associated with the inflammation of CD, then the present study rules out excess intake as the problem. Nonetheless, microparticle-containing foods have now been identified which allows a low-microparticle diet to be further assessed in CD.},

The present study set out to assess whether patients with CD have dietary habits that lead to low Fe intakes and/or reduced bioavailable Fe compared with control subjects. Patients with asymptomatic CD were matched to controls (n 91/group). Dietary intakes of Fe and contributions from different food groups were compared using a 7 d food diary. Promoters and inhibitors of non-haem Fe absorption were investigated and a recently published algorithm was applied to assess bioavailable Fe. Fewer patients than controls met the reference nutrient intake for Fe (32% CD patients v. 42% controls). Overall, patients had significantly lower mean Fe intakes (by 2.3 mg/d) and Fe density (by 0.26 mg/MJ (1.1 mg/1000 kcal)) compared with controls (both P<0.001). Differences were mainly due to a preference among CD patients for low-fibre non-Fe fortified cereals, particularly breakfast cereals. In particular, control subjects had higher Fe intakes than matched CD subjects for men (P<0.001) and women less than 50 years (P=0.03). Intakes of both ascorbic acid (P<0.001) and phytic acid (P<0.01), but not animal tissue (P=1.0), were lower in patients with CD, but these had no overall effect on the predicted percentage of bioavailable Fe. Thus total bioavailable Fe was reduced in patients with CD due to lower intakes (P<0.01). Dietary Fe intakes are low in CD patients, which may contribute to an increased risk of ID and anaemia. Changing dietary advice may compromise perceived symptoms of the disease so the need for Fe supplementation should be carefully considered.},

The aim of this study was to analyze the value of these six "criticized" items to the discriminative properties of the PCDAI. METHODS: Data from 71 children with Crohn's disease visiting an outpatient clinic were analyzed. Physician global assessment of disease activity was used as the gold standard. A "basic index" was calculated by subtracting the score of the six criticized items from the score of the PCDAI calculated in the standard fashion. Multivariate logistic regression procedures identified which items significantly contributed to the "basic index". Receiver operating characteristic curves were produced comparing the standard PCDAI score to the "basic index" and a new "clinical index" which included only the criticized items truly contributing to the discriminatory ability of the "basic index". RESULTS: Logistic regression models identified only perirectal disease as contributing to the discriminative abilities of the basic index. The clinical index therefore consists of the three history items (abdominal pain, number of liquid stools, and general well-being), three physical examination items (weight loss, abdominal examination, and perirectal disease) and no laboratory tests. The clinical index had an area under the curve not significantly inferior to that of the original PCDAI (0.93 [95% confidence interval, 0.89-0.99] vs. 0.96 [95% confidence interval, 0.92-0.99]). CONCLUSIONS: A clinical index consisting of three history items and three physical examination items has an accuracy equal to the standard PCDAI in distinguishing children with disease in remission from those with a relapse.},

RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in remission rate at 6 wk (intent-to-treat analysis): E028E 11/16 (69%) and NuS 14/17 (82%) (p = 0.438). There was no difference in the decrease in PCDAI and CDAI between patients treated with E028E and those treated with NuS from 0 to 6 wk. Patients treated with NuS gained significantly more weight than patients treated with E028E (+2.5 kg; 95% CI 0.9, 4.1; p = 0.004), this difference remained when adjusting for maximum caloric intake per kilogram bodyweight (+2.9 kg; 95% CI 1.4, 4.5; p = 0.001). Concomitant disease, complications and side effects were seen in 5/33 patients (pyelonephritis, pneumonia, intraabdominal abscess, perianal abscess and borborygmi). CONCLUSION: E028E and NuS did not differ in terms of remission rate. Patients treated with NuS gained more weight than patients with E028E. Polymeric diet may be superior to elemental diet in the treatment of paediatric Crohn's disease where the primary aim is to increase the patient's weight.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recent experience with surgery for enterocutaneous fistulae (ECF) at a specialist colorectal unit is reviewed to define factors relating to a successful surgical outcome. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: ECF cause significant morbidity and mortality and need experienced surgical management. Previous publications have concentrated on mortality resulting from fistulae, while factors affecting recurrence have not previously been a focus of analysis. METHODS: Records were reviewed of patients who had ECF surgery (1994-2001). Management strategy involved early drainage of sepsis and nutritional support prior to elective ECF repair, with selective defunctioning proximal stoma formation. RESULTS: A total of 205 patients were available (89 males, 43%; median age, 51 years; range, 16-86) years). ECF were related to Crohn's disease in 95, ulcerative colitis in 18, diverticular disease in 17, carcinoma in 25 (16 after radiotherapy), mesh ventral hernia repair in 21, and other causes in 29. Forty-one (20%) had undergone attempted fistula repair at other institutions. Initial management included CT-guided drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess in 23 patients, and total parenteral nutrition in 74 (36%). A total of 203 patients had definitive ECF repair. Forty-four had oversewing or wedge resection of the fistula, and 159 had resection and reanastomosis of the involved small bowel segment or ileocolic anastomosis. Ninety-day operative mortality was 3.5%. A total of 42 (20.5%) patients developed ECF recurrence within 3 months. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that recurrence was more likely after oversewing (36%) than resection (16%, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: A strategy of drainage of acute sepsis, maintenance of nutritional support prior to surgery, and selective use of PS allows for primary closure in 80% of complicated ECF. Resection should be performed when feasible.},

The aim of this study was to explore the gastrointestinal tract in MMF-treated renal transplant recipients with persistent afebrile diarrhea to characterize its nature and etiology. METHODS: Renal transplant recipients with persistent afebrile diarrhea (daily fecal output >200 g) were prospectively investigated for infections, morphologic, and functional (gastrointestinal motility and intestinal absorptive capacity) integrity of the gastrointestinal tract; 26 patients met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: All but one patient had an erosive enterocolitis. Seventy percent of the patients had malabsorption of nutrients, contributing to the diarrhea. In +/-60%, an infectious origin was demonstrated and successfully treated with antimicrobial agents without changes in immunosuppressive regimen. In +/-40%, no infection occurred, but a Crohn's disease-like pattern of inflammation was noted. These patients also had a less pronounced bile-acid malabsorption but a significant faster colonic transit time, correlating with the trough level of mycophenolic acid (MPA). Cessation of MMF, however, was associated with allograft rejection in one third of these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent afebrile diarrhea in renal transplant recipients is characterized by erosive enterocolitis, which is of infectious origin in +/-60%. In +/-40%, a Crohn's disease-like (entero-)colitis was present. Because reduction or cessation of MMF was the only effective therapy, MPA or one of its metabolites may be suggested as a possible cause. However, reduction or cessation of MMF was associated with an increased risk for rejection.},

Eighteen CD patients were followed prospectively for 2 years at 8- to 12-week intervals. Disease activity was assessed using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Psychological distress was assessed using the following self-administered questionnaires: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and multiple Holmes Recent Life Changes (RLC) Questionnaires. The effects of psychological distress on current and subsequent CDAI (approximately 8-12 weeks later) were assessed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). The mean CDAI score during follow-up was 138 +/- 86, with a median of 121 (range, 0 to 394). BDI scores (possible range of 0 to 63) were independently associated with CDAI scores simultaneously (beta = 5.64, P = 0.004) and 8-12 weeks later (beta = 6.08, P = 0.004). Higher levels of anxiety, hopelessness, and recent life changes were also suggestive of higher CDAI scores, however, their effects were generally of lesser magnitude and not independent of the influence of depressive symptoms. Levels of depressive symptoms are positively associated with future changes in CDAI. Routine psychological assessment may help to identify patients at higher risk for exacerbation.},

The use of complementary and alternative therapies appears to be common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but few studies have been completed in children. We sought to examine the extent that children with inflammatory bowel disease in the Greater Philadelphia area (Philadelphia County and the surrounding counties in Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) use alternative therapies. We paid particular attention to the specific types of therapies used and whether certain demographic and disease associated factors influence the degree of usage. In this study, we questioned the families of all children diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, aged 6 to 16 years and living within Philadelphia and its surrounding counties, who were followed at 1 of the 2 academic pediatric gastroenterology programs that served the area. More than 80% of surveys were returned. Fifty-one percent (95% C.I. 45% to 56%) of patients surveyed reported some form of alternative medicine use within the previous year. Univariate analysis revealed increased use among patients who had Crohn disease, who used the Internet for research on their disease, who reported poor quality of life and had increased school absences in the past year. Therapies associated with alternative medicine use included biological and immunomodulatory therapy. Regression analysis revealed positive associations between use of alternative therapies and expenditure on nonprescription treatments, poor quality of life, Internet research, and the need for calorie supplementation, whereas there was a negative association with history of prior surgery for inflammatory bowel disease.},

Pulmonary function tests showed severe ventilatory defects, arterial hypoxemia, and decreased oxygen saturations. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDAX) of the patient's lung biopsy and expectorant demonstrated similar patterns, supporting crystal migration into the alveoli. Treatment included broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticoagulation, corticosteroids, and daily pulmonary toilet. The patient required continuous supplemental oxygen for two months and then was able to use it intermittently. This patient survived widespread pulmonary vascular occlusions secondary to precipitation and crystallization of TPN solution, with moderately severe residual deficits in exercise tolerance and chest x-ray abnormalities. This case underscores the importance of surveillance and recognition and of TPN-associated complications by health care workers.},

The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of human antichimeric antibody (HACA), relationship to infusion reactions (IR), and the role of concomitant immunomodulatory therapies. METHODS: An inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) database was queried, and a retrospective review of patients who had HACA performed was undertaken. RESULTS: HACA was conclusively determined in 34 patients with IBD (14 male, Crohn disease/ulcerative colitis: 30/4), median age 14.8 years (range, 6.4-22.5 years). Twenty-nine (85.3%) patients were receiving immunomodulatory therapy. A total of 234 infliximab infusions were administered (mean, 6.9; range, 1-26). HACA was detected in 12 (35.3%) patients. IR occurred in 8 (23.5%) patients. HACA-positive patients had a higher proportion of infusions associated with IR than did HACA-negative patients (P < 0.01). HACA levels > or =8.0 microg/mL were more likely to be associated with IR (P = 0.03). Levels of > or = 8.0 microg/mL were more common in patients who had an average interval between infliximab infusions of 8 weeks or less (P = 0.04). Concomitant immunomodulatory therapy was associated with a lower risk of developing HACA (P = 0.02) and lower titer of HACA (P = 0.04). Patients did not have HACA at a greater rate when there was an extended interval (more than 12 weeks) between infliximab infusions (P = 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: In children and adolescents with IBD, HACA formation is related to IR and to the duration of response to treatment. Immunomodulatory agents seem to have a protective role against development of HACA or high titers of antibodies. The interval between infusions does not influence the development of HACA.},

   abstract = {During the past few years, small bowel transplantation (SBT) has become a realistic alternative for patients with irreversible intestinal failure who have or will develop severe complications from total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Transplantation can be associated with large fluid shifts and massive blood loss necessitating rapid infusions of large quantities of crystalloid and/or blood products. Invasive monitoring and large-bore venous access are necessary in order to manage these patients intraoperatively. Because patients with irreversible intestinal failure are often managed with total parenteral nutrition via a central venous catheter, thrombotic intraluminal obstruction of major vessels may develop over time. Additionally, this may lead to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome as well as challenging problems with vascular access. We present a 34-year-old woman with a past medical history for long-standing Crohn's disease with multiple small bowel resections and short gut syndrome who presented for an SBT. The patient had a long history of TPN use, complicated by SVC syndrome and inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction. She was presently asymptomatic from her SVC obstruction. Central venous access was obtained by an interventional radiologist. A 7-French double-lumen Hickman minicatheter was placed in the left femoral vein with the tip of the catheter positioned just distal to the IVC narrowing. A left radial 20-gauge arterial line was placed for hemodynamic monitoring and frequent blood sampling. The patient's left and right dorsal-saphenous veins were cannulated with 16-guage catheters and adequate flow was observed. Lower extremity pressure was measured via the Hickman catheter in the left femoral vein. A multiplane transesophageal echo was used to assess ventricular volume. The options and intraoperative management of such patients are discussed.},

Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a risk factor for vascular disease and has been implicated as a mediator of thromboembolic events in adults with IBD. The authors studied the link between tHcy and IBD in children, in whom associations may be clearer, and investigated associations with plasma von Willebrand factor antigen, a marker of vascular damage. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 43 patients with IBD (27 Crohn disease, 9 ulcerative colitis, and 7 indeterminate colitis) and 46 control subjects from a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Plasma tHcy, plasma 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate, red cell folate, plasma vitamin B12, plasma von Willebrand factor antigen, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype (for the C677T mutation) were measured. RESULTS: Plasma tHcy concentrations were higher in children with IBD than in control subjects, when corrected for age (P < 0.05), and plasma tHcy was negatively correlated with plasma 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate (P < 0.0005). Plasma 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate and age were the main predictors of plasma tHcy. Neither MTHFR genotype nor von Willebrand factor showed any association with any other measure, and there were no differences between children with IBD and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma tHcy is a consequence of IBD in children, probably mediated by poor folate status associated with diet or the pathophysiology of the disease.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease result from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Only one gene, NOD2/CARD15, has been clearly identified; a minority of people with alteration of this gene develop Crohn's disease. The NOD2/CARD15 protein is thought to be involved in defence against intracellular bacteria. This supports the idea that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis result from altered immunological responses to the normal intestinal flora. Life expectancy is normal in ulcerative colitis and nearly so in Crohn's disease, but both conditions cause considerable morbidity. Approximately 80% of patients with Crohn's disease eventually require surgery, and about 25% of patients with ulcerative colitis require colectomy. Treatment of ulcerative colitis is generally by corticosteroids for acute disease and mesalazine for maintenance, but the range of therapies for Crohn's disease is expanding. Alternative therapies include immunosuppressives, enteral nutrition, antibiotics, anti-TNF antibody (infliximab), corticosteroids, and surgery. High dosages of corticosteroids may provide symptomatic relief in Crohn's disease but do not affect the long term natural history of the disease, and management strategies should avoid using steroids whenever possible.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the most frequent inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with a prevalence of approximately one out of 500. Cytokine research opened new and potent treatment options and thus stimulated clinical and basic research.However, the IBD still remain a challenge for patients and physicians,demanding close cooperation between gastroenterologists,radiologists and surgeons. The basic understanding of IBD,which is necessary for efficient diagnostic and therapeutic concepts is reviewed. METHODS: Based upon recent publications and our clinical experience we discuss aspects of etiology,pathogenesis,diagnostics,and therapy of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. RESULTS: A genetically influenced, exaggerated and sustained immune response against the own gut flora seems to be one of the most important factors in the pathogenesis of IBD. Not less important are environmental influences. For instance, cigarette smoking had been judged to have some negative influence on the natural course of Crohn's disease.Now,however, recent studies show that smoking is even a significant independent risk factor in the pathogenesis of IBD. Since IBD and especially Crohn's disease can effect the whole body, detailed analysis of inflammatory organ involvement is necessary before therapy. For instance, the MRI enteroclysis technique adds a necessary diagnostic tool for the exploration of those parts of the small bowel that cannot been reached by routine endoscopy like the upper ileum and the lower jejunum. In terms of therapy, a change of paradigms can be observed: patients will no longer be treated only when symptoms arise, but will early be integrated into a therapeutic concept, which is determined by site and extent of the disease and adapted to the abilities and needs of the patient.Furthermore,immunosuppressive agents like azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine will establish as central concept in the medical treatment of IBD. DISCUSSION: IBD-therapy should rather be adapted to the patient's individual inflammatory pattern than be oriented to schematic treatment rules. New endoscopic and radiologic techniques provide the necessary diagnostic tools.},

The correction and maintenance of nutritional status, achieved by careful nutritional monitoring and intervention, should be an integral part of the multidisciplinary management of IBD throughout all stages of the disease. In acute Crohn's disease, enteral nutrition (polymeric and elemental) is an effective and safe primary therapy for many patients. Enteral diets should be considered as primary therapy in pediatric Crohn's disease patients, especially in children with poor nutritional status or growth impairment and in patients with severe drug-induced side effects. Total parenteral nutrition does not have a primary therapeutic role in IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dietary, environmental and genetic events may influence host susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF-beta 2), a multifunctional polypeptide (cytokine) present in human and bovine milk, plays a critical role in the development of tolerance, the prevention of autoimmunity, and in anti-inflammatory responses. TGF-beta 2 is a potent inhibitor of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) growth and stimulates IEC differentiation. The objective of this study was to determine whether a diet containing TGF-beta 2 modulates intestinal injury and immune responses in an Interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10-/-) mouse model of IBD. METHODS: Five-week-old IL-10-/- mice (in BALB/c background) reared in our transgenic facility were fed either an enteral diet (Diet-A) containing TGF-beta 2 or a control enteral diet (Diet-B) not rich in TGF-beta 2. Mice were weighed weekly, monitored for illness and euthanized after eight weeks on the diet. RESULTS: Final weights were 28 +/- 1.2 g (58.2% gain) for Diet-A mice and 23 +/- 1.6 g (32.9% gain) for Diet-B mice (p = 0.0194). The hematocrits were 48.3% for Diet-A compared to 42% for Diet-B mice (p = 0.0021). Mice on Diet-A had significantly lower serum TNF-alpha concentrations. Forty-four percent of mice on Diet-B developed severe diarrhea and rectal prolapse compared with none on Diet-A. Evaluation of intestinal pathology (score 0-4) revealed that animals fed Diet-A had a score of 2.1 +/- 0.4 compared to 3.2 +/- 0.36 in the Diet-B group (p = 0.040). The acute phase protein, serum amyloid A (SAA), was 3.8 times higher in the Diet-B group (p = 0.0038). CONCLUSIONS: IL-10-/- mice fed a TGF-beta 2 containing diet gained more weight, did not develop diarrhea or prolapse, had lower pathological scores, and lower SAAs. These data further support the use of TGF-beta 2 containing enteral diets as one mode of therapy for Crohn's disease.},

The exact etiology of IPT remains unclear. Although the association of IPT with systemic inflammatory disorders has been established, a specific link with Crohn's disease is rare. We report two cases of IPT associated with Crohn's disease. Both patients were elderly males who presented with abdominal pain and jaundice. At the time of presentation, both had active Crohn's disease that was undiagnosed. Computed tomography demonstrated a liver mass, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed biliary strictures in both patients. Given their symptomatic jaundice and concern for cholangiocarcinoma, they underwent abdominal surgical exploration and pathology results revealed IPT. They were subsequently diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Following treatment of Crohn's disease, there was significant improvement in their overall clinical status. An underlying diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease should be considered in patients with IPT.},

Ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease are chronic with remissions and recidives. Crohns disease involves any part of digestive tube. Histological changes in ulcerative colitis are: inflammation of mucosa and submucosal tissue, crypt abscesses and ulcerations, pseudopolpys, bowel shortening and toxic megacolon in severe inflammation. In Crohns disease, transmural inflammation, "jumping lesions", deeper ulcerations, coble-stone mucosa, progressive fibrosis, granuloma with gigantic epithelial cells. TREATMENT: ulcerative colitis: mesalazine, rectal 5-ASA and hydrocortisone enemas, surgery. Crohns disease: mesalazine and prednisolone. For terminal ilcitis, corticosteroid budesonid could be applied. Severe symptomatic disease: hospitalization, parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, prednisone, surgery in partial bowel obstruction, fistulas, abscessus, perforation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of Crohn's disease has been increasing in Western communities, but there are no published studies which have examined this change in children in Australia. The centralization of pediatric gastroenterology services in Victoria provides an opportunity to examine these changes within one state. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective study over a 31-year period of all children aged 16 years or less initially diagnosed with Crohn's disease at either the Royal Children's Hospital, or Monash Medical Center, Melbourne, Victoria. RESULTS: We identified 351 patients who met the diagnostic criteria between 1971 and 2001. The incidence of Crohn's disease in children aged 16 years or less rose from 0.128 to 2.0 per 100,000 per year over the three decades (r = 0.964, P < 0.01). There was a disproportionate over-representation of children from an urban background (incidence rate ratio 1.66, 95% CI 1.28-2.16). Children currently being diagnosed had on average a lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and higher albumin than in previous decades. The use of flexible endoscopy has increased markedly (1970s: 60%; 1990s: 96%, P < 0.05) and the proportion of children recognized at diagnosis with upper gastrointestinal and colonic involvement has increased significantly. CONCLUSION: There has been a significant increase in the incidence of Crohn's disease in Victorian children. The pattern of disease has also changed with colonic disease now more frequent, and inflammatory indices less abnormal. The increased use of endoscopy has established the frequent involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract.},

Our aim was to identify potential candidates for ITx according to these national guidelines among patients managed by a medical referral center for CIF. Records of patients who received HPN were reviewed. CIF was considered reversible or irreversible (energy by HPN <50% or >50% basal energy expenditure). Patients with irreversible CIF were considered eligible for ITx in the absence of a contraindication, as are used for solid organs Tx. From 1986 to 2003 among 64 patients who met the entry criteria 23 showed reversible and 41 irreversible, CIF. Twenty-one patients with irreversible CIF had an indication for ITx, but eight had also contraindications; thus 13 were eligible, including intestinal pseudo-obstruction (n = 6), mesenteric ischemia (n = 3), Crohn's (n = 2), radiation enteritis (n = 1), and desmoid (n = 1). Indications for ITx included HPN liver failure (n = 2), lack of venous access (n = 2), CIF with high risk of mortality (n = 3), very poor QoL (n = 6 including 5 with pseudo-obstruction). According to the Italian guidelines for ITx, 31% of patients with irreversible CIF managed by a medical referral center were eligible for ITx. Primary disease-related poor QoL was the indication in half of them. Studies on the QoL after ITx are required to allow patients to make an educated decision.},

Middle age was 5 +/- 4 years for patients < 14 years old, and 48 +/- 15 years for those > or = 14 years old. The more prevalent diagnosis were: ischemic bowel (28.4%), neoplasm (16.4%), radiation enteritis (13.4%), motility disorders (7.5%), Crohn's disease (2.9%), and other. The mean time on HPN was 7.5 +/- 4.4 months. Tunelized catheter was the preferential route (77.6%), followed by the implantated one (20.9%). The intermittent method (nocturnal) was preferential (91.0%). Patients receive the formula from hospital pharmacy more frequently than from Nutriservice (71.5% versus 19.4%). The complications related to nutrition (0.32/100 days of HPN) included the infections (0.12 catheter sepsis/100 d of HPN), metabolic (0.06/100 d of HPN), mechanic (0.03/100 d of HPN) and electrolitic disorders (0.03/100 d of HPN).

The question has been raised whether IC can be assigned to a diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis through the characterization of immunogenetic similarities, or whether IC may represent a distinct subgroup within these heterogeneous disorders. In this article, the use of serologic markers, genetics, and immune responses to understand the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and define clinically important subgroups of patients will be discussed. Then, how these scientific advances have been applied to the entity of IC will be reviewed. Importantly, a recent prospective study suggests that the absence of IBD-associated serologic markers defines the majority of IC as a separate entity within the spectrum of IBD. The development of serologic, genetic, and immune response markers will allow for rational description of clinically important subgroups, redefine natural history, and predict responses to therapy in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) typically is associated with a confluent proctitis, whereas rectal sparing may be seen in large bowel Crohn disease (CD). A few studies have reported rectal sparing in UC and suggested that this might indicate a more severe form of the disease. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and prognostic significance of rectal sparing in children with newly diagnosed, untreated UC. METHODS: The records of all children with untreated UC presenting to a regional pediatric gastroenterology service between January 1996 and December 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups according to the endoscopic appearance of the rectum: Group 1 (proctitis) and Group 2 (rectal sparing). Clinical features, intractability index (duration of active disease as a proportion of length of follow-up), response to treatment, relapse index (number of recurrences per year), and the need for surgery were compared. RESULTS: Thirty children with untreated UC were identified. Seven (23%) had rectal sparing at initial endoscopy, but disease distribution was otherwise similar in both groups. Presenting symptoms were similar in those with and without rectal sparing. In Group 1, 20 (87%) children achieved remission with initial medical treatment, compared with 3 (43%) in Group 2 (P < 0.05). The intractability index was higher in children with rectal sparing, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.22). During a median follow-up period of 2 years, one (4%) child in Group 1 and two (29%) children in Group 2 experienced primary sclerosing cholangitis, and two (29%) children with rectal sparing required colectomy, compared with none in Group 1. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic rectal sparing was seen in 23% of children with newly diagnosed, untreated UC, but this feature did not correlate with presenting symptoms. However, the presence of rectal sparing may indicate more aggressive disease that is less responsive to medical treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of esophageal Crohn disease (ECD) in adults ranges from 0.2% to 11.2% and in children is up to 43%. The aim of the study was to determine the clinical and endoscopic spectrum of ECD and its prevalence in our patient population. METHODS: Chart review of children with Crohn disease (CD). Esophageal Crohn disease was defined by accepted endoscopic and/or histologic findings. RESULTS: 210 children with CD were identified; 27 of those children had ECD. Nine children presented with specific upper GI symptoms; dysphagia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and odynophagia. Esophagoscopy in children with upper gastrointestinal symptoms revealed deep ulcers (n = 2), aphthous ulcers (n = l), erosions (n = l), edematous nodules, (n = l) and normal mucosa (n = 4). In asymptomatic children aphthous ulcers (n = 5), erosions (n = 3), deep ulcers (n = 3), and normal looking mucosa (n = 7) were seen. Twenty children also had gastric lesions, 3 children had duodenal lesions, and 3 children had both duodenal and gastric involvement. All 27 children had evidence of ileo-colonic or colonic disease. Acid suppressive medications were given only to children with upper GI symptoms and endoscopic esophageal lesions. The mean duration of follow-up from diagnosis of CD was 3.02 years (range 2 months-11.7 years). At last follow-up review, 7 children were receiving acid suppression and no children were receiving steroids. There were no complications related to ECD. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of endoscopic ECD is 7.6% but as many as 17.6% of our patient population had histologic evidence of ECD. The clinical and endoscopic spectrum of ECD are highly variable and poorly correlate with each other.},

   abstract = {Changes in diet greatly affect the mucosal immune system, particularly in diseases such as Crohn's disease and necrotizing enterocolitis. This review examines the hypothesis that alterations in the luminal environment of the intestine regulate the expression of genes in the epithelium responsible for signaling to immune cells. Increasing chemokine expression in the mouse intestinal epithelium using transgenic techniques enhances the recruitment of neutrophils and lymphocytes into the intestine. Furthermore, SCFA concentrations in the intestinal lumen vary markedly with diet. SCFAs alter chemokine expression by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity in the enterocyte. The review therefore describes a molecular pathway explaining how changes in diet may alter leukocyte recruitment by regulating enterocyte gene expression. It is likely that other similar pathways remain to be discovered.},

AIMS: To prospectively document the presenting features, delay in presentation, disease localisation, and growth in newly diagnosed cases of IBD. METHODS: For 13 months, between June 1998 and June 1999, 3247 paediatricians, adult gastroenterologists, and surgeons across the UK and Ireland were prospectively surveyed each month and asked to report every newly diagnosed case of childhood IBD. RESULTS: A total of 739 new IBD cases aged less than 16 years were identified. Only one quarter of Crohn's disease (CD) cases presented with the "classic triad" of diarrhoea, weight loss, and abdominal pain; nearly half did not report diarrhoea. The median delay from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 5 months (mean 11 months), with one fifth having symptoms of more than one year. Delays were most common in CD and in younger children. Short stature was noted only in those with CD and not with ulcerative colitis. One fifth of CD cases had disease activity in the jejunum and this group had significantly reduced stature. Ileo-colonic involvement was documented in most CD cases, with only a small minority having isolated ileal or isolated colonic disease. Pan-colitis was reported in most UC cases, with very few having only an isolated proctitis. CONCLUSIONS: Many children are diagnosed after prolonged delays and have growth failure. Improved knowledge of the presenting features of IBD, and earlier investigation of suspected cases, may help reduce the delays noted.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by inflammatory hyperperfusion of the intestinal wall in affected bowel segments. We applied a novel method to quantify color Doppler signals dynamically along a complete heart cycle inside the bowel wall. The aim was to describe bowel wall perfusion in Crohn disease patients in comparison with healthy probands and to compare a conventional activity index (Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index) with perfusion measurements as an indicator of inflammatory activity. METHOD: Color Doppler sonographic videos of bowel wall perfusion from 34 healthy children (aged 5 to 18 years) and from 14 patients with Crohn disease (aged 8.2 to 15.9 years) were recorded under defined conditions. Perfusion signals (color hue, color area) were automatically measured inside the bowel wall. Specific tissue perfusion was calculated as mean flow velocity of a region of interest during one full heart cycle. Bowel wall perfusion was compared using the Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index in 12 patients. RESULTS: Specific bowel wall perfusion was significantly elevated in bowel segments of Crohn disease patients compared with healthy subjects (P < 0.001). Specific flow in small bowel was 0.025 cm/s in healthy probands and 0.095 cm/s in patients with Crohn disease, whereas large bowel wall perfusion of 0.012 cm/s in healthy probands clearly differed from 0.082 cm/s in patients with Crohn disease. No differences of perfusion between moderate and high Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index levels could be demonstrated despite a weak significant overall correlation. CONCLUSION: The new method of dynamic, automatic noninvasive perfusion quantification is useful to describe local inflammatory activity in bowel segments affected by Crohn disease and adds new information to activity evaluation by Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index. Specific wall perfusion in intestines of Crohn patients is significantly elevated and reaches up to sevenfold intensity compared with healthy subjects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The quantity and quality of mucins are affected in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) both because of a reduction in the number of goblet cells and a decrease in the number of sugar residues per oligosaccharide side chain. Alteration in the types of mucins and aberrant location may contribute to the underlying pathology by affecting the mucus barrier function or may instead be a response to inflammation. The authors used the periodic acid-Schiff/Alcian blue stain to distinguish neutral and acidic mucins, and used specific antibodies to the mature goblet cell mucin MUC2, MUC2 core antigen, foveolar cell mucin MUC5AC, and gastric trefoil factor (TFF1), to characterize their presence and distribution in colonic tissue sections from patients with IBD. RESULTS: Both core and mature MUC2 were expressed in all colonic goblet cells from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease and from healthy controls. MUC5AC and TFF1, which are not normally expressed by colonic tissue, also were expressed in scattered goblet cells, coexpressing with MUC2. In areas of goblet cell depletion, MUC2 was present in cytoplasmic granules of flattened, cuboidal, nongoblet-cell-like surface cells. The staining was more intense and homogenous with the MUC2 core antibody, suggesting expression of relatively immature mucin. Some of these cells also coexpressed MUC5AC but to a lesser extent. These findings are not unique to IBD but were also found in other types of intestinal inflammation. CONCLUSION: The study confirms earlier observations that MUC2 is the major colonic mucin in IBD. It appears in two forms: mature MUC2 in goblet cells and immature MUC2 especially in secretory granules of cells that are not phenotypically goblet cells. MUC5AC and TFF1 expression in goblet cells is common in IBD and other inflammatory conditions of the colon. These changes may represent a nonspecific repair function of the colon cells to compensate for damage to barrier function.},

Accurate pre-operative determination of bowel length may be useful in conditions where further resection of small bowel is contemplated. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of small bowel length measured by barium follow-through (BaFT) examination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients underwent both intra-operative measurement of small bowel length, and BaFT examination where length was measured using an opisometer. RESULTS: The difference between operative and radiological measurement (mean +/- standard deviation: 15.7 +/- 16 9%) was least in those with the shorter small intestine (overall variation: r = 0.703, P < 0.01, regression coefficient: -0.118, intercept: 15.1). There was no difference in whether BaFT was performed pre or postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Assessment of small bowel length by BaFT radiography is accurate, particularly in those with shorter small bowel lengths.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) is a validated measure of disease activity comprised of historical, laboratory and physical examination parameters. It has been suggested that an abbreviated PCDAI may be of similar utility without requiring laboratory evaluations or calculated height velocity. The aim of this study was to compare an abbreviated PCDAI and the original PCDAI and also compare the abbreviated PCDAI and a quality-of-life measurement. METHODS: The authors prospectively analyzed quality of life and disease activity, using the IMPACT-35 Questionnaire, the PCDAI and an abbreviated PCDAI consisting of three historical items (abdominal pain, stools and patient functioning) and three physical examination items (weight, abdomen and perirectal disease). RESULTS: Forty subjects aged 5-24 years (22 males) were included in analysis. Correlations were performed between the original PCDAI, an abbreviated PCDAI and the IMPACT-35. There was a significant, strong correlation between the PCDAI and the abbreviated PCDAI (n = 40, r = 0.849, p <0.001), a significant, moderate correlation between PCDAI and IMPACT-35 (n = 29, r = -0.547, p = 0.002) and a significant, moderate correlation between the abbreviated PCDAI and IMPACT-35 (n = 29, r = -0.579, p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An abbreviated PCDAI predicted disease activity as well as the full PCDAI. The IMPACT-35 correlated well with disease activity based on both PCDAI and an abbreviated PCDAI. An abbreviated PCDAI may offer advantages over the original PCDAI and should be prospectively validated in future studies.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a condition of chronic inflammation potentially involving any location of the alimentary tract from mouth to anus but with a propensity for the distal small bowel and proximal large bowel. Frequent complications include stricture and fistula. Numerous extra-intestinal manifestations may also be present. The aetiology of Crohn's disease is incompletely understood, and therapy, although generally effective in alleviating the symptoms, is not curative. Due to the heterogeneity of the disease a major need for the therapeutic approach is the ability to define subgroups with distinct characteristics. However, with regard to the heterogeneity of demographic, anatomic and disease behaviour characteristics, distillation of the numerous possible phenotypes in simple categories is a formidable task. In the present review the focus will be on clinically relevant situations providing therapeutic algorithms according to international guidelines.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of low serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25-OHD) levels and the associated alterations in bone mineral density in a cohort of adults with Crohn's disease. METHODS: 25-OHD levels were determined in 242 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease seen in two tertiary inflammatory bowel disease referral centres. Bone mineral density was assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Nineteen (8%) patients exhibited vitamin D deficiency (25-OHD less than 25 nmol/L) and 52 (22%) patients exhibited vitamin D insufficiency (25-OHD less than 40 nmol/L). Mean T-scores at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip and ultradistal radius in the group with low 25-OHD did not differ from those of the normal 25-OHD group. Serum alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone levels were higher in the low 25-OHD group than in the normal group. Decreased red blood cell (RBC) folate predicted low 25-OHD in male patients, while smoking, RBC folate and serum iron predicted low 25-OHD in female patients. The rate of low 25-OHD deficiency in the winter was significantly higher than that in the summer (11.9% versus 2.8%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D-deficient Crohn's disease patients exhibit biochemical evidence of metabolic bone disease, without detectable differences in bone mineral density. Sunlight exposure, nutrition and smoking status were predictors of vitamin D deficiency in this patient cohort.},

   abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammation, including Crohn's disease (CD). We investigated the distribution and state of maturation of DCs in the colon in relation to the severity of inflammation and therapy. Using archival specimens from colonic resections in 19 pediatric patients with CD and 14 controls, we identified and characterized the DCs within the lamina propria, submucosa, and muscularis compartments using morphologic and quantitative immunohistochemical methods. The distribution of CD11c+CD83+CD68+DC-SIGN+ and immature CD11c+CD83-CD68-DC-SIGN+ DCs within the different compartments varied according to the presence or absence of CD as well as to the severity of inflammation and systemic corticoid treatment. Immature DCs were only found in non-inflamed control colonic tissue. Marked reductions (60% and 30%) in total CD11c and CD83 DC numbers were observed in CD tissue samples compared with controls (P < 0.05). CD samples from patients on corticosteroid therapy were significantly more depleted than in tissue from untreated patients or those on other drugs. Colonic tissue with severe inflammation had reduced numbers of CD11c+ and CD83+ DCs in the lamina propria and submucosal compartments (80% and 76% for CD11c; 75% and 76% for CD83, respectively, P < 0.05), with a concomitant increase (525% for CD11c and 700% for CD83 P < 0.05) of DCs in the muscularis compartment, compared to moderately inflamed and non-inflamed CD tissue. Our data suggest that an imbalance in intestinal DC subpopulations may play a role in the initiation and/or the maintenance of chronic inflammation in CD. Corticosteroid therapy is associated with colonic DC depletion.},

   abstract = {The mucosal immune system is overactivated in Crohn disease (CD) and viral infections have been associated with clinical exacerbations. To investigate the potential association between mucosal inflammation and the cytokines involved in the early response to viruses, we analyzed colonic tissue levels of IL-2Ralpha, interferon-alpha, and IL-15 in CD. Patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy were classified into controls (n = 22) and three CD groups based on the histologic severity of inflammation and clinical activity: a) severely active CD (n = 3); b) mild to moderately active CD (n = 14); and c) quiescent CD (n = 23). Rectal biopsies (two per patient) were homogenized and cytokine levels determined by ELISA kits. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA with Tukey and Scheffe tests. IL-2Ralpha levels were increased in the active CD group compared with the quiescent CD group: a) 405 +/- 87, b) 159 +/- 31, and c) 33 +/- 15 pg/mg DNA (p < 0.001). The latter group was similar to controls (39 +/- 20 pg/mg DNA). Furthermore, a linear correlation (r = 0.98) between IL-2Ralpha and disease activity (Van Hees index) was observed. IL-15 levels were also higher in active compared with quiescent CD and controls: a) 0.69 +/- 0.23 and b) 0.72 +/- 0.31 versus c) 0.28 +/- 0.21 and 0.28 +/- 0.14 pg/mg DNA for controls (p < 0.05). Interferon-alpha levels were undetectable in all samples. Our data suggest that IL-2Ralpha tissue levels correlate with CD activity. IL-15 is also overproduced in inflamed CD tissue. The lack of a parallel elevation of interferon-alpha does not support a role for viral induction of IL-15 in inflamed CD samples.},

METHODS: The RING (Ricerca Informatizzata in Gastroenterologia) project is an observational study collecting hospital discharge forms from 56 centres. Factors associated with the length of hospital stay were studied using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In 24 months starting from August 2000, out of 29,376 hospital discharge forms, 2131 (7.3%) were collected for inflammatory bowel disease (1163 for Crohn's disease and 968 for ulcerative colitis). The Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis groups were compared according to demographic characteristics, diagnoses, procedures and hospital stay. In Crohn's disease, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, x-rays/barium enema, number of procedures and number of diagnoses were significantly associated with a hospital stay longer than 10 days. In ulcerative colitis, this association was found for parenteral nutrition, malnutrition, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging and number of procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease was confirmed as a disabling disorder requiring more frequent hospital treatment than ulcerative colitis. For the latter, parenteral nutrition and malnutrition were related to a longer hospital stay. The number of procedures, especially abdominal computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, was a major item for both pathologies.},

Experience using infliximab at a large pediatric center is reviewed. METHODS: A retrospective review of all infliximab infusions administered to patients with Crohn's disease (CD) was undertaken. Data were obtained from database and pharmacy records. Chart review and interviews with physicians, patients, and families were used to obtain missing data. RESULTS: A total of 432 infusions were administered to 82 patients (34 female and 48 male) with CD. The number of infusions each patient received ranged from one to 18, with a mean of 5.3 (SD 4.6) and median of 3. Of 33 patients, 19 (57.6%) became independent and remained free of corticosteroids. There was a statistically significant difference in the steroid dose between 0 and 4 wk and 0 and 8 wk. In all, 23 infusion reactions occurred (5.3%). Three patients developed herpes zoster, and one developed Listeria monocytogenes meningitis. No patients were documented to have delayed hypersensitivity reactions or malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is safe and effective for treating pediatric patients with CD. A steroid-sparing effect was demonstrated. The most common adverse reaction to infliximab was infusion reaction. These reactions did not preclude further use of the agent. Serious infections were seen in a small number of patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder that is caused by environmental and genetic factors. Mutations in the CARD15 gene have been recently identified to be associated with the disease. Until now no genetic study has focused directly on a pediatric population. METHODS: The authors sequenced all 12 exons of the CARD15 gene in 55 pediatric patients with Crohn disease from Saxony. Their average age at onset was 11.2 years (1-17.5 years). The authors also evaluated the genotype-phenotype relationship in the patients. RESULTS: Fourteen different polymorphic and/or disease-related nucleotide alterations have been identified in the patients. Sixty-five percent of their genomic DNA samples harbored at least one of six mutations within the CARD15 gene, which previously has been identified as being associated with Crohn disease. The authors found that the cytosine insertion mutation 3020insC was significantly more common in their pediatric population than in patients with Crohn disease (26% versus 11% of the alleles) whose results were reported in the literature. The genotype-phenotype analysis showed that the authors' patients with at least one of the six CARD15 disease-associated mutations had a high risk of inflammation located in the terminal ileum and ascending colon. In 10 of 19 patients with two mutations, intestinal resection surgery was necessary because of stricturing. CONCLUSIONS: In the authors' pediatric patients, the genetic influence on Crohn disease was more pronounced than that reported in any other study, and it strongly affected the clinical phenotype.},

   abstract = {Cutaneous manifestations are well-recognized complications of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The incidence of these manifestations varies widely but, at the time of diagnosis, the mean incidence is around 10%. During the course of the disease, a great variety of skin lesions may develop, many of which are secondary to granulomatous cutaneous disease, reactive skin eruptions, nutritional deficiency and other associated conditions. The disorders that are directly related to the inflammatory process of Crohn's disease include perianal and peristomal ulcers and fistulae, metastatic Crohn's disease and oral granulomatous lesions. Histologically, the features are similar to those found in the inflamed bowel. These lesions usually respond to treatment of the underlying intestinal disease. The most common forms of reactive skin eruption are erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum. Certain subsets of patients are more susceptible to the development of erythema nodosum; in a previous report from our group, erythema nodosum was seen mainly in females, and in patients with colonic involvement and/or arthritis. This manifestation tends to occur during the first 2 years of the clinical course of the disease and may recur in approximately one-half of cases. Infliximab is highly effective in healing refractory lesions of erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum. Manifestations that are secondary to nutritional deficiency or associated conditions include acrodermatitis enteropathica, psoriasis and autoimmune disorders. For most of the cutaneous manifestations, the primary therapeutic target remains the bowel. Early aggressive therapy can minimize severe complications and maintenance treatment may prevent some devastating consequences.},

We reviewed the records of 170 adult patients with SBS evaluated over a 20-year period. Thirty (18%) had Crohn's disease. SBS was defined as an intestinal remnant less than 180 cm with associated malabsorption. There were 20 women and 10 men ranging in age from 18 to 62 years. Eighteen (60%) presented initially with ileocolonic disease, seven (23%) with colonic disease, and five (17%) with small intestinal disease. The interval from initial diagnosis to development of SBS ranged from 2 to 32 years, with 21 patients (71%) having an interval greater than 15 years. The number of resections leading to SBS varied from 2 to 12 with 24 patients (80%) having four or fewer resections. Nineteen patients (63%) had an ostomy. Small intestinal remnant length was less than 60 cm in 10 patients, 60 to 120 cm in six patients, and greater than 120 cm in 14 patients. Only one patient underwent stricturoplasty before developing SBS. Five patients were initially diagnosed as having ulcerative colitis and underwent a pouch procedure, which was subsequently resected. Twenty patients (67%) required parenteral nutrition. Three patients have undergone reversed intestinal segment to slow intestinal transit. Two patients underwent intestinal transplantation. Two patients have died: one from parenteral nutrition-related liver failure and the other after intestinal transplantation. Crohn's disease remains a common cause of SBS. Aggressive resectional therapy, surgical complications, and errors in initial diagnosis contribute to development of SBS in these patients. Selected patients are candidates for surgical therapy for SBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: NOD2/CARD15 variants have recently been shown to be associated with Crohn's disease (CD). No analysis of NOD2/CARD15 gene variants has so far been reported in pediatric patients. Therefore, our aim was to analyze NOD2/CARD15 gene variants in children with CD and to perform genotype-phenotype analyses. METHODS: We studied 101 children with CD and 136 healthy controls. Detailed phenotypic information was obtained from each patient. Patients were genotyped for the three NOD2/CARD15 variants R702W (single nucleotide polymorphism 8 [SNP8]), G908R (SNP12), and L1007fs (SNP13), and genotype-phenotype correlations were performed. RESULTS: We found 33 NOD2/CARD15 mutations in 29 of 101 patients (29%). The frequency of NOD2 variation was 31% in white (n=87) compared with 11% in controls (chi2=14; p=0.0001; OR=3.7; 95% CI=1.7-7.8). Four white patients but not control subjects were compound heterozygotes. NOD2/CARD15 variants were significantly associated with ileal disease (chi2=4.5; p=0.03; OR=5; 95% CI=0.9-35.9). Of the children with NOD2/CARD15 variants, 44% were < or =5th percentile for weight at diagnosis, whereas only 15% of children without mutations were < or =5th percentile (chi2=8.7; p=0.003; OR=4.5; 95% CI=1.4-14.4). Similar trends were observed for height but they did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that: 1) the three NOD2/CARD15 variants confer risk to CD in children; 2) NOD2/CARD15 variants are associated with ileal disease in children as in adults; and 3) NOD2/CARD15 variants are associated with lower weight percentiles at diagnosis in children and a tendency toward lower height percentile, suggesting an association between growth in children with CD.},

   abstract = {In addition to being involved in nutrient uptake, the epithelial mucosa constitute the first line of defense against microbial pathogens. A direct consequence of this physiological function is a very complex network of immunological interactions that lead to a strong control of the mucosal immune balance. The dysfunction of immunological tolerance is likely to be a cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). HLA-G is a non-classical major histocompatibility complex (HLA) class I molecule, which is highly expressed by human cytotrophoblast cells. These cells play a role in immune tolerance by protecting trophoblasts from being killed by uterine NK cells. Because of the deregulation of immune system activity in IBD, as well as the immunoregulatory role of HLA-G, we have analyzed the expression of HLA-G in intestinal biopsies of patients with UC and CD. Our study shows that the differential expression of HLA-G provides a potential way to distinguish between UC and CD. Although the reason for this differential expression is unclear, it might involve a different mechanism of immune regulation. In addition, we demonstrate that in the lamina propria of the colon of patients with UC, IL-10 is strongly expressed. In conclusion, the presence of HLA-G on the surface of intestinal epithelial cell in patients with UC lends support to the notion that this molecule may serve as a regulator of mucosal immune responses to antigens of undefined origin. Thus, this different pattern of HLA-G expression may help to differentiate between the immunopathogenesis of CD and UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) is associated with osteoporosis and other extraintestinal manifestations that might be mediated by cytokines from circulating (peripheral blood) mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Fish oil rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduces disease activity in patients with CD with raised laboratory markers of inflammation and in healthy subjects alters PBMC function. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of fish oil plus antioxidants on cytokine production by PBMCs from patients with CD with raised C-reactive protein concentrations (>/=6.9 mg/L) or erythrocyte sedimentation rates (>/=18 mm/h). DESIGN: A randomized placebo-controlled trial of fish oil (2.7 g EPA and DHA/d; n = 31) or placebo (olive oil; n = 31) for 24 wk was conducted in patients with CD. The fish-oil group additionally received an antioxidant preparation (vitamins A, C, and E and selenium). Exclusion criteria included corticosteroid use. Fatty acid composition was measured by gas chromatography. Production of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays after stimulation with mitogen and endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). RESULTS: Fish-oil plus antioxidant dietary supplementation was associated with higher EPA and DHA incorporation into PBMCs (P < 0.001) and lower arachidonic acid (P = 0.006) and lower production of IFN-gamma by mitogen-stimulated PBMCs (P = 0.012) and of PGE(2) by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated PBMCs (P = 0.047). CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementation with fish oil plus antioxidants is associated with modified PBMC composition and lower production of PGE(2) and IFN-gamma by circulating monocytes or macrophages. The response of extraintestinal manifestations of CD should be investigated in a randomized controlled trial.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with nutritional deficiencies, altered plasma concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and an anti-inflammatory response to fish oil that contains n-3 PUFA. This suggests that, in CD, immune cells may have altered n-3 PUFA composition with functional consequences. The aim of this study is to investigate n-3 and n-6 PUFA composition and synthetic function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the basal state. METHODS: A case control study of 52 adult CD patients and healthy, age- and sex-matched controls. Composition of PBMC and plasma phospholipids were measured by gas chromatography and production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by PBMC were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: CD was associated with higher concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid and other n-3 PUFA, and lower arachidonic acid (AA) (n-6 PUFA) in PBMC. This was not explained by differences in dietary fat intake. Lower rates of production of PGE2 and IFN-gamma by PBMC were noted in quiescent and active CD, respectively, compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: CD is associated with a greater availability, and not a deficiency, of n-3 PUFA in PBMC, but lower concentrations of AA, and lower rates of production of PGE2 and IFN-gamma, compared to healthy controls.},

The availability of essential fatty acids (linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids) or their derivatives (arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids) may alter in plasma and cell membrane phospholipid in protein-energy malnutrition in children and in Crohn's disease in adults. AIM: To investigate the relationship of fatty acid phospholipid profiles with disease activity and nutritional status in paediatric Crohn's disease. METHODS: The fatty acid (proportionate) composition of plasma and erythrocyte phosphatidylcholine was determined in 30 patients (10.3-17.0 years) stratified into active and quiescent Crohn's disease (paediatric Crohn's disease activity index) and high and low body mass (body mass index centile). RESULTS: In plasma phosphatidylcholine, active disease activity was associated with a lower level of alpha-linolenic acid compared with that in quiescent disease (P < 0.05). A body mass index below the 50th centile was associated with active Crohn's disease, low linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids and high arachidonic acid (P < 0.05) in plasma phosphatidylcholine, and low alpha-linolenic acid in erythrocyte phosphatidylcholine. These findings could not be explained through differences in habitual dietary fat intake. CONCLUSION: In paediatric Crohn's disease, a low body mass index centile and high disease activity are associated with altered profiles of essential fatty acids and their derivatives, which may reflect altered metabolic demand.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is associated with reduced bone density. The power of simple markers of systemic inflammation to identify higher rates of bone loss, in Crohn's disease, is uncertain. This relationship and the role of circulating (peripheral blood) mononuclear cells were investigated in a case-control study. METHODS: Urinary deoxypyridinoline/creatinine and serum osteocalcin concentrations were compared in male and premenopausal females with "active" Crohn's disease (C-reactive protein > or = 10 and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate > or = 20) (n = 22) and controls with "quiescent" Crohn's disease (C-reactive protein < 10 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate < 20) (n = 21). No patients were receiving corticosteroid therapy. Production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma and prostaglandin E(2) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured. RESULTS: Active Crohn's disease was associated with a higher deoxypyridinoline/creatinine (P = 0.02) and deoxypyridinoline/creatinine:osteocalcin ratio (P =0.01) compared with quiescent Crohn's disease, but similar osteocalcin (P = 0.24). These were not explained by vitamin D status, dietary intake or nutritional status. However, production of interferon-gamma by concanavalin A-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells was lower in active Crohn's disease (P = 0.02) and correlated negatively with the deoxypyridinoline/creatinine:osteocalcin ratio (r = -0.40, P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: In Crohn's disease, raised C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate may indicate higher rates of bone loss and, if persistent, the need to assess bone mass even where disease symptoms are mild. This may be partly explained by altered production of interferon-gamma by peripheral blood mononuclear cells.},

   abstract = {Even with the development of new therapeutic agents, such as infliximab, enteral nutrition (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN) therapies remain important for the treatment of Crohn's disease because Crohn's patients often require nutritional support. Furthermore, nutritional therapies can be used in the control of disease activity. Elemental diets, which are mainly used in EN therapy, consist of a refined amino acid mixture, glucose or maltodextrins and minimal essential fatty acids. EN therapy can reduce mucosal inflammation by the elimination of dietary antigens, which induce inflammation, and by reductions in fat, which activates inflammation. EN is applied not only as induction therapy, but also as maintenance therapy after remission (home EN). However, the unpalatability of elemental diets, difficulties related to self-intubation and the high cost of EN have limited its application as a primary therapy in western countries. PN is utilized as complete bowel rest supporting nutrition. However, since the therapeutic efficacies of EN and PN are similar, the indications for PN are limited and PN is mainly utilized in patients with bowel obstructions or severe fistulas. PN is also used as home therapy in the treatment of Crohn's patients with short bowel syndrome. However, long-term PN sometimes causes life-threatening complications including catheter-induced sepsis, liver failure and lethal mineral deficiencies. We suggest that gastroenterologists should recognize the advantages and limitations of all therapies and choose carefully or combine various therapies in order to maintain the quality of life in individual patients even if in cases where remission can not be achieved.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease remains unclear, dietary fat is thought to exacerbate intestinal inflammation. Chitosan is a water-insoluble dietary fiber, and a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture has been shown in rats to increase fecal fat excretion without affecting protein digestibility. However, it remains unclear whether a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture is safe and effective for patients with Crohn's disease. We designed a pilot trial to investigate the tolerability and amount of fat excretion after the oral administration of a chitosan and ascorbic mixture for inactive Crohn's disease. METHODS: Eleven outpatients were given seven tablets daily of a chitosan and ascorbic mixture (chitosan was given at 1.05 g/d) for 8 wk. Patients did not interrupt their respective therapies for Crohn's disease. RESULTS: The bowel movements of most patients increased slightly during the study. Nutritional and inflammatory markers in patients did not differ before and after treatment. The chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture significantly increased the fat concentration in the feces during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that oral administration of a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture in patients with Crohn's disease is tolerable and increases fecal fat excretion without affecting disease activity.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic transmural inflammation that may involve any part of the alimentary tract. The affected patients show peculiar metabolic characteristics; they often have a reduced body weight, due to reduction of lipid stores (in spite of lean mass depletion) and an increased utilization of lipids as fuel substrate. An alteration of nutritional status, up to real malnutrition, is common in CD and malnutrition's effects influence the course of disease, acting as independent factors. We will give a description of the main pharmacological approaches in CD management; the first line therapy for CD patients remains the combinations of aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids and immunomodulatory agents. The development of new biological agents for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases has added to the growing armamentarium of available therapy. We also will explain the importance of enteral nutrition, whose importance goes over the simple amelioration of nutritional status, especially in childhood CD, where it has shown to be as effective as traditional therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) seems to be rising. Incidence studies could provide more insight into geographical differences and thereby lead to the identification of etiological factors. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the incidence of pediatric IBD in the Netherlands from 1999 to 2001, using both an active physician case-reporting registry and a nationwide pathology database. METHODS: All pediatricians in the Netherlands were sent monthly identification cards to be returned if they had diagnosed a new case of IBD in a pediatric patient. Follow-up questionnaires were sent to physicians reporting new cases of IBD. The pathology database contains reports from all cytologic and histologic diagnoses made in the Netherlands. Two independent raters searched the database for new IBD cases. Cases identified from the pathology database were labeled as "probable IBD" and "possible IBD." Cases were cross-checked across databases on the basis of gender, date of birth, date of biopsy, and place of residence. Age-specific incidence rates were calculated for the Dutch population for the year 2000. RESULTS: Five hundred forty-six probable cases of IBD were identified; 217 cases were labeled as possible. The incidence rate was 5.2 new cases per 100000 children (<18 years) per year. An increase in incidence with age was observed. Only 24% of the cases were ascertained through the clinical registry. CONCLUSION: The incidence of IBD cases in the Netherlands is comparable with that reported in other European countries. Epidemiological studies using case reporting by physicians may be underestimates of true incidence rates.},

   abstract = {The hypothesis was studied that intestinal microbial metabolites play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. For that purpose, an in vitro model of the colon was inoculated with fresh feces of six healthy individuals and eight inflammatory bowel disease patients. Samples were taken from the model over time to analyze metabolites from both saccharolytic and proteolytic fermentation. Microbiotas from inflammatory bowel disease patients produced significantly more short-chain fatty acids and ammonia than microbiotas from healthy individuals. Furthermore, the branched-chain fatty acid production was 25% higher after inoculation with microbiotas from patients than after inoculation with microbiotas from healthy individuals. Phenolic compounds were produced by all microbiotas, with large interindividual variation. The production of (potentially toxic) metabolites may play a role in the onset or chronicity of inflammatory bowel disease, because they were produced in higher amounts by microbiotas from these patients than by microbiotas from healthy individuals.},

   abstract = {The serologic panel for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is rapidly expanding. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies (ASCA) have remained the most widely studied markers, but immune reactivity against a new group of bacterial antigens such as I2, OmpC (outer membrane porin C), and flagellin, has been described in Crohn's disease. Several clinical avenues have been explored, such as the usefulness of serologic markers as screening tools for IBD and in accelerating a diagnosis in patients with indeterminate colitis. Another area of interest is disease stratification. Emerging data suggest there is a diversity of qualitative and quantitative responses to environmental antigens that differs among groups of IBD patients and may be associated with different clinical behaviors. As a result, it may be possible to tailor therapy on the basis of serologic responses. Prospective studies are needed before translating this concept into clinical practice. Clustering of IBD patients into more homogeneous subgroups based on antibody responses may help to unravel the pathophysiology of subsets of IBD.},

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated the incidence of psoas abscess on 312 patients with Crohn's disease, seen at our institution between 1992-2001. RESULTS: We encountered three cases of psoas abscess (0.9%). One patient was managed with ileocolic resection and immediate anastomosis, while in two patients a percutaneous drainage was first performed and then, after 12 days of total parenteral nutrition, a resection of the diseased bowel with immediate reconstruction was carried out. CONCLUSIONS: A correction of the nutritional deficiencies is mandatory. Percutaneous computed-tomography guided drainage of the abscess with intestinal resection with immediate anastomosis, performed after a parenteral hyperalimentation, should be the method of choice in the management of such patients.},

Among patients with Crohn's disease from 32% to 38% have osteopenia (Z-scores <-1), and among patients with ulcerative colitis 23% to 25% have osteopenia. The mean deficit was 0.44+/-0.08 Z-scores in the spine in Crohn's disease and 0.34+/-0.08 in ulcerative colitis. A similar deficit was seen in the hip in both conditions. From these deficits, an increase in overall fracture risk of 1.1-1.3 should be expected. The observed excess fracture risk was limited compared to the general population in both Crohn's disease (RR=1.2, 95% CI: 0.9-1.6 for any fracture and 2.2, 95% CI: 1.2-4.0 for spine fractures) and ulcerative colitis (RR=1.1, 95% CI: 1-1.2 for any fracture, and 1.5, 95% CI: 0.9-2.5 for spine fractures). The observed excess fracture risk was close to that expected from the changes in BMD. Despite the limited excess fracture risk, a relatively large percentage of all fractures may be attributable to corticosteroid use among users of corticosteroids.},

The authors' objective was to evaluate the differences in initial clinical presentation of young and older children with IBD and to determine whether a positive family history of IBD is associated with the age of presentation. METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of all patients with new diagnoses of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) who presented between July 1996 and July 1999. Initial evaluation included assessment of growth parameters and laboratory values (hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum albumin). Inquiry regarding a family history of IBD was made in every patient. RESULTS: There were 153 patients with new diagnoses (82 with CD and 71 with UC), with a mean age of 11.9 years (range, 16 months-18 years). The children with CD had a higher sedimentation rate and platelet count and a lower mean hemoglobin concentration and serum albumin at presentation than did children with UC. Body mass index (BMI) was significantly lower in patients with newly diagnosed CD than in those with UC. The only significant laboratory differences between patients younger than 11 years and those 11 years or older was a higher mean platelet count in patients with CD who were younger than 11 years. Of the younger patients with CD, 41.7% had a positive family history of IBD, which was significantly greater that that found in the older patients with CD. CONCLUSIONS: Except for higher platelet counts, a lower BMI, and a higher frequency of positive family history in young children with CD, there were no significant differences in the presentation of young children with IBD compared with older children.},

Our aim was to compare the NOD2/CARD15 genotype and the genotype-phenotype correlation in Jewish pediatric patients with CD (</=16 years of age) with older patients with CD. STUDY DESIGN: Carrier frequencies of the three variants were determined in 67 children and 144 adults with CD. Variants were detected by using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion assay. Demographic and phenotypic characterizations of the patients were determined. RESULTS: The carrier rate of the three NOD2/CARD15-associated variants was 51.5% in children and 37.5% in adults (P=.07). The most prevalent allele variant was G908R (allele frequency 18% in children, 11% in adults; P=.063). Young Ashkenazi patients had the highest allele frequency of G908R, and higher than Ashkenazi adults: 25% and 9%, respectively (P=.003). Children had more family history of inflammatory bowel disease and more inflammatory-type disease, with no relation to variant allele carriage. CONCLUSIONS: G908R allele-variant of the NOD2/CARD15 gene is closely related with the appearance of CD at a young age in Jewish Ashkenazi patients.},

   abstract = {Left-sided diverticulosis coli is a common condition in western communities, with 30% to 50% of adults over the age of 60 being affected. It predominantly involves the sigmoid colon. The diverticula (pseudodiverticula) are pockets of mucosa bounded by muscularis mucosae and invested with a thin layer of submucosa, that are forced out through weak points in the muscularis propria, the tips ending in the colonic subserosa. The weak points in the muscle coat are the sites of entry of the nutrient vessels of the colonic mucosa. Diverticulosis is attributed to increased colonic intraluminal pressure while straining at stool in individuals who eat low-fiber diets. Muscular hypertrophy, shortening of the bowel, and thickened mucosal folds due to mucosal redundancy are characteristic of this condition. Complications of diverticulosis include bleeding, diverticulitis, peridiverticular abscess, perforation, stricture, and fistula formation. However, most individuals with diverticulosis are asymptomatic, without evidence of complications. Mucosal changes in the diverticula in uncomplicated diverticulosis include an increased lymphoid infiltrate, development of lymphoglandular complexes, mucin depletion, mild cryptitis, architectural distortion, Paneth cell metaplasia, and ulceration. The mucosa of the remainder of the sigmoid colon (ie, the nondiverticular mucosa) is usually normal, but in about 1% of cases it has features that are indistinguishable from ulcerative colitis or from Crohn's disease (segmental colitis associated with diverticular disease, SCAD). Such cases pose a difficult diagnostic challenge as patients with SCAD respond to medical or surgical therapy for diverticular disease, whereas those with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease will develop other manifestations of their disease in time and require different treatment. In SCAD, the mucosal changes are confined to the area of diverticulosis; therefore, histologic evaluation of the rectum (which is unaffected by diverticulosis) and more proximal bowel can be helpful in the differential diagnosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This case presentation describes a method of evaluation and a conservative management plan for a child with probable inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's Disease). Possible causes for this clinical presentation and a brief review of the literature are offered. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 9-year-old female had a history of headaches, stomach ache, foulsmelling soft stools, canker and cold sores, dry skin, stuffy nose with postnasal drip, difficulty concentrating in school, mood swings and growing pains with leg cramps. She also had a trace of fecal blood. A Urine OrganiX Profile and the Food Antibody Assessment was ordered demonstrating metabolic changes and food sensitivities. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: In this case, following a clinical laboratory assessment, treatment was initiated using nutrients and dietary changes. Fourteen months after consultation, the patient was symptom-free and her final laboratory assessment was essentially negative. She learned to work with her diet and the consequences resulting from breaking it. CONCLUSIONS: There is the need for a conservative approach to evaluation and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease before considering other more aggressive and potentially hazardous approaches. The patient's signs and symptoms responded to a unique method of evaluation and conservative management when other approaches had failed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delayed growth is a well-established feature of pediatric Crohn's disease. Several factors have been shown to affect growth, including disease location, severity, and treatment. The recently discovered NOD2 gene has been correlated to ileal location of Crohn's disease and subsequently could affect growth through the resulting phenotype or as an independent risk factor. The aim of our study was to determine if growth retardation is affected by genotype independently of disease location or severity. METHODS: Genotyping for 3 NOD2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms was performed in 93 patients with detailed growth records. Parameters including disease location, disease severity, and NOD 2 genotype and their effect on z scores for height and weight at disease onset and during follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS: NOD2 mutations were correlated with ileal location but not with disease severity or growth retardation. Ileal involvement was significantly associated with height retardation at disease onset and the lowest z score during follow-up. Use of steroids affected weight but not height. Regression models for growth variables revealed that the strongest association with impaired growth is with disease severity (weight- and height-failure odds ratios: 6.17 and 4.52, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Severity of disease is correlated with growth failure for both height and weight. Location of disease is a weaker predictor of disordered growth and is correlated with growth retardation but not growth failure. The NOD2 genotype was not correlated with growth retardation or growth failure.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increasing incidence of Crohn's disease has been found in China in recent years. Our study has been focused on evaluating the diversity of the clinical manifestations of Crohn's disease in order to improve early diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: Thirty patients with active Crohn's disease were enrolled and their clinical data, including diagnostic and therapeutic results, were analyzed. Endoscopy combined with histological examination of biopsy specimens provided characteristic features of the disease. Transabdominal bowel sonography (TABS) was used for detecting intestinal complications. Nutritional supportive therapy was given to 20 subjects with active cases of the disease. RESULTS: Most patients were young adults with a higher proportion of females to males (ratio: 1.14:1). The disease affects any segment or a combination of segments along with the alimentary tract (from the mouth to the anus). In this study, the colon and small bowel were the major sites involved. Recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant and watery diarrhea were the most common symptoms. Granulomas were identifiable in nearly one-third (30.8%) of all biopsy specimens. In moderate cases of the disease, remission was achieved more quickly through the use of oral prednisone therapy than with SASP or 5-ASA. Beneficial effects on the host's nutritional status were observed. Immunosuppressives were used on an individual basis and showed variable therapeutic effects. Sixteen patients had surgery due to intestinal obstruction or failure to respond to drug therapies. Rapid improvement after surgery was reported. CONCLUSION: Endoscopy (with biopsy) and TABS were both crucial procedures for diagnosis. SASP (or 5-ASA) and prednisone were effective as inductive therapies. Azathioprine has demonstrable benefits after induction therapy with prednisone. Surgery, as an alternative treatment, provided another effective choice in selected patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Serologic testing is increasingly being utilized to evaluate children with suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this paper was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a currently available panel involving four antibodies: deoxyribonuclease (DNase)-sensitive perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (DNase-sensitive pANCA), IgA and IgG antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (IgA and IgG ASCA), and antibody to Escherichia coli outer membrane porin (anti-OmpC). We also wished to determine whether antibody levels correlated with disease activity, and whether a specific antibody pattern correlated with location and outcome of disease in children. METHODS: We studied sera from 81 children with Crohn's disease (CD), 54 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 63 controls. Clinical data, disease activity, and disease diagnosis were gathered at the time of serum sampling, and charts were re-reviewed at time of the study to determine long-term outcome. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was utilized to determine titers of antibodies to ASCA, DNase-sensitive pANCA, and anti-OmpC; the presence of perinuclear staining for ANCA was confirmed by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: We identified ASCA antibodies in 44% of CD patients, 0% of UC patients, and 1 control patient. DNase-sensitive pANCA antibodies were found in 70% of patients with UC, 18% of CD patients (predominantly Crohn's colitis), and 3% of controls. Anti-OmpC as an isolated assay had low sensitivity for both CD (24%) and UC (11%), and displayed a 5% false-positive rate. However, anti-OmpC did identify a small number of IBD patients not detected by the other assays. If any one or more of the four antibodies was positive, the overall sensitivity of the four antibody panel was 65% for CD and 76% for UC, with a specificity of 94%. Patients who were ASCA-positive were more likely to have disease of the ileum or ileum and right colon than patients who were ASCA-negative (58%vs 18%, p < 0.001). Patients with ASCA-positive were also more likely to require ileocecal resection (36%vs 13%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A currently available commercial antibody panel has good sensitivity and excellent specificity for CD and UC. The ASCA antibodies, while highly specific for CD, identify predominantly the subset of children with disease of the ileum and ascending colon who may be at increased risk of surgery.},
