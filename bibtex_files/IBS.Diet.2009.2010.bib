   abstract = {(1) Patients frequently complain of occasional bowel movement disorders, associated with abdominal pain or discomfort, but they are rarely due to an underlying organ involvement. Even when patients have recurrent symptoms, serious disorders are no more frequent in these patients than in the general population, unless other manifestations, anaemia, or an inflammatory syndrome is also present; (2) There is currently no way of radically modifying the natural course of recurrent irritable bowel syndrome; (3) The effects of antispasmodics on abdominal pain have been tested in about 20 randomised controlled trials. Pinaverium and peppermint essential oil have the best-documented efficacy and only moderate adverse effects. Antispasmodics with marked atropinic effects do not have a favourable risk-benefit balance; (4) Tricylic antidepressants seem to have only modest analgesic effects in this setting. In contrast, their adverse effects are frequent and they have somewhat negative risk-benefit balances. Nor has the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) been demonstrated; (5) Alosetron and tegaserod carry a risk of potentially life-threatening adverse effects and therefore have negative risk-benefit balances; (6) Seeds of plants such as psyllium and ispaghul, as well as raw apples and pears, have a limited impact on constipation and pain. Osmotic laxatives are effective on constipation. Symptomatic treatments for constipation can sometimes aggravate abdominal discomfort; (7) Loperamide has been poorly assessed in patients with recurrent irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea. It modestly slows bowel movement but does not relieve pain or abdominal discomfort; (8) Dietary measures have not been tested in comparative trials. Some patients are convinced that certain foods provoke a recurrence of irritable bowel syndrome, but restrictive diets carry a risk of nutritional deficiencies; (9) Various techniques intended to control emotional and psychological disturbances have been proposed, including relaxation, biofeedback, hypnosis, and psychotherapy. The results of clinical trials are not convincing; (10) Oral products containing live bacteria, designed to change the equilibrium of intestinal flora, have been tested in 13 placebo-controlled trials, with inconsistent results. A few cases of septicaemia have been reported; (11) The six available trials of acupuncture (versus sham acupuncture) showed no more than a placebo effect; (12) In practice, patients who have recurrent irritable bowel syndrome but with no other signs of a condition warranting specific treatment should be reassured as to the harmless nature of their disorder if a careful physical examination and basic laboratory tests are negative. The only available treatments have purely symptomatic effects and only limited efficacy. It is best to avoid using all treatments and additional diagnostic investigations that carry a risk of disproportionate adverse effects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sensitivity and specificity of anti-human tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-htTGA) seem to be superior to those of anti-tissue transglutaminase of guinea pig (anti-gptTGA) for screening patients with celiac disease (CD), but there are still controversies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of two INOVA ELISA kits to detect IgA anti-htTGA and anti-gptTGA in patients with and without CD. METHODS: The study groups were comprised of 49 anti-endomysial antibody (EMA)-positive untreated-CD, and 123 controls (EMA-negative treated CD, EMA-negative chronic diarrhea, autoimmune hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease and healthy people). RESULTS: The agreement between the two ELISAs was statistically significant in all study groups and there was no significant difference between them (92.7% agreement; kappa = 0.70; kappa p = 0.001; McNemar p = 1). All patients with serum reactivity of more than 100 units had histologic diagnosis of CD. In seven of 10 patients with treated-CD who had control biopsies, villous atrophy was still present in four who tested positive by both kits. Two of three celiacs with histologic remission tested positive for both anti-tTGA. CONCLUSIONS: the anti-gptTGA and anti-htTGA determination were equally efficient in identifying patients with untreated-CD with high titers of EMA. Whatever the anti-tTGA ELISA used, the reactivity above 100 units was always related to active CD diagnosed by histologic alterations in intestinal biopsies. The anti-tTGA reactivity by both kits was not only similar in determining histologic activity in the follow-up of CD after a gluten free diet, but also in identifying positive sera from the control groups, regardless if CD has been confirmed by duodenal biopsies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A sensation of abdominal swelling (bloating) and actual increase in girth (distension) are troublesome features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is more common in patients with constipation, especially those with delayed transit. AIM: To establish whether a fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 reduces distension in association with acceleration of gastrointestinal transit and improvement of symptoms in IBS with constipation. METHODS: A single centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel group study in which patients consumed the test product or control product for 4 weeks. Distension, orocaecal and colonic transit and IBS symptoms were assessed on an intention-to-treat population of 34 patients. RESULTS: Compared with control product, the test product resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage change in maximal distension [median difference - 39%, 95% CI (-78, -5); P = 0.02] and a trend towards reduced mean distension during the day [-1.52 cm (-3.33, 0.39); P = 0.096]. An acceleration of orocaecal [-1.2 h (-2.3,0); P = 0.049] as well as colonic [-12.2 h (-22.8, -1.6); P = 0.026] transit was observed and overall symptom severity [-0.5 (-1.0, -0.05); P = 0.032] also improved. CONCLUSIONS: This probiotic resulted in improvements in objectively measured abdominal girth and gastrointestinal transit, as well as reduced symptomatology. These data support the concept that accelerating transit is a useful strategy for treating distension.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic abdominal pain is a common complaint in childhood and adolescence. Despite decades of clinical observations and research, it still poses a challenge to pediatric health care professionals. The aim of this review is to highlight the epidemiology of pediatric chronic abdominal pain and to describe the pathogenesis of this disorder, its clinical manifestations, evaluation and therapeutic options. DATA SOURCES: Articles on chronic abdominal pain in the recent years from PubMed, MEDLINE, and reference textbooks were reviewed. RESULTS: Chronic abdominal pain, a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID), is a multifactorial condition that results from a complex interaction between psychosocial and physiologic factors via the brain-gut axis. A thorough history coupled with a complete physical examination and normal screening studies rule out an organic cause in 95% of the cases. It is highly important for the physician to establish a trusting relationship with the child and parents because successful treatment including modification of physical and psychological stress factors, dietary changes, and drug therapy depends greatly on education, reassurance and active psychological support. CONCLUSIONS: FGIDs are a cause of great anxiety, distress and morbidity in children as well as adults. As our understanding of these conditions improves, our therapeutic interventions will progress not only to overcome them but also to intervene early in the disease course so as to limit long-term impact.},

This study prospectively evaluated a VLCD in IBS-D. METHODS: Participants with moderate to severe IBS-D were provided a 2-week standard diet, then 4 weeks of a VLCD (20 g carbohydrates/d). A responder was defined as having adequate relief of gastrointestinal symptoms for 2 or more weeks during the VLCD. Changes in abdominal pain, stool habits, and quality of life also were measured. RESULTS: Of the 17 participants enrolled, 13 completed the study and all met the responder definition, with 10 (77%) reporting adequate relief for all 4 VLCD weeks. Stool frequency decreased (2.6 +/- 0.8/d to 1.4 +/- 0.6/d; P < .001). Stool consistency improved from diarrheal to normal form (Bristol Stool Score, 5.3 +/- 0.7 to 3.8 +/- 1.2; P < .001). Pain scores and quality-of-life measures significantly improved. Outcomes were independent of weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: A VLCD provides adequate relief, and improves abdominal pain, stool habits, and quality of life in IBS-D.},

   abstract = {AIM: To assess the effect of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) on fasting and postprandial (PP) perception of rectal distension and symptoms in hypersensitive constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C). METHODS: Forty-two patients meeting Rome II criteria for IBS-C and with a pain threshold of < 32 mmHg were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients received either oral PEG, 3.45 g t.i.d. orally for 30 days or placebo. Rectal sensitivity was assessed before and after treatment with a barostat using the ascending method of limits, during basal and PP periods. RESULTS: No changes in fasting and PP rectal tone and thresholds for first sensation, gas sensation, urge to defecate, and pain was observed with PEG in relation to placebo. In both groups, pressure at which patients crossed the thresholds for noxious (PEG: from 28 +/- 8.8 to 22 +/- 6.9 mmHg) and non noxious (PEG: from 16 +/- 4.9 to 12 +/- 3.6 mmHg) stimuli decreased compared with pretreatment values. PEG improved consistency of faeces and showed a trend to diminish blood in faeces. PEG and placebo increased bowel movements per week (P < 0.001), and relieved symptoms without significant side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: Both PEG 3350 and placebo were clinically useful in patients with IBS-C, an effect that cannot be explained by changes in rectal tone and sensation. The results support the concept that visceral sensitivity is not stable and has a heterogeneous response to drugs, and suggest the existence of a post healing hypersensitivity state.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lactose malabsorption (LM), the inability to break down lactose into glucose and galactose, is due to a deficiency in the small intestinal lactase phlorizin hydrolase enzyme. Ethnic and geographic variations of LM are known. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of LM in healthy southern and northern Indian populations. DESIGN: A total of 153 healthy volunteers (76 from southern and 77 from northern India) were evaluated for LM by using a lactose tolerance test (LTT), a lactose hydrogen breath test (lactose HBT), and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism to identify the lactase gene C/T-13910 polymorphism (confirmed by sequencing). RESULTS: Volunteers from southern and northern India were comparable in age and sex. The LTT result was abnormal in 88.2% of southern Indians and in 66.2% of northern Indians (P = 0.001). The lactose HBT result was abnormal in 78.9% of southern Indians and in 57.1% of northern Indians (P = 0.003). The CC genotype was present in 86.8% and 67.5% (P = 0.002), the CT genotype was present in 13.2% and 26.0% (P = 0.036), and the TT genotype was present in 0% and 6.5% (P = 0.03) of southern and northern Indians, respectively. The frequency of symptoms after the lactose load (47.4% compared with 15.6%; P < 0.001) and peak concentrations of breath hydrogen (88.5 +/- 71.9 compared with 55.4 +/- 61.9 ppm; P = 0.003), both of which might indicate the degree of lactase deficiency, were higher in southern than in northern Indians. CONCLUSION: The frequency and degree of LM is higher in southern than in northern Indian healthy populations because of genetic differences in these populations.},

   abstract = {Treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders remains difficult with many very different approaches showing similar response rates, regardless of whether they target luminal contents (e.g., presumed bacterial overgrowth), signaling within the gut wall (e.g., serotonin agonists or antagonists) or processing in the brain (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy). Discrepancies between recent clinical trials and a meta-analysis have forced us to re-examine the use of antidepressants. Other studies have looked beyond the traditional drug therapies and have suggested other options such as dietary interventions and communication strategies that address relevant disease mechanisms and enable us to understand patient concerns, with the ultimate goal being to individualize and thus improve treatment outcomes.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of increasing the dietary content of soluble fibre (psyllium) or insoluble fibre (bran) in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: General practice. PARTICIPANTS: 275 patients aged 18-65 years with irritable bowel syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: 12 weeks of treatment with 10 g psyllium (n=85), 10 g bran (n=97), or 10 g placebo (rice flour) (n=93). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was adequate symptom relief during at least two weeks in the previous month, analysed after one, two, and three months of treatment to assess both short term and sustained effectiveness. Secondary end points included irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity score, severity of abdominal pain, and irritable bowel syndrome quality of life scale. RESULTS: The proportion of responders was significantly greater in the psyllium group than in the placebo group during the first month (57% v 35%; relative risk 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.26) and the second month of treatment (59% v 41%; 1.44, 1.02 to 2.06). Bran was more effective than placebo during the third month of treatment only (57% v 32%; 1.70, 1.12 to 2.57), but this was not statistically significant in the worst case analysis (1.45, 0.97 to 2.16). After three months of treatment, symptom severity in the psyllium group was reduced by 90 points, compared with 49 points in the placebo group (P=0.03) and 58 points in the bran group (P=0.61 versus placebo). No differences were found with respect to quality of life. Fifty four (64%) of the patients allocated to psyllium, 54 (56%) in the bran group, and 56 (60%) in the placebo group completed the three month treatment period. Early dropout was most common in the bran group; the main reason was that the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome worsened. CONCLUSIONS: Psyllium offers benefits in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in primary care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trials NCT00189033.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) and eosinophilic colitis (ECO) are two forms of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by eosinophil accumulation in the mucosa or in deeper layers of the gastrointestinal wall and associated with atopic disease. The eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases broadened the spectrum of atopic gastrointestinal disorders formerly restricted to food allergy manifestating at the gastrointestinal mucosa. Their awareness increased enormously; therefore, we will review current knowledge about atopic gastrointestinal diseases for the allergologist. RECENT FINDINGS: Major attention will be drawn to the differential diagnosis, because symptoms of atopic gastrointestinal diseases frequently mimic those of other chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), although the diseases are distinct in their histopathology, gene expression signature, response to therapy, and association with allergies. The pathogenesis of EGE and ECO will be described that involves environmental and genetic factors, particularly food antigens and expression level of interleukin (IL)-5 and selective chemokines. SUMMARY: Understanding symptoms and pathology of such disease is the basis of a rational treatment based on reduced exposure to offending food antigens as well as anti-inflammatory therapy. Atopic gastrointestinal diseases are in many cases reversible; however, chronic treatment is often necessary to prevent relapse.},

OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the dietary triggers for IBS and the role of diagnostic testing in patients with IBS. DISCUSSION: In addition to the long standing implication of lactose in lactase deficient patients, fermentable dietary oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, together with very low carbohydrate diets, have been increasingly recognised as important in the causation and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Understanding their role and utilising the services of a practising dietician have become additional important tools for general practitioners managing this common complaint.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the evidences for the usefulness of dietary manipulations (including the use of probiotics and prebiotics) in the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). RECENT FINDINGS: Exclusion diets do not have a role in the management of these patients except in the case of malabsorbed sugars (lactose, fructose). However, recent work suggests that excluding these sugars is more effective in non-IBS than in IBS patients. Also, the first small open series on the use of very low (20 g/day) carbohydrate diet (VLCD) in IBS has been published with promising results. However, safety concerns do not allow us to recommend them. In the period of review, further evidence has been provided on the role of psyllium in IBS. Also, the available evidence on the use of probiotics in IBS has been meta-analyzed. SUMMARY: IBS patients should eat a balanced diet without restrictions, and (except for malabsorbed sugars) exclusion diets are not useful in most of them. The role of VLCD remains to be established. The concept that increasing fiber intake is useful for IBS may not be true for all patients, and hydrophilic colloids (e.g. psyllium) are preferred. There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS.},

   abstract = {Lactose and food intolerance cause a wide range of gut and systemic symptoms, including gas, gut pain, diarrhoea or constipation, severe headaches, severe fatigue, loss of cognitive functions such as concentration, memory and reasoning, muscle and joint pain, heart palpitations, and a variety of allergies (Matthews and Campbell, 2000; Matthews et al., 2005; Waud et al., 2008). These can be explained by the production of toxic metabolites from gut bacteria, as a result of anaerobic digestion of carbohydrates and other foods, not absorbed in the small intestine. These metabolites include alcohols, diols such as butan 2,3 diol, ketones, acids, and aldehydes such as methylglyoxal (Campbell et al., 2005, 2009). These 'toxins' induce calcium signals in bacteria and affect their growth, thereby acting to modify the balance of microflora in the gut (Campbell et al., 2004, 2007a,b). These bacterial 'toxins' also affect signalling mechanisms in cells around the body, thereby explaining the wide range of symptoms in people with food intolerance. This new mechanism also explains the most common referral to gastroenterologists, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and the illness that afflicted Charles Darwin for 50 years (Campbell and Matthews, 2005a,b). We propose it will lead to a new understanding of the molecular mechanism of type 2 diabetes and some cancers.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: A percentage of patients with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) suffer from food hypersensitivity (FH) and improve on a food-elimination diet. No assays have satisfactory levels of sensitivity for identifying patients with FH. We evaluated the efficacy of an in vitro basophil activation assay in the diagnosis of FH in IBS-like patients. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 120 consecutive patients diagnosed with IBS according to Rome II criteria. We analyzed in vitro activation of basophils by food allergens (based on levels of CD63 expression), as well as total and food-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels in serum. Effects of elimination diets and double-blind food challenges were used as standards for FH diagnosis. RESULTS: Twenty-four of the patients (20%) had FH (cow's milk and/or wheat hypersensitivity); their symptom scores improved significantly when they were placed on an elimination diet. Patients with FH differed from other IBS patients in that they had a longer duration of clinical history, a history of FH as children, and an increased frequency of self-reported FH; they also had hypersensitivities to other antigens (eg, egg or soy). The basophil activation assay diagnosed FH with 86% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and 87% accuracy; this level of sensitivity was significantly higher than that of serum total IgE or food-specific IgE assays. CONCLUSIONS: A cytometric assay that quantifies basophils after stimulation with food antigens based on cell-surface expression of CD63 had high levels of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in diagnosing FH. This assay might be used to diagnose FH in patients with IBS-like symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition associated with no certain organic cause, though diet and stress are widely implicated. The condition is frustrating for both sufferers and doctors, and there are problems in diagnosing and treating the condition. Eliciting explanatory models (EMs) is a useful tool for understanding how individuals relate to their illnesses and their expectations for treatment, particularly for illnesses with uncertain aetiology like IBS. OBJECTIVES: To understand the EMs, experiences and expectations for management of patients with IBS. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 51 primary care patients (31 in the UK, 20 in The Netherlands) meeting the Rome II diagnostic criteria for IBS. RESULTS: Although IBS often had a significant dampening effect on daily life, IBS patients made great efforts not to allow the condition to take over their lives. Triggers of symptoms were more important to patients than understanding the underlying aetiology of IBS. Diet and stress were both recognized as important triggers, but views about which foods were problematic and the extent to which stress was modifiable were inconsistent. Diagnosis and treatment were often a confusing and frustrating process, and patients often expected more diagnostic tests than they were offered before receiving a diagnosis of IBS. However, the often poor outcome of medical interventions does not, in general, appear to have a negative impact on the patient-doctor relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the extensive impact of IBS on sufferers' daily life and the frustration that results from repeatedly trying treatments with little effect. Clearly explaining the guidelines for diagnosing IBS and the range of treatment options may help patients to make sense of the diagnostic and treatment processes. The personal EM should be addressed during the consultation with the IBS patient, ensuring that any successive medical interventions match with the patients' disease perception.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a four week kiwifruit intervention on bowel function in patients diagnosed with IBS/C. Fifty-four patients with IBS/C and 16 healthy adults participated in this study. All subjects participated in the 6 week, three phase study, which included a baseline phase (1 week), a dietary intervention period (4 weeks), and a post-intervention phase (1 week). Forty-one IBS/C patients and all healthy adults consumed two Hayward green (Actinida deliciosa var) kiwifruits per day for 4 weeks. Thirteen IBS/C patients in the control group took two placebo capsules per day for 4 weeks. Colon transit time was measured immediately prior to and following the intervention period. All subjects completed daily defecation records. After the 4-week intervention, weekly defecation frequency significantly increased in the IBS/C group of participants who consumed kiwifruit (p<0.05). Colon transit time significantly decreased (p=0.026) in the IBS/C group that consumed kiwi fruit. These findings suggest that kiwifruit consumption for 4 weeks shortens colon transit time, increases defecation frequency, and improves bowel function in adults diagnosed with IBS/C.},

This chronic disorder causes abdominal pain or discomfort and is characterized by abnormal defecation that presents mainly as either constipation or diarrhea symptoms. IBS associated with diarrhea (IBS-D) accounts for approximately one third of all IBS patients. IBS-D treatment can be confusing and frustrating for both the patient and the physician, complicated by the fact that a specific therapeutic algorithm has not been developed. Treatment options are widely varied, consisting of both nonpharmacologic (dietary changes) and pharmacologic (loperamide and alosetron) interventions. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests a possible role for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in the pathogenesis of IBS-D; thus, both antibiotics (such as rifaximin) and probiotics are frequently used to treat patients. Although all of these interventions elicit some measure of symptom response in a proportion of treated patients, there is no standard of care for the treatment of IBS-D. Thus, physicians would benefit from knowledge of all of the strategies used to treat IBS-D, in order to treat patients appropriately.},

For a distinct subset of patients with more severe and disabling illness, finding effective treatment for these disorders remains a challenge. Over the years, a wide range of therapies have been proposed and studied. The lack of a single, proven intervention highlights the complex interplay of biopsychosocial factors probably involved in the development of childhood FAP and IBS, and the need for a multidisciplinary, integrated approach. This article reviews the current literature on the efficacy of pharmacologic, dietary and psychosocial interventions for FAP and IBS in children and adolescents.},

   abstract = {Irregularities of serotonin function in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be due to changes in the metabolism of the serotonin precursor l-tryptophan. Dietary alteration of tryptophan intake may impact upon the mood and bowel symptoms of IBS. We hypothesized that diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (d-IBS) patients would exhibit an increase in plasma tryptophan due to alterations in tryptophan metabolism. We also hypothesized that a diet low in tryptophan would reverse this change and reduce symptoms. Thirteen patients with d-IBS had fasting serum free and total tryptophan, large neutral amino acids, and 6 kynurenine metabolites measured before and after 2 weeks of a strict dairy-free diet. Baseline tryptophan parameters were compared with an age- and sex-matched control group. Changes in the specific tryptophan parameters before and after dairy-free diet were correlated with symptoms of IBS and mood. Compared with the control group, d-IBS patients at baseline exhibited significantly higher free serum tryptophan (10.5 +/- 4.35 vs 4.75 +/- 2.43 mumol/L [means +/- standard deviation], P = .006) and significantly lower tryptophan dioxygenase and total tryptophan oxidation as measured by the kynurenine to free tryptophan and total kynurenines to free tryptophan ratios (23.37 +/- 10.12 vs 55.33 +/- 16.02, P < .001 and 49.34 +/- 17.84 vs 258.46 +/- 98.67, P < .001, respectively). Dairy-free diet did not modulate metabolites of the kynurenine pathway or symptoms. Tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway is inhibited in d-IBS, and a dairy-free diet does not alter this. Our findings are consistent with possible enhanced serotonin activity in d-IBS.},

   abstract = {The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic abdominal symptom complex that is heterogeneous in terms of its clinical presentation and underlying pathophysiology and pathogenesis. It is now established that enteric infection can trigger the syndrome in at least a subset of patients. In addition, there is growing evidence of low grade inflammation and immune activation in the distal bowel of some IBS patients. These observations now prompt the question as to what maintains gut dysfunction in these patients. The intestinal microbiota influences a broad array of host organs that include the gut and the brain, and is an important determinant of normal function in these systems. Disruption of the delicate balance between the host and its intestinal microbiota (termed dysbiosis) results in changes in the mucosal immune system that range from overt inflammation as seen in Crohn's Disease, to low grade inflammation without tissue injury, as seen in a subset of IBS patients. Under experimental conditions, disruption of the microbiota also produces changes in gut sensory-motor function and immune activity. Thus, dysbiosis induced by infection, dietary change or drugs such as antibiotics could produce low grade inflammation and chronic gut dysfunction, reminiscent of that seen in IBS. Fluctuations in gut physiology destabilize the habitat of commensal bacteria and provide a basis for chronic dysbiosis. Recent observations in animal models that changes in gut flora influence behavior provide a basis for a novel unifying hypothesis that accommodates both gut dysfunction and behavioral changes that characterize many IBS patients. This hypothesis states that dysbiosis exists in at least a subset of IBS patients, as a result of infection, dietary change or drugs and contributes to gut inflammatory and functional change in addition to psychiatric co-morbidity.},

Its evolution is chronicle but there are no organic lesions for the beginning. Nevertheless, it impairs quality of life and creates many days of incapacity of work. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We studied 1118 cases with digestive malfunctions, selected from the patients consulted on Ambulatory Care Unit--Internal Medicine, 2007-2008. RESULTS: Basal clinical and laboratory explorations classified the type of digestive malfunctions according to international criteria. So we found these types of anomalies: gastro-oesofagial reflux--788 cases; peptic-like syndrome--752 cases; pyloric functional spasm--385 cases; helicobacter pyloridi positive--632 cases; gallblader dysfunction--767 cases; irritable bowel syndrome--872 cases. The treatment was applied pursued the pathological status. Most of cases had un diagnosticated diseases as peptic ulcer, gastritis, gallbladder diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Our conclusions are that the whole tract has continuity and the site of dysfunction is difficult to diagnose from the beginning. Pro-kinetic drugs and inhibitory of gastric secretion have very good results. The same time we must treat the "background"--extra digestive factors (i.e., Helicobacter pylori infection).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of carbohydrate maldigestion or malabsorption remains unclear in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of identifying lactose maldigestion (LM) and fructose malabsorption (FM) on patients with and without IBS. METHODS: Patients who received lactose and fructose challenge testing formed the study group. Carbohydrate challenge testing was performed with 50 g lactose and 25 g fructose. Breath samples were collected and analyzed for hydrogen, methane, and CO2 (for correction) using a MicroLyzer Model SC (QuinTron Instrument Company, Milwaukee, WI). Questionnaires were used to assess Rome III IBS criteria, compliance with carbohydrate dietary modifications, and changes in symptoms. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-one of the 181 (67%) study subjects were able to be contacted 8 months to 4 years after carbohydrate testing. LM (21) and FM (2) were seen in 33% of the 66 IBS subjects. LM (12) and FM (9) were seen in 33% of the 55 subjects without IBS. Seventy-seven percent of IBS and 72% of those without IBS reported compliance with dietary advice. Of the subjects who reported compliance, 47% of IBS and 77% of those without IBS reported that, after identifying LM or FM, their symptoms resolved or improved. CONCLUSIONS: Carbohydrate maldigestion has a similar incidence in patients with and without IBS and both populations have similar compliance with therapeutic diets. However, patients without IBS are more likely to have improvement in symptoms when dietary changes are instituted when compared to IBS patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although clinicians generally make treatment decisions in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) related to the type of symptoms, other factors such as the perceived severity and the risks patients are willing to tolerate for effective treatment are also important to consider. These factors are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: To describe among patients with IBS their symptoms and severity, quality of life and health status, medications taken, and the risk that they would take to continue medications for optimal relief. METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with IBS who accessed the websites of the International Foundation for Functional GI Disorders or the University of North Carolina Center for Functional GI Disorders filled out questionnaires to address the study aims. RESULTS: The 1966 respondents (83% female, 91% white, 78% US/Canada) reported impaired health status: restricting on average 73 days of activity in a year, having poor health-related quality of life particularly with dietary restrictions, mood disturbance, and interference with daily activity, and 35% reported their symptoms as severe defined primarily as pain, bowel difficulties, bloating, and eating/dietary restrictions). These symptoms were reported in some combination by over 90%, and 35.1% endorsed all 4 items. To receive a treatment that would make them symptom free, patients would give up 25% of their remaining life (average 15 y) and 14% would risk a 1/1000 chance of death. Most of the medications being taken were for pain relief and 18% were taking narcotics. Complementary and alternative treatments were used by 37%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients accessing IBS informational websites report moderate-to-severe impairments in health status, and would take considerable risk to obtain symptom benefit. There is an unmet need to find effective treatments for patients with IBS and regulatory agencies might consider raising risk-benefit ratios when approving new medications for IBS.},

   abstract = {In irritable bowel syndrome, the main objectives of the treatment are the relief of abdominal pain then the improvement of bowel disturbances. Spasmolytic agents, or clays remain routinely the first line pharmacological options. The efficacy of dietary recommendations is not validated in most of the cases while dietary fibers, mainly insoluble fibers, may even worsen abdominal discomfort. In C-IBS, osmotic laxatives or macrogol are effective to improve colonic transit while loperamide and also colestyramine can be prescribed to reduce the number of stools of D-IBS patients. When the first line treatment fails to improve symptoms, antidepressants (tricyclic rather than SSRs) can be prescribed at lower doses than that recommended for depression. In meta-analysis, the odds ratio for pain relief varies from 2 to 4 and strongly depends on the patient's compliance to the treatment. Probiotics, pregabalin and even antibiotics (i.e neomycin, metronidazole or rifaximin), are possible new therapeutic options. Few clinical trials suggest that ramosetron (a new 5HT3 antagonist), octreotide, melatonin, or lidocain could be also discussed in the future. A non pharmacological therapeutic approach has to be considered, particularly in patients with severe symptoms, in combination with pharmacological treatment.},

In almost 20% of the patients, IBS is clearly a post-infectious IBS as a consequence of an acute bacterial gastroenteritis. Some papers have reported an abnormal colonic fermentation in IBS patients that could explain symptoms such as bloating and be one of the factors triggering visceral hypersensitivity. More recently, significant differences in the composition of both the luminal and mucosa-associated microbiota have been reported between both IBS patients and healthy controls and IBS subgroups while some arguments exist for a small intestinal overgrowth in a subset of IBS patients. All these arguments for a deleterious role of the gut microbiota lead to the actual discuss to consider new therapeutic options, including mainly pre- and probiotics and maybe antibiotics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous meta-analyses have recently assessed the overall clinical benefit of single therapy options and groups of therapies in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). By large, this should enable physicians to select from a number of therapy options available. METHODS: We entered dichotomous outcome data from 121 IBS trials published over the last 35 years with different groups and subgroups of drugs (antispasmodics, motility-affecting agents, antidepressants, peppermint oil), dietary interventions (bran, probiotics), and psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral, psychodynamic, hypnotherapy, relaxation techniques) into meta-analytic tools and estimate the overall efficacy (odds ratio, number needed to treat). RESULTS: Highest efficacy is currently found for peppermint oil, followed by psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions and probiotics. Traditional antispasmodic therapy has a moderate efficacy, whereas the list of (partially failed or cancelled) motility affecting drugs yielded weak clinical results, and therapies by bran and fibers are of no value in IBS. CONCLUSION: Evidence-based therapy in IBS provides a number of effective treatment options beyond the fact that many novel compounds under development have failed to reach the market. An algorithm for clinical therapy decision is proposed.},

   abstract = {AIM: Nutritional changes are often considered first-line treatment in public health diseases that apply to many gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, as different food and beverages may modulate GI motor and sensory functions, and may provoke GI symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine dietary coping and possible changes in food and beverage intake in relation to GI symptoms reported by identified irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients compared with healthy controls, and whether any sex differences were observed in these respects. METHODS: A population-based case-control design was used. Three primary healthcare centres were selected in the city of Linkoping in Sweden. The IBS patients were recruited from the studied primary healthcare centers on the basis of diagnoses from computerized medical records. The controls were randomly selected from the general population in the same region. A questionnaire was used with specific questions about self-reported food and beverage increase or decrease of GI symptoms and self-reported changes in dietary habits. RESULTS: Female IBS patients seem to be more willing to change dietary habits because of their GI problems than men. Effects of these nutritional behaviour changes were reported for almost all participants that had made dietary adjustments. Fatty food, certain vegetables, dairy products and eggs were significantly more reported to cause GI complaints among IBS patients compared with their controls. CONCLUSION: Female IBS patients reported more changes in their dietary habits because of GI problems than men with the disease. The majority of both women and men who changed their dietary habits because of GI problems experienced improvement in their symptoms.},

This malabsorption is sometimes associated with abdominal complaints and diarrhea development, symptoms indistinguishable from those of functional bowel disease. Recently, polymerized forms of fructose (fructans) also were implicated in symptom production in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Evidence from uncontrolled and controlled challenge studies suggests that malabsorbed sugars (fructose, sorbitol, lactose) and fructans may act as dietary triggers for clinical symptoms suggestive of IBS. Further placebo-controlled studies are needed to obtain definite conclusions about the role of dietary sugar malabsorption in functional bowel disease.},

After summarizing the general mechanism of action of mineral waters, the main indications of such waters in thermal treatment are examined including: biliary sand, biliary dyskinesia, functional dyspepsia, irritable colon, chronic primitive constipation. The dysfunctions of biliary and digestive tracts are growing, mainly in the affluent world, because of the increase for stress, dietary habits, modern life style. Now they affect from 2,4% of general population to 7% of men and 20% of women, according to different studies. Mineral waters can improve symptoms and care some physiopathological underlying mechanisms. Authors stress the efficacy of sulphate-bicarbonate mineral waters in the therapy of biliary dyskinesias, namely gallbladder hypokinesia and Oddi's sphincter spasm, caused by their content in SO4 = anion and Mg++ cation and related effects on paracrine-endocrine gastrointestinal system. In addition, they report the effects of sulphate-bicarbonate mineral waters in the lithogenic bile (sand bile), because of their diluting and washing activity. Among the sulphate-bicarbonate mineral waters, the Authors outline the well-documented therapeutic activity of Acqua Santa and Fucoli of Chianciano Terme. Acqua Santa has stimulating effect on cholecystis's motility, as proved by controlled clinical trials. Finally, the therapeutic use of sulphate-bicarbonate mineral water is discussed in functional dyspepsia, chronic primitive constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) relieves symptoms in children with recurrent abdominal pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 141 children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional pain were enrolled in 9 primary care sites and a referral center. Children entered a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and received LGG or placebo for 8 weeks and entered follow-up for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was overall pain at the end of the intervention period. At entry and at the end of the trial, children underwent a double-sugar intestinal permeability test. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, LGG, but not placebo, caused a significant reduction of both frequency (P < .01) and severity (P < .01) of abdominal pain. These differences still were significant at the end of follow-up (P < .02 and P < .001, respectively). At week 12, treatment success was achieved in 48 children in the LGG group compared with 37 children in the placebo group (P < .03); this difference still was present at the end of follow-up (P < .03). At entry, 59% of the children had abnormal results from the intestinal permeability test; LGG, but not placebo, determined a significant decrease in the number of patients with abnormal results from the intestinal permeability testing (P < .03). These effects mainly were in children with IBS. CONCLUSIONS: LGG significantly reduces the frequency and severity of abdominal pain in children with IBS; this effect is sustained and may be secondary to improvement of the gut barrier.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a functional bowel disorder with symptoms of abdominal pain and disturbed defecation experienced by 10% of U.S. adults, results in significant disability, impaired quality of life, and health-care burden. Conventional medical care focusing on pharmacological approaches, diet, and lifestyle management has been partially effective in controlling symptoms. Behavioral treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnosis, are promising. This paper describes an on-going feasibility study to assess the efficacy of mindfulness training, a behavioral treatment involving directing and sustaining attention to present-moment experience, for the treatment of IBS. METHODS/DESIGN: The study design involves randomization of adult women with IBS according to Rome II criteria, to either an eight-week mindfulness training group (based on a Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction [MBSR] format) or a previously validated IBS social-support group as an attention-control condition. The primary hypothesis is that, compared to Support Group participants, those in the Mindfulness Program will demonstrate significant improvement in IBS symptoms as measured by the IBS Symptom Severity Scale [1]. DISCUSSION: 214 individuals have been screened for eligibility, of whom 148 were eligible for the study. Of those, 87 were enrolled, with 21 withdrawing after having given consent. 66 have completed or are in the process of completing the interventions. It is feasible to undertake a rigorous randomized clinical trial of mindfulness training for people with IBS, using a standardized MBSR protocol adapted for those experiencing IBS, compared to a control social-support group previously utilized in IBS studies.

Irritable bowel syndrome has been described as a biopsychosocial condition, in which colonic dysfunction is affected by psychological and social factors. As a result of this unusual constellation, irritable bowel syndrome may be subject to cultural variables that differ in different parts of the globe. In this article, we describe some of the ways in which irritable bowel syndrome may be experienced differently, depending on local belief systems, psychological pressures, acceptance or resistance to a mind-body paradigm, and breakdown in support or relationship structure. Examples are given in which irritable bowel syndrome investigators from countries around the world describe various aspects of the syndrome that may affect the illness experience of their patients. We describe our own research studies that have demonstrated possible adverse effects on disease severity from relationship conflict, attribution of symptoms to physical rather than emotional cause, and the belief that irritable bowel syndrome is enduring and mysterious. Also described is our finding that symptom patterns may differ significantly between different geographic locations. Finally, we discuss the importance of "cultural competence" on the part of healthcare professionals in regard to caring for patients of diverse cultural backgrounds.},

   abstract = {Co-existing algogenic conditions in two internal organs in the same patient may mutually enhance pain symptoms (viscero-visceral hyperalgesia). The present study assessed this phenomenon in different models of visceral interaction. In a prospective evaluation, patients with: (a) coronary artery disease (CAD)+gallstone (Gs) (common sensory projection: T5); (b) irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)+dysmenorrhea (Dys) (T10-L1); (c) dysmenorrhea/endometriosis+urinary calculosis (Cal)(T10-L1); and (d) gallstone+left urinary calculosis (Gs+LCal) (unknown common projection) were compared with patients with CAD, Gs, IBS, Dys or Cal only, for spontaneous symptoms (number/intensity of pain episodes) over comparable time periods and for referred symptoms (muscle hyperalgesia; pressure/electrical pain thresholds) from each visceral location. In patients' subgroups, symptoms were also re-assessed after treatment of each condition or after no treatment. (a) CAD+Gs presented more numerous/intense angina/biliary episodes and more referred muscle chest/abdominal hyperalgesia than CAD or Gs; cardiac revascularization or cholecystectomy also reduced biliary or cardiac symptoms, respectively (0.001<p<0.05). (b) IBS+Dys had more intestinal/menstrual pain and abdomino/pelvic muscle hyperalgesia than IBS or Dys; hormonal dysmenorrhea treatment also reduced IBS symptoms; IBS dietary treatment also improved dysmenorrhea (0.001<p<0.05) while no treatment of either conditions resulted in no improvement in time of symptoms from both. (c) Cal+Dys had more urinary/menstrual pain and referred lumbar/abdominal hyperalgesia than Cal or Dys; hormonal dysmenorrhea treatment/laser treatment for endometriosis also improved urinary symptoms; lithotripsy for urinary stone also reduced menstrual symptoms (0.001<p<0.05). (d) In Gs+LCal, cholecystectomy or urinary lithotripsy did not improve urinary or biliary symptoms, respectively. Mechanisms of viscero-visceral hyperalgesia between organs with documented partially common sensory projection probably involve sensitization of viscero-viscero-somatic convergent neurons.},

   abstract = {Rice- and chili-containing foods are common in Asia. Studies suggest that rice is completely absorbed in the small bowel, produces little intestinal gas and has a low allergenicity. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that rice-based meals are well tolerated and may improve gastrointestinal symptoms in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). Chili is a spicy ingredient commonly use throughout Asia. The active component of chili is capsaicin. Capsaicin can mediate a painful, burning sensation in the human gut via the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1). Recently, the TRPV1 expressing sensory fibers have been reported to increase in the gastrointestinal tract of patients with FGID and visceral hypersensitivity. Acute exposure to capsaicin or chili can aggravate abdominal pain and burning in dyspepsia and IBS patients. Whereas, chronic ingestion of natural capsaicin agonist or chili has been shown to decrease dyspeptic and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. The high prevalence of spicy food in Asia may modify gastrointestinal burning symptoms in patients with FGID. Studies in Asia demonstrated a low prevalence of heartburn symptoms in GERD patients in several Asian countries. In conclusion rice is well tolerated and should be advocated as the carbohydrate source of choice for patients with FGID. Although, acute chili ingestion can aggravate abdominal pain and burning symptoms in FGID, chronic ingestion of chili was found to improve functional dyspepsia and GERD symptoms in small randomized, controlled studies.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic gastrointestinal disorder, affects from 3-20% of the US population, depending on sociocultural and comorbid factors. IBS is characterized by a symptom complex of abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habits that present as diarrhea or constipation, and general physical weakness in the absence of abnormal morphological, histological or inflammatory markers. The main diagnostic Rome III criteria as established by international professional organizations are based on exclusion criteria and the occurrence and rate of symptoms. Because the pathophysiology and causes of IBS are poorly understood, treatment approaches are mainly focused on symptom management to maintain everyday functioning and improve quality of life for persons with IBS. The mainstay of intervention is pharmacological treatment with antispasmodics and antidiarrheals for diarrhea, prokinetics and high-fiber diets for constipation, and supportive therapy with low-dose antidepressants to normalize gastrointestinal motility. Other interventions include lifestyle and dietary changes, psychotherapy, herbal therapies and acupuncture. The purpose of this review is to critically assess benefits and risks of current treatment approaches as well as promising complementary and alternative therapies.},

   abstract = {AIM: Some probiotics improve digestive comfort of people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, but this needs confirmation in a healthy population. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of consuming fermented milk containing the probiotics Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173010 and yoghourt strains (test product) on digestive comfort and symptoms amongst adults without diagnosed gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: The study was designed to approximate a real-life situation, by using a branded product in the intervention groups. In an open-label, randomized, controlled trial, 371 adults reporting digestive discomfort were randomized into three groups who had a daily consumption of either one or two pots of test product over 2 weeks, or to follow their usual diet. Digestive comfort and bother from digestive symptoms were assessed by questionnaire at baseline and follow-up (per protocol population n = 360). Self-reported change in digestive comfort and computed change between baseline and follow-up for each of 20 items were compared between groups (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). RESULTS: A higher percentage of participants consuming the test product reported improved digestive comfort (1-pot group 82.5%; 2-pot group 84.3%), than controls (2.9%). Their self-reported change scores differed significantly (P < 0.001). For both test product groups, almost all symptom scores improved significantly more than controls (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between 1-pot and 2-pot groups. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that daily consumption of a probiotic food in real-life conditions may be useful in improving digestive comfort and symptom experience of adults from general population. Further double-blind randomized controlled studies are required to confirm these health benefits.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many of the ideas on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are derived from studies conducted in Western societies. Their relevance to Asian societies has not been critically examined. Our objectives were to bring to attention important data from Asian studies, articulate the experience and views of our Asian experts, and provide a relevant guide on this poorly understood condition for doctors and scientists working in Asia. METHODS: A multinational group of physicians from Asia with special interest in IBS raised statements on IBS pertaining to symptoms, diagnosis, epidemiology, infection, pathophysiology, motility, management, and diet. A modified Delphi approach was employed to present and grade the quality of evidence, and determine the level of agreement. RESULTS: We observed that bloating and symptoms associated with meals were prominent complaints among our IBS patients. In the majority of our countries, we did not observe a female predominance. In some Asian populations, the intestinal transit times in healthy and IBS patients appear to be faster than those reported in the West. High consultation rates were observed, particularly in the more affluent countries. There was only weak evidence to support the perception that psychological distress determines health-care seeking. Dietary factors, in particular, chili consumption and the high prevalence of lactose malabsorption, were perceived to be aggravating factors, but the evidence was weak. CONCLUSIONS: This detailed compilation of studies from different parts of Asia, draws attention to Asian patients' experiences of IBS.},

These highly varied treatments are often associated. They can be classed into four categories: reflexology methods, interventions on the psyche, biological therapies, and treatments using certain forms of energy. Although some studies show interesting results, currently there are not sufficient scientific arguments to recommend one or another of these alternative treatments.

   abstract = {This review summarizes what is known about the effect of diet on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms emphasizing data from randomized, controlled clinical trials. Studies suggest that IBS symptoms in one quarter of patients may be caused or exacerbated by one or more dietary components. Recent studies indicate that a diet restricted in fermentable, poorly absorbed carbohydrates, including fructose, fructans (present in wheat and onions), sorbitol, and other sugar alcohols is beneficial, but confirmatory studies are needed. Despite a long history of enthusiastic use, fiber is marginally beneficial. Insoluble fiber may worsen symptoms. Some patients with IBS, especially those with constipation, will improve with increased intake of soluble fiber. Prebiotic fibers have not been adequately tested. Daily use of peppermint oil is effective in relieving IBS symptoms. The usefulness of probiotics in the form of foods such as live-culture yogurt and buttermilk for IBS symptoms is not established. In clinical practice, it is very difficult to establish that a patient's symptoms result from an adverse reaction to food. A double blind placebo-controlled food challenge is the most reliable method, but it is not suitable for routine clinical use. A modified exclusion diet and stepwise reintroduction of foods or trials of eliminating classes of food may be useful.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Symptomatology and physiology differ between men and women and across the menstrual cycle in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Ovarian hormones influence 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), an amine known to play a role in gut motor-sensory function. AIM: To assess the effects of gender and menstrual status on platelet-depleted plasma (PDP) 5-HT concentration in IBS patients with diarrhoea (IBS-D) patients compared with healthy volunteers (HV). METHODS: Platelet-depleted plasma 5-HT concentrations were assessed under fasting and fed conditions in 73 IBS-D patients (aged 18-58 years; 18 men) and 64 HV (aged 18-50 years; 24 men). Women were divided into those with low or high progesterone/oestrogen (P/O) levels. RESULTS: Irritable bowel syndrome patients with diarrhoea had higher PDP 5-HT concentrations than HV under fasting (P = 0.002) and fed (P = 0.049) conditions. This was particularly related to IBS-D men having higher PDP 5-HT concentrations than healthy controls (P = 0.002). Moreover, PDP 5-HT concentrations in IBS-D women with low P/O levels were similar to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to IBS-D women with high P/O levels, IBS-D men also have raised PDP 5-HT concentrations. 5-HT concentration normalizes at menses in IBS-D women, suggesting a shift in the mechanisms responsible for abnormal 5-HT signalling in these patients.},

METHOD: Animal model of compound diarrhea was induced by a lactose enriched diet in the Wistar rat, combining with restraint stress. At first, the best cycle of taking medicine was tested. In order to decide the best cycle of taking medicine, 24 female Wistar rats were randomly divided into normal control group, model group and 60 mg x kg(1) x d(-1) weichangan group. The rate of weight increase, the rate of diarrhea, the incubation period of diarrhea and the diarrhea index were observed. And then 45 female Wistar rats randomly divided into five groups: normal control group, model group and Weichang Anwan groups of high, medium and low doses( 80, 60, 40 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)). The mast cells in mucous membrane were observed by light microscope. The level of NO in blood serum was checked by the method of nitrate reductase. 5-HT in blood serum was detected by fluorimetry. The level of SP in colon was measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULT: After taking Weichang Anwan for 4 days, the rate of weight increase in Weichangan group was higher than the model group's. And the rate of diarrhea was lower significantly. So the best cycle of taking medicine was 4 days. The levels of NO and 5-HT in blood serum decreased remarkably in the model group than those of the normal control group. At the same time, the amount of the mast cells and the level of SP in colon significantly increased. Compared with the model group, the levels of NO and 5-HT in blood serum increased remarkably in the groups of high doses and medium doses. Meanwhile, the amount of the mast cells and the level of SP in colon decreased significantly. CONCLUSION: Weichang Anwan has the effect of antidiarrhea. It can adjust the levels of NO and 5-HT in blood serum and can inhibit the expression of SP in colon which can active the mast cell. Weichangan can also decrease the amount of the mast cells directly.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Between 4% and 25% of school-age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) of sufficient severity to interfere with daily activities. It is unclear whether the diagnosis includes children with different aetiologies for their pain. For the majority no organic cause for their pain can be found on physical examination or investigation. Although most children are likely managed by reassurance and simple measures, a large range of interventions have been recommended. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of dietary interventions for recurrent abdominal pain in school-age children. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2006), EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2006), CINAHL (1982 to Dec 2007), ERIC (1966 to Dec 2006), PsycINFO (1872 to Dec 2006), LILACS (1982 to Dec 2006), SIGLE (1980 to March 2005), and JICST (1985 to 06/2000) were searched . Where appropriate, search filters were employed. Researchers working in this area were asked to identify relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised studies of any dietary treatment versus placebo or no treatment in school-age children with a diagnosis of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorder based on the Rome II criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed quality and extracted data. Where appropriate studies were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Seven trials were included in this review. Two trials, including 83 participants, compared fibre supplements with placebo (Christensen 1982, Feldman 1985), with data from one study reported in two papers (Christensen 1982, Christensen 1986). The pooled odds ratio for improvement in the frequency of abdominal pain was 1.26 (0.25, 6.29). Two trials, including 90 participants (Lebenthal 1981, Dearlove 1983) compared lactose-containing with lactose-free diets. Neither reported data in a form which could be used in the meta-analysis and the former trial had a loss to follow-up of 45%. We were not able to obtain further data for either trial. Three trials (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007, Young 1997) comparing supplementation with Lactobacillus with placebo met the inclusion criteria but only two (Bausserman 2005, Gavronska 2007), including a total of 168 children, provided analysable data. The pooled odds ratio for improvement of symptoms was 1.17 (95% CI 0.62, 2.21). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of high quality evidence on the effectiveness of dietary interventions. This review provides no evidence that fibre supplements, lactose free diets or lactobacillus supplementation are effective in the management of children with RAP.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Lactose stimulates proliferation and colonization of acidophilic bacteria, which due to fermentation processes lower colonic pH and simplified absorption of some microelements from the intestine. However, the common problem in children is intolerance of this carbohydrate. Treatment, quite simple, is based on partial or total elimination of lactose from diet. Some substitutional products with equivalent nutritional value should be introduced to prevent deficiencies symptoms during lactose-free diet. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY: Determination of milk and dairy products consumption and their connection with lactose malabsorption or lactose intolerance in children above 5 years of age in selected disorders of the alimentary tract: food allergy, celiac disease, secondary enteropathy, functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and deficiency of body weight and height. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The number of 301 patients above 5 years of age (135 boys and 166 girls; mean age 11.5 years) were included into the study. Milk and dairy products consumption habits, lactose intolerance symptoms, hydrogen breath test, activity of lactase and villous atrophy were investigated. RESULTS: Decreased sweet milk consumption from, 33.33% in children with food allergy to 55.38% in children with functional indigestion was observed, in spite of gastrointestinal complaints after ingestion of milk. The biggest lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance frequency was observed in children with decreased sweet milk consumption due to complaints after ingestion of milk and in children who didn't drink milk. There were no statistically significant difference between frequency of lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance symptoms in children with different dairy products consumption habits. There were no statistically significant difference between frequency of hypolactasia in children with different sweet milk or dairy products consumption habits. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent (33-55%) decreased sweet milk consumption in children in spite of clinical symptoms after ingestion of milk was observed. The biggest lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance symptoms frequency was observed in children who didn't drink milk and in children with decreased consumption of sweet milk due to complaints after ingestion of milk. There were no statistically significant difference between frequency of lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance in children with different dairy products consumption habits.},

   abstract = {Reports that bacteria within the Firmicutes phylum, especially the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, are less abundant in Crohn's disease (CD) patients and supernatants from cultures of this bacterium are anti-inflammatory prompted the investigation of the possible correlations between the abundance of F. prausnitzii and the response to treatment in patients with gut diseases and healthy controls. In a randomized, double-blind trial, faeces were collected from healthy volunteers, and from patients with active CD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome before and after treatment. The levels of F. prausnitzii DNA in faecal suspensions were determined by PCR. Treatment by an elemental diet was effective, resulting in decreases in both the Harvey and Bradshaw index (P<0.001) and the concentrations of serum C-reactive protein (P<0.05). The total levels of F. prausnitzii in faecal samples from CD patients at presentation were lower than those in the other groups both before and after the treatment. There was no correlation between F. prausnitzii abundance and the severity of CD before treatment. Clinical improvement unexpectedly correlated with a significant decrease in the abundance of F. prausnitzii, especially the A2-165 subgroup (P<0.05). Our data suggest that a paucity of F. prausnitzii in the gastrointestinal microbial communities is likely to be a minor aetiological factor in CD: recovery following elemental diet is attributed to lower levels of gut flora.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common health issue that is characterized by abdominal pain, abnormal bowel movements, altered visceral perception, and abnormal metabolism of 5-hydroxy triptamine (serotonin; 5HT). The use of prebiotics or probiotics treatment for IBS has become increasingly important as an adjunct to pharmaceutical options. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of enzyme-treated rice fiber (ERF) on an IBS model. We obtained a new prebiotic from defatted rice bran that was developed as an insoluble dietary fiber through amylase and hemicellulase treatment followed by removal of the soluble fraction. Containing approximately 70% hemicellulose, ERF is utilized by lactobacilli and subsequently converted to butyrate using Eubacterium limosum. We employed a restraint stress IBS model which involved the continuous application of stress for 4 h per day for 3 days. Polycarbophil Ca (PC) (500 mg/kg body weight) was used as a positive control and ERF was added to the diet at 4% in diet. During restraint stress, ERF significantly attenuated urgent fecal excretion, colonic mucosal 5HT secretion, and hyperalgesthesia compared with the control. ERF also significantly increased cecal butyrate production as well as total organic acid content. PC was only effective in regard to preventing increases in 5HT levels. Furthermore, there were no significant levels of pro-inflammatory markers CINC-1 and TNF-alpha among the groups. Although more detailed studies are needed, the ERF prebiotic demonstrated potency in attenuating major symptoms of IBS.},

Acute affections of intestinal functions e.g. during gastrointestinal infections usually need no functional diagnostics but resolve spontaneously or with adequate therapy of the underlying disease. By contrast, chronic disturbances of small intestinal, colonic and anorectal motility and/or sensitivity are subject to gastrointestinal function tests. The role of these tests for diagnosis and therapeutic handling of severe intestinal dysmotility/chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, severe constipation, diarrhoea, fecal incontinence and irritable bowel syndrome will be discussed in this review that mainly focuses on adults.},

   abstract = {IBS is a common gastrointestinal condition characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. IBS is considered a functional bowel disorder (that is, not defined by structural or biochemical abnormalities) and is diagnosed using symptom-based criteria. Limited and judicious use of diagnostic testing is recommended, particularly in patients with typical symptoms of IBS without alarm signs and symptoms. Management of IBS is based on a multifactorial approach and includes establishment of an effective patient-provider relationship, education, reassurance, dietary alterations, pharmacotherapy, behavioral and psychological treatment. Patient-centered care is recommended, in which management is focused on the patient's most bothersome and impactful symptoms, their preferences and previous experiences with treatment, and addressing factors associated with the onset and exacerbation of symptoms. Pharmacotherapy is typically targeted against the predominant symptom. This Review discusses the current evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of IBS. An improved understanding of the recommended diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for IBS will lead to greater patient satisfaction, as well as reduced health-care costs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease shares several symptoms which constitute some of the ROME criteria used for the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and as such many patients with underlying Celiac disease may be mistakenly diagnosed as having IBS. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Celiac disease in patients with IBS fulfilling ROME III criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who fulfilled ROME III criteria for irritable bowel syndrome were screened for Celiac disease using the Biocard(TM) Celiac Disease Stick test, and patients who tested positive had their serum samples analyzed for antigliadin IgA and IgG, and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies. Patients with detectable antibody levels underwent endoscopic duodenal biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of Celiac disease. RESULTS: Two of 100 patients who were diagnosed as having irritable bowel syndrome as per the Roma III criteria were found to have elevated levels of serum antigliadin IgA and IgG, and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies, with histological evidence of Celiac disease on examination of duodenal biopsy. Both patients were started on a gluten-free diet, showing significant improvement in their symptoms on follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is a common finding among patients labeled as IBS. Celiac disease must be considered in differential diagnosis of IBS especially in the therapy refractory group.},

METHODS: Three hundred individuals, 206 females (68.7%) and 94 males (31.3%), were submitted to a rapid and easy immunoglobulin-A-class fingertip whole blood point-of-care test in the doctor's office in order to make immediate clinical decisions: 13 healthy controls, 6 with CD suspicion, 46 treated celiacs, 84 relatives of the celiac patients, 69 patients with dyspepsia, 64 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 8 with Crohn's disease and 9 with other causes of diarrhea. RESULTS: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsies was performed in patients with CD suspicion and in individuals with positive test outcome: in 83.3% (5/6) of the patients with CD suspicion, in 100% of the patients that admitted gluten-free diet transgressions (6/6), in 3.8% of first-degree relatives (3/79) and in 2.9% of patients with dyspepsia (2/69). In all these individuals duodenal biopsies confirmed CD (Marsh's histological classification). The studied test showed good correlation with serologic antibodies, endoscopic and histological findings. CONCLUSION: The point-of-care test was as reliable as conventional serological tests in detecting CD cases and in CD diet monitoring.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent functional bowel disorder routinely encountered by healthcare providers. Although not life-threatening, this chronic disorder reduces patients' quality of life and imposes a significant economic burden to the healthcare system. IBS is no longer considered a diagnosis of exclusion that can only be made after performing a battery of expensive diagnostic tests. Rather, IBS should be confidently diagnosed in the clinic at the time of the first visit using the Rome III criteria and a careful history and physical examination. Treatment options for IBS have increased in number in the past decade and clinicians should not be limited to using only fiber supplements and smooth muscle relaxants. Although all patients with IBS have symptoms of abdominal pain and disordered defecation, treatment needs to be individualized and should focus on the predominant symptom. This paper will review therapeutic options for the treatment of IBS using a tailored approach based on the predominant symptom. Abdominal pain, bloating, constipation and diarrhea are the four main symptoms that can be addressed using a combination of dietary interventions and medications. Treatment options include probiotics, antibiotics, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and agents that modulate chloride channels and serotonin. Each class of agent will be reviewed using the latest data from the literature.},

We have provided a series of useful tools to approach these patients. We have provided the symptom-based diagnostic criteria plus the red flags to help you avoid missing an organic diagnosis. We have placed these disorders squarely within the complex biopsychosocial framework by identifying early life stress and many environmental factors that are key factors in the development of pain. We have identified the role of psychological comorbidities of anxiety and depression and the need to address them directly in order to rehabilitate a disabled child. Finally, pharmacologic, psychological, dietary, and complementary approaches are reviewed and recommended as empiric therapy in functional abdominal pain, functional dyspepsia, and irritable bowel syndrome. Use these new tools well.},

Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum MF1298 was found to have the best in vitro probiotic properties of 22 strains of lactobacilli. The aim of this study was to investigate the symptomatic effect of L. plantarum MF1298 in subjects with IBS. Primary outcome was treatment preference and secondary outcomes were number of weeks with satisfactory relief of symptoms and IBS sum score. METHODS: The design was a randomised double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. 16 subjects with IBS underwent two three-week periods of daily intake of one capsule of 10(10) CFU L. plantarum MF 1298 or placebo separated by a four-week washout period. RESULTS: Thirteen participants (81%; 95% CI 57% to 93%; P = 0.012) preferred placebo to L. plantarum MF1298 treatment. The mean (SD) number of weeks with satisfactory relief of symptoms in the periods with L. plantarum MF1298 and placebo were 0.50 (0.89) and 1.44 (1.26), respectively (P = 0.006). IBS sum score was 6.44 (1.81) in the period with L. plantarum MF1298 treatment compared with 5.35 (1.77) in the period with placebo (P = 0.010). With a clinically significant difference in the IBS sum score of 2 in disfavour of active treatment, the number needed to harm was 3.7, 95% CI 2.3 to 10.9. CONCLUSIONS: This trial shows for the first time an unfavourable effect on symptoms in subjects with IBS after intake of a potential probiotic.},

We assessed anxiety and depression in SFH patients, using both questionnaires and interview. METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=130) and randomly selected healthy volunteers (n=75) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the neuroticism scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-N) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Seventy-six of the patients were also interviewed by use of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Montgomery-Aasberg Depression Rating Scale. All patients underwent extensive allergological, gastroenterological and dietary examinations. RESULTS: According to interviews, 57% of patients fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for at least one psychiatric disorder. Anxiety disorders (34%) and depression (16%) predominated. According to questionnaires, patients scored significantly higher than controls on all psychometric scales except for depression (HADS). We also found an underreporting of depression in HADS compared with interviews (2.5% vs. 16%, P=.001). Food hypersensitivity was rarely confirmed by provocation tests (8%). Eighty-nine percent of the patients had irritable bowel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety and depression are common in patients with IBS-like complaints self-attributed to food hypersensitivity. Anxiety disorders predominate. In this setting, depression may be underreported by HADS.},

IBS has prevalence rates of approximately 6% to 22% in various countries, and more women than men are diagnosed with this disorder. This study explored how Taiwanese women with IBS gain knowledge about the disorder and studied their experiences in using alternative remedies. An ethnographic study design involving interviews and Internet online discussions was used. Women (18-45 years) either diagnosed with IBS or with self-reported symptoms that met the Rome II criteria were included. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by the constant comparison method. Results showed that symptom pattern recognition was used most often by participants to interpret symptoms. The bodily practices of the IBS women followed Taiwanese gender norms, with bodily experiences being represented as a dialogue between the disordered body and the social body. Linking diarrhea with social norms of female slenderness, IBS women applied cultural strategies to manage symptoms. The findings facilitate a partnership between healthcare professionals and IBS women, which can facilitate the development of an appropriate self-management manual, self-help groups, and Internet discussion groups to facilitate symptom management. It is hoped that this study will enhance nurse understanding of the traditional Chinese view of the body and the corresponding dietary practices used to harmonize the body's yin and yang. Although Asian women may resist Western medications due to their side effects, study results provide nurses with information on alternative therapies that may be more acceptable in the Asian context. In conclusion, the bodily experiences and practices of women with IBS are developed from personal cultural views of the body and gender norms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Probiotics can alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), possibly by stabilizing the intestinal microbiota. Our aim was to determine whether IBS-associated bacterial alterations were reduced during multispecies probiotic intervention consisting of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS and Bifidobacterium breve Bb99. The intervention has previously been shown to successfully alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms of IBS. METHODS: The faecal microbiotas of 42 IBS subjects participating in a placebo-controlled double-blind multispecies probiotic intervention were analysed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Eight bacterial targets within the gastrointestinal microbiota with a putative IBS association were measured. RESULTS: A phylotype with 94% similarity to Ruminococcus torques remained abundant in the placebo group, but was decreased in the probiotic group during the intervention (P = 0.02 at 6 months). In addition, the clostridial phylotype, Clostridium thermosuccinogenes 85%, was stably elevated during the intervention (P = 0.00 and P = 0.02 at 3 and 6 months, respectively). The bacterial alterations detected were in accordance with previously discovered alleviation of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic supplement was thus shown to exert specific alterations in the IBS-associated microbiota towards the bacterial 16S rDNA phylotype quantities described previously for subjects free of IBS. These changes may have value as non-invasive biomarkers in probiotic intervention studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Postprandial symptoms are common in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and could be diet related. We studied postprandial changes in distribution of water in the upper gastrointestinal tract of healthy volunteers (HVs) and patients with IBS-D after contrasting meals. METHODS: In study 1, 11 HVs consumed 350-mL test meals with 5% mannitol (unabsorbable) or 5% glucose (readily absorbed). In study 2, 17 HVs consumed a 331-kcal meal, with or without 15 g bran. In study 3, 26 patients with IBS-D consumed the study 2 diet with bran meal. All subjects underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging analysis. RESULTS: In study 1, subjects' small bowel water content (SBWC) increased after the mannitol but not glucose meals, reaching 381 mL (interquartile range, 343-491 mL) and 47 mL (18-78 mL), respectively, 40 minutes after eating (P < .001). In study 2, SBWC initially decreased after both meal types and then increased, plateauing at 180-405 minutes and was greater after the bran meal (P = .02). In study 3, fasting and postprandial SBWC was lower in IBS-D than in HVs (P < .05 and P < .0001, respectively). Patients with IBS-D had faster orocecal transit times (135 minutes; 90-180 minutes) compared with HVs (225 minutes; 203-293 minutes; P < .0001) and reduced terminal ileum diameter (P < .003). CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial SBWC initially decreases, because of rapid, nutrient-driven fluid absorption, and then increases after a mixed liquid/solid meal. Patients with IBS-D have reduced fasting and postprandial SBWC with faster transit, possibly indicating increased small intestinal tone.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: 5-HT(3) antagonists have been shown to be effective in relieving the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D). Using a recently validated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method, we have demonstrated reduced fasting small bowel water content (SBWC) in IBS-D associated with accelerated small bowel transit. We hypothesized that slowing of transit with ondansetron would lead to an increase in SBWC by inhibiting fasting motility. AIM: To assess the effects of ondansetron compared with placebo in healthy volunteers on SBWC and motility in two different groups of subjects, one studied using MRI and another using manometry. METHODS: Healthy volunteers were given either a placebo or ondansetron on the day prior to and on the study day. Sixteen volunteers underwent baseline fasting and postprandial MRI scans for 270 min. In a second study, a separate group of n = 18 volunteers were intubated and overnight migrating motor complex (MMC) recorded. Baseline MRI scans were carried out after the tube was removed. RESULTS: Fasting SBWC was markedly increased by ondansetron (P < 0.0007). Ondansetron reduced the overall antroduodenal Motility Index (P < 0.04). The subjects who were intubated had significantly lower fasting SBWC (P < 0.0002) compared with the group of subjects who were not intubated. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-HT(3) receptor antagonism increased fasting small bowel water. This was associated with reduced fasting antroduodenal Motility Index which may explain the clinical benefit of such drugs.},

   abstract = {Patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) commonly report the precipitation of symptoms on food ingestion. Though the role of dietary constituents in IBS has not been extensively studied, food could contribute to symptom onset or even the causation of IBS through a number of mechanisms. First, the physiological response of the intestine to food ingestion could precipitate symptoms in predisposed individuals; second, there is some evidence that allergy or intolerance to a particular food can produce IBS-like symptoms, third, certain foods may alter the composition of the luminal milieu, either directly or indirectly through effects on bacterial metabolism, and thus induce symptoms and, finally, IBS may develop following exposure to food-borne pathogens. Anticipatory, psychological factors generated by previous negative experiences with food ingestion or other factors may also contribute though their contribution has been scarcely quantified. Not surprisingly, there is considerable interest in the potential roles of diet and food supplements in the therapy of IBS; for the most part, the evidence base for such recommendations remains slim though certain probiotics show considerable promise.},

In the present study, we aimed to compare the patterns of breath hydrogen and methane and symptoms produced in response to diets that differed only in FODMAP content. METHODS: Fifteen healthy subjects and 15 with IBS (Rome III criteria) undertook a single-blind, crossover intervention trial involving consuming provided diets that were either low (9 g/day) or high (50 g/day) in FODMAPs for 2 days. Food and gastrointestinal symptom diaries were kept and breath samples collected hourly over 14 h on day 2 of each diet. RESULTS: Higher levels of breath hydrogen were produced over the entire day with the high FODMAP diet for healthy volunteers (181 +/- 77 ppm.14 h vs 43 +/- 18; mean +/- SD P < 0.0001) and patients with IBS (242 +/- 79 vs 62 +/- 23; P < 0.0001), who had higher levels during each dietary period than the controls (P < 0.05). Breath methane, produced by 10 subjects within each group, was reduced with the high FODMAP intake in healthy subjects (47 +/- 29 vs 109 +/- 77; P = 0.043), but was not different in patients with IBS (126 +/- 153 vs 86 +/- 72). Gastrointestinal symptoms and lethargy were significantly induced by the high FODMAP diet in patients with IBS, while only increased flatus production was reported by healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary FODMAPs induce prolonged hydrogen production in the intestine that is greater in IBS, influence the amount of methane produced, and induce gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms experienced by patients with IBS. The results offer mechanisms underlying the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet in IBS.},

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of pitavastatin (P) therapy on plaque components and morphology in the thoracic aorta by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and clarify the impact of the therapy on media and intima in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Sixty-four media and 64 intima of the thoracic aorta were investigated in 32 patients with hypercholesterolemia. The corrected integrated backscatter (c-IBS) values in the thoracic aortic wall and intima-media thickness (IMT) at the same site were measured before and after P therapy or diet (D) for 7 mo. Moreover, c-IBS values in media were measured in 168 patients without hypercholesterolemia to estimate age-dependent changes. C-IBS values in media were correlated with age (r = 0.84, p < 0.001). C-IBS and IMT of media in the P group significantly decreased from -17.8 +/- 2.4 to -20.1 +/- 3.7 dB and from 1.7 +/- 0.3 to 1.5 +/- 0.3 mm, respectively (p < 0.001), whereas those in the D group significantly increased from -18.3 +/- 2.0 to -16.7 +/- 2.1 dB and from 1.6 +/- 0.3 to 1.7 +/- 0.2 mm, respectively (p < 0.001). IMT in intima in the P group significantly decreased from 3.7 +/- 0.4 to 3.3 +/- 0.4 mm (p < 0.001). C-IBS in intima in the P group significantly increased from -10.2 +/- 2.2 to -6.9 +/- 1.7 dB, which indicated plaque stabilization. Pitavastatin improved the atherosis measured by IMT and sclerosis measured by c-IBS values in the media and induced stabilization and regression of plaques in the intima of the thoracic aorta.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As the use of the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist alosetron (GlaxoSmithKline) and the 5-HT(4) receptor agonist tegaserod (Novartis) in patients with irritable bowel syndrome has been associated with cases of ischaemic colitis, the effects of alosetron, cilansetron (Solvay) and tegaserod on the rat splanchnic circulation were evaluated. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Phenobarbital-anaesthetised rats were instrumented to record blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery and transverse colon and to calculate mesenteric and colonic vascular conductance. KEY RESULTS: Intravenous alosetron (0.03-0.3 mg.kg(-1)) did not alter blood pressure or heart rate but reduced mesenteric blood flow and vascular conductance by 15-20%. This activity profile was also seen after intraduodenal alosetron and shared by the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist cilansetron. In contrast, blood flow, vascular conductance and intraluminal pressure in the colon were not modified by alosetron and cilansetron. Intravenous or intraduodenal tegaserod (0.3-1.0 mg.kg(-1)) had no inhibitory effect on mesenteric and colonic blood flow. Peroral treatment of rats with alosetron or tegaserod for 7 days did not modify mesenteric haemodynamics at baseline and after blockade of nitric oxide synthesis. Mild inflammation induced by dextran sulphate sodium failed to provoke a vasoconstrictor effect of cilansetron in the colon. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Alosetron and cilansetron, not tegaserod, caused a small and transient constriction of the rat mesenteric vascular bed, whereas blood flow in the colon remained unaltered. The relevance of these findings to the treatment-associated occurrence of ischaemic colitis in patients with irritable bowel syndrome remains open.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine quality of life (QOL) and dietary constituents in three subgroups of women with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) based on the severity of their bloating symptoms. A secondary analysis of data from two studies of women with IBS (n = 183), ages 18 to 48, is performed. Measures include the Modified Flanagan Quality of Life Scale and a 3-day food record ( n = 95) and a daily symptom diary completed over a month. There are no differences in QOL and few differences in dietary intake, although women with the most severe bloating report less dietary intake of fructose ( p = .035) as compared with the women with less severe bloating symptoms. The findings suggest that women with IBS who experience moderate to severe bloating symptoms may not reduce their dietary intake except fructose.},

For eight weeks, IBS patients consumed 0.4 L per day of a probiotic fermented milk product or non-probiotic acidified milk. Both diets resulted in elevated levels of blood serum L-lactate and 3-hydroxybutyrate. Our results showed identical effects of acidified milk consumption independent of probiotic addition. A similar result was previously obtained in a questionnaire-based evaluation of symptom relief.

However, there was no correspondence between symptom relief and metabolite response on the patient level.},

People's experience of IBS can fluctuate over time and various bowel symptoms may predominate. Many complementary medicines are used to treat IBS symptoms. Currently there is good evidence to recommend the use of probiotics, peppermint oil capsules and psyllium. Other therapies such as Chinese and Ayuvedic herbs and psychological techniques look promising, but further high quality trials are required before these approaches can be recommended.},

   abstract = {A new era in medical science has dawned with the realization of the critical role of the "forgotten organ", the enteric microbiota, in generating a variety of functions which sustain health and, when disrupted, lead to disease. Central to this beneficial interaction between the microbiota and man is the manner in which the bacteria contained within the gut "talk" to the immune system and, in particular, the immune system that is so widespread within the gut itself, the gut-associated (or mucosa-associated) lymphoid system. Into this landscape come two new players: probiotics and prebiotics. While many products have masqueraded as probiotics, only those which truly and reproducibly contain live organisms and which have been shown, in high quality human studies, to confer a health benefit can actually claim this title. Several human disease states have benefited from the use of probiotics, most notably, diarrheal illnesses, some inflammatory bowel diseases, certain infectious disorders and, most recently, irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics promote the growth of "good" bacteria and, while a variety of health benefits have been attributed to their use, prebiotics have been subjected to few large scale clinical trials.},

   abstract = {There is resurgent interest in the use of probiotics to maintain gastrointestinal and systemic health, driven by recent advances in knowledge of bacterial interactions with the epithelium and innate immune system of the intestine. The effects of probiotic bacteria on the intestinal epithelium and their downstream consequences are reviewed. Probiotics prevent pathogen adherence and invasion of the epithelium, partly by blocking adherence sites but also by upregulating gene expression of MUC2 and of antimicrobial peptides. Metabolic effects of probiotics on the intestinal epithelium include production of short chain fatty acids which influence epithelial cell metabolism, turnover and apoptosis. Bacterial metabolism of unabsorbed dietary constituents with production of free radicals and phenolic metabolites can lead to DNA damage and cancer; probiotics restore eubiosis and potentially prevent this. Probiotics alter expression and redistribution of tight junction proteins and reduce intestinal permeability limiting absorption of noxious molecules from the gut lumen. Most studied are the effects of probiotics on epithelial cells which are the first line of innate immune-capable cells that encounter luminal flora. Probiotics, through secreted molecules, influence the innate inflammatory response of epithelial cells to stimuli from the gut lumen, and reduce mucosal inflammation. Through effects on dendritic, and possibly epithelial, cells they influence naive T cells in the lamina propria of the gut and thus influence adaptive immunity. These varied effects of probiotics have implications for the treatment of several gastrointestinal diseases including antibiotic-associated colitis, acute gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {Increased intestinal permeability is a likely cause of various pathologies, such as allergies and metabolic or even cardiovascular disturbances. Intestinal permeability is found in many severe clinical situations and in common disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. In these conditions, substances that are normally unable to cross the epithelial barrier gain access to the systemic circulation. To illustrate the potential harmfulness of leaky gut, we present an argument based on examples linked to protein or lipid glycation induced by modern food processing. Increased intestinal permeability should be largely improved by dietary addition of compounds, such as glutamine or curcumin, which both have the mechanistic potential to inhibit the inflammation and oxidative stress linked to tight junction opening. This brief review aims to increase physician awareness of this common, albeit largely unrecognized, pathology, which may be easily prevented or improved by means of simple nutritional changes.},

   abstract = {Symptoms consistent with the irritable bowel syndrome are remarkably frequent around the world. Irritable bowel syndrome prevalence ranges from 2.1% to 22%, depending on criteria used. Women are more frequently affected than men, but the reasons remain obscure; irritable bowel syndrome occurs in all age groups but there appears to be a modest decline in prevalence with advancing age again for unknown reasons. The incidence of irritable bowel syndrome per year has been estimated at approximately 1.5% in community subjects; annually only 0.2% of population will be diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. The natural history of irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by symptomatic flare ups and by a high rate of transition to other functional gastrointestinal diseases over the long term. Well recognized risk factors for irritable bowel syndrome include psychological distress and gastroenteritis. However, the association of psychological distress in some cases may reflect confounding factors and might be explained at least in part by cytokine production. Familial aggregation of irritable bowel syndrome occurs, and while the environment is key, twin studies generally support a genetic component in irritable bowel syndrome explaining up to 20% of the variability. Prior surgery may increase risk of irritable bowel syndrome. Early childhood trauma may be important; a low birth weight, nasogastric suction at birth, childhood abuse, and low socioeconomic status may carry an increased risk of suffering with irritable bowel syndrome as an adult. The role of diet remains uncertain but under-studied.},

   abstract = {The different compartments of the gastrointestinal tract are inhabited by populations of micro-organisms. By far the most important predominant populations are in the colon where a true symbiosis with the host exists that is a key for well-being and health. For such a microbiota, 'normobiosis' characterises a composition of the gut 'ecosystem' in which micro-organisms with potential health benefits predominate in number over potentially harmful ones, in contrast to 'dysbiosis', in which one or a few potentially harmful micro-organisms are dominant, thus creating a disease-prone situation. The present document has been written by a group of both academic and industry experts (in the ILSI Europe Prebiotic Expert Group and Prebiotic Task Force, respectively). It does not aim to propose a new definition of a prebiotic nor to identify which food products are classified as prebiotic but rather to validate and expand the original idea of the prebiotic concept (that can be translated in 'prebiotic effects'), defined as: 'The selective stimulation of growth and/or activity(ies) of one or a limited number of microbial genus(era)/species in the gut microbiota that confer(s) health benefits to the host.' Thanks to the methodological and fundamental research of microbiologists, immense progress has very recently been made in our understanding of the gut microbiota. A large number of human intervention studies have been performed that have demonstrated that dietary consumption of certain food products can result in statistically significant changes in the composition of the gut microbiota in line with the prebiotic concept. Thus the prebiotic effect is now a well-established scientific fact. The more data are accumulating, the more it will be recognised that such changes in the microbiota's composition, especially increase in bifidobacteria, can be regarded as a marker of intestinal health. The review is divided in chapters that cover the major areas of nutrition research where a prebiotic effect has tentatively been investigated for potential health benefits. The prebiotic effect has been shown to associate with modulation of biomarkers and activity(ies) of the immune system. Confirming the studies in adults, it has been demonstrated that, in infant nutrition, the prebiotic effect includes a significant change of gut microbiota composition, especially an increase of faecal concentrations of bifidobacteria. This concomitantly improves stool quality (pH, SCFA, frequency and consistency), reduces the risk of gastroenteritis and infections, improves general well-being and reduces the incidence of allergic symptoms such as atopic eczema. Changes in the gut microbiota composition are classically considered as one of the many factors involved in the pathogenesis of either inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. The use of particular food products with a prebiotic effect has thus been tested in clinical trials with the objective to improve the clinical activity and well-being of patients with such disorders. Promising beneficial effects have been demonstrated in some preliminary studies, including changes in gut microbiota composition (especially increase in bifidobacteria concentration). Often associated with toxic load and/or miscellaneous risk factors, colon cancer is another pathology for which a possible role of gut microbiota composition has been hypothesised. Numerous experimental studies have reported reduction in incidence of tumours and cancers after feeding specific food products with a prebiotic effect. Some of these studies (including one human trial) have also reported that, in such conditions, gut microbiota composition was modified (especially due to increased concentration of bifidobacteria). Dietary intake of particular food products with a prebiotic effect has been shown, especially in adolescents, but also tentatively in postmenopausal women, to increase Ca absorption as well as bone Ca accretion and bone mineral density. Recent data, both from experimental models and from human studies, support the beneficial effects of particular food products with prebiotic properties on energy homaeostasis, satiety regulation and body weight gain. Together, with data in obese animals and patients, these studies support the hypothesis that gut microbiota composition (especially the number of bifidobacteria) may contribute to modulate metabolic processes associated with syndrome X, especially obesity and diabetes type 2. It is plausible, even though not exclusive, that these effects are linked to the microbiota-induced changes and it is feasible to conclude that their mechanisms fit into the prebiotic effect. However, the role of such changes in these health benefits remains to be definitively proven. As a result of the research activity that followed the publication of the prebiotic concept 15 years ago, it has become clear that products that cause a selective modification in the gut microbiota's composition and/or activity(ies) and thus strengthens normobiosis could either induce beneficial physiological effects in the colon and also in extra-intestinal compartments or contribute towards reducing the risk of dysbiosis and associated intestinal and systemic pathologies.},

There was general agreement that probiotic effects were species and often strain specific. The experts agreed that some probiotics were effective in reducing the incidence and duration of rotavirus diarrhoea in infants, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in adults and, for certain probiotics, Clostridium difficile infections. Some probiotics are associated with symptomatic improvements in irritable bowel syndrome and alleviation of digestive discomfort. Probiotics can reduce the frequency and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants and have been shown to regulate intestinal immunity. Several other clinical effects of probiotics, including their role in inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, respiratory or genito-urinary infections or H.pylori adjuvant treatment were thought promising but inconsistent.},

This paper will address the decision-making process used by these women when contemplating the consumption of dietary temptations, despite the associated negative consequences. This phenomenological study was guided by heuristic inquiry. A purposive sample of eight women, between the ages of 18 and 23 years, who were living with IBD or IBS were recruited via postings and word-of-mouth. The findings indicate that these women occasionally felt compelled to give into dietary temptations, despite the consequences to their health. The decision-making process they used when considering these negative health behaviours involved three personally controlled parameters. These three parameters included: assessing the cost-benefit relationship before engaging in these behaviours; having a physical and/or psychological reliance on medications to treat resulting symptoms; and through controlling the timing and surroundings in which they indulged in these negative dietary behaviours. The practical implications for health-care professionals treating patients with IBD or IBS are discussed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence supporting selected complementary and alternative medicine approaches used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January 1980), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched until March 2008, combining the terms irritable bowel syndrome or irritable colon with complementary therapies, alternative medicine, acupuncture, fiber, peppermint oil, herbal, traditional, yoga, massage, meditation, mind, relaxation, probiotic, hypnotherapy, psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, or behavior therapy. Results were screened to include only clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Level I evidence was available for most interventions. MAIN MESSAGE: Soluble fibre improves constipation and global IBS symptoms. Peppermint oil alleviates IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain. Probiotic trials show overall benefit for IBS but there is little evidence supporting the use of any specific strain. Hypnotherapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy are also effective therapeutic options for appropriate patients. Certain herbal formulas are supported by limited evidence, but safety is a potential concern. All interventions are supported by systematic reviews or meta-analyses. CONCLUSION: Several complementary and alternative therapies can be recommended as part of an evidence-based approach to the treatment of IBS; these might provide patients with satisfactory relief and improve the therapeutic alliance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut microflora-mucosal interactions may be involved in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: To investigate the efficacy of a novel prebiotic trans-galactooligosaccharide in changing the colonic microflora and improve the symptoms in IBS sufferers. METHODS: In all, 44 patients with Rome II positive IBS completed a 12-week single centre parallel crossover controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive either 3.5 g/d prebiotic, 7 g/d prebiotic or 7 g/d placebo. IBS symptoms were monitored weekly and scored according to a 7-point Likert scale. Changes in faecal microflora, stool frequency and form (Bristol stool scale) subjective global assessment (SGA), anxiety and depression and QOL scores were also monitored. RESULTS: The prebiotic significantly enhanced faecal bifidobacteria (3.5 g/d P < 0.005; 7 g/d P < 0.001). Placebo was without effect on the clinical parameters monitored, while the prebiotic at 3.5 g/d significantly changed stool consistency (P < 0.05), improved flatulence (P < 0.05) bloating (P < 0.05), composite score of symptoms (P < 0.05) and SGA (P < 0.05). The prebiotic at 7 g/d significantly improved SGA (P < 0.05) and anxiety scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The galactooligosaccharide acted as a prebiotic in specifically stimulating gut bifidobacteria in IBS patients and is effective in alleviating symptoms. These findings suggest that the prebiotic has potential as a therapeutic agent in IBS.},

METHODS: We randomized 74 IBS patients to receive 8 weeks of daily treatment with 400 mL milk fermented with the yoghurt bacteria and containing Lactobacillus paracasei, ssp. paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 (Cultura; active) or acidified milk without these bacteria (control). The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects reporting adequate relief of their IBS symptoms at least 50% of the weeks. IBS symptom severity, psychological symptoms and quality of life were assessed. RESULTS: The proportion of responders was 38% (14/37 patients) in the active group and 27% (10/37 patients) in the control group (P = 0.3). IBS symptom severity improved significantly in both groups during the treatment period. This change was greater in the active group during the first 2 weeks, but thereafter, no significant group differences were seen. CONCLUSIONS: We could not detect a clearly positive effect of fermented milk containing three probiotic bacteria on GI symptoms in IBS patients compared with the control treatment. However, a trend towards a more favourable effect during the first weeks was seen in the active group.},

This study explored ghrelin and motilin concentrations in plasma in relation to gastrointestinal motility and whether plasma ghrelin is changed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Nine patients with severe IBS and 10 healthy subjects underwent stationary antro-duodeni-jejunal manometry; blood was sampled during similar motility phases in the two groups. The motility phases were monitored and blood samples were collected during fasting and after food intake. Plasma was analyzed for two forms of ghrelin (octanylated and desoctanylated) as well as for motilin. In IBS patients circulating motilin levels covaried with total ghrelin levels (r=0.90; p<0.004), octanylated ghrelin (r=0.77; p<0.02) and desoctanylated ghrelin (r=0.69; p<0.04). No such correlations were seen in the control group. Octanylated ghrelin comprised 35.3+/-3.9% (mean+/-SEM) of the total circulating ghrelin in the IBS patients compared to 40.4+/-4.5% (mean+/-SEM) in the control group (NS). Ghrelin covaried with motilin in plasma in IBS but not in plasma from healthy subjects. This suggests the two peptides act together in IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders, with a strong female predominance. When compared to the vast knowledge pertaining to adults with IBS, very little is known about IBS in the adolescent population. In Korea, the field of adolescent health with IBS is just beginning to develop, so there is still a lack of information concerning the prevalence of IBS in adolescent groups. OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to explore the prevalence of IBS among Korean adolescent girls, and identify the risk factors affecting IBS occurrence. DESIGN: This study adopted a cross-sectional descriptive design using the self-reported questionnaire. METHODS: A total of 405 adolescent females were recruited from 5 academic high schools in Korea in August and September of 2007. IBS was diagnosed based on the Rome II criteria. For the evaluation of risk factors on the IBS, we investigated dietary habit, life style, stress, anxiety, depression, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS). RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS according to Rome II criteria was 25.7% in the subjects. The multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that higher stress (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.13-4.48), anxiety (OR 4.27, 95% CI 1.09-16.71), and depression (OR 10.87, 95% CI 1.14-103.81) were independently associated with increased IBS occurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IBS in female adolescent students from this study was higher compared with those reported in the Western countries. This study provides much need information about the relatively unstudied Korean female adolescents in terms of IBS issues and aspects of psychological attributes to IBS. This study has the potential to influence the development of better promotion programs for adolescents and women's health.},

One hundred sixty-five individuals diagnosed with AS were invited to complete a self-administered postal questionnaire regarding demographic data, diet, medication, and gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to two established disease assessment questionnaires, i.e., the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). No significant correlation between diet and disease activity was found. Overall, 27% of the patients reported aggravating gastrointestinal problems when consuming certain foodstuff(s). The 30% of patients who reported suffering from gastrointestinal pain had significantly greater disease activity and poorer functional status according to their BASDAI and BASFI scores (p < 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively). Patients who reported gastrointestinal pain had a significantly higher consumption of vegetables (p < 0.01) and lower consumption of milk and soured milk (p = 0.04). No significant correlation was found between the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and gastrointestinal symptoms. In multiple regression models, BASDAI and the consumption of vegetables were independent and statistically significant predictors of gastrointestinal pain. To conclude, in a group of Swedish AS patients, no correlation between diet and disease activity could be detected. There were, however, correlations between diet and gastrointestinal pain. Gastrointestinal problems were also found to be prevalent in AS, independent of NSAID usage.},

   abstract = {Lubiprostone, a bicyclic fatty acid chloride channel activator, is efficacious in treatment of chronic constipation and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The study aim was to compare effects of lubiprostone and placebo on colonic sensory and motor functions in humans. In double-blind, randomized fashion, 60 healthy adults received three oral doses of placebo or 24 microg lubiprostone per day in a parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. A barostat-manometry tube was placed in the left colon by flexible sigmoidoscopy and fluoroscopy. We measured treatment effects on colonic sensation and motility with validated methods, with the following end points: colonic compliance, fasting and postprandial tone and motility indexes, pain thresholds, and sensory ratings to distensions. Among participants receiving lubiprostone or placebo, 26 of 30 and 28 of 30, respectively, completed the study. There were no overall effects of lubiprostone on compliance, fasting tone, motility indexes, or sensation. However, there was a treatment-by-sex interaction effect for compliance (P = 0.02), with lubiprostone inducing decreased fasting compliance in women (P = 0.06) and an overall decreased colonic tone contraction after a standard meal relative to fasting tone (P = 0.014), with greater effect in women (P < 0.01). Numerical differences of first sensation and pain thresholds (P = 0.11 in women) in the two groups were not significant. We concluded that oral lubiprostone 24 microg does not increase colonic motor function. The findings of decreased colonic compliance and decreased postprandial colonic tone in women suggest that motor effects are unlikely to cause accelerated colonic transit with lubiprostone, although they may facilitate laxation. Effects of lubiprostone on sensitivity deserve further study.},

   abstract = {This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and 1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants. Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.},

   abstract = {Probiotics as dietary supplements have been readily accepted by Asian populations. Use of certain probiotic preparations is widespread and the number of clinical trials undertaken with such products is unparalleled in western scientific literature. One such preparation, containing a combination of Enterococcus faecium R0026 and Bacillus subtilis R0179, has 23 publications on post-market clinical studies involving over 1,800 adults. The majority of these publications are printed in Chinese and Korean journals. This review examines the clinical findings with this probiotic combination. As mono-therapy, it has been used to overcome symptoms associated with chronic diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome. It has been used as co-adjuvant therapy with sulfasalazine and mesalazine to improve remission times in mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis and to improve compliance with conventional triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication. While the much of the data is preliminary and the study designs require refinement, the contribution of these trials should not be ignored. The information derived in this review will provide practitioners with practical information on appropriate applications for probiotic supplements, expected outcomes, dosing regimes, safety and reported adverse events. Furthermore, identification of problems in these trials should help researchers design better clinical trials when investigating probiotic products.},

   abstract = {WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The complexity and diversity of irritable bowel syndrome's (IBS) presentation make treatment difficult. Although there are reviews and guidelines for treating IBS, they focus on the efficacy of medications for IBS symptoms using high-priority endpoints, leaving those of lower priority largely unreported. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive evidence-based review of the efficacy of medications to treat IBS symptoms, reported by IBS subtype, including secondary symptom endpoints that are often underreported. METHODS: A review of PubMed for articles published through December 2009 using the keywords: 'irritable bowel syndrome', 'therapeutics', 'antidiarrhoeals', 'laxatives', 'loperamide', 'dietary fibre', 'psyllium', 'calcium polycarbophil', 'bulking agents', 'lubiprostone', 'antidepressant agents, tricyclics' and its representative entities, 'serotonin reuptake inhibitors' and its representative entities, 'dicyclomine', hyoscyamine', 'peppermint oil', 'parasympatholytics' and its representative entities, 'rifaximin', 'pregabalin', 'gabapentin', 'clonidine', 'octreotide', 'atropine' and 'probiotics' is provided. Placebo-controlled trials were evaluated for the strength of evidence supporting the efficacy of each medication for explicit IBS symptoms. The efficacy of each medication for the symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, stool form, mucus, urgency, feeling of incomplete evacuation, flatulence, frequency, or borborgymi and overall symptoms are reported by IBS subtype. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature search identified 58 placebo-controlled trials of the efficacy of medications for treating IBS symptoms, which were critically evaluated and reported. The available studies suggest improvement in various IBS symptoms with loperamide, fibre supplements, lubiprostone, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs), antispasmotics, rifaximin, pregabalin, gabapentin, clonidine, octreotide and probiotic treatments. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This review is the first to compile the available evidence on the efficacy of the various pharmacological treatments for IBS on the basis of IBS subtype and specific symptoms. This evidence is limited and more well-designed studies are required to better inform therapeutic decision-making in the management of this difficult syndrome.},

   abstract = {The repertoire of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms is finite; however, the etiologies and mechanisms underlying symptom generation and perception are diverse and, in many cases, unknown. This review examines the clinical and experimental evidence exploring the putative relationship between gluten sensitivity (GS) and the generation of GI symptoms. It explores the hypothesis that, in a proportion of patients, GS causes functional bowel disorder (FBD)-like symptoms. We propose a model for investigating and understanding the induction of GI symptoms and dysfunction by gluten in FBD and organic disease. We hypothesize that, even in the absence of fully developed celiac disease, gluten can induce symptoms similar to FBD. We discuss the hypothesis that GS and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) provide two triggers that can explain at least part of the spectrum that constitutes IBS, further advancing an understanding of the role of mucosal responses to luminal factors in FBDs. We propose that the animal model of GS in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)- DQ8 mice allows investigation of mucosal pathophysiological changes that occur before the onset of full-blown inflammation in a GS host. A better understanding of how gluten can cause symptoms in sensitive individuals will illuminate the interaction between host genotype, diet, and intestinal microbiota in generating one of the most common GI conditions.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of articles published on the theme based on a Medline (PubMed) search and consensus conferences selected according to their scientific relevance. RESULTS: IBS is very common. Patients report abdominal pain and/or discomfort, bloating, and abnormal bowel habit (diarrhoea, constipation or both), in the absence of any structural or biochemical abnormalities. IBS has a complex, multifactorial pathophysiology, involving biological and psychosocial interactions resulting in dysregulation of the brain-gut axis associated with disorders of intestinal motility, hyperalgesia, immune disorders and disorders of the intestinal bacterial microflora and autonomic and hormonal dysfunction. Many treatments have been proposed, ranging from diet to pharmacology and psychotherapy. DISCUSSION: Patients with various types of chronic pelvic and perineal pain, especially those seen in urology departments, very often report associated IBS. This syndrome is also part of a global and integrated concept of pelviperineal dysfunction, avoiding a rigorous distinction between the posterior segment and the midline and anterior segments of the perineum.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recurrent, watery diarrhoea affects one-third of patients diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome ('IBS-D'). Idiopathic bile acid malabsorption ('I-BAM') may be the cause. AIM: To determine the prevalence of I-BAM in patients suffering from IBS-D. METHODS: A systematic search was performed of publications reporting patients presenting with IBS-D type symptoms, who were subsequently confirmed as having I-BAM by SeHCAT scanning. RESULTS: Eighteen relevant studies, 15 prospective, comprising 1223 patients were identified. Five studies (429 patients) indicated that 10% (CI: 7-13) patients had severe bile acid malabsorption (SeHCAT 7 day retention <5% of baseline value). 17 studies (1073 patients) indicated that 32% (CI: 29-35) patients had moderate bile acid malabsorption (SeHCAT <10%). 7 studies (618 patients) indicated that 26% (CI: 23-30) patients had mild (SeHCAT <15%) bile acid malabsorption. Pooled data from 15 studies showed a dose-response relationship according to severity of malabsorption to treatment with a bile acid binder: response to colestyramine occurred in 96% of patients with <5% retention, 80% at <10% retention and 70% at <15% retention. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic adult-onset bile acid malabsorption is not rare. International guidelines for the management of irritable bowel syndrome need to be revised so that clinicians become more aware of this possibility.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains unsatisfactory. There are no objective markers for diagnosis, and classification (currently based on symptoms) provides little insight into potential causes or optimal therapy. The aim of this study was to determine whether a Swedish classification of IBS based on cluster analysis of patients' symptoms might provide a guide to successful treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients in a research clinic for IBS were classified according to criteria published by Ragnarsson & Bodemar (R&B) and also assessed independently by a clinician. Patients fulfilling the R&B criteria for subgroups 1 and 2 received specific treatments, either bulk laxatives or dietary treatment to reduce colonic fermentation, respectively. Patients who did not fit into these categories were given "best treatment" targeted at their predominant symptoms, but not limited in any way. Results before and after follow-up were assessed using a validated symptom-scoring scale. RESULTS: Seventy-one successive patients were recruited, and the numbers falling into R&B subgroups 1 and 2 were 15 (21%), and 28 (39%), respectively, leaving 28 (39%) unclassified. Receiver operating characteristic plots showed that the criteria for separation into subgroups 1 and 2 correlated well with the clinician's assessment. After treatment, symptom scores for the whole group showed a significant improvement (p<0.0001), but results were significantly better in subgroups 1 and 2 than in those unclassified, even when allowance was made for a potential therapeutic placebo effect of 40%. CONCLUSION: The R&B classification provides a helpful guide to treatment in many cases of IBS.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The pharmacology, uses, dosages, safety, drug interactions, and contraindications of probiotics are reviewed. SUMMARY: Probiotics are live nonpathogenic microorganisms administered to improve microbial balance, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. They consist of Saccharomyces boulardii yeast or lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, and are regulated as dietary supplements and foods. Probiotics exert their beneficial effects through various mechanisms, including lowering intestinal pH, decreasing colonization and invasion by pathogenic organisms, and modifying the host immune response. Probiotic benefits associated with one species or strain do not necessarily hold true for others. The strongest evidence for the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in the treatment of acute diarrhea, most commonly due to rotavirus, and pouchitis. More research is needed to clarify the role of probiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, travelers' diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and vulvovaginal candidiasis. There is no consensus about the minimum number of microorganisms that must be ingested to obtain a beneficial effect; however, a probiotic should typically contain several billion microorganisms to increase the chance that adequate gut colonization will occur. Probiotics are generally considered safe and well tolerated, with bloating and flatulence occurring most frequently. They should be used cautiously in patients who are critically ill or severely immunocompromised or those with central venous catheters since systemic infections may rarely occur. Bacteria-derived probiotics should be separated from antibiotics by at least two hours. CONCLUSION: Probiotics have demonstrated efficacy in preventing and treating various medical conditions, particularly those involving the gastrointestinal tract. Data supporting their role in other conditions are often conflicting.},

   abstract = {Melatonin (MT) exerts a beneficial action in the treatment of many diseases, among them also in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Its secretion decreases with age, particularly, in the postmenopausal period in women. It has not been determined whether these changes can have an impact on the clinical picture of IBS. The study aimed at evaluating the urinary excretion of the main MT metabolite - 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate (6-HMS) in women at different age with IBS. The investigations were carried out in five groups of 30 women each. Group Ia (the controls) - premenopausal healthy women (20-39 years), group Ib (the controls) - postmenopausal healthy women (46-66 years), group II - women with constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C; 19-42 years), group III - women with diarrhoea predominant IBS (IBS-D; 20-39 years), group IV - women with IBS-C (49-68 years), group V - women with IBS-D (48-69 years). The diagnosis of IBS was based on the Rome III Criteria after excluding other diseases. On the day of the study the patients remained on the same liquid diet (Nutridrink - 3x400 ml) and 1500 ml of still mineral water. 6-HMS concentration in urine was measured by ELISA method applying IBL antibodies (RE-54031, Immunological Laboratories). The results showed that 24-hour urinary 6-HMS excretion in the studied premenopausal women were as follows: group Ia - 15.13+/-5.83 microg/24 h, group II - 28.85+/-12.59 microg/24 h (p<0,01), group III - 26.10+/-11.76 microg/24 h (p<0,01) and in the postmenopausal subjects they were: group Ib - 10.66+/-3.23 microg/24 h, group IV - 13.73+/-5.09 microg/24 h ((p=0,02), group V - 21.39+/-10.88 microg/24 h (p<0,01). In women with IBS-C the obtained results of 24-hour 6-HMS urinary excretion were independent on the intensity of clinical symptoms. On the other hand, in women with IBS-D, both in the group III and V, higher intensity of ailments was accompanied by significantly increased 6-HMS urinary excretion. The results of the study allowed drawing the following conclusions: (1). 24-hour 6-HMS urinary excretion in women with the constipation-predominant (IBS-C) as well as the diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) is higher than in healthy persons both in the premenopausal and postmenopausal period. (2). Relatively high 6-HMS urinary excretion in postmenopausal women with IBS-D indicates an adaptive increase in MT secretion from EC in the gut.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: no systematic studies on the prevalence of coeliac disease (CD) have been reported from China. In western populations CD is more common in patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). We have screened patients with these conditions presenting to the outpatient department of a large hospital of "Traditional Chinese Medicine" (TCM) in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, P.R. China. METHODS: we tested sera of 78 unrelated Han Chinese patients (5 IDDM and 73 D-IBS), using ELISA serological tests for IgG anti-gliadin antibodies (IgG-AGA) and IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA-tTG). RESULTS: six out of 78 patients (7.7%) were positive for IgG-AGA (two men and four women) and two (2.6%) were positive for IgA-tTGs. One of the latter patients was negative for IgG-AGA. Besides, one patient had a dubious IgA-tTG antibody and a positive IgG-AGA. None of the six patients agreed to undergo duodenal biopsy. Two out of these six patients followed a gluten-free diet for one year. In one patient the diarrhoea ceased and his body weight increased. Another stopped losing weight. CONCLUSIONS: this study previously published as a letter in GUT (Wu J, Xia B, von Blomberg BME, Zhao C, Yang XW, Crusius JBA, Pena AS. Coeliac disease: emerging in China? Gut 2010; 59(3): 418-9) demonstrated that CD may exist in the Jiangsu province of P.R. China. The present article draws attention to the difficulties of following a standard protocol in China such as established in western countries and highlights important factors less well known in the west in relation to the development of CD in China. Wheat production became significant in China between 1600 and 1300 B.C. After the Han dynasty (500-200 B.C.), wheat was one of the main cereals in China. One the major wheat fields in China is located in the Jiangsu province where the research for this article was performed. A review of Chinese literature shows that the predominant HLA-DQ CD risk alleles and haplotypes are present in the Jiangsu province. Genetic background, food consumption, and the results of our study suggest that CD should actively be investigated in P.R. China.},

   abstract = {The term "food allergy" is widely misused for all sorts of symptoms and diseases caused by food. Food allergy (FA) is an adverse reaction to food (food hypersensitivity) occurring in susceptible individuals, which is mediated by a classical immune mechanism specific for the food itself. The best established mechanism in FA is due to the presence of IgE antibodies against the offending food. Food intolerance (FI) are all non-immune-mediated adverse reactions to food. The subgroups of FI are enzymatic (e.g. lactose intolerance due to lactase deficiency), pharmacological (reactions against biogenic amines, histamine intolerance), and undefined food intolerance (e.g. against some food additives). The diagnosis of an IgE-mediated FA is made by a carefully taken case history, supported by the demonstration of an IgE sensitization either by skin prick tests or by in vitro tests, and confirmed by positive oral provocation. For scientific purposes the only accepted test for the confirmation of FA/FI is a properly performed double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). A panel of recombinant allergens, produced as single allergenic molecules, may in future improve the diagnosis of IgE-mediated FA. Due to a lack of causal treatment possibilities, the elimination of the culprit "food allergen" from the diet is the only therapeutic option for patients with real food allergy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Instability of carotid plaques has been reported to be associated with stroke and other cerebrovascular events. The purpose of this study was to examine whether cholesterol-lowering therapy with atorvastatin in nonhypercholesterolemic patients reduces carotid plaque instability as assessed by ultrasound integrated backscatter (IBS) analysis. METHODS: Consecutive non- or slightly hypercholesterolemic patients with moderate carotid artery stenosis were randomly assigned to a diet group (n = 20) or a statin group (atorvastatin; n = 20). Carotid plaques were monitored by measuring intima media thickness (IMT) and IBS values at baseline and after 6 months. RESULTS: Three-dimensional IBS imaging showed that relative lipid volume of carotid plaques significantly decreased from 58.4 +/- 25.6 to 47.8 +/- 23.5% in the statin group (p < 0.01), whereas there was no significant decrease in the diet group. Significant regression of IMT was not observed in either group. The changes of IBS values and relative lipid volume between baseline and 6 months were correlated with the change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.31, p < 0.05, and r = 0.34, p < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Lipid-lowering therapy by atorvastatin decreased relative lipid volume without significant regression of plaque volume during short-term follow-up in patients with moderate carotid artery stenosis. Quantitative assessment of carotid plaques by IBS analysis was clinically useful for monitoring atherosclerotic lesions.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is increasingly recognized autoimmune enteropathy caused by a permanent gluten intolerance. Gluten is the main storage protein of wheat, in genetically predisposed individuals. Celiac disease risk in first degree relatives is about 10%. Diarrhea and changes of bowel movement, observed as well in celiac disease as in IBS, may lead to misdiagnosis of IBS basing on the Rome criteria or may be associated with coexistence of both diseases. The aim of the study was to assess the celiac disease prevalence in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The study group comprised 200 patients (120 women and 80 men) aged 18-78 years (mean: 46.7 years) with diarrhoeal form of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), according to the Rome criteria II. At the beginning and after a three month period anti tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA tTG) were estimated. Gastroscopy with biopsy where performed in those with IgA tTG titre above 1/200. 40 patients were immunologically positive and 14 of them have histopathologically proven celiac disease. In the group of patients with detected celiac disease, gluten free diet was applied besides the treatment with trimebutin or mebewerin, recommended for IBS. After 6 months the decrease of IgA tTG titre in the serum was observed. In 5 of these patients IgA tTG level was negative. It was associated with the significant decrease of clinical symptoms, such as diarrhea and flatulence. The remaining symptoms, such as abdominal pain, feeling of incomplete defecation demanded continuation of IBS treatment. With regard to often atypical celiac disease symptoms--adult active searching should be performed to differentiate from irritable bowel syndrome.},
