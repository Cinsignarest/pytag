   abstract = {A cross-sectional study was carried out to explore the effect of the Ramadan fast on daily practices (life events, diet and smoking), health and performance of 265 university students. Analysis showed that more people got involved in stress reducing (watching TV, listening to the radio and visiting) and spiritual activities (prayers and reading Kotan) during this month. They drank less caffeine-containing beverages and smoked less. Food intake appeared to improve during Ramadan with higher proportions eating foods from all food groups. The amount of foods did not differ significantly except in the case of foods from the cereal, meat and vegetable groups. Even though less, cereal consumption was still in the adequate range. Change in weight was variable. Weight loss was significantly more among the sick. A large proportion of the latter improved during the month especially those with irritable bowel syndrome and constipation. Reduced activity, study desire and concentration ability were reported by more than 50% of subjects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disease in the general population. Evaluation of IBS symptoms does not cover all the complaints of patients who report restrictions to social life, the need to diet and psychosocial repercussions. Quality of life (QOL) measurement permits a precise approach to patient status. METHODS: The generic QOL questionnaires SF 36 and two validated specific QOL questionnaires--IBSQOL and Functional Digestive Disorders FDDQL--have been used for the evaluation of IBS patient outcome. IBSQOL measures 9 domains and its reliability and validity have been demonstrated. FDDQL measures 8 domains, an international psychometric validation was obtained in French, English and German by comparison with the SF36. The discriminant validity and responsiveness of the FDDQL have been evaluated. RESULTS: Generic QOL evaluation and specific questionnaires like the FDDQL were able to measure changes in IBS patient status and QOL during several clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Specific QOL questionnaires have been validated in IBS patients and are available for controlled studies. Development of effective new drugs are needed for IBS treatment, complete and precise evaluation of outcome will involve QOL analysis in association with specific validated questionnaires.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The degree to which patient education in the areas of diet, exercise, and stress management can improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) through healthier lifestyle behaviors is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of outpatient education on the short and long term outcomes, and the association between health-promoting behaviors and symptoms. METHODS: Pender's Health Promotion Model provided the theoretical framework. The study had a prospective longitudinal design. A consecutive sample of 52 adult outpatients with IBS attended a structured class that taught health-promoting modifications of lifestyle. Participants completed the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP) and selected items from a Bowel Disease Questionnaire (BDQ) before the class and 1 month and 6 months later. Spearman rank correlations were used to assess the association between HPLP and symptom scores. Wilcoxon rank sum tests compared changes in scores versus their baseline values. RESULTS: Response rates at 1 and 6 months were 75% and 83%, respectively. Results revealed significant 1- and 6 month-improvements in pain and Manning symptoms (p < 0.01) and in some HPLP scores (exercise at 1 month, p < 0.05; stress management at 6 months, p < 0.01). Significant associations were found between some, but not all, HPLP and symptom scores over time. CONCLUSION: A structured IBS educational class for patients with IBS improved symptoms and some health-promoting behaviors. However, relationships among specific behaviors and specific symptoms did not consistently correspond with this improvement.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The pathophysiology underlying chronic constipation in older people is poorly understood. Our objective was to determine if functional bowel disease (particularly constipation) in this population is associated with risk factors (age, immobility, low dietary fiber intake, and medication use) or directly with slow colonic transit. METHODS: A previously validated questionnaire was administered to a random sample of older residents (age range 65-104 years, n = 1609) of Olmsted County, MN. A random subset who met standard diagnostic criteria for functional constipation (n = 52) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (n = 55) and a group without gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 93) were selected for further study. Each subject underwent structured interview and physical examination. Total caloric and fiber intake were assessed by dietitian interview, a food frequency questionnaire, and a food diary. Physical activity was assessed using a previously validated instrument. Medication use was determined by self-report, physician interview, and review of medical records. Total and segmental colonic transit was assessed radiographically using radioopaque markers. RESULTS: Total colonic transit times were prolonged in subjects with functional constipation (median 50.4 hours) but not in subjects with IBS (median 34.2 hours) or in healthy controls (median 28.8 hours); however, only rectosigmoid transit was delayed significantly. Age, gender, physical activity, and dietary fiber intake were not associated with total transit times, nor could they discriminate among the three patient groups. Laxative use was associated with prolonged total transit times independent of patient group. CONCLUSIONS: Older subjects can be classified by abdominal pain and bowel symptoms, which reflect colonic transit times. Older subjects with constipation symptoms generally have prolonged rectosigmoid transit. Other potential risk factors do not distinguish symptom subgroups, nor are they associated with altered colonic transit although older people who use laxatives regularly have prolonged colonic transit.},

   abstract = {Alterations in both gastric emptying (GE) and small bowel motility have been reported in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); the relationship, however, between these different measures of upper gut motor function in IBS has not been assessed. The aims of this study were therefore: (1) to compare the prevalence and characteristics of altered small bowel motility in IBS patients with and without delayed GE; and (2) to assess the interrelationships between fasting and postprandial small bowel motility in IBS, accounting for delayed GE. Forty-four IBS patients and 25 healthy controls underwent 24 hr ambulant recording of interdigestive and digestive small bowel motility. On a separate occasion the IBS patients had GE of both solids and liquids measured by a dual-isotope scintigraphic technique. Thirty-nine percent of IBS patients had delayed GE. Patients with normal GE had no interdigestive small bowel abnormalities. However, in patients with delayed GE fasting phase II burst frequency was higher than in controls [median 0.21/hr (IQR 0.15-0.34) vs 0.06/hr (0-0,16), P = 0.004]. Postprandially, abnormal phase III-like activity was higher in diarrhea-predominant IBS patients (0-0.08/hr vs 0/hr, P = 0.01), than in patients with normal GE or controls. Furthermore, IBS patients with delayed GE did not have the normal correlation between fasting and postprandial motor parameters (percentage occurrence of clustered contractions, postprandial pattern duration vs preceding MMC cycle length). In conclusion, small bowel motor dysfunction occurs more frequently in IBS patients with concomitant gastroparesis than in patients with normal GE. These findings provide further evidence that a neuropathic process may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBS in a subgroup of IBS patients.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) continues to provide a major therapeutic challenge to clinicians and those involved in drug development. It seems unlikely from the data before us that this multisymptom syndrome with peripheral and central components is likely to respond reliably in all patients to the same single agent. There is still a lack of well designed, appropriately powered, randomised clinical trials and the problems of dealing with the high placebo response rate in this group of patients remains a dilemma for trial designers. There are, however, some new ideas, particularly those relating to the role of hyperalgesia in IBS. For many patients, abdominal pain and bloating are the most distressing symptoms of this disease and the new drugs targeted at pain control, such as kappa agonists and serotonin antagonists (5-HT3) and possibly 5-HT4), may eventually find a place in the clinical management of this syndrome. Other candidates include somatostatin analogues and antidepressants, the latter predominantly for their effects on increasing pain threshold. More speculative new drugs for IBS include cholecystokinin antagonists such as loxiglumide and the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue, leuprorelin (leuprolide). The results of on-going randomised clinical trials are still awaited for some of these newer agents. The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common gastrointestinal condition encountered by general practitioners and is reported to account for up to 50% of the work of gastroenterologists in secondary care. However, most people with the symptoms of IBS (60 to 75%) do not consult a doctor. Its cause is unknown, its development is poorly understand and, perhaps not surprisingly, no universally agreed approach to treatment exists.},

There have been no studies of the prevalence or causes of chronic diarrhea in these patients after treatment with a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with celiac sprue (59 women and 19 men) treated with a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months were surveyed about their bowel habits. Those with chronic diarrhea, defined as passage of loose stools three or more times per week for 6 months, underwent an extensive diagnostic evaluation to determine its cause. RESULTS: Sixty-two of the 78 patients (79%) experienced diarrhea before treatment, and 13 (17%) had chronic diarrhea (of lesser severity) after treatment. The causes of diarrhea in 11 patients consenting to this study were microscopic colitis, steatorrhea secondary to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, dietary lactose or fructose malabsorption, anal sphincter dysfunction causing fecal incontinence, and the irritable bowel syndrome. Only 1 patient had antigliadin antibodies detected in serum or small intestinal villous atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: After treatment of celiac sprue with a gluten-free diet, chronic diarrhea persists in a substantial percentage of patients. Although ongoing gluten ingestion is one possible cause, other causes may be more frequent. Therefore, diagnostic investigation of diarrhea in celiac sprue after treatment seems warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We describe the development and evaluation of a new disease-specific instrument, the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBSQOL), which was designed for use in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The IBSQOL measures 10 domains found to be relevant to patients with irritable bowel syndrome: emotional health, mental health, health belief, sleep, energy, physical functioning, diet, social role, physical role, and sexual relations. METHODS: During its development and evaluation, the IBSQOL was administered to over 500 patients with irritable bowel syndrome--two groups of patients from tertiary care centres, three focus groups of 8-12 patients each, and 287 patients in a national irritable bowel syndrome support network. As a control, the IBSQOL was also administered to 37 patients who did not have irritable bowel syndrome but had other gastrointestinal disorders. Statistical analyses to test the reliability and validity of the IBSQOL were performed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. RESULTS: Responses from the focus groups indicated that the IBSQOL was easy to complete and did not require too much time to fill out (approximately equal to 25 min). Statistical analyses of the final 30-item version of the IBSQOL demonstrated that it had both adequate validity and reliability (alpha > or = 0.60). A comparison of mean IBSQOL scores of persons with and without irritable bowel syndrome (but with other gastrointestinal conditions) showed no difference between the two groups with irritable bowel syndrome; however, scores for both irritable bowel syndrome groups were considerably lower than for the non-irritable bowel syndrome group, suggesting better health-related quality of life in patients who do not have irritable bowel syndrome. This further demonstrated the validity of the IBSQOL in targeting questions and domains specific to patients with irritable bowel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of the IBSQOL included testing the questionnaire in a large number of patients, which resulted in a revised and well-constructed instrument that demonstrated both adequate validity and reliability. The IBSQOL is currently being used in large-scale clinical trials to measure changes in quality of life in patients with irritable bowel syndrome following treatment intervention.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome and functional bowel disorder are diagnoses used to describe chronic GI symptoms for which no overt pathological condition can be identified. Symptoms are more common in women and are frequently followed in gastroenterology clinics. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the research linking GI symptoms and reproductive cycling and to discuss implications for practice. GIGl symptoms such as stomach pain and nausea are highest during menses compared with other cycle phases; also, stool consistency is loosest at menses. This pattern is present in control subjects. In women with irritable bowel syndrome the same pattern is seen but with higher symptom intensity. Although animal studies have demonstrated that estrogen and progesterone modulate contractile function of some GI segments. In humans, symptoms are highest when these hormones are at the lowest levels. Thus, symptoms in women may be related to decreasing ovarian hormone levels or to other circulating hormones or factors which vary with the menstrual cycle. Additionally, other factors such as stress aggravate symptoms. Therapeutics directed toward increasing patient awareness of cyclic patterns in symptom complaints, for example, via the use of daily symptom diaries may be a useful adjunct to dietary, pharmacological, and other therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We investigated the possibility that a variant of the normal colonic flora, a high concentration of methanogens, influences the host's response to ingestion of nonabsorbable, fermentable materials. METHODS: To better evaluate symptomatic and breath H2 and methane (CH4) responses, subjects were placed on a basal diet (primarily rice and hamburger) that contained minimal amounts of nonabsorbable, fermentable substrate. A breath CH4/H2 ratio of greater or less than 1 on the second day of the basal diet was used to categorize subjects as high (N = 9) or low (N = 25) CH4 producers. After stabilization of the breath gas excretion (day 3 or 4 on the basal diet), the subjects ingested either sorbitol (8.8 g) or oat fiber (10.2 g). RESULTS: The low CH4 producers had a significantly higher (p < 0.05) breath H2 concentration than the high producers on the basal diet and after ingestion of sorbitol (27.1 +/- 2.7 ppm vs 15.8 +/- 3.6 ppm) or oat fiber (13.1 +/- 0.08 ppm vs 9.6 +/- 1.2 ppm). Low producers of methane reported significantly increased bloating and cramping after sorbitol ingestion and increased bloating after fiber ingestion, whereas high CH4 producers reported no significant increase in these symptoms. CONCLUSION: The presence of a methanogenic flora is associated with a reduced symptomatic response to ingestion of nonabsorbable, fermentable material in healthy subjects. Manipulation of the normal flora could be of therapeutic value in nonmethanogenic patients with irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cause of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is unknown. It may follow gastroenteritis and be associated with an abnormal gut flora and with food intolerance. Our study was designed to assess whether these factors were associated with colonic malfermentation. METHODS: We carried out a crossover controlled trial of a standard diet and an exclusion diet matched for macronutrients in six female IBS patients and six female controls. During the final 72 h on each diet, faecal excretion of fat, nitrogen, starch, and non-starch polysaccharide NSP was measured, and total excretion of hydrogen and methane collected over 24 h in a purpose-built 1.4 m3 whole-body calorimeter. Breath hydrogen and methane excretion were then measured for 3 h after 20 g oral lactulose. FINDINGS: The maximum rate of gas excretion was significantly greater in patients than in controls (2.4 mL/min IQR 1.7-2.6 vs 0.6, 0.4-1.1). Although total gas production in patients was not greater than in controls (median 527 mL/24 h IQR 387-660 vs 412, 234-507), hydrogen production was higher (332, 318-478 vs 162, 126-217, p=0.009). In patients, the exclusion diet reduced symptoms and produced a fall in maximum gas excretion (0.5 mL/min IQR 0.3-0.7). After lactulose, breath hydrogen was greater on the standard than on the exclusion diet. INTERPRETATION: Colonic-gas production, particularly of hydrogen, is greater in patients with IBS than in controls, and both symptoms and gas production are reduced by an exclusion diet. This reduction may be associated with alterations in the activity of hydrogen-consuming bacteria. Fermentation may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of IBS.},

Although the causes of this syndrome are not clear, psychological factors do play a major role in determining whether a patient seeks medical care. Patients who have IBS tend to suffer from a psychiatric disorder, most notably anxiety and depression. Traditional medical care with its emphasis on pharmacological interventions and dietary changes has not been effective. Psychotherapy has been shown to be an important, yet underutilized, approach in the treatment of IBS. A clinical example of a young man suffering from IBS illustrates how traditional medical care and psychotherapy enhance the treatment of this disorder.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with IBS that can respond well to an exclusion diet with/without oral disodium cromoglycate and to document the effects of this combination. We selected 120 ambulatory patients with diarrhoeic type IBS; 66 of them (55%) had a concomitant food intolerance (assessed by skin prick test), showing a positive reaction to one (32%) or more foods (68%). Sixty-three (52.5%) tested by cytotoxic test showed more positive reactions. The results were evaluated by means of semiquantitative subjective and objective scores. Thirty patients were randomly treated with a strict exclusion diet, while the other 36 were treated with both exclusion diet and oral disodium cromoglycate (250 mg four times daily) for four months. We observed an improvement of symptoms in 18 (60%) of the 30 patients that had received the only exclusion diet, whereas thirty-two of 36 patients (89%) who had undergone both dietary and cromoglycate treatments showed an improvement that was clinically and statistically significant (p = 0.01).Thus it is concluded that dietary exclusion in association with disodium cromoglycate is most effective in carefully selected patients with diarrhoeic type IBS, with a very high probability of prolonged symptomatic benefit in those subjects that do respond.},

This appears to be a possible explanation for the adverse effects of bran on hospital patients with this disorder, but we do not yet know how this product affects community IBS sufferers. We cannot ignore the fact that fiber and bran have major beneficial effects in other areas, not least in the reduction of colonic carcinoma. In conclusion, it is probably best to recommend that patients with IBS be left to judge for themselves whether bran helps or exacerbates their symptoms, but there is enough evidence to suggest that the current dogma of routinely treating all IBS sufferers with bran should be challenged. Proprietary sources of fiber, such as ispaghula, may be more appropriate for those IBS subjects (for example, constipated) for whom fiber supplementation is believed justified.},

   abstract = {The common occurrence of irritable bowel syndrome underscores the importance of an accurate diagnostic evaluation without unnecessary expense. A preliminary diagnosis can usually be made with the Manning symptom criteria and additional history data in patients without warning signs of organic disease. A confident diagnosis can often be made with the addition of a physical examination and only limited laboratory and structural studies, such as a proctosigmoidoscopy and complete blood count. Tests that may be indicated in some patients include fecal examination for parasites and occult blood, dietary lactose exclusion or a lactose-hydrogen breath test, and a complete colon structural study. Other tests are occasionally indicated. Routine rectal biopsy and abdominal ultrasonography are unnecessary in patients with only typical symptoms, and large bowel motility testing is not useful. After a confident diagnosis, further testing for recurrent symptoms can be minimized. Investigation for psychosocial factors, while not necessary to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome, is important in treatment and may reduce medical costs. Misdiagnosis can result in unnecessary hysterectomy and other surgery, and it may be reduced by closer collaboration with gynecologists and general surgeons in the evaluation of patients.},

Intrinsic gut motor disease and central nervous system disorder are most usually congenital in origin, and alterations of the humoral environment acquired. Irritable bowel syndrome occurs in children as well as adults and is multifactorial in origin, with an interplay of psychogenic and organic disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We undertook to determine whether adverse food reactions play a role in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: A systematic review of the literature using Medline (1980-1996), targeting IBS and adverse food reactions, was performed. All clinical trials whereby dietary exclusion was followed by food challenge were selected. Each study was reviewed using a structured format to examine methodological issues and study outcomes. RESULTS: Of the seven studies included, the positive response to an elimination diet ranged from 15% to 71%; double-blind placebo-controlled challenges identified problem foods in 6% to 58% of cases. Milk, wheat, and eggs were most frequently identified to cause symptom exacerbation; of the foods identified the most common trait was a high salicylate content. Foods high in amines were also identified. Studies of diarrhea-predominant IBS identified a higher percentage of adverse food reactions. However, all studies had major limitations in their trial designs, including inadequate patient selection, appropriateness of--and duration of--exclusion diets, and methods of food challenge. CONCLUSION: Whether adverse reactions to foods are a key factor in exacerbating IBS symptoms or whether dietary manipulation is a valid treatment option is unclear. Carefully designed controlled clinical trials are now needed to specifically test the potential role of adverse food reactions in diarrhea-predominant IBS.},

There is no association with structural or biochemical abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract. Functional variations in myoelectrical activity, visceral hypersensitivity and illness behaviours have all been observed in patients experimentally. In conjunction with environmental, psychological and alimentary factors, these mechanisms have been proposed as the major determinants of symptom genesis. Certainly, dietary factors are frequently perceived by sufferers as powerful symptom triggers, with many reporting multiple food intolerance. Physicians, however, remain divided upon the relevance of food to the disorder, with many eschewing a nutritional connection. This is unsurprising as, despite much experimental work to determine the clinical relevance of food intolerance and allergy to the aetiology of the disorder, the vast range of foodstuffs available for testing, inherent procedural problems with test foods, methodological insufficiencies and the continually evolving knowledge of the disorder, particularly the subgrouping of sufferers, have restricted the scientific validity of current findings. At the present time, it is difficult to make informed judgement upon the importance of food in IBS, and rigorously designed, large scale trials devised in the light of recent knowledge are required before conclusions can be drawn.},

   abstract = {Large intestinal disease, and more especially colitis, is a commonly seen problem in small animal practice. Although colitis is most frequently diagnosed in dogs, it is becoming increasing common in cats. The etiology of colitis is not known, but there is general agreement that an immune-mediated response to luminal antigen is involved. In particular, parasites, bacteria and dietary factors may be involved. In approximately 10% of dogs presented with typical signs of colitis, no pathologic lesion will be found on investigation. These dogs have a functional diarrhea associated with some stress factor and are thought to have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This condition is most frequently observed in working dogs, although highly nervous and excitable dogs may also exhibit similar clinical signs. Until the underlying etiology of colitis is determined, treatment regimens will remain symptomatic. Recent studies have placed considerable importance on the value of diet in the prevention, immediate and long-term therapy of colitis in dogs and cats. In particular the value of "novel" protein diets, fermentable fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids is receiving the most attention. It is now possible to maintain patients in long-term remission and to modify the severity and chronicity of colitis by using diet alone. This paper will review the subject of dietary management of colitis and IBS and present results from the author's clinical research program.},

METHODS: This study evaluated postprandial jejunal motility in IBS patients classified as constipation-predominant (n = 25) or diarrhoea-predominant (n = 35) and compared results against 18 volunteers. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory jejunal manometry was carried out in all subjects, and recordings were analysed by microcomputer and visual assessment. RESULTS: By means of analysis of variance (fitting factors for channels, meals, and time periods) postprandial contraction frequency was greater in both patient groups compared with normal (constipation-predominant versus normal, diarrhoea-predominant versus normal; P < 0.001). In the constipation-predominant cohort, contraction amplitudes were lower (constipation-predominant versus normal; P < 0.002). Discrete cluster contractions occurred with similar frequency and duration in both patient and volunteer groups. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative differences of postprandial jejunal contraction characteristics have been shown between patients with IBS and healthy volunteers. Contraction frequency is greater than normal in both diarrhoea- and constipation-predominant categories, whereas contraction amplitudes are lower in constipation-predominant patients.},

   abstract = {IBS is one of the most common of the gastrointestinal disease, but it can be a diagnostic challenge because of the many symptoms that overlap with other such diseases. Most common among the symptoms are abdominal pain, a feeling of intestinal distention or bloating, and either diarrhea or constipation. Patients may be found to have an exacerbation of symptoms with stress, and they may have an increased sensitivity to bowel distention. History and physical examination findings often can be relied on to make the diagnosis, avoiding overuse of laboratory testing. Treatment consists of patient education and support, lifestyle and dietary changes, and use of several pharmacologic agents for symptom relief. Antidepressants are being investigated as a possible additional form of treatment.},

   abstract = {Increased gastrointestinal permeability was found in celiac disease already 20 years ago. Originally a genetical defect was supposed leading to elevated permeability and later to celiac disease. However, patients under long-term gluten-free diet normalized their permeability tests. On the other side, unaffected relatives of patients with celiac disease showed high permeability but not different from patients with irritable bowel syndrome and with a tendency for normalization during follow-up. In active symptomatic celiac disease, permeability is elevated in the gastroduodenum - measured by sucrose test - as well as in the small intestine - measured by lactulose/mannitol ratio. The sensitivity in active celiac disease is high (near 100%), the specificity is low due to high permeability in many intestinal diseases as in acute infectious gastroenteritis, Crohn's disease, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment, etc. In contrast, lactulose/mannitol test permeability is much less sensitive in silent celiac disease without diarrhea (74%). The real importance of permeability disease is established by its use for follow-up of celiac patients under gluten-free diet whereas it is correlated to the degree of mucosal atrophy. In vitro tests also show increased lactulose mucosal to serosal flux in celiac disease, but not correlated to oral permeability test. In conclusion, lactulose/mannitol test is the only noninvasive functional test in celiac disease which has essential importance in active celiac disease and in follow-up under diet.},

   abstract = {Conventional analysis of ambulatory longterm manometry of the small intestine has revealed abnormalities in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim was to use methods from non-linear dynamics, in particular the concepts of symbolic dynamics and entropy, in order to discriminate motility in IBS from healthy subjects. 24-h jejunal motility was recorded in 30 IBS patients and 30 healthy subjects. Computerized analysis of contraction amplitudes and intercontractile intervals was performed. Both time series were analysed by symbolic dynamics and entropy to quantify the degree of randomness inherent in the signal. During phase II IBS patients exhibited significantly increased entropies for the intercontractile intervals (IBS: 0.978 +/- 0.016, C: 0.965 +/- 0.020, P = 0.004) and for the contraction amplitudes (IBS: 0.978 +/- 0.008, C: 0.970 +/- 0.026, P = 0.05) compared with healthy subjects. In addition, a significantly increased mean contraction amplitude (mmHg) was found in patients (IBS: 25.2 +/- 4.8, C: 22.2 +/- 3.1, P = 0.003). Considering a combination of both parameters, a diagnostic accuracy of 82% was achieved. We conclude that phase II motility of the small intestine is more random in IBS than in health. Symbolic dynamics seems to be a promising new concept for the analysis of long-term gastrointestinal motility recordings.},
