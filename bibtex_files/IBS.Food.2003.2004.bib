PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 53 patients with irritable bowel syndrome was enrolled in a non-propabilistic sample. Patients were diagnose with Roma II criteria. In all patients were determined, weight, height, body mass index, dietary intake of 3 days and a symptoms scoring system. RESULTS: The average age of 53 patients was 45.67+/-13.6 years with a distribution of sex (22 males/31 females). Caloric intakes was right in absolute terms and corrected by weight. Distribution of calories was 41.5% of carbohydrates, a 19.8% of proteins, and a 38.7% of lipids, showing a high intake of lipids and low of carbohydrates. A low intake of vitamin A and D was detected. High intake of vitamin B12, vitamin C and niacine was observed. A low intake of calcium, magnesium, yodo and zinc was detected. Intake of soluble fiber was lower than insoluble fiber (1.46+/-0.74 g/day) (19%) vs 6.21+/-2.67 g/day (71%). Intake of fiber corrected by calories was low 4.5+/-1.2 g/1000 calories. In correlation analysis, insoluble fiber (r=0.46; p < 0.05) and soluble fiber (r=0.42; p < 0.05) were inverse correlated with general symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome showed a deviation of mineral and vitamin dietary. Fiber intake is low, a correlation between fiber intake and general symptoms was detected.},

Fifty-six subjects with irritable bowel syndrome were prospectively and randomly assigned to one of two groups: group 1 received a diet containing 10.4 g/d of fiber and group 2 received a diet containing 30.5 g/d of fiber. Patients' body weights, nutritional intakes as assessed with 3-d written food records, and symptom scores were assessed at baseline and at 3 mo. RESULTS: There were no dropouts during the study. Total energy intake and the distribution of macronutrients were not significantly different between groups. Total dietary fiber intake did not reach recommended levels in either group but was higher in group 2 than in group 1 (25.95 +/- 2.12 g/d versus 6.06 +/- 2.7 g/d, P < 0.05). Initial fiber intake did not differ significantly between groups. Pain scores, bowel scores, and general scores improved in both groups (from baseline to 3 mo), and no significant differences were detected between groups. CONCLUSIONS: A modest fiber intake in patients with irritable bowel syndrome relieved symptoms, but this therapeutic benefit of fiber may have been due to a placebo effect because the results were similar in the low-fiber group.},

Tests attempting to predict food sensitivity in IBS have been disappointing but none has utilised IgG antibodies. AIMS: To assess the therapeutic potential of dietary elimination based on the presence of IgG antibodies to food. PATIENTS: A total of 150 outpatients with IBS were randomised to receive, for three months, either a diet excluding all foods to which they had raised IgG antibodies (enzyme linked immunosorbant assay test) or a sham diet excluding the same number of foods but not those to which they had antibodies. METHODS: Primary outcome measures were change in IBS symptom severity and global rating scores. Non-colonic symptomatology, quality of life, and anxiety/depression were secondary outcomes. Intention to treat analysis was undertaken using a generalised linear model. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, the true diet resulted in a 10% greater reduction in symptom score than the sham diet (mean difference 39 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 5-72); p = 0.024) with this value increasing to 26% in fully compliant patients (difference 98 (95% CI 52-144); p<0.001). Global rating also significantly improved in the true diet group as a whole (p = 0.048, NNT = 9) and even more in compliant patients (p = 0.006, NNT = 2.5). All other outcomes showed trends favouring the true diet. Relaxing the diet led to a 24% greater deterioration in symptoms in those on the true diet (difference 52 (95% CI 18-88); p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Food elimination based on IgG antibodies may be effective in reducing IBS symptoms and is worthy of further biomedical research.},

OBJECTIVES: To compare patients' and GPs' views on the symptomatology, etiology and treatment of IBS. METHODS: One hundred forty-two IBS patients and 100 GPs were requested to complete a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: The response rates of the patients and GPs were 80% and 47%, respectively. Abdominal pain and bloating were considered to be the most bothersome symptoms in IBS, by both patients and GPs. Although all patients were diagnosed by their GP as having IBS, and 62% met the Manning criteria, only 18% fulfilled the Rome II criteria for IBS. Patients consider food intolerance and GPs regard lack of fibre as the main etiologic dietary factor. Many IBS patients expect a diagnostic work-up, but GPs generally restrict this to elderly patients. GPs start IBS management with dietary advice (94%), counselling (77%) and drug therapy (55%). Patients expect reassurance (47%) and drug treatment (37%), but dietary interventions are less appreciated (9%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients and GPs have different perceptions of the efficacy of diagnostic and dietary interventions in IBS. GPs should explore the patients expectations and incorporate these in their approach to IBS patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both high-fibre dietary advice and the prescription of fibre as a bulking agent are very common in primary and secondary care management of irritable bowel syndrome. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation may have delayed intestinal transit. Therefore, fibres that accelerate intestinal transit may be beneficial in these patients. The uncertain benefits reported in several clinical studies, however, have led us to reappraise the value of fibre in irritable bowel syndrome management. AIM: To quantify the effect of different types of fibre on global and symptom relief from irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: Using a structured literature search in MEDLINE (1966-2002), we selected randomized controlled trials involving irritable bowel syndrome patients treated with fibre. Analyses were performed for the total group and for trials using soluble and insoluble fibre separately. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included in the analysis. None investigated primary care irritable bowel syndrome patients. Fibre, in general, was effective in the relief of global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms [relative risk, 1.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-1.50]. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation may receive benefit from fibre treatment (relative risk, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.21-2.02), but there was no evidence that fibre was effective in the relief of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome. Soluble and insoluble fibre, separately, had different effects on global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Soluble fibre (psyllium, ispaghula, calcium polycarbophil) showed significant improvement (relative risk, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.35-1.78), whereas insoluble fibre (corn, wheat bran), in some cases, worsened the clinical outcome, but there was no significant difference compared with placebo (relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of fibre in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome are marginal for global irritable bowel syndrome symptom improvement and irritable bowel syndrome-related constipation. Soluble and insoluble fibres have different effects on global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Indeed, in some cases, insoluble fibres may worsen the clinical outcome. Future clinical studies evaluating the effect and tolerability of fibre therapy are needed in primary care.},

   abstract = {The intestinal flora may play a key role in the pathogenesis of certain gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Components of bowel flora such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidus have long been used empirically as therapeutic agents for GI disorders. More complex combinations of probiotics for therapeutic bacteriotherapy have also recently become available, however the most elaborate mix of human-derived probiotic bacteria is, by definition, the entire fecal flora. Fecal bacteriotherapy uses the complete normal human flora as a therapeutic probiotic mixture of living organisms. This type of bacteriotherapy has a longstanding history in animal health and has been used sporadically against chronic infections of the bowel, especially as a treatment of last resort for patients with severe Clostridium difficile syndromes including recurrent diarrhea, colitis, and pseudomembranous colitis. Encouraging results have also been observed following infusions of human fecal flora in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic constipation. The therapeutic use of fecal bacteriotherapy is reviewed here and possible mechanisms of action and potential applications explored. Published reports on fecal bacteriotherapy are few in number, and detail the results of small uncontrolled open studies and case reports. Nevertheless, given the promising clinical responses, formal research into fecal bacteriotherapy is now warranted.},

A detailed literature review (from 1950 through February 2004) of English-language articles was undertaken to find articles showing a relationship between probiotic use and medical conditions. Medical conditions that have been reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive, hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary tract infections, and others. The use of probiotics should be further investigated for possible benefits and side-effects in patients affected by these medical conditions.},

DESIGN: Partially blinded, randomized, two-dose, pilot study. SUBJECTS: Five hundred (500) volunteers were screened for IBS using the Rome II criteria. Two hundred and seven (207) suitable volunteers were randomized. INTERVENTIONS: One or two tablets of a standardized turmeric extract taken daily for 8 weeks. OUTCOMES MEASURES: IBS prevalence, symptom-related quality of life (IBSQOL) and self-reported effectiveness. RESULTS: IBS prevalence decreased significantly in both groups between screening and baseline (41% and 57%), with a further significant drop of 53% and 60% between baseline and after treatment, in the one- and two-tablet groups respectively (p < 0.001). A post-study analysis revealed abdominal pain/discomfort score reduced significantly by 22% and 25% in the one- and two-tablet group respectively, the difference tending toward significance (p = 0.071). There were significant improvements in all bar one of the IBSQOL scales of between 5% and 36% in both groups, approximately two thirds of all subjects reported an improvement in symptoms after treatment, and there was a favorable shift in self-reported bowel pattern. There were no significant differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Turmeric may help reduce IBS symptomology. Placebo controlled trials are now warranted to confirm these findings.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Does artichoke leaf extract (ALE) ameliorate symptoms of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in otherwise healthy volunteers suffering concomitant dyspepsia? METHODS: A subset analysis of a previous dose-ranging, open, postal study, in adults suffering dyspepsia. Two hundred and eight (208) adults were identified post hoc as suffering with IBS. IBS incidence, self-reported usual bowel pattern, and the Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI) were compared before and after a 2-month intervention period. RESULTS: There was a significant fall in IBS incidence of 26.4% (p < 0.001) after treatment. A significant shift in self-reported usual bowel pattern away from "alternating constipation/diarrhea" toward "normal" (p < 0.001) was observed. NDI total symptom score significantly decreased by 41% (p < 0.001) after treatment. Similarly, there was a significant 20% improvement in the NDI total quality-of-life (QOL) score in the subset after treatment. CONCLUSION: This report supports previous findings that ALE ameliorates symptoms of IBS, plus improves health-related QOL.},

   abstract = {The management of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequent, yet challenging task in both primary care and gastroenterology practice. A diagnostic strategy guided by keen clinical judgment should focus on positive symptom criteria and on the absence of alarm symptoms. In younger patients lacking alarm features, invasive testing has a low-yield. The presence of food intolerance and underlying celiac disease should be excluded. The usefulness of fecal tests such as calprotectin and lactoferrin to exclude organic bowel disease is not adequately established. In patients with moderate to severe symptoms who fail initial therapeutic trials, further tests can be performed in tertiary care settings, such as transit measurement and tests for diagnosing pelvic floor dysfunction. Treatment strategies for IBS are currently directed at the predominant symptoms. In diarrhea-predominant IBS, opioids (e.g. loperamide) and the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist alosetron are efficacious. In constipation-predominant IBS, fiber and bulk laxatives are traditionally used, but their efficacy is variable and may worsen symptoms. The 5-HT(4) receptor agonist tegaserod is efficacious in female patients with IBS and constipation. In patients with IBS and abdominal pain, antispasmodics and antidepressants can be used, with the best evidence supporting the prescription of tricyclic antidepressants. The efficacy of psychological treatments in terms of relieving the symptoms of IBS is still uncertain. Limited evidence suggests that anti-enkephalinase agents, somatostatin analogues, alpha(2)-receptor agonists, opioid antagonists, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, probiotics and herbal treatments may be useful in IBS patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Different food items are made responsible for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, but the physiopathology of IBS remains unclear. AIMS: During a meeting in Nice, France, experts of the European Working Team of the IBiS Club discussed selected data regarding the relationships between alimentation, food items (including fibers) and IBS symptoms. METHODS/RESULTS: Food allergy remains a difficult diagnosis, but medical and general history, presence of general symptoms such as skin rash, and hypersensitivity tests may help in achieving a positive diagnosis. On the other hand, food intolerance is more confusing because of the subjectivity of the relationship between ingestion of certain foods and the appearance of clinical symptoms. Different food items which are commonly implicated in adverse reactions mimicking IBS were found to be stimulants for the gut, suggesting that patients with predominant diarrhea IBS have to be carefully questioned about consumption of different kinds of food (i.e., coffee, alcohol, chewing gum, soft drinks) and not only on lactose ingestion. Gas production is discussed on the basis of retention of intestinal gas as well as on malabsorption of fermentable substrates. The role of a large amount of this kind of substrate reaching the colon is suggested as a potential mechanism of IBS-type symptoms in overeating patients. Regarding the role of fiber in IBS, the expert group concluded that fibers are not inert substances and that they could trigger pain or bloating in some IBS patients. CONCLUSION: Despite numerous reviews on this subject, it is very difficult to give general dietary advice to IBS patients, but dieteticians may have a positive role in managing such patients.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gut functional diseases, affecting 10-20% of people worldwide. Although most patients do not seek medical help, the disease accounts for huge costs for both patients and health-care systems and worsens significantly patients' quality of life. Diagnosis is based on the identification of symptoms according to Manning, Rome I and Rome II criteria and exclusion of alarm indicators. IBS symptoms overlap with those of coeliac disease, lactose intolerance, food allergies and bile salt malabsorption. The treatment of IBS is centred on an excellent doctor-patient relationship along with drugs targeting the predominant symptom, especially during exacerbations. Current pharmacological remedies are unsatisfactory due to the high number of patients complaining of lack of response and/or symptom recurrence. Although useful in some IBS patients, the validity of psychotherapy deserves further investigation. A wide array of potentially useful drugs are currently under consideration in pre-clinical trials. A better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying IBS may help to develop more effective drugs for this disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The goal was to investigate the neuroimmune axis in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by analyzing the neuroendocrine and cellular immune responses to nutrient load. METHODS: In the fasting state and 20, 40, 70, and 100 min following nutrient load, blood samples were collected and cardiovascular recordings were accomplished in 15 female IBS patients and 15 healthy women. Plasma norepinephrine, prolactin, cortisol, and growth hormone were analyzed, and blood pressure and heart rate responses were measured. The distribution of peripheral leukocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations and the in vitro production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) after whole blood stimulation with in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were analyzed. RESULTS: IBS patients demonstrated significantly greater postprandial increases in plasma norepinephrine and systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05), but no cortisol response. A postprandial redistribution of circulating leukocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations was observed in both groups, including significant increases in the numbers of leukocytes and granulocytes and significant decreases in the numbers of monocytes, T-cells, and natural killer (NK) cells (all p < 0.05). However, IBS patients demonstrated significantly greater postprandial increases in leukocytes and granulocytes, while changes in the numbers of monocytes and NK cells were significantly diminished (all p < 0.05). Patients also failed to show the postprandial decrease in the in vitro TNF-alpha production observed in controls. Postprandial norepinephrine concentrations were negatively correlated with NK cell numbers in IBS patients (r= 0.58, p < 0.05) but not controls. CONCLUSIONS: IBS may involve an autonomic hyper-responsiveness to visceral stimuli, which occurs throughout the entire gut, is independent of acutely perceived GI symptoms, and does not necessarily involve HPA axis activation. Women with IBS show altered cellular immune responses to food intake, which may at least in part be mediated by adrenergic mechanisms. Thus, autonomic disturbances may have implications for cellular immune function along the neuroendocrine-immune axis in patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is part of the spectrum of functional bowel disorders characterised by a diverse consortium of abdominal symptoms including abdominal pain, altered bowel function (bowel frequency and/or constipation), bloating, abdominal distension, the sensation of incomplete evacuation and the increased passage of mucus. It is not surprising therefore that no single, unifying mechanism has as yet been put forward to explain symptom production in IBS. The currently favoured model includes both central and end-organ components which may be combined to create an integrated hypothesis incorporating psychological factors (stress, distress, affective disorder) with end-organ dysfunction (motility disorder, visceral hypersensitivity) possibly aggravated by sub-clinical inflammation as a residuum of an intestinal infection. There is currently no universally effective therapy for IBS. Standard therapy generally involves a symptom-directed approach; anti-diarrhoeal agents for bowel frequency, soluble fibre or laxatives for constipation and smooth muscle relaxants and anti-spasmodics for pain. New drug development has focused predominantly on agents that modify the effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the gut, principally the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists for painful diarrhoea predominant IBS and 5-HT(4) agonists for constipation predominant IBS. More speculative new therapeutic approaches include anti-inflammatory agents, antibiotics, probiotics, antagonists of CCK1 receptors, tachykinins and other novel neuronal receptors.},

The aims of this study were to compare the prevalence of lactose malabsorption (LM) and symptoms related to intake of milk and lactose in subjects with IBS with that of healthy volunteers, and to search for symptoms that are characteristic of LM. METHODS: A case-control study in a Norwegian population was initiated. Subjects with IBS were asked for symptoms related to intake of milk and lactose, tested for LM, and compared with a group of healthy volunteers. RESULTS: The study comprised a total of 187 persons (82 with IBS and 105 volunteers), females/males: 138/49, mean age 47 years. In subjects with IBS and in healthy volunteers, LM was present in 3/74 (4.1%) and 4/105 (3.8%), respectively (ns), milk-related symptoms in 32/79 (40%) and 13/105 (12%), respectively (P < 0.001) and symptoms after intake of lactose in 28/74 (38%) and 21/104 (20%), respectively (P=0.01). Borborygmi starting within 5 h after intake of lactose and lasting for more than 2 h indicated LM (OR 61 (95% CI: 8-475), P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: IBS and LM are unrelated disorders in a Norwegian population. Milk-related symptoms and symptoms after intake of lactose are unreliable predictors for LM. Precise symptom-based criteria might enhance the diagnostic accuracy for LM.},

Their major role in preventing and treating gastrointestinal disease appears to be from their effect on the immune process, protection against abnormal invasive bacteria, and in the production of short-chain fatty acids from starch and non-starch polysaccharides. Probiotic microorganisms are administered in food supplements and yogurts. They are also now sold in the form of capsules and powders. There is great variation in the microorganisms in the various supplements. It is important to understand that all probiotic products are different. Some contain a single organism and others contain multiple organisms. Therapeutic results have been achieved with various probiotics in different diseases. In the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), success has been reported with Escherichia coli Nissle strain in ulcerative colitis, and with a multiple organism product, VSL#3 (VSL Pharmaceuticals, Fort Lauderdale, FL), in Crohn's disease and pouchitis. Initial reports in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have resulted in encouraging results with the use of E. coli Nissle strain, and recently with multiple organism probiotic supplements. However, caution must still apply to the use of probiotics in IBD and IBS because the reports and the number of patients treated are limited.},

   abstract = {Nowadays. there is a growing interest in probiotics as a safe way of changing the intestinal bacterial flora. Probiotics may have potential in several gastroenterological conditions, especially when the intestinal flora has been disturbed. Most scientific evidence is available for diarrhoea patients treated with Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri or Saccharomyces boulardii. Meta-analyses have shown an overall reduction in the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea during treatment with probiotics, and benefits have also been demonstrated for patients with rota-virus-associated diarrhoea. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, an inflammatory disorder characterized by a change in the intestinal flora, are another important target group for which probiotics may be beneficial. It has been claimed that in ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease patients, lactobacilli, S. boulardii and Escherichia coli reduce relapses. but most studies were not placebo-controlled. A reduction in relapses has also been demonstrated in pouchitis patients treated with a multispecies probiotic. Irritable bowel syndrome might be another clinical indication for probiotic therapy, but results of clinical trials performed in these patients are inconsistent. Additionally, probiotics may improve lactose absorption. Helicobacter pylori eradication and constipation. Finally, in animal models of colorectal cancer, treatment with probiotics reduces the prevalence of this disease, and in humans the amount of genotoxic substances in faeces has been reduced. In conclusion, the results of studies on the effects of probiotics in gastrointestinal conditions are encouraging. but well-designed placebo-controlled studies are warranted before recommendations for therapeutic or preventive use can be given. Many issues still have to be resolved, including optimal dose and duration of treatment, selection of and differences between the several available probiotic strains, and, importantly, their mechanisms of actions have to be elucidated.},

Irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis have all been linked to alterations in the intestinal microflora. The intestinal dysbiosis hypothesis suggests a number of factors associated with modern Western living have a detrimental impact on the microflora of the gastrointestinal tract. Factors such as antibiotics, psychological and physical stress, and certain dietary components have been found to contribute to intestinal dysbiosis. If these causes can be eliminated or at least attenuated then treatments aimed at manipulating the microflora may be more successful},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome is a common but complex problem that disproportionately affects women. Nurses are ideally situated to provide accurate information regarding the disorder and to provide symptom management. Currently, the diagnosis is based on the presence of abdominal pain and alterations in bowel habits. A multicomponent approach beginning with education and reassurance is more likely to be effective than one focused on a predominant symptoms (eg., constipation) alone. Building a therapeutic relationship with the patient over time will likely enhance the effectiveness of the prescribed therapy. Treatment paradigms that include new drugs that affect more than one symptom of IBS, along with nondrug therapies (eg, relaxation and cognitive behavioral strategies), will likely hold the greatest promise for management.},

   abstract = {This report examines the relationships between bloating and other symptoms in young women with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), using both retrospective and daily diary measures of symptoms. Of the 195 IBS women, 147 (75%) reported retrospectively that they often feel bloated and distended. Across-women analyses of both retrospective and daily diary data show that bloating is most strongly associated with constipation, abdominal pain, and intestinal gas. Within-woman analyses of daily symptoms also show a strong association of bloating with abdominal pain and intestinal gas (i.e., abdominal pain and intestinal gas are higher on days when bloating is higher) but only a weak association with constipation. Bloating is strongly associated with uterine cramping and breast tenderness, but only when perimenses days are included in the analysis. In conclusion, bloating is a very common symptom in women with IBS that is most strongly related to abdominal pain and intestinal gas but may be confounded with menses-associated symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meal ingestion is often associated with exacerbation of gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Furthermore, recent preliminary data suggest that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentration in platelet poor plasma is elevated following meal ingestion in some subjects with diarrhoea predominant IBS (d-IBS) compared with healthy subjects, although it is not known whether this is related to postprandial symptomatology. AIM: To expand on previous data by evaluating a larger number of subjects but also to assess plasma 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations, 5-HT turnover, platelet 5-HT stores, and any relationship to symptomatology. METHODS: We assessed platelet depleted plasma 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations for two hours (60 minute intervals) under fasting conditions, and then for a further four hours (30 minute intervals) after a standard carbohydrate meal (457 kcal), together with fasting platelet 5-HT concentrations in 39 female subjects with d-IBS (aged 19-52 years; mean age 33) and 20 healthy female volunteers (aged 20-46 years, mean age 28). IBS symptomatology, in particular abdominal pain and bloating, and urgency to defecate were assessed throughout the study RESULTS: When related to fasting levels, there was no statistically significant difference in postprandial plasma 5-HT concentrations between d-IBS and healthy subjects. However, when fasting levels were not taken into consideration, d-IBS subjects exhibited higher postprandial plasma 5-HT concentrations compared with healthy subjects (p=0.040). Furthermore, d-IBS subjects who exhibited postprandial symptomatology had higher levels of postprandial plasma 5-HT, whether assessed with respect to fasting baseline levels (p=0.069) or not (p=0.047), compared with d-IBS subjects who did not report postprandial symptomatology. This appeared to be associated with a concomitant increase in plasma 5-HIAA (p=0.161) but reduction in turnover (p=0.058). Lastly, d-IBS subjects had higher platelet concentrations of 5-HT than healthy subjects (p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that postprandial symptomatology may be associated with increased platelet depleted plasma 5-HT concentrations in female subjects with d-IBS. In addition, the presence of increased platelet stores of 5-HT may act as a useful marker for the diagnosis and management of d-IBS.},

   abstract = {Zinc is known to be essential for all highly proliferating cells in the human body, especially the immune system. A variety of in vivo and in vitro effects of zinc on immune cells mainly depend on the zinc concentration. All kinds of immune cells show decreased function after zinc depletion. In monocytes, all functions are impaired, whereas in natural killer cells, cytotoxicity is decreased, and in neutrophil granulocytes, phagocytosis is reduced. The normal functions of T cells are impaired, but autoreactivity and alloreactivity are increased. B cells undergo apoptosis. Impaired immune functions due to zinc deficiency are shown to be reversed by an adequate zinc supplementation, which must be adapted to the actual requirements of the patient. High dosages of zinc evoke negative effects on immune cells and show alterations that are similar to those observed with zinc deficiency. Furthermore, when peripheral blood mononuclear cells are incubated with zinc in vitro, the release of cytokines such as interleukins (IL)-1 and -6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, soluble IL-2R and interferon-gamma is induced. In a concentration of 100 micro mol/L, zinc suppresses natural killer cell killing and T-cell functions whereas monocytes are activated directly, and in a concentration of 500 micro mol/L, zinc evokes a direct chemotactic activation of neutrophil granulocytes. All of these effects are discussed in this short overview.},

Five groups of female ICR mice aged approximately 8 weeks at the commencement of the experiment were caged in groups of eight and received various treatments. The treatments included OVA alone, OVA with cholera toxin (CT), and OVA with various doses of STE. Mice were primed intraperitoneally with 500 microg of OVA alone or co-administered with 0.1 microg CT, or with 1 microg STE. All mice were boosted orally via gastric intubation 14 days after priming with 10 mg OVA alone, or co-administered with 10 microg CT or with 10 mg, 1 mg or 0.1 mg STE. One week later all mice were killed and organs obtained for analysis of the immune response. Intestinal, faecal and pulmonary OVA-specific sIgA concentration was significantly increased (p<0.05) in mice that received booster combinations of OVA/CT and OVA with all extract doses (p<0.05). Specific serum IgG titres did not differ significantly between groups. It is concluded that STE can significantly enhance secretory immunity in the intestine to OVA with mucosal homing to the lungs. The adjuvant effect of STE is comparable to that of CT.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that subjects with relatives who suffered from abdominal pain or bowel dysfunction would be at an increased risk of more persistent irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: A valid, self-report questionnaire was mailed to an age- and gender-stratified random sample of residents, aged 30-64 years, in Olmsted County, MN, USA, on three occasions over a 4-year period. Persistent irritable bowel syndrome was defined as the presence of irritable bowel syndrome on at least two of the three surveys, and fluctuating irritable bowel syndrome was defined as the presence of irritable bowel syndrome on only one of the surveys. RESULTS: Subjects were less likely to have persistent irritable bowel syndrome over the age of 50 years [odds ratio (OR), 0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.09, 0.47]. A positive family history was reported by 23%. A family history of gastrointestinal symptoms was independently associated with persistent irritable bowel syndrome (vs. no irritable bowel syndrome: OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3, 4.9) and fluctuating irritable bowel syndrome (vs. no irritable bowel syndrome: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3, 4.4). However, subjects reporting a positive family history were not more likely to report persistent vs. fluctuating irritable bowel syndrome (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.5, 2.9). The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2, 4.3) and a history of food sensitivity (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.9, 6.9) were the only other predictors of persistent irritable bowel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: A history of abdominal pain or bowel troubles in first-degree relatives appears to be independently associated with both persistent and fluctuating irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS) mainly includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). UC and CD are chronic and recurrent conditions, with a tendency to exacerbations and remissions. The incidence of diseases worldwide has increased over the last years. Although the etiology of inflammatory bowel syndrome has been studied intensively it still remains unclear. The development and persistence of inflammation is an effect of numerous factors: proinflammatory (aggressive), regulating bowel mucosa homeostasis and protective factors. Proinflammatory factors include intestinal bacteria, bile acids, digestive enzymes, lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans. Protective mechanisms are impermeability of mucosa barrier, presence of intestinal mucus, activity of secretive immunoglobulins, some prostaglandins and interleukins, glutamine, somatostatin, cortisol and short-chain fatty acids. Factors modifying intestinal mucosa homeostasis consist of genetically determined immunoregulators and activity of intestinal mucosa barrier and some environmental factors (diet, smoking, infections, stress, antibiotics and others). Environmental factors are jointly responsible for IBS occurrence in case of genetically determined dysregulation leading to proinflammatory cytokines overproduction or disturbances in synthesis of cytokines regulating intestinal mucosa homeostasis.},

Probiotics are currently the subject of intense and widespread research as functional foods since they are known to induce health benefits, may be used as pharmaceutical preparations, and have achieved a "generally recognized as safe" (GRAS) status. Lactobacillus strains can also be genetically engineered for use in oral immunotherapeutic applications, such as vaccination and delivery of immunoregulatory substances. In the present review we evaluate the two different approaches to the therapeutic use of probiotics. We also focus on recent findings in the field of molecular biology and genetics of the intestinal immune response related to the microflora and intestinal ecology, in order to understand the mechanisms of action of probiotics and their present indications in gastrointestinal diseases. Finally, with a view to future perspectives we provide some examples of probiotics that are being assessed and have great potential in improving the health of animals and man.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effects of a probiotic formulation, VSL#3, on gastrointestinal transit and symptoms of patients with Rome II irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhoea. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome were randomly assigned to receive VSL#3 powder (450 billion lyophilized bacteria/day) or matching placebo twice daily for 8 weeks after a 2-week run-in period. Pre- and post-treatment gastrointestinal transit measurements were performed in all patients. Patients recorded their bowel function and symptoms daily in a diary during the 10-week study, which was powered to detect a 50% change in the primary colonic transit end-point. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mean gastrointestinal transit measurements, bowel function scores or satisfactory global symptom relief between the two treatment groups, pre- or post-therapy. Differences in abdominal bloating scores between treatments were borderline significant (P = 0.09, analysis of covariance). Further analysis revealed that abdominal bloating was reduced (P = 0.046) with VSL#3 [mean post- minus pre-treatment score, - 13.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), - 2.5 to - 24.9], but not with placebo (P = 0.54) (mean post- minus pre-treatment score, - 1.7; 95% CI, 7.1 to - 10.4). With the exception of changes in abdominal bloating, VSL#3 had no effect on other individual symptoms: abdominal pain, gas and urgency. All patients tolerated VSL#3 well. CONCLUSION: VSL#3 appears to be promising in the relief of abdominal bloating in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. This is unrelated to an alteration in gastrointestinal or colonic transit.},

The impact of probiotics on gut flora represents a new and interesting therapeutic approach in a number of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. According to actual publications and guidelines of medical societies, the clinical relevance of probiotics can be described as follows: (a) In the case of ulcerative colitis, available data demonstrate benefits of probiotic therapy. (b) The available data regarding pouchitis are limited, but the therapeutic effect seems to be excellent. (c) In the case of Crohn's disease, the role of probiotics is not clearly defined, thus the results of new trials have to be awaited before probiotic therapy is recommended. (d) Further indications such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute pancreatitis or irritable bowel syndrome have been reported recently. The results of these clinical trials have been encouraging, but they often included only a small number of patients and therefore a clear-cut assessment seems difficult at the moment.},

   abstract = {A large proportion of the American population avails itself of a variety of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions. Allopathic practitioners often dismiss CAM because of distrust or a belief that there is no sound scientific evidence that has established its utility. However, although not widely appreciated, there are thousands of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have addressed the efficacy of CAM. We reviewed the RCTs of herbal and other natural products, acupuncture, and homeopathy as examples of typical CAM modalities, focusing on conditions of interest to gastroenterologists. Peppermint (alone or in combination) has supportive evidence for use in patients with dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and as an intraluminal spasmolytic agent during barium enemas or endoscopy. Ginger appeared to be effective in relieving nausea and vomiting due to motion sickness or pregnancy. Probiotics were useful in childhood diarrhea or in diarrhea due to antibiotics; one particular formulation (VSL#3) prevented pouchitis. Acupuncture appeared to ameliorate postoperative nausea and vomiting and might be useful elsewhere. There is even a suggestion that homeopathy has efficacy in treatment of gastrointestinal problems or symptoms. The major problem in interpreting these CAM data is the generally low quality of the RCTs, although that quality might not be different compared to RCTs in the general medical literature. Gastroenterologists should become familiar with these techniques; it is likely that their patients already are.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Both irritable bowel syndrome and some gynaecological diseases can give rise to lower abdominal pain, which may result in diagnostic confusion. Disorders such as endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease can be diagnosed definitively only by laparoscopy, which is seldom undertaken in the gastroenterological setting. It was the aim of this study to compare the symptomatology of irritable bowel syndrome with that of laparoscopically confirmed chronic pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A symptom questionnaire was administered to 50 women with irritable bowel syndrome and 51 gynaecological patients (30 patients with endometriosis, 21 patients with chronic pelvic inflammatory disease). As the symptoms of the two gynaecological conditions were so similar, the groups were combined for the purposes of comparison with irritable bowel syndrome. RESULTS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome suffered significantly more upper abdominal pain, colicky pain and exacerbation of pain by food or stress. They also experienced more disturbance of bowel habit, distension and nausea. In contrast, the only gynaecological features that were more common in the gynaecological patients were intermenstrual bleeding, premenstrual exacerbation of pain and forniceal tenderness. CONCLUSION: The presence of gastrointestinal symptomatology, especially bowel dysfunction, in a woman with lower abdominal pain is suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome. However, the history may not be so helpful in detecting gynaecological disease.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterised by recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of any discernible structural, biochemical and physiological abnormalities. Although there is no specific biological marker for the diagnosis of this disorder, recently developed symptom-based criteria provide the tools necessary to make a diagnosis. The precise underlying pathophysiology of IBS remains unknown. However, disturbances in the brain-gut axis involving the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system have emerged as an underlying concept for IBS. In this regard, conventional treatment has been recognised as unsatisfactory for many patients with IBS and novel, neuroenteric modulatory compounds have been introduced for use by clinicians. Specifically, compounds interacting with the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) receptors of the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 subtype have been demonstrated of benefit in some patients for the treatment of IBS. In this leading article, we present the current data on the pharmacology, clinical trials, indications and adverse effects of alosetron, a potent and selective 5-HT3 antagonist. As a result of the recognition of serious adverse effects, the indication for alosetron has been restricted and it is now indicated only for women with severe diarrhoea-predominant IBS who have symptoms for at least 6 months and who have failed to respond to conventional therapy. Prescribing restrictions and the risk-management programme implemented as required by the US FDA is reviewed along with a summary of the studies to be performed after reintroduction of alosetron to monitor safety.},

   abstract = {Probiotic products have been widely used in Japan and Europe for years. Probiotics are now emerging as an important category of food supplement in the United States. Questions about the biologic nature, available products, claimed health benefits, and safety and regulation of probiotics are important for both consumers and nutrition professionals. Probiotics can be considered functional foods because they provide health benefits beyond the traditional nutrition function. With few exceptions, most probiotic products currently available contain lactic-acid-producing bacteria, which mainly belong to the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. We reviewed the scientific papers published in major nutrition journals and abstracts available on the PubMed website regarding probiotics. Evidence suggests the following beneficial effects of probiotics: normalization of the intestinal microflora, ability to block the invasion of potential pathogens in the gut, prophylactic or therapeutic treatment for several types of diarrhea, relief of symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, amelioration of lactose intolerance, prevention of colon cancer, modulation of immune function, inhibition of Helicobacter pylori, and possible enhancement of calcium absorption and reduction of blood cholesterol levels. Mechanisms for the above benefits have been proposed, but none has been proven. An adequate level of viable bacteria in a probiotic product and an appropriate daily dose are critical to achieve a health benefit. Because probiotics are not known to be pathogenic and their upper tolerable level is high, they could be promoted as a beneficial food supplement. Currently, no disease-prevention or therapeutic claim for probiotics is legally allowed.},

OBJECTIVE: To find out the absolute fiber intake from different sources of food items in patients with IBS and healthy subjects from northern India. METHODS: Using the 72-hour recall method, dietary intake of macronutrients and fiber was determined in 33 consecutive adult patients with IBS and 33 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: The patients consumed lower amounts of macronutrients (protein 60.4 g vs 79.3 g, fat 47.7 g vs 65.7 g, and carbohydrates 294.6 g vs 339.8 g) and dietary fiber (8.1 g vs 15.7 g) than the control subjects. Though the patients consumed similar amount of pulses as the controls (46.6 [25.0] vs 46 [19.6] g/day), their fiber intake from pulses was lower (0.8 [0.7] vs 1.4 [0.9] g/day). The intake of fiber from vegetables and fruits was also significantly lower in patients (2.1 and 0.5 g/day, respectively) than in control subjects (5.8 and 3.9 g/day, respectively; p< 0.001 each). CONCLUSION: Total dietary fiber intake and intake of fiber from vegetables, fruits and pulses are lower in patients with IBS from northern India than in control subjects.},

Probiotics as living microorganisms may theoretically be responsible for 4 types of side effects in susceptible individuals: infections, deleterious metabolic activities, excessive immune stimulation, and gene transfer. Very few cases of infection have been observed. These occurred mainly in very sick patients who received probiotic drugs because of severe medical conditions. Prebiotics exert an osmotic effect in the intestinal lumen and are fermented in the colon. They may induce gaseousness and bloating. Abdominal pain and diarrhea only occur with large doses. An increase in gastroesophageal reflux has recently been associated with large daily doses. Tolerance depends on the dose and individual sensitivity factors (probably the presence of irritable bowel syndrome or gastroesophageal reflux), and may be an adaptation to chronic consumption.},

Fourteen consecutive subjects, 9M and 5F, aged 6-48, with clinical symptoms of asthma and /or conjunctivitis, rhinitis, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and irritable bowel syndrome were enrolled. Allergen-specific serum IgE were found in twelve patients. Flow-cytometric measurement of peripheral blood CD34dim/bright HPC values were assessed before and after 30 days of therapy, consisting in the oral administration of one sachet a day of ENDOLAC (UCB Pharma, Turin, Italy). Each sachet contained a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. delbrueckii and Streptococcus thermophilus for a total of 1 x 10(9) live bacteria. Circulating CD34+ cell values significantly (p < 0.001) reduced after the treatment. ENDOLAC, thus, may improve the efficacy of the standard treatments of allergic diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Alosetron hydrochloride (Lotronex), a potent selective 5-hydroxytryptamine(3) receptor antagonist, was approved in February, 2000 in the United States for the treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in women. Marketing was suspended in November, 2000, after reports of colonic ischemia and serious complications of constipation. We sought to compare the incidence of colonic ischemia, hospitalized complications of constipation, and bowel surgery among alosetron users and a cohort of patients with IBS who did not use alosetron. METHODS: We sought outcomes of colonic ischemia, hospitalized complications of constipation, and bowel surgery in 3,631 Lotronex users and 2,480 comparison IBS subjects using diagnoses, procedures, and drugs recorded in the UnitedHealthcare insurance claims database, and validated these by chart review. The initial assessment was to last for 3 yr beginning with the start of alosetron treatment and was to include 10,000 Lotronex users; however, the observation period ended by December 31, 2000, after suspension of marketing. RESULTS: There were 3631 alosetron users among members of UnitedHealthcare from March through December, 2000, and we identified 2480 comparison IBS-only patients; follow-up time averaged about 5 months in both groups. There were no instances of colonic ischemia in either cohort. Thirty instances of bowel surgery occurred, giving rates of 10.2/1000 person-yr in the alosetron cohort and 11.8/1000 person-yr in the IBS/no alosetron cohort. There were three cases of hospitalized complications of constipation. The incidence rates were essentially the same in alosetron users (1.24/1000 person-yr) and in IBS patients with no alosetron use (0.92/1000 person-yr). CONCLUSIONS: Alosetron users did not differ from IBS patients not using alosetron in the incidence of bowel surgery or hospitalized complications of constipation; there were no cases of colonic ischemia. The statistical upper limit of colonic ischemia rates in alosetron users was 2.28/1000 person-yr. Because of the market withdrawal, the size of the cohort and the duration of follow-up were smaller than originally planned; consequently, the statements about the safety of alosetron were necessarily limited. On June 7, 2002, the Food and Drug Administration approved alosetron for reintroduction in the U.S. market for women with severe diarrhea-related IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been reported to follow infectious diarrhea. Food-borne infections affect 76 million people in the United States and 9.4 million in England per year; of these, only a small percentage of patients see their doctor, and even fewer will have stool culture confirmation. We hypothesized that patients who present to their doctor with gastroenteritis and have positive stool samples may be different from the normal population with regard to their pre-existing bowel symptoms. Our aim was to determine if patients with bacterial gastroenteritis were more likely to have prior IBS, functional dyspepsia, or functional diarrhea, compared with a control population. METHODS: Between January, 2000 and January, 2001, subjects with stool positive bacterial gastroenteritis and control subjects from the same primary care practice were invited to participate. The main outcome measure was the presence of IBS, functional dyspepsia, or functional diarrhea diagnosed using self-report Rome II modular questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 217 people with recent bacterial gastroenteritis and 265 community controls consented to participate in the study. Of these, 89/217 cases and 46/265 controls had one of the functional GI disorders (OR = 3.3; 95% CI = 2.17-5.00). IBS was present in 67 cases (31%) and 26 controls (10%) (OR = 4.1; 95% CI = 2.49-6.72). There was no statistically significant difference in the presence of prior functional dyspepsia or functional diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: IBS is more frequent before diagnosis in people with bacterial gastroenteritis presenting to their primary care physician than in community controls. Studies that examine the rate of IBS after bacterial gastroenteritis need to carefully exclude people with prior IBS in a systematic way.},

   abstract = {Treatment of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is frustrated by the low efficacy of antibiotics. Elemental diets have been shown to reduce enteric flora. In this study, we evaluate the ability of an elemental diet to normalize the lactulose breath test (LBT) in IBS subjects with abnormal breath test findings. Consecutive subjects with IBS and abnormal LBT suggesting the presence of bacterial overgrowth underwent a 2-week exclusive elemental diet. The diet consisted of Vivonex Plus (Novartis Nutrition Corp., Minneapolis, MN) in a quantity based on individual caloric requirement. On day 15 (prior to solid food), subjects returned for a follow-up breath test and those with an abnormal LBT were continued on the diet for an additional 7 days. The ability of an elemental diet to normalize the LBT was determined for days 15 and 21. A chart review was then conducted to evaluate any clinical benefit 1 month later. Of the 93 subjects available for analysis, 74 (80%) had a normal LBT on day 15 of the elemental diet. When those who continued to day 21 were included, five additional patients normalized the breath test (85%). On chart review, subjects who successfully normalized their breath test had a 66.4 +/- 36.1% improvement in bowel symptoms, compared to 11.9 +/- 22.0% in those who failed to normalize (P < 0.001). An elemental diet is highly effective in normalizing an abnormal LBT in IBS subjects, with a concomitant improvement in clinical symptoms.},

We mailed surveys to 1331 eligible participants, and 571 (43%) were returned. A new health problem following infection was reported by 153 (27%) of the respondents: 12 (8%) reported new onset of joint pain and 53 (35%) reported new gastrointestinal symptoms, of whom 38 reported persistent diarrhea, including 2 who reported irritable bowel syndrome. Three respondents reported hair loss. The frequency, nature, and etiology of these complications merit further investigation.},

   abstract = {About 10,000 years ago domestication and farming of wheat and other cereals developed in the 'Fertile Crescent', an area including modern Turkey, Iraq and Iran. Agriculture then slowly spread from Middle East to Europe. Coeliac disease is the permanent intolerance to dietary gluten, the major protein component of wheat. It has been until relatively recently hypothesised that wheat consumption exerted a negative selective pressure on genes predisposing to coeliac disease, eventually leading to higher coeliac disease frequency in Northeastern Europe because of lack of exposure to cereals. This theory is at variance with recent studies showing that coeliac disease is as common in Middle Eastern countries as in Europe. High prevalence of coeliac disease has been found in Iran, in both the general population and at-risk groups, e.g. patients with irritable bowel syndrome or type 1 diabetes. Clinical manifestations of coeliac disease vary markedly with the age of the patient, the duration and the extent of disease. Clinical studies showed that presentation with non-specific symptoms or no symptoms is as common in the Middle East as in Europe. Wheat represented a major component of the Iranian diet for many centuries and it may be argued that the continuous and high level of exposure to wheat proteins has induced some degree of immune tolerance, leading to milder symptoms that may be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome or unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. The gluten-free diet represents a real challenge to both patients and clinicians in this area. This is particularly difficult in the absence of any supply for gluten-free diet in Middle Eastern countries.},

METHODS: All relevant papers published on partially hydrolyzed guar gum were reviewed and the results summarized. RESULTS: Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a water-soluble dietary fiber with a wide range of uses in clinical nutrition. Its low viscosity allows its use in enteral products and beverages. PHGG can be added to enteral formulas and food products as a dietary fiber source. PHGG provides the benefits associated with dietary fiber ingestion. Addition of PHGG to the diet reduced laxative dependence in a nursing home population. PHGG also reduced the incidence of diarrhea in septic patients receiving total enteral nutrition and reduced symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. PHGG also increased production of Bifidobacterium in the gut. CONCLUSION: The ease of use of PHGG and its clinical effectiveness make it a good choice in clinical nutrition practice.},

The subjects were submitted to the skin prick test with 9 food antigen extracts, for a total of 387 skin tests (9 per volunteer). Of the 126 tests applied to group I, 24 (19.4%) were positive (a 3-mm wider papule than the negative control) and of the 135 tests applied to group II, 3 (2.3%) were positive. Of the 126 tests applied to group III, 6 (4%) were positive. The number of positive responses obtained in group I (IBS) differed significantly from the other 2 groups (P < 0.01). None of the volunteers with IBS reported intolerance to any isolated food. The higher reactivity to food antigens in group I compared to groups II and III suggests that intestinal permeability may be increased in patients with IBS.},

Management can be difficult and treatment unrewarding; these facts have led physicians and patients toward alternative therapies. We explored a variety of treatments that exist beyond the scope of commonly used therapies for irritable bowel syndrome. Guarded optimism exists for traditional Chinese medicine and psychological therapies, but further well-designed trials are needed. Oral cromolyn sodium may be useful in chronic unexplained diarrhea and appears as effective as and safer than elimination diets. The roles of lactose and fructose intolerance remain poorly understood. Alterations of enteric flora may play a role in irritable bowel syndrome, but supporting evidence for bacterial overgrowth or probiotic therapy is lacking.},

METHODS: DESIGN: Trial of HFD alone (Group 1) followed by a randomized, double-blind trial of HFD with paroxetine or placebo (Group 2). SETTING: Gastroenterology office in a 524-bed university-affiliated community hospital in Pittsburgh. PATIENTS: Men and women, aged 18-65 yr, previously diagnosed with IBS but otherwise healthy. INTERVENTION: Institution of HFD in 98 participants consuming low- or average-fiber diets. Allocation of paroxetine to 38 and placebo to 43 symptomatic participants consuming HFDs. MEASUREMENTS: Overall well-being, abdominal pain, and abdominal bloating (Groups 1 and 2); food avoidance, work functioning, and social functioning (Group 2). RESULTS: In Group 1, overall well-being improved in 26% patients, and abdominal pain and bloating decreased in 22% and 26% patients, respectively, with an HFD. In Group 2, overall well-being improved more with paroxetine than with placebo (63.3%vs 26.3%; p= 0.01), but abdominal pain, bloating, and social functioning did not. With paroxetine, food avoidance decreased (p= 0.03) and work functioning was marginally better (p= 0.08). Before unblinding, more paroxetine recipients than placebo recipients wanted to continue their study medication (84%vs 37%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The difference in overall well-being found in our paroxetine/placebo trial is greater than that found in previously published drug/placebo trials for IBS. Moreover, the difference in well-being applied to nondepressed recipients of paroxetine.},

   abstract = {The therapeutic management of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is ineffective and not satisfying either patients or practitioners. Research in functions of the enteric nervous system and its interaction with the central nervous system is the basis for the development of emerging pharmaceuticals in therapy of the IBS. These pharmaceuticals include agents such as opioid agonists, psychotropic agents and particularly serotonin receptor modulators. These novel pharmaceuticals aim to provide a more comprehensive approach in the therapy of the IBS and will serve both patients and practitioners. So far, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved two agents specifically for the treatment of the IBS, both belonging to the group of serotonin receptor modulators. However, questions remain whether a single therapy is sufficient in the management of IBS because this disease is influenced by biological and psychological as well as cultural and social factors.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders. The prevalence rate is 10-20% and women have a higher prevalence. IBS adversely affects quality of life and is associated with health care use and costs. IBS comprises a group of functional bowel disorders in which abdominal discomfort or pain is associated with defecation or a change in bowel habit, and with features of disordered defecation. The consensus definition and criteria for IBS have been formalized in the "Rome II criteria". Food, psychiatric disorders, and gastroenteritis are risk factors for developing IBS. The mechanism in IBS involves biopsychosocial disorders; psychosocial factors, altered motility, and heightened sensory function. Brain-gut interaction is the most important in understanding the pathophysiology of IBS. Effective management requires an effective physician-patient relationship. Dietary treatment, lifestyle therapy, behavioral therapy, and pharmacologic therapy play a major role in treating IBS. Calcium polycarbophil can benefit IBS patients with constipation or alternating diarrhea and constipation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Experimental and clinical studies have shown that a novel symbiotic (known as SCM-III) exerts a beneficial effect on gut translocation and local and systemic inflammatory and microbial metabolic parameters. The present investigation was a preliminary trial on the effectiveness of SCM-III for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Sixty-eight consecutive adult patients with IBS who were free from lactose malabsorption, abdominal surgery, overt psychiatric disorders and ongoing psychotropic drug therapy or ethanol abuse were studied prospectively and divided into 2 groups that were comparable for age, gender, body size, education and pattern of presenting symptoms. The 2 groups were blindly given for 12 weeks either SCM-III 10 mL t.i.d or the same dosage of heat-inactivated symbiotic. RESULTS: Treatment with SCM-III was 'effective' or 'very effective' in more than 80% of the patients (P < 0.01 vs baseline values and control). Less than 5% reported 'not effective' as the final evaluation compared with over 40% of patients in the control group. After 6 weeks of treatment, a significant improvement of pain and bloating was reported in the treatment group compared with control and baseline values. There was also a benefit for bowel habits, mostly for patients with constipation or alternating bowel habits. No overt clinical or biochemical adverse side-effects were recorded. CONCLUSION: Compared with baseline values and the control group, SCM-III resulted in a significant increase in lactobacilla, eubacteria and bifidobacteria, which suggests that some selected IBS patients could benefit substantially from symbiotics, but the treatment may need to be given on a cyclic schedule because of the temporary modification of the fecal flora.},

   abstract = {Diverticular disease of the colon is very common in developed countries with its prevalence increasing with age, varying from < 10% in those < 40 years of age, to an estimated 50-66% of patients > 80 years of age. Diverticulitis, defined as inflammation and/or infection associated with diverticula, is the most common clinical complication of this disorder, affecting an estimated 10-25% of patients with colonic diverticula. The therapeutic measures aim at putting the intestine 'at rest', thus resolving the infection, the consequences of the inflammation and preventing or limiting complications. For patients with severe and complicated diverticulitis, ampicillin, gentamicin, metronidazole, piperacillin and tazobactam are the antibiotics successfully used in clinical practice, whereas ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and more recently, rifaximin, have been successfully used in the treatment of uncomplicated diverticular disease. Mesalazine (alone or in association with antibiotics) and probiotics are the two latest therapies for the treatment of diverticulitis which have been developed in the last few years. In fact, the combination of mesalazine and an antibiotic showed significant superiority in improving the severity of symptoms, bowel habits and in preventing symptomatic recurrence of diverticulitis than antibiotics alone, but probiotics also seem to be effective in preventing recurrence of the disease. In light of the excellent results obtained in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, it is probable that probiotics may be the future best treatment also for mild-to-moderate uncomplicated attacks of acute diverticulitis, especially if used with salycilates.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effects of probiotics on gut dysfunction in postinfective irritable bowel syndrome are unknown. We tested whether probiotics influence persistent muscle hypercontractility in mice after recovery from infection with Trichinella spiralis and analyzed the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Mice were gavaged with Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Bifidobacterium longum, or Bifidobacterium lactis in spent culture medium from days 10 to 21 after infection. Additional mice received heat-inactivated Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus paracasei -free spent culture medium, or heat-inactivated Lactobacillus paracasei -free spent culture medium. Lactobacilli enumeration, immunohistochemistry, and cytokine detection (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were performed. Mice were also treated with Lactobacillus paracasei or Lactobacillus paracasei -free spent culture medium from days 18 to 28 after infection. Contractility was measured on days 21 and 28 after infection. RESULTS: Lactobacillus paracasei, but not Lactobacillus johnsonii, Bifidobacterium lactis, or Bifidobacterium longum, attenuated muscle hypercontractility. This was associated with a reduction in the Trichinella spiralis -associated T-helper 2 response and a reduction in transforming growth factor-beta1, cyclooxygenase-2, and prostaglandin E 2 levels in muscle. Attenuation of muscle hypercontractility by Lactobacillus paracasei -free spent culture medium was abolished after heat treatment. Improvement of muscle hypercontractility at day 28 after infection was also observed after the administration of Lactobacillus paracasei or Lactobacillus paracasei -free spent culture medium from day 18 after infection. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics show strain-dependent attenuation of muscle hypercontractility in an animal model of postinfective irritable bowel syndrome. This likely occurs via both a modulation of the immunologic response to infection and a direct effect of Lactobacillus paracasei or a heat-labile metabolite on postinfective muscle hypercontractility. Lactobacillus paracasei may be useful in the treatment of postinfective irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {The intestinal microbiota interacts with several aspects of gastrointestinal function that may affect the expression or progression of disease. For example, a role for bacterial metabolism of bile acids and food has been linked to colorectal cancer development. Studies have also shown a potential role of the intestinal microbiota in the modulation of inflammation in the intestine and joints. Normal gut physiology is molded by the interaction between the intestinal microbiota and the host's gastrointestinal tissues, including motility, absorption and secretion, and intestinal permeability. Early studies in axenic mice demonstrated gross morphological abnormalities and gut motor dysfunction related to the absence of a normal microflora, raising the possibility that shifts in commensal bacterial populations could play a role in the development of altered motility states including functional disorders of the gut. This chapter concentrates on the experimental evidence for a role of intestinal microbiota and the potential therapeutic value of probiotics in functional diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {AIM: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disorder in the Western population, but detailed population-based data in China are limited. The aim of this study was to understand the epidemiology of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux (SGER) in adults of Xi'an, a northwestern city of China, and to explore the potential risk factors of GERD. METHODS: Symptoms suggestive of GERD, functional dyspepsia (FD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), upper respiratory diseases and some potential risk factors were investigated in a face-to-face manner in a region-stratified random samples of 2789 residents aged 18-70 years in Xi'an by using a standardized questionnaire. METHODS: With a response rate of 91.8%, the prevalence of SGER was 16.98% (95% CI, 14.2-18.92) in Xi'an adults, and no gender-related difference was observed (P<0.05). SGER was more common among subjects aged 30-70 years than in those aged 18-29 years (P<0.01). The prevalence of SGER in rural, urban and suburban subjects was 21.07%, 17.44% and 12.12%, respectively, and there was a significant difference between rural, urban and suburban regions (P<0.05). Compared with subjects without SGER, the prevalence of symptoms suggestive of FD and IBS, pneumonia, asthma, bronchitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, chronic cough, wheeze, globus sensation, oral ulcer and snore was significantly increased in subjects with SGER (P<0.01). Heavy smoking (OR=5.76; CI, 3.70-6.67), heavy alcohol use (OR=2.85; CI, 1.67-4.49), peptic ulcer (OR=5.76; CI, 3.99-8.32), cerebral palsy (OR=3.97; CI, 1.97-8.00), abdominal operation (OR=2.69; CI, 1.75-4.13), obesity (OR=2.16; CI, 1.47-3.16), excessive food intake (OR=1.43; CI, 1.17-1.15), sweet food (OR=1.23; CI, 0.89-1.54), and consumption of coffee (OR=1.23; CI, 0.17-2.00) were independently associated with SGER. The episodes of GERD were commonly precipitated by dietary factors (66.05%), followed by body posture (26.54%), ill temper (23.72%), fatigue (22.32%) and stress (10.93%). CONCLUSION: GERD is common in Xi'an's adult population with a mild or moderate degree. The etiology and pathogenesis of GERD are probably associated with FD, IBS, and some respiratory, laryngopharyngeal and odontostological diseases or symptoms. Some lifestyles, diseases and dietary factors are the risk factors of GERD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of evaluated treatments for recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children. METHODS: Online bibliographic databases were searched for the terms "recurrent abdominal pain," "functional abdominal pain," "children," or "alternative therapies" in articles classified as randomized controlled trials. The abstracts or full text of 57 relevant articles were examined; 10 of these met inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria required that the study involve children aged 5 to 18 years, subjects have a diagnosis of RAP, and that subjects were allocated randomly to treatment or control groups. The methodology and findings of these articles were evaluated critically, and data were extracted from each article regarding study methods, specific interventions, outcomes measured, and results. RESULTS: Studies that evaluated famotidine, pizotifen, cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and peppermint oil enteric-coated capsules showed a decrease in measured pain outcomes for those who received the interventions when compared with others in control groups. The studies that evaluated dietary interventions had conflicting results, in the case of fiber, or showed no efficacy, in the case of lactose avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for efficacy of treatment of RAP in children was found for therapies that used famotidine, pizotifen, cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and peppermint oil enteric-coated capsules. The effects of dietary fiber were less conclusive, and the use of a lactose-free diet showed no improvement. There seemed to be greater improvement when therapy (famotidine, pizotifen, peppermint oil) was targeted to the specific functional gastrointestinal disorder (dyspepsia, abdominal migraine, irritable bowel syndrome). The behavioral interventions seemed to have a general positive effect on children with nonspecific RAP. Many of these therapies have not been used widely as standard treatment for children with RAP. Although the mechanism of action for each effective therapy is not fully understood, each is believed to be safe for use in RAP.},

Dietary management of functional gastrointestinal conditions is an attractive therapeutic option for the patient and physician alike because it is safe and economical and empowers the patient to help themselves. However, in practice, dietary manipulation frequently yields rather disappointing results. Exclusion diets can be helpful, but are labor intensive and occasionally can be very restrictive. Laboratory testing for immunoglobulin E food antibodies usually is not helpful, except in a small subgroup of patients with diarrhea, predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and atopy. There is some preliminary evidence to suggest that elimination diets based on immunoglobulin G food antibody testing may possibly have therapeutic potential in IBS, but this requires confirmation.},

Both had a profound inhibitory effect upon populations seen as important for gut health (bifidobacteria, lactobacilli). However, a tetracycline resistant Lactobacillus was enriched from the experiments. A combination of genotypic and phenotypic characterisation confirmed its identity as Lactobacillus plantarum. This strain exerted powerful inhibitory effects against Candida albicans. Because of its ability to resist the effects of tetracycline, this organism may be useful as a probiotic for the improved management of yeast related conditions such as thrush and irritable bowel syndrome.},

METHODS: A questionnaire was used to screen IBS by face-to-face interviews according to Manning (modified including symptoms of constipation) and Rome II criteria. Random clustered sampling involving permanent inhabitants aged 18 - 80 years was carried out under stratification of urban and suburban areas. Potential risk factors were explored by comparing the frequencies among IBS group and non-IBS group using chi(2) and logistic analysis of multivariate adjusted for age and gender. RESULTS: A total of 4178 residents (male 1907, female 2271) were investigated. Mean age among the responders was (43 +/- 14) years. The response rate was 98%. The adjusted prevalence of IBS in Guangdong province is 5.67% according to the modified Rome II criteria, and is 11.50% according to Manning criteria. There is no difference between urban and suburban areas. The female was predominant in IBS, and the ratio of male to female was 1:1.25 (Rome II) and 1:1.34 (Manning). The age was poorly correlated with the prevalence. Events including history of analgesic use such as NSAID (OR = 3.83), history of food allergies (OR = 2.68), psychological distress (OR = 2.18), life events (OR = 1.89), history of dysentery (OR = 1.63) and negative coping style (OR = 1.28) are highly associated with IBS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: IBS is a common disorder in Guangdong Province which deserves greater care and further investigation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The detailed population-based data on irritable bowel syndrome in South China are lacking. AIMS: To assess the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in South China and its impact on health-related quality of life. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A face-to-face interview was carried out in South China to assess the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome. Random clustered sampling of permanent inhabitants aged 18-80 years was carried out under stratification of urban and suburban areas. The impact of irritable bowel syndrome on health-related quality of life was evaluated using the Chinese version of SF-36. RESULTS: A total of 4178 subjects (1907 male and 2271 female) were interviewed. The adjusted prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in South China is 11.50% according to the Manning criteria and 5.67% according to the Rome II criteria. Factors including history of analgesic use such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (odds ratio 3.83), history of food allergies (odds ratio 2.68), psychological distress (odds ratio 2.18), life events (odds ratio 1.89), history of dysentery (odds ratio 1.63) and negative coping style (odds ratio 1.28) were significantly associated with the presence of irritable bowel syndrome (P < 0.05). Irritable bowel syndrome was significantly associated with a decrement in health-related quality of life score. CONCLUSION: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder in South China and has a negative impact on health-related quality of life.},

   abstract = {In this paper the ecological aspects of widespread antibiotic consumption are described. Many practitioners, veterinarians, breeders, farmers and analysts work on the assumption that a antibiotics undergo spontaneous degradation. It is well documented that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics has led to the water contamination, selection and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant organisms, alteration of fragile ecology of the microbial ecosystems. The damages caused by the overuse of antibiotics include hospital, waterborne and foodborne infections by resistant bacteria, enteropathy (irritable bowel syndrome, antibiotic-associated diarrhea etc.), drug hypersensitivity, biosphere alteration, human and animal growth promotion, destruction of fragile interspecific competition in microbial ecosystems etc. The consequences of heavy antibiotic use for public and environmental health are difficult to assess: utilization of antibiotics from the environment and reduction of irrational use is the highest priority issue. This purpose may be accomplished by bioremediation, use of probenecid for antibiotic dosage reduction and by adoption of hospital infections methodology for control resistance in natural ecosystems.},
