   abstract = {Measurements of the hemodynamic parameters of the superior mesenteric artery were performed in 18 patients with celiac disease. Ten were studied at the time of diagnosis, when a small bowel biopsy showed a flat mucosa. The remaining eight patients were studied after complete clinical and histological recovery induced by a gluten-free diet. Doppler ultrasound flowmetry was used to measure blood flow in physiological and fasting conditions and after a mixed liquid test meal (Ensure-Plus). The results were compared with those of healthy subjects (N = 7). Mean basal flow was 50% higher in untreated celiac disease patients than in healthy controls and patients with chronic pancreatitis (P = NS). Postprandial mesenteric blood flow was significantly increased (P < 0.002) and delayed in time (P < 0.005) in celiac disease as compared to controls. Successful treatment reduced the mesenteric blood flow in celiac disease to normal values. Our study demonstrates that pathophysiological changes in the small bowel mucosa during the active clinical phase of celiac disease induce an abnormal splanchnic circulation.},

   abstract = {Oral immunization with gliadin (GLI) can induce immunoglobulin A mesangial deposits (IgA nephropathy [IgAN]) in mice. A role for GLI in human IgAN has been inferred from an association with celiac disease, increased serum anti-GLI IgA in patients with IgAN, and benefit from a gluten-free diet observed in some IgAN patients. These effects might be due to the antigenic or lectinic properties of GLI. The aim of our study was to investigate whether GLI binding to glycosylated residues (ie, lectinic activity) favors binding of GLI to cultured rat mesangial cells, bridging IgA macromolecules. We also sought to determine whether GLI binding alters mesangial cell function. Gliadin binds to rat mesangial cells in the third and fourth passages, as determined by immunofluorescence. Gliadin binding is inhibited by co-incubation with 1 mol/L N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and 1 mol/L alpha-D-mannose, sugars competitive for this lectinic bond. Quantification by biotinylated GLI revealed a significant dose-dependent binding of GLI (P < 0.001) inhibited by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (P < 0.05). Some saccharolytic enzymes, like invertase, modify the cell surface to decrease GLI binding (P < 0.02). In addition, GLI promoted the binding of purified mouse polymeric IgA to mesangial cells. The binding of GLI to mesangial cells modulates arachidonic acid metabolism by cultured mesangial cells, significantly inhibiting prostaglandin E2 production (P < 0.02), increasing synthesis of thromboxane B2 (P < 0.01) and tumor necrosis factor (P < 0.001), but not interleukin-1 beta. These responses were abrogated by co-incubation with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and/or pretreatment with invertase. Non-immune binding of an environmental alimentary lectin, GLI, to mesangial cells in culture might favor the binding of IgA and IgAIC to mesangial cells, enhancing both IgA mesangial trapping and in situ IgA deposit formation. This could occur via GLI-specific antibodies or by virtue of the binding of nonspecific IgA on a lectinic basis, or both. Moreover, related changes in eicosanoid synthesis might stimulate mesangial cell growth and mesangial matrix production, together with mesangial cell contraction, contributing to the pathogenesis of IgAN.},

The aim of this study is to assess whether in coeliac children breath hydrogen excretion reflects the histological changes in the jejunal mucosa. Hydrogen breath test was performed on 40 children (15 males 25 females) divided into three groups. Group I (controls): 9 children with symptoms suggestive of coeliac disease who, after the appropriate workup, were found to suffer from other gastrointestinal disorders and had abnormal jejunal mucosa. Group II: 14 children who had been diagnosed as coeliacs according to the ESPGAN criteria, were kept on a gluten free diet for a minimum of 6 months and had a normal jejunal mucosa. Group III: 17 coeliac children who ate small quantities of gluten or were on a normal diet. At histology, 10 of them showed a total and 7 a partial atrophy of the jejunal mucosa. Breath hydrogen levels were measured both at baseline and after ingestion of a 2% sorbitol solution in water, at 30 minute intervals for four hours. The peak hydrogen level and the total surface area under the hydrogen excretion curve were also assessed. Coeliac children on a gluten containing diet excrete significantly more H2 than controls or coeliacs on a gluten free diet. Patients with more severe histological lesions had higher peak H2 levels and greater total excretion areas. In coeliac children, sorbitol breath H2 test represents a simple noninvasive technique to detect impaired jejunal function and it should have an important role as a screening test and in assessing dietary compliance.},

From 8 coeliac patients specimens were taken before dietary treatment. Specimens were analysed from 7 patients on gluten free diet and from 5 after gluten challenge. In addition, 11 control specimens were studied. The cells of each IgG and IgA subclass were present in significantly higher densities in the specimens from the children with coeliac disease on a normal diet than in those from controls. The distribution of the different IgA and IgG subclasses did not differ significantly from that of controls. The significant increase of cells containing the different IgG and IgA subclasses in the small intestinal mucosa of coeliac children indicates that these cells play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The analysis of these cells may help in the histological diagnosis of coeliac disease.},

Its frequency in patients referred for jejunal biopsy has been examined. METHODS: Serum IgG and IgA antigliadin antibody, jejunal fluid IgA and IgM antibodies to gliadin, ovalbumin and beta lactoglobulin, and jejunal fluid IgA and IgM concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Seventeen of 19 celiac patients on normal diet and 16 of 23 on gluten-free diet had the celiaclike antibody pattern, as did 41 of 217 other patients. Jejunal biopsy histology had been classified as normal in 38 of these, with minor abnormalities in 3; however, intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) counts were high in 13 cases. Trial of a gluten-free diet produced clinical improvement in 6 of 7 antibody-positive patients. After extra dietary gluten, one developed subtotal villous atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: The celiaclike intestinal antibody pattern and a high IEL count may be markers of latent gluten-sensitive enteropathy; some of these patients are clinically gluten sensitive in the absence of enteropathy.},

The original diagnosis had been made in childhood in all patients. Fifty eight (45%) of the subjects were following a gluten free diet, 23 (18%) were following a gluten free diet but with occasional gluten consumption, and 47 (37%) had adopted an unrestricted, gluten containing diet for a mean of 11.2 years. There was no correlation in individual subjects between the presence of symptoms, biochemical and immunological abnormalities, severity of histological findings, and the amount of dietary gluten, despite the greater frequency of symptoms in the group following an unrestricted diet than in the other two groups. Short stature and epilepsy with cerebral calcifications only occurred in patients following an unrestricted diet. As only diagnosis based on two or three biopsy samples and regular follow up correlated positively with dietary compliance, it is suggested that a histologically confirmed diagnosis of coeliac disease and regular lifelong follow up are essential in the management of these patients.},

The purpose of this study was to systematically address this topic by means of intraluminal pressure recordings in a series of such patients. Sixteen subjects (nine adults, seven children, age range 2-69 years) with celiac sprue were recruited and studied while untreated. Manometric examination was carried out for 6 hr during fasting and 3 hr after a meal. Adult celiac patients displayed a significantly (mean +/- SEM) greater frequency of migrating motor complexes in comparison to controls during fasting (4.44 +/- 1.6 vs 2.45 +/- 0.20, P < 0.01), whereas no differences were found in the pediatric group with respect to this variable. Fasting motor abnormalities, chiefly represented by discrete clustered contractions, giant jejunal contractions, and bursts of nonpropagated contractions, were discovered in a high percentage in both groups of celiac subjects (89% in adults and 44% in children, respectively). Similar abnormalities were observed in the postprandial period, especially in adults. In conclusion, patients with celiac sprue frequently display discrete gastrointestinal motor abnormalities, which though perhaps nonspecific may account for several symptoms complained of by such patients.},

Standard dosing consisted of 500 U lipase/kg body weight/meal, 250 U lipase/kg body weight/snack; high dosing consisted of 1,500 U lipase/kg body weight/meal, 750 U lipase/kg body weight/snack. Doses were determined by units of lipase/kg body weight to provide dosing consistency among patients of varying size. Each patient was on a regular diet of approximately 100 g of fat per day. Two separate, 72-h stool collections were performed between markers. A significant difference in mean percentage fat absorbed between the standard dose and the high dose was found (86% versus 91%, p < 0.05). Subjects were then stratified into two groups, based on the grams of fecal fat eliminated (GFFE) as follows: Group 1 with < or = 7 GFFE/24 h on both dosages (n = 7) and Group 2 with > 7 GFFE/24 h on either dose (n = 14). A significant difference (p < 0.05) between Group 1 (96%) and Group 2 (88%) was noted in the percentage fat absorbed while on the high dose. Fat absorption improved from 81% to 88%, (p < 0.05) in Group 2. During the study period, the adverse reactions of constipation or elevated serum uric acid levels were not observed. The increased doses of pancreatic enzymes resulted in improved correction of steatorrhea.},

The test was a diffusion-in-gel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DIG-ELISA). Of these 191, 14 (7.3%) appeared to have untreated celiac disease. Depending on the choice of cut-off value of the test (combined determination of IgA and IgG), the sensitivity was 86-100%, the specificity was 97-99%, and the positive/negative predictive values were 70-92% and 99-100%, respectively. No variation according to age was found. Gliadin antibodies were determined in 47 children who had well-treated celiac disease. Fourteen of these children were also investigated when challenged with gluten. Gliadin antibodies (IgA or IgG) decreased significantly in 13 of 13 cases when the patients shifted from a gluten-containing diet to a gluten-free one. During the gluten challenge, the IgG and IgA increased in 14 of 14 and 11 of 14 cases, respectively (two patients suffered from IgA deficiency). In eight patients who later appeared to be free of celiac disease, the gliadin antibodies were determined on gluten-free diet and during gluten challenge; no significant differences in gliadin antibodies were found. We conclude that this test is useful in selecting patients with symptoms suggesting celiac disease for a small-intestinal biopsy. The test seems to be of some value in monitoring the effects of a gluten-free diet and during gluten challenge.},

   abstract = {Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), is associated with skin eruptions and granular depositions of IgA in the papillary dermis, but this is not a feature of coeliac disease (CD). The specificity of the IgA in the skin is unknown. High molecular weight glutenin (HMW-g), a component of gluten, has been shown to have structural similarities to human elastin. This paper reports immunoadsorption studies which suggest that human serum may contain antibodies which cross-react with HMW-g and elastin. DH patients had significantly lower levels of IgA antibodies to HMW-g and to elastin than both CD patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, introduction of a gluten-free diet (GFD) was associated with a further reduction in the amount of IgA antibodies to elastin in the DH patients. This diet-associated decrease of elastin antibodies was restricted to the IgA isotype. A significant correlation was observed between IgA antibodies to HMW-g and elastin in healthy controls and CD patients, while no such correlation was found in patients with DH. These findings could indicate that HMW-g induces production of antibodies to elastin, which are deposited in the skin, and that when the antigenic stimulus is removed, these antibodies are further reduced due to continuous dermal deposition. It is postulated that DH may be an autoimmune disease due to cross-reactivity between dietary glutenin and dermal elastin.},

Gluten and gliadin antibodies were positive, and the jejunal biopsy revealed villous atrophy consistent with the diagnosis of coeliac disease. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis showed a mean haemosiderin score (Golde index) of 240, and a local suppressor/cytotoxic profile on immunocytology. Both clinical and immunological improvement was obtained after a month of gluten-free diet. These immunological findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of this disease.},

After gluten challenge followed by villous atrophy, 78.5% of patients were positive for AGA IgA, 85.71% for AGA IgG and 100% for AEA. Anti-endomysium antibodies were absent both in healthy controls both in control disease patients, while sometimes antigliadin antibodies were present in patients with various intestinal pathology (AGA IgA in 1.44% and AGA IgG in 7.2% of cases).

Screening was divided into three levels: first, IgG and IgA antigliadin antibody (AGA) assay on capillary blood obtained by finger prick; second, AGA plus IgA anti-endomysium antibody (AEA) test and measurement of serum immunoglobulins in venous blood; and third, intestinal biopsy. 3351 students (66% of the eligible population) aged 11-15 years attended first-level screening. 71 (2%) were recalled because of AGA positivity; 18 of these satisfied second-level criteria and underwent intestinal biopsy. Coeliac disease was diagnosed in 11 subjects, most of whom had no serious symptoms. Selective IgA deficiency was found in 4 subjects, 1 of whom also had coeliac disease. The prevalence of subclinical coeliac disease in the study group was 3.28 per 1000. Coeliac disease screening is feasible and involves only slight discomfort to the general population. Such screening can detect large numbers of cases of coeliac disease, which can be treated with a gluten-free diet. Many subclinical cases of coeliac disease would not be detected by screening only a selected group of at-risk patients.},

   abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic ingestion of small amounts of gliadin on children with coeliac disease. A four week challenge was performed on 20 children who had been on a gluten free diet for mean (SD) 14 (3) months. They were given a daily dose of either 100 mg (group A, n = 10, mean age 4 (2) years) or 500 mg of gliadin (group B, mean age 5 (3) years). The effects of the gliadin were monitored by morphometric study of the jejunal mucosa, intestinal permeability test with cellobiose/mannitol, and serum antigliadin antibody test. After the challenge, group A patients showed a significant increase in the mean intraepithelial lymphocyte count (before challenge 11 (3), afterwards 19 (6)) and a decrease in the villous height/crypt depth ratio (beforehand 1.5 (0.1), afterwards 1.3 (0.2)), while the intestinal permeability test remained normal and the IgA-antigliadin antibody increased in four of 10 children. After the challenge group B showed more pronounced histological changes, an increase in the mean urinary cellobiose/mannitol % (beforehand 0.028 (0.020), afterwards 0.058 (0.028)), and IgA-antigliadin antibody positivity in six of eight subjects. The discriminant analysis function showed that the pretreatment group, group A after challenge, and group B after challenge were correctly classified in 90% of cases by functions based on the individual intraepithelial lymphocyte count and the villous height/crypt depth ratio. This study shows that chronic ingestion of small amounts of gluten causes dose-dependent damage to the small intestinal mucosa in children with coeliac disease. The predictive value of laboratory tests, such as the antigliadin antibody test and the intestinal permeability test seems to be lower in treated patients than in those with active coeliac disease.},

In a 13-month study, we examined the usefulness of screening for these antibodies in the diagnosis of coeliac disease in children. Twenty-one of 223 (9.4%) serum samples [or 17 of 192 (9%) children undergoing investigation for GI disorders] were found to be positive for serum IgA class endomysial antibodies. These included eight strong positives, eight positives, and five weak positives. One-hundred-thirty-four children had small bowel biopsies performed. Endomysial antibodies were found in all children with severe villous atrophy on a gluten-containing diet who were diagnosed as having coeliac disease. Three children with positive and four with weak-positive results did not have coeliac disease. One had partial villous atrophy consistent with the diagnosis of cow-milk-sensitive enteropathy and the others had a normal small bowel mucosa. This study confirms a strong association between endomysial antibodies and coeliac disease; however, not all cases with positive antibodies had the disease. At the present time, small bowel biopsy remains essential for the diagnosis of coeliac disease.},

The incidences of malignant diseases and the survival rate in coeliac patients were compared with those in the Finnish population. Ten coeliac patients developed a cancer during the follow up (mean 5.3 years, range 1-12) but none had a lymphoma. The risk of malignant diseases in coeliac patients did not differ from that in the Finnish population in general. Eleven coeliac patients died during the follow up. The five year survival rates of coeliac patients did not differ from those in the general population. At least 83% of the coeliac patients adhered strictly to the gluten free diet, which may explain the favourable outcome.},

The screening was performed with IgA-class reticulin and endomysium antibody, IgA- and IgG-class gliadin antibody tests, and various biochemical tests for malabsorption. None of the tested subjects had selective IgA deficiency, which excludes the possibility of not detecting positives by an IgA-class test. Of the 83 patients, three asymptomatic coeliac patients were found, and one patient with coeliac disease previously diagnosed, an overall frequency of 4.8%. In addition, 25 patients with a solitary nodule of the thyroid gland were examined and one of them (4%) was found to have coeliac disease. By contrast, one (0.4%) out of 249 age- and sex-matched blood donors was found to have coeliac disease. All newly detected coeliac patients had IgA-class gliadin, reticulin and endomysium antibodies, but none of the patients had any gastrointestinal symptoms or abnormal biochemical findings suggesting coeliac disease. Treatment of thyroid disorders and coeliac disease was successful in these patients. The present results confirm that the frequency of subclinical coeliac disease is increased among patients with autoimmune thyroid disorders. IgA-class reticulin, endomysium or gliadin antibody tests are suitable screening methods for detecting these patients, as far as selective IgA-deficiency is excluded.},

This is due to lipofuscin deposition in intestinal smooth muscle and occurs in association with malabsorption. Three cases occurring in a coeliac registry of 559 patients are described. One patient presented with acute massive bleeding per rectum, and two were diagnosed at autopsy. The syndrome may be accompanied by vitamin E deficiency and neurologic dysfunction. Two patients had evidence of peripheral neuropathy, and one had low vitamin E levels. Concomitant vitamin D deficiency was present. Fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption, especially if there is a poor response to a gluten-free diet or neuropathy, might alert the clinician to the possibility of brown-bowel syndrome and suggests careful search for lipofuscin in biopsy material, using special histologic techniques.},

DESIGN: Cohort prospective study. SETTING: All subjects were seen at the outpatient 'malabsorption' clinic of the Department of Medical Pathology I, University of Bologna (referral centre), Bologna. SUBJECTS: Eighty consecutive patients with CD (48 with classical and 32 with subclinical presentation), 15 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and 40 healthy volunteers (members of the hospital staff). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The nutritional status was evaluated by anthropometric measurements (percentage of ideal body weight for height and sex, percentage of standard triceps skinfold thickness and percentage of ideal arm-muscle circumference). RESULTS: The overall prevalence of malnutrition in our series of CD patients was 53%. Prevalence of malnutrition (actual body weight less than 90% of the ideal) was significantly higher in classical coeliacs (67%) than in subclinical ones (31%, P < 0.002), in patients with DH (13%, P < 0.0003) and in healthy volunteers (13%, P < 0.0001). At diagnosis, percentage values of ideal body weight, triceps skinfold thickness and arm-muscle circumference were significantly lower (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0002 and P < 0.0003, respectively) in classical coeliacs (84.5 +/- 10.6, 71.2 +/- 28.1 and 87.1 +/- 10.8, respectively) than in subclinical coeliacs (95.5 +/- 9.1, 105.6 +/- 41.0 and 94.8 +/- 10.6, respectively). After GFD, 33% of classical and only 3% of subclinical coeliacs were still malnourished. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of malnutrition in CD is lower than was previously thought. CD patients with classical presentation may require a longer period of GFD to achieve a significant improvement of their nutritional status, with respect to those with subclinical presentation, probably because of a greater extent of intestinal damage. Finally, a careful evaluation of dietary habits is usually sufficient to identify incomplete adherence to GFD as the reason for nonimprovement of the nutritional status in patients with CD.},

The study period has been divided into three subperiods of 6 years each (1972-1977, 1978-1983, 1984-1989). From the first to the third subperiod a significant increase in the number of new diagnoses and of the proportion of patients recognized by minor symptoms has been observed. These patients represent 50% of our series in the last 3 years of the study and 70% in 1989. Diagnosing subclinical forms of celiac sprue has significantly lowered the mean age at diagnosis and the female/male ratio. First-degree relatives of celiac patients; subjects who had a gluten-free diet for a period during childhood; patients with short stature, anemia, or amenorrhea of no obvious cause; or patients with unexplained immunological abnormalities are the groups in which most patients with subclinical celiac sprue have been found and in which potential patients should be sought. Helpful diagnostic tools include antigliadin antibody testing and the observation of absent or reduced Kerckring folds in the descending duodenum in the course of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.},

The mean height SD score showed increasing growth retardation in the year before diagnosis, relatively quick catch-up growth in the year after diagnosis, and complete catch-up in 2-3 years. Mean weight-for-height showed a progressive decrease 12-18 months before diagnosis, increased to a maximum at the end of the first year of therapy, and returned to normal 15 months after dietary treatment. Independent of age at diagnosis, initial degree of wasting, diagnostic delay, and strictness of gluten-free diet, catch-up growth was complete in this group of patients who were diagnosed before 9 years of age.},

A very close relationship was found between faecal fat, as measured by standard chemical methods, and faecal energy (r = 0.95, P < 0.001). We conclude that the determination of faecal energy, easier to measure than faecal fat, can provide reliable information about the extent of steatorrhoea in cystic fibrosis.},

Correlation with the intestinal histology at the different stages of the disease was evaluated, as well as its therapeutic monitoring ability. Fifty six children, twenty seven girls and twenty nine boys, aged six months to twelve years old, were studied. Thirty nine celiac children were al different diagnostic stages of the disease. Seventeen children with malabsorption symptoms and with normal intestinal histology were used as controls. Sixty blood samples were obtained simultaneously with the small intestinal biopsy. IgA-AGA (ELISA method) and IgA-EmA (immunofluorescent test performed over lower third Rhesus monkey esophagus) were determined in every blood sample. In 34 serum samples from patients with total or subtotal villous atrophy, two were negative for IgA-AGA and only one was negative for IgA-EmA. In 26 samples from patients with normal intestinal histology, two were positive for IgA-AGA and four were positive for IgA-EmA. The results for IgA-EmA had sensitivity 97%, specificity 84.6%, positive predictive value 89.2% and negative predictive value 95%. In the case of IgA-AGA were: sensitivity 94.1%, specificity 92.3%, positive predictive value 94.1%, negative predictive value 92.3%. IgA-AGA and IgA-EmA showed a high correlation with intestinal histology and are in combination powerful tools for the diagnosis and follow up of celiac patients. Besides, they provide a useful aid in the indication of a jejunal biopsy and in close monitoring of the dietary treatment compliance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {In a period of over 18 years the prominent medical bibliographic marks with regard to definition, diagnosis and examinations of coeliac disease (CD) have been compared and as far as possible reproduced. The results confirm the remarks derivating from wider statistics. From the beginning of 1975 to the first six months of 1993 in Merate Hospital Pediatric Division, 323 patients were submitted to a first jejunal peroral biopsy in 133 cases (41.2%) CD was diagnosed. Since 34 children (25.6%) concluded the ESPGAN diagnostic iter with 3 consecutive biopsies, the reasons why the other patients didn't finish or respect the programs are here examined. Since 1987 a specific anti-gliadin (IgA and IgG) antibodies titrimetry has been available either in the investigation of suspect symptomatology or like control mark during the assessment or after a sure CD diagnosis. Since october 1992 antiendomysium antibodies (EMA or AEA IgA) have been determined only in selected patients. From the examination of 24 subjects now checked with AGA IgA/IgG and EMA and with a first positive biopsy, it is possible to point out that only one jejunal biopsy (or at the most a second one as a control during the gluten challenge) with the guarantee of haematologic patterns doesn't raise doubts about a CD diagnosis. Analogous considerations mainly refer to the atypical CD "late onset" when a constant lack of AGA and EMA during gluten free diet (GFD) or their changes in a non compliance or in gluten challenge, can exclude a following hystological confirmation. By this experience it follows that a specific antigliadin and antiendomysium antibodies investigation is indispensable to the shortening of diagnostic times, to the reduction of an often unwelcome invasive diagnostic method and to the discovery of the "CD iceberg".},

The test showed excellent reproducibility for both anti-gliadin IgA and IgG detection. The average intraassay coefficient of variation (CV) was 3.0% for IgA and 2.4% for IgG (n = 6), while the average interassay CV was 6.4% for IgA and 4.3% for IgG (n = 3). By defining a positive test as both IgA and IgG elevated, a sensitivity of 93% in untreated coeliacs (n = 75) was observed. The corresponding specificities in healthy adults (n = 130) and healthy children (n = 77) were > 99% and 100% respectively, while in patients with other gastrointestinal disorders (disease controls) the specificity was 94% (n = 129). The test was also useful in monitoring patients, with anti-gliadin IgA and IgG falling for up to a year after commencing a gluten-free diet (GFD) (12 adults). In some patients however, antibody levels did not reach the normal cutpoint after many months on a GFD, which may reflect the patients' poor adherence to their gluten free diet. The test was superior to the Pharmacia anti-gliadin ELISA, and should be useful as an aid to the diagnosis of coeliac disease, as well as in the follow-up of treated patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The measurement of jejunal disaccharidases is used by several gastroenterologists when investigating suspected small-bowel disease. The clinical value of this analysis is assessed. METHOD: The histology and disaccharidase results in 1585 jejunal biopsy specimens were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Disaccharidase and histology results concurred in most cases (72%). However, disaccharidases were an insensitive indicator of small-bowel disease: low levels were found in only 65% of coeliac patients with villous atrophy, 15% of patients with giardiasis, and 6% of patients with villous atrophy associated with non-coeliac histology. Low disaccharidase levels were sometimes found in patients with normal histology (1.6%) and when biopsy specimens were unwittingly taken from non-jejunal sites (1.4%). Isolated low lactase activities were found in 3.2%. Usually this finding was not clinically relevant because patients had no symptoms of lactose intolerance (38%), had another diagnosis that responded to appropriate treatment (8%), or had no response to a low-lactose diet (14%). In 16 patients sucrase activities were markedly low, and this investigation proved central to the diagnosis of sucrase-alpha-dextrinase deficiency, which was subsequently confirmed in 9. CONCLUSION: Jejunal disaccharidases are clinically useful only in the diagnosis of sucrase-alpha-dextrinase deficiency. We recommend that their measurement be reserved for the investigation of patients suspected of having this condition.},

   abstract = {To study changes in rectal mucosa that might be attributable to the effects of gluten, rectal biopsy specimens from untreated and treated gluten sensitised subjects were analysed morphometrically and by immunohistochemical techniques and were compared with a series of disease control mucosae. Although morphometry showed increased populations of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and mast cells in the mucosae of untreated patients, which were reduced (except for mast cells) by dietary gluten restriction, immunohistochemical techniques were far more sensitive in defining these changes. There were highly significant increases in CD3+ and gamma delta+ lymphocytes within both the lamina propria and the epithelium while neutrophils (CD15+ cells) were not at all prominent. Activated (CD25+) lymphocytes expressing interleukin (IL)-2 receptors were increased in lamina propria, usually subjacent to basal lamina, although a few IL-2R+ intraepithelial lymphocytes were found: other IL-2R+ cells were deemed to be macrophages (CD68+). These results clearly indicate that in untreated, gluten sensitised subjects the rectal mucosa shows a lymphoplasmacytoid reaction that is responsive to gluten restriction. The absence of neutrophilia suggests that this lesion is not a conventional inflammatory type proctitis, but rather one presumed to be induced by gluten antigen(s) present in the faecal stream--that is, a cell mediated form of response.},

   abstract = {Gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea, and fecal incontinence occur frequently in diabetics with long-standing and often poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes. These motor abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract tend to be associated in these patients with evidence of autonomic neuropathy and other diabetes-related complications such as peripheral neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. The management of these derangements of motility is generally frustrating and very difficult. The prokinetic agents currently available have fewer side effects than previously used drugs, and have expanded the treatment options for diabetics with motility disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The treatment of diabetic diarrhea remains aimed at the symptom because the cause is often unknown. The diagnosis of diabetic diarrhea depends on a careful and judicious assessment, which allows for the distinction of this condition from other causes of diarrhea. For example, celiac disease can occur in insulin-dependent diabetics, but it is specifically treated by the elimination of gluten from the diet. In recent years, we have also gained a better understanding of the liver and biliary tree abnormalities that occur in the diabetic. The most common hepatobiliary lesions found in these patients include excessive glycogen deposition, fatty liver, and gallstones. Cirrhosis of the liver can develop in diabetics as a result of progressive fatty steatosis, pericentral hepatic fibrosis, and, at times, central hyaline sclerosis. Future study of the underlying pathogenesis of diabetes may one day allow us to find common threads in the seemingly disparate gastrointestinal and hepatic complications of this disease.},

It was found that the combined information from IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies gave the highest specificity (94%) and sensitivity (89%).

   abstract = {Gut immunology encompasses the need for local cellular immunity and prevention of systemic immune reactions to dietary antigens. The relation between these factors and nutritional state or the presence of luminal nutrients in the enterally fed and parenterally fed is poorly defined. Most studies suggest that acquisition of lymphoid characteristics is independent of luminal nutrition and its responsiveness is related more to bacterial challenge. Protein malnutrition may impair immune responsiveness by moderating the generalised inflammatory response, rather than through reduced T cell function and IgA synthesis. Predisposition to the development of gut hypersensitivity can be induced in animals by longterm feeding with elemental diets. The efficient absorption of these diets reduces the caecal microflora burden and together with changed gastric acid secretion and small bowel motility, may affect the composition of the gut flora. Changed luminal nutrition, enhanced tissue damage and inappropriately increased mucosal T cell function may thus be related. The clinical effectiveness, however, of elemental diets in treatment of unresponsive coeliac disease is reassuring. To investigate intestinal immunity in humans, an approach based on whole gut lavage has been developed. Data from this non-invasive human technique will prove to be a useful means of assessing the effects of nutritional rehabilitation on mucosal immunity.},

   abstract = {The clinical heterogeneity of celiac disease is well recognized, with great variability in malabsorption and in gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with active celiac disease, and the fairly common occurrence of silent celiac disease (ie, an apparently healthy individual with a flat small bowel mucosa). Research in experimental animals has shown that expression of cell-mediated immunity in the gut mucosa occurs in a spectrum of pathologies ranging from minimal enteropathy with a high count of intra-epithelial lymphocytes to the celiac-like lesion with short villi and long crypts. A similar range of pathology is seen in celiac patients in some circumstances, with low grade enteropathy occurring in the early stages of gluten challenge, in patients taking a low gluten diet, and also in some patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. In so-called latent celiac disease, sophisticated immunologic studies may reveal a high intra-epithelial lymphocyte count, an increased gamma delta intra-epithelial lymphocyte count, and a celiac-like intestinal antibody abnormality with overexpression of mucosal IgM responses. If further work confirms that one or more of these features may be the only manifestation of gluten-sensitive disease in some newly presenting patients, the current definition of celiac disease (a flat mucosa, gluten-sensitive) will need to be revised.},

Subjects were divided into two groups according to whether they committed slight dietary transgressions or adhered to a strict gluten free diet. A reference group of preadolescents with coeliac disease was also included in the study. Intestinal permeability and antigliadin antibody tests were performed on all patients. The diagnostic marker of intestinal permeability was excellent in the reference group. Neither the intestinal permeability test nor antigliadin antibody tests, however, succeeded in discriminating between the two groups of adolescents considered in this study.

In three of them brain imaging showed the presence of calcified areas in the occipital region. They had complex partial seizures (CPS), associated in two with transient episodes of blindness. In another patient with CPS and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) progressive multifocal cerebral calcifications were noted. In the other six patients with CPS and/or GTCS cerebral calcifications were absent. Symptoms of CD in all these cases were either not previously taken into account, or they were very mild or completely absent. In a group of 36 patients with clinically manifest CD, regular follow-up, and good compliance with the dietary regimen, no clinical seizures were reported.

All patients presented isolated manifestations of malabsorption, but we did not find the typical symptoms of celiac disease, like diarrhea or steatorrhea. Three patients showed an iron deficiency anemia refractory to therapy and one patient a distinct osteomalacia with spontaneous bone fractures. In all these cases we were able to point out the typical microscopic feature and tissue antibodies of the celiac disease. Treating the patients with a gluten-free diet, the symptoms disappeared. These observations demonstrate the importance of the small bowel biopsy in cases of causative unknown isolated manifestations of malabsorption, which possibly belong to the celiac disease.},

The presence of these two pathologies interfered with the intestinal absorption of L-thyroxin (L-T4) and made the appropriate management of CH difficult. A male patient, formula fed from birth, was screened for CH at 5 days of age. CH was confirmed and L-T4 treatment (6.8 micrograms/kg/day per os) begun at 35 days of age. Seen after 3 weeks because of feeding problems and impaired growth and with a serum T4 concentration of 4.7 micrograms/dl and a TSH of 56 mU/ml, his replacement dose was increased to 12 micrograms/kg/day. One week later, the child was hospitalized because of vomiting, acidosis and shock. CMPI was diagnosed and the child began a diet with a hydrolyzed milk protein food. After 7 weeks the serum T4 improved to 11 micrograms/dl, the TSH decreased to 10 mU/ml, while maintaining the 12 micrograms/kg dose. After 2 months an oral challenge with cow's milk confirmed the diagnosis of CMPI with a concomitant decrease in serum T4 to 6.4 micrograms/dl, while TSH rose to 64 mU/ml. Weight and T4 levels normalised with CMPI diet. At 12 months of age the patient presented anorexia and impaired growth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Recent advances in immunology and genetics have shed light on the underlying mechanisms and risks associated with the disease. Although the classical manifestations are well known, the wide variety of clinical presentations make celiac disease often difficult to diagnose, and the ubiquitous presence of prolamins in the Western diet make treatment challenging.},

Of the 212 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis attending between 1967 and 1992, 133 managed to take the diet, and 78 of these achieved complete control of their rash by diet alone. Of the remaining 55 patients taking a gluten-free diet, all but three were taking partial diets; over half of these patients managed to substantially reduce the dose of medication required. Of the 77 patients taking a normal diet, eight entered spontaneous remission, giving a remission rate of 10%; a further two patients who had been taking gluten-free diets were found to have remitted when they resumed normal diets. Loss of IgA from the skin was observed in 10 of 41 (24%) patients taking strict gluten-free diets. These patients had been taking their diets for an average of 13 years (range 5-24 years), and their rash had been controlled by diet alone for an average of 10 years (range 3-16 years). The advantages of a gluten-free diet in the management of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis are: (i) the need for medication is reduced or abolished; (ii) there is resolution of the enteropathy, and (iii) patients experience a feeling of well-being after commencing the diet. Thus, we propose that a gluten-free diet is the most appropriate treatment for patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.},

   abstract = {Although malnourished children are stunted, their bone maturity is usually retarded to a comparable degree. This is seen in impoverished societies as well as in diseases such as coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and hormonal deficiency. When these children are followed to adulthood they normally have some degree of spontaneous catch-up. With a change in environment, through adoption, emigration or with treatment of the disease there is usually definite catch-up growth, although it is often not to the NCHS standards. If puberty is delayed and/or growth continues into the early or mid twenties, then an acceptable final adult height is achieved. However, there may be a limitation imposed on an individual's maximum height by genetic imprinting in very early development. This may be the case where full catch-up appears to have taken place but is followed by an advanced puberty and early cessation of growth (Proos, Hofvander & Tuvemo, 1991a). The data from US slaves and cases of hormonal replacement, where treatment was initiated after age 18, each show that, if the circumstances of children in the Third World change, almost complete reversal of stunting is possible. The children can reach their own height potentials. Total reversal to affluent societal norms would probably require cross-generational catch-up. The most obvious reason why catch-up is not seen regularly is that an appropriate diet is not available over a sufficient period of time. We do not know the optimum ingredients for such a diet. Sulphur has been neglected as an essential nutrient; its economy should be examined in relation to skeletal growth in stunted populations.
PIP: Malnourished children are stunted with their bone maturity usually retarded to a comparable degree. Some degree of spontaneous catch-up is, however, usually observed when these children are followed to adulthood. Catch-up growth tends to result with a change in environment through adoption or emigration, or with treatment of the disease, albeit often not to NCHS standards. If puberty is delayed and/or growth continues into the early or mid-twenties, an acceptable final adult height is achieved. There may, however, be a limit imposed upon an individual's maximum height by genetic imprinting in very early development such as when full catch-up appears to have taken place, but is followed by an advanced puberty and early cessation of growth. Data on cases of hormonal replacement after age 18 years and for US slaves each show that almost complete reversal of stunting is possible among children in the Third World if their circumstances change. They can reach their own height potentials, although total reversal to affluent society norms would probably require cross-generational catch-up. Catch-up is not seen regularly because an appropriate diet is not available over a sufficient period of time. Finally, although optimum ingredients for such a diet are not known, it may be said that sulphur has been neglected as an essential nutrient.

   abstract = {Catch-up growth in coeliac disease was thought to be a continuous process and hence linear models have been proposed to interpret the pattern of catch-up growth. Observed longitudinal data do not fit a linear model adequately. The aim of this study is to clarify the pattern of short-term catch-up growth in coeliac patients. Twenty-one coeliac children (aged 6-24 months) entered the study and were monitored at short-time intervals. All showed a "pulsatile" pattern of growth velocity for height, weight, leg length, subscapular and triceps skinfolds. Peaks alternated with troughs at a mean time of 62 days for the whole set of measurements. The periodicity was remarkably stable. The size of the peaks decreased with time on a gluten-free diet. Catch-up growth is a discontinuous process made up of a sequence of bursts of growth followed by a resting phase. This provides strong evidence for the possibility that short-term growth may be pulsatile.},

   abstract = {Previous studies have shown that A-gliadin, a major gluten-derived peptide known to activate the gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) of coeliac disease (CD), and the non-structural E1B peptide produced during early lytic gastrointestinal infection with human adenovirus type 12 (AD12) share an identical twelve amino acid sequence. It is suggested that immunological cross reactivity between these two peptides may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CD. As a milder but histologically identical GSE is found in the majority of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), a condition also thought to be caused by dietary gluten, we postulated that AD12 may also be involved in the pathogenesis of DH. To test this we assayed sera from 40 patients with DH and 18 healthy controls for AD12-neutralizing antibodies as evidence of past viral exposure. Detectable AD12 antibodies (titre of 13 or higher) were found in only 15% (6/40) of DH patients, compared with 27.8% (5/18) controls (not significant). These findings do not support a causative role for AD12 in the pathogenesis of DH.},

In this series, of 35 patients who did not have dermatitis herpetiformis, 15 had attended family doctors and hospital outpatient departments for an average of 28 years with unexplained symptoms or abnormalities in blood tests but the diagnosis of coeliac disease had been missed. This is unsatisfactory because these patients can both manage and respond to a gluten free diet. Thirty eight patients complied strictly with the diet with resolution of symptoms. Significant improvement in weight, haemoglobin, albumin, calcium, and alkaline phosphatase values after a year on the diet also occurred. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of coeliac disease in the elderly particularly in patients with non-specific complaints in the presence of unexplained anaemia.},

   abstract = {En face autoradiography of the endothelium was used to quantify the distribution, area, and permeability of sites with enhanced permeability to 125I-low-density lipoprotein (125I-LDL) around the intercostal and celiac arteries and at the iliac bifurcation of normal rabbit aortas. The density of such sites was highest in the upper thoracic aorta and around the celiac and superior mesenteric branches and was lowest in the lower abdominal aorta. Permeable sites occurred more frequently distal to the intercostal branch orifices and both lateral and distal to the orifice at the celiac branch. At the intercostal branch orifices, these sites were larger, with a lower permeability and higher frequency than those away from the branch. At the celiac flow divider, sites of elevated autoradiographic grain density were more permeable and larger than at other locations in the abdominal aorta. Mean regional permeabilities were obtained by weighted area averages of low- and high-permeability sites. Mean regional permeabilities around the intercostal branches were 1.5 times higher than values away from the intercostal branches. Within 0.25 and 1 mm away from the celiac flow divider, mean regional permeability was 3.1 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, than those away from the flow divider. Few sites of elevated permeability were found distal to the aortoiliac bifurcation, and the permeabilities at the medial and lateral walls of the iliac arteries were not different. Mitotic cells were associated with 13 +/- 8% of all sites with elevated permeability to 125I-LDL. The frequency of mitotic endothelial cells was not increased at branch sites, suggesting that mechanisms other than cell replication were responsible for increased LDL permeability in the rabbit. These results suggest that the permeability and frequency of occurrence of sites with elevated permeability around the celiac and intercostal branches may influence the distribution and severity of early lesions in rabbits fed a hypercholesterolemic diet.},

At 21 years of age, after 14 years of gluten challenge, a mucosal relapse was found and a gluten-free diet was reinstituted. A biopsy one year later showed a normal mucosa. From this case report it is apparent that a patient with a past history of subtotal villous atrophy, which after a preceding period of gluten-free diet does not recur within two years of gluten challenge, must be followed carefully, so as not to miss a late relapse.},

Particular attention was given to a group of 21 patients with coeliac disease according to ESPGAN criteria who were on a well tolerated long term normal diet and in nine of whom the mucosa had returned to normal or nearly normal. A significant increase in TcR gamma delta+ cells was observed in the gut epithelium of coeliac patients compared with age matched controls, and this did not correlate with either the presence of gluten in the diet or with the grade of villous atrophy. Thus, numbers of TcR gamma delta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) were considerably above the normal range in four of seven patients on a gluten free diet and in four of nine patients who had recovered a normal or nearly normal mucosa in spite of a normal diet. In contrast, numbers of intestinal TcR alpha beta+ cells varied with the stage of the disease. Their number was high in the epithelium of patients with active coeliac disease (n = 18) but significantly less in patients whose mucosa had returned to normal or nearly normal either after gluten free diet (n = 7) or in spite of a normal diet (n = 9). Immunohistochemical markers of intestinal mononuclear cell activation detected in active coeliac disease were either weakly expressed or absent in the latter patients. It is suggested that TcR alpha beta+ but not TcR gamma delta+ IEL are sensitised to gliadin in coeliac disease, and that only the former cells play a direct part in the pathogenesis of the villous atrophy. The normal counts of TcR alpha beta+ IEL and the absence of detectable mononuclear activation in the biopsy specimens of a few patients who have recovered clinical and histological tolerance to gluten sustains this hypothesis and also suggests that immunological tolerance to gluten may be acquired in a subgroup of coeliac patients. Hte appreciable increase in TcR gamma delta+ IEL observed in some of the latter patients, however, is similar to that observed in latent coeliac disease urging for their careful and prolonged follow up until the role of TcR gamma delta+ IEL in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease is elucidated.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is a gluten intolerance caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors such as nutrition and infections. Monozygotic twins appear to have a concordance for CD up to 71%. This paper reports a third case of late onset of CD in monozygotic twin girls. The twins were defined as monozygotic based upon paired clinical and laboratory examinations. Clinical examinations included genotypic, phenotypic and dermatoglyphic analysis, while laboratory examinations included HLA typing and blood groups. Following European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition criteria, CD was diagnosed in both girls, though 4 years and 8/12 months apart. The twins achieved clinical, laboratory and histological remissions within 1 year, after the institution of a gluten-free diet. Genetic markers are undoubtedly the main precondition for CD development. Environmental factors, however, may play a more significant role in triggering the onset of disease.},

These antibodies have been studied separately or compared as pairs, but no prospective comparison of all three antibodies in childhood coeliac disease exists. Thirty-four confirmed coeliacs were compared with nine non-coeliacs with pathological small intestines, and 32 children with a normal intestinal histology. Sera were examined for IgG- and IgA-antigliadin antibodies (AGA) by ELISA, and for IgA-antireticulin antibodies (ARA) and IgA endomysial antibodies (EMA) by indirect immunofluorescence. In active coeliac disease, IgA-EMA was the most sensitive (97%), while IgA-AGA the least sensitive antibody (52%). The specificity of IgA-AGA, IgG-AGA, IgA-ARA, IgA-EMA was 95%, 92%, 100% and 98%, respectively. Positive predicted values of ARA and EMA were comparable (97-100%), while EMA had the highest negative predicted value (98%). Compared with IgG-AGA, IgA-EMA titres better reflected variations in dietary gluten, and correlated best with intestinal pathology. Compared with AGA and ARA sensitivity, specificity and predictive values, EMA is the most reliable serological marker for the diagnosis of coeliac disease. It reflects dietary changes in gluten and correlates best with intestinal histopathology. Therefore, it should be considered the best of the three serological tests available for childhood coeliac disease.},

The disease shows a strong human HLA association predominantly to the cis or trans encoded HLA-DQ(alpha 1*0501,beta 1*0201) (DQ2) heterodimer. T cell recognition of gliadin presented by this DQ heterodimer may thus be of immunopathogenic importance in CD. We therefore challenged small intestinal biopsies from adult CD patients on a gluten-free diet in vitro with gluten (containing both gliadin and other wheat proteins), and isolated activated CD25+ T cells. Polyclonal T cell lines and a panel of T cell clones recognizing gluten were established. They recognized the gliadin moiety of gluten, but not proteins from other cereals. Inhibition studies with anti-HLA antibodies demonstrated predominant antigen presentation by HLA-DQ molecules. The main antigen-presenting molecule was established to be the CD-associated DQ(alpha 1*0501, beta 1*0201) heterodimer. The gluten-reactive T cell clones were CD4+, CD8-, and carried diverse combinations of T cell receptor (TCR) V alpha and V beta chains. The findings suggest preferential mucosal presentation of gluten-derived peptides by HLA-DQ(alpha 1*0501, beta 1*0201) in CD, which may explain the HLA association.},

The patient was in a state of depression. The causes of osteomalacia and then a general malabsorption syndrome were investigated. Anti-gliadin antibodies were positive. Histological tests on duodenal mucous revealed a pattern indicative of gluten-sensitive enteropathy. A gluten-free diet was prescribed and at a check-up one month later the patient had improved markedly. Skeletal symptoms are predominant in 30% of atypical forms of gluten-sensitive enteropathy. The severity of this case was due to a late diagnosis.},

   abstract = {General Recommendations: 1. Children with diabetes mellitus have the same basic nutritional requirements as other children. 2. Dietary recommendations should be based on good eating habits for the whole family. Radical changes in diet involving unusual foods or eating patterns for the child with diabetes alone are not appropriate. 3. Energy requirements of children vary widely and the energy content of the diet should be based on what the child usually eats. The diet should be reviewed regularly to meet the changing needs of growth and physical exercise without obesity. 4. The insulin regimen should, as far as is possible, be chosen to fit the child's daily lifestyle and preferred eating habits. Insulin type, dose, and frequency should be reviewed with the diet as the child develops. 5. Regular distribution of meals and snacks throughout the day remains the most important way to avoid extremes of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. This distribution should be based on an exchange system, using handy measures and taking into account food and meal type, the particular insulin regimen and the child's exercise patterns and usual eating habits. Currently this exchange system is based on carbohydrate foods but in the future the energy and fat contents will need further consideration. 6. Most special 'diabetic foods' are unnecessary. Low calorie sweeteners, as used in low calorie fruit squashes and fizzy drinks, are useful. 7. Children with diabetes from specific ethnic minority groups, or on vegan diets or living in deprived circumstances require special dietary attention for their diabetes. Those with coexisting chronic disorders such as cystic fibrosis or coeliac disease, should receive dietary advice from professionals with specialist knowledge. 8. Translating the principles of diabetic dietary management into a varied diet, arranged readily by the parents and eaten by the child, is demanding. It can best be met by a skilled dietitian working in close co-operation with child, parents, diabetes specialist nurse and doctor. Infancy 9. The diet should not differ from that of infants without diabetes. Breast feeding should be encouraged or a standard infant formula-feed used. Solids may be introduced from 3-6 months, but breast milk or a modified infant formula is encouraged as part of the increasingly mixed diet to at least the end of the first year. 10. Diabetes is rare in infancy so expert advice should be sought from dietitians experienced in paediatric diabetes. Under fives: 11.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Fecal fat was measured under standard dietary conditions (100 g lipid/day) with no enzyme supplementation and during treatment with 75,000, 150,000, or 225,000 IU of lipase per day. The median fecal fat output (g/day) was significantly (p < 0.005) lower after each increase in dosage: basal, 20.5 (range, 10.3-92.2); 3 cps/day at meals, 13.3 (6.4-38.2); 6 cps/day, 9.9 (4.8-31.4); 9 cps/day, 7.3 (2.6-17.3). For the five patients with a basal fecal fat output of < 15 g/day, steatorrhea was totally corrected by 3 cps a day. Of the seven patients with more severe steatorrhea, the fecal fat output of only two was not normalized with the highest dose of 9 cps/day: for one it was reduced to 13.3 g/day from a basal of 92.2 g/day and for the other to 17.3 g/day from 25.4 g/day. This pilot study demonstrates that the tested pancreatic extract very effectively corrects pancreatic steatorrhea in a simple low-dose regimen. Good compliance can be expected.},

All coeliac patients had assumed cow's milk and soy proteins at the moment of the test or a few days before. Higher antibody serum level was found in coeliac disease to both cow's milk and soy proteins and in cases with cow's and soy allergy, than in control cases. The highest mean value of cow's milk and soy proteins antibodies have been found in the untreated coeliac children (CD), also higher than in the two groups of specific allergy. In treated coeliac children (GFD) with normalized jejunal mucosa cow's milk and soy proteins antibodies was normal.

SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Patients recruited from two University Hospitals (Amsterdam, Leiden) and from PALGA (National Dutch data-bank) over a 16-year period. DESIGN: Review of hospital charts with respect to clinical presentation and treatment of both coeliac disease and malignant lymphoma. Re-evaluation of morphology and staging by immunoperoxidase, enzyme- and immunohistochemical stainings on unstained and frozen materials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical behaviour and T- or B-cell morphology of extranodal intestinal, extranodal extraintestinal and nodal intestinal disease. RESULTS: Fourteen cases of enteropathy-associated lymphoma could be traced, 10 with a history of coeliac disease, four primarily presenting with malignant lymphoma. The usual extranodal intestinal lymphoma (eight cases) presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and malabsorption. Six had atypical disease: four presented with extranodal extraintestinal disease, located in the skin or the respiratory tract; two patients had intractable malabsorption and oedema caused by a nodal intestinal lymphoma. Re-evaluation with additional immunohistochemical stainings in 11 patients showed a pleomorphic malignant infiltrate of histiocyte-like cells of T-cell origin, with a pattern of CD3+; CD4-; CD5 +/-; CD7+ and CD8-. It also established a more appropriate diagnosis in four, an 0.6-year earlier diagnosis in six, and an upgraded stage of disease in two patients. A more extensive spread and poorer outcome appeared to become more probable in the ranking order of extranodal intestinal, extranodal extraintestinal and nodal intestinal lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: A proper and timely diagnosis of enteropathy-associated lymphoma requires clinical vigilance and unrelentless perseverance to obtain adequate fresh and frozen tissue for histochemical staining. Further research in a larger number of patients is warranted to investigate the relation between the primary site of the lymphoma, i.e. extranodal intestinal, extranodal extraintestinal, or nodal intestinal, and (its impact on) clinical presentation and prognosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Osteopenia is a well-known complication of overt celiac disease, but whether such defective bone mineralization is present among asymptomatic or silent patients is not known. Our objectives were: 1) to examine bone mineralization of a group of asymptomatic celiac patients; 2) to compare these results with those of symptomatic patients. METHODS: Bone mineral density of the spine and total skeleton by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and serum parameters of mineral metabolism of eight recently diagnosed asymptomatic patients with celiac disease were studied. Results were compared with those obtained in 20 untreated symptomatic celiacs, 14 patients treated with gluten-free diet for a mean time of 15 yr, and 153 healthy adult subjects, matched by sex and age. RESULTS: Four and five out of eight asymptomatic patients presented with reduced mineralization of the spine and the total skeleton, respectively (> 1 SD below normal values for sex and age). Two patients presented with severe osteopenia of the spine, and the other three presented with severe osteopenia of the whole skeleton (> 2 SD below mean normal values). Osteopenia at plane bone level (total skeleton) was significantly lower when compared to healthy controls (p < 0.02). Symptomatic untreated patients had significantly more severe deterioration of bone mineralization than did asymptomatics (p < 0.05) and treated patients (p < 0.05). No difference in bone mineral density was observed between treated patients and asymptomatic celiacs. Serum levels of calcium, alkaline phosphatase, 25-OH vitamin D, and parathormone did not show conclusive abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide direct evidence that reduced bone mineralization occurs in asymptomatic celiac patients before any other symptom becomes evident. Only early diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease can avoid the deterioration of the bone structure observed in all clinical status of celiac disease.},

Each patient had a xylose absorption test and small intestinal biopsy. Blood samples were collected to AGA assay. The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of antigliadin antibodies test, IgG and IgA, in screening celiac disease for intestinal biopsy and in the monitoring of gluten-free diet and challenge in celiac patients. Twenty patients were diagnosed with celiac disease confirmed by three small intestinal biopsies; 12 patients were suspected of having celiac disease, with two biopsies, before and one year after a gluten-free diet; 106 patients had environmental enteropathy; 45 patients had protracted diarrhea and 56 children had failure to thrive with no gastrointestinal symptoms. The AGA test was considered a reliable test in screening for biopsy and in the differential diagnosis between celiac disease and other causes of malabsorption syndrome. The IgG AGA test had high sensitivity (90.4%) and the IgA AGA test had high specificity (92.1%) in screening for celiac disease. In the follow-up of the celiac patients the antibody levels were significantly higher during gluten containing diet than after gluten avoidance being thus a reliable test to evaluate dietary compliance.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a fascinating illness, from both a clinical and research perspective. Most clinicians consider a diagnosis of celiac disease when a young patient has classic signs and symptoms of steatorrhea and severe malabsorption. However, the typical gastrointestinal symptoms often are absent. The patient may only have subtle signs of chronic malnutrition or nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints. Celiac disease is not diagnosed commonly in the United States, at least in part because of a low clinical index of suspicion. A diagnosis of celiac disease is confirmed by a small bowel mucosa biopsy. A dramatic clinical response to a gluten-free diet verifies the diagnosis, and provides a cost-effective treatment free of significant side effects. Strict adherence to the prescribed diet usually results in a complete resolution of the symptoms and mucosal histopathologic changes. The serious, long-term complication of intestinal lymphoma also may be prevented. To the clinical investigator, celiac disease is an important model of the HLA-associated immune-mediated illnesses. A specific HLA-DQ heterodimer is found in 95% of patients, representing perhaps the strongest association of any illness with a specific class II HLA molecule. In addition, an important environmental trigger (gluten) has been identified, providing a unique opportunity to study the interaction of gene products and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of an immune-mediated disease.},

Of the 11 boys and 16 girls 4 adolescents consume a normal diet, while another 2 are on semistrict diet, all 6 of them without any enteral symptoms. Out of the 15 children aged younger than 13 years 9 are on a strict diet. Semistrict diet has an impact on gliadin antibody levels respectively. Serum ferritin levels of those on a normal diet are significantly lower than those of the control group. Out of the 25 lactose breath tests 7 showed abnormal results, irrelevant both to the strictness of the diet and to gliadin antibody levels. In the view of weight and length percentiles there is no difference at present between those eating normal food and diet. Nevertheless, with regards to the risk of malignancy in coeliac disease the necessity of a strict diet must be stressed. In long term follow-up the levels of gliadin antibodies and of serum ferritin are of pathognostic importance.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is characterized by hypersensitivity to the alcohol-soluble wheat proteins called gliadins. Total avoidance of gliadin is the lifelong treatment for such patients. However, wheat gliadins are often present as impurities in industrial starch commonly used in the preparation of different pharmaceutical products. Therefore, some drugs might contain gliadin, which can be dangerous for sensitive patients if taken in large amounts or used permanently. The purpose of this study was to develop a sensitive, reliable assay that is specific for the detection of gliadins in pharmaceutical products. Gliadins were extracted here using sodium dodecyl sulfate rather than 70% ethyl alcohol, which has been the traditional solvent. This gliadin extract was utilized in a dot-blot assay that incorporated an antigliadin antibody developed in rabbit and labeled with peroxidase. 4-Chloro-1-naphthol was used as a peroxidase-specific substrate. Isolated wheat gliadin was used as the positive control. Dilution experiments showed that the lower level of sensitivity for the assay was in the range of 0.0045 mg/ml of gliadin, which is a concentration level lower than that suggested for a gluten-free diet. The assay developed here revealed that 71.2% of 59 prescription and nonprescription drugs tested contained gliadin in the amount detected by our dot-blot assay. The prescription drugs tested were among the top 50 most frequently dispensed in U.S. community pharmacies. The nonprescription drugs were among those that constitute the largest sales in the United States. The results showed that the simple dot-blot assay developed here can be used for pharmaceutical testing performed either by hospital laboratories or by patients themselves.},

In the present study we evaluated radial bone mineral content (BMC) in celiac children and adolescents at diagnosis and after they consumed a gluten-free diet (GFD). The BMC values of 33 celiac patients at diagnosis were significantly lower than those of 255 control subjects (P < 0.001). There was no difference between diabetic and non-diabetic celiac patients. In 14 patients the BMC increased significantly (P < 0.05, ANCOVA) after 1.28 y of GFD. In these patients the mean annual BMC increment was 0.07 g/cm, significantly greater (P < 0.05) than the increment of normal growing children (0.05 g.cm-1.y-1). Our data indicate that although osteoporosis complicates celiac disease during childhood and adolescence, GFD alone is able to remarkably improve bone mineralization.},

   abstract = {Gluten-free diet (GFD) as the standard treatment for coeliac disease (CD) was discovered by Dicke. In 1989 Holmes attributed a protective role to GFD with regard to the development of malignancy in untreated CD. Gluten sensitivity is in general an asymptomatic condition. The identification of subclinical cases is becoming a major topic of current interest. Defining high-risk groups for coeliac disease is mandatory. The evaluation of small-intestine biopsies (SIB), however, is much more complicated, as was suggested in the past. Recognition of the Corazza sign and rediscovery of the endoscopic guided capsule may well be of help. Screening patients with a high-risk of CD with a minimal number of tests prior to SIB makes more and more sense. Therefore intestinal permeability tests might be helpful. GFD appears simple, but in practice it represents a challenge to patients, dietitians and physicians. Management of coeliac disease seems much more complicated, as was thought in the early 1980s.},

Bile acid concentration, and bicarbonate and lipase excretions in duodenal juice were determined every 10 minutes up to 120 minutes and compared with controls. Moreover, octreotide (100 micrograms) was s.c. administered to 5 healthy subjects 30 minutes before meals for 7 days. Fecal fat and bile acid excretions before and after administration were determined. Bile acid concentration, and bicarbonate and lipase excretions in the octreotide group decreased to 1/3-1/4 that of controls. Bile acid concentration became 0 mM for 60 minutes. Fecal fat excretion increased; obvious steatorrhea occurred in 2 cases. Fecal bile acid excretion decreased to about 1/4. These results suggest that decreases in bile acid secretion should be considered, as well as pancreatic lipase and bicarbonate secretions, when fatty stool occurs after octreotide administration.},

To evaluate a possible association with gluten ingestion, we then compared frequency of mucosal damage in patients on a gluten-containing diet and those on a gluten-free Diet (GFD). In children with CD, frequency of esophageal damage seen at endoscopy and of peptic esophagitis shown by histology were significantly lower than in non-CD patients (p < 0.01) due to the very low frequency of mucosal damage in CD children on GFD; however, frequency of columnar metaplasia was significantly higher (p < 0.05). At endoscopy, CD children had a significantly lower frequency of gastric abnormalities, but histology showed a higher prevalence of superficial chronic gastritis (SCG; p < 0.01). SCG was associated with gluten ingestion, since its frequency in CD children on GFD was similar to the frequency in non-CD patients. At endoscopy, frequency of duodenal mucosal damage was similar in CD and non-CD patients. In addition to villous atrophy, histology showed a significantly higher frequency of duodenitis in CD children on a gluten-containing diet (p < 0.001 vs. non-CD patients; p < 0.05 vs. CD children on GFD). Our findings show that the mucosa of the whole upper GI tract can be damaged in CD patients and that the prevalence of some changes is higher with a gluten-containing diet.},

In 1 year, 1789 patients (43% IDDM, 57% NIDDM) were screened, and 73 had raised IgA-AGA. Of these patients, 49 agreed to duodenal biopsy and 13 (10 IDDM) had coeliac disease. Selective IgA deficiency was found in eight patients, one of whom had coeliac disease. Of these 14 patients with newly diagnosed coeliac disease, four had microcytic anaemia, nine a low serum ferritin, and four a low albumin-corrected calcium. Eight patients had symptoms which improved on gluten withdrawal. Dietary compliance was maintained in 6/8 symptomatic patients, but only in 1/6 without symptoms. Included in the 1789 patients were four (all IDDM) with known coeliac disease. The overall prevalence of coeliac disease in adult patients with IDDM was 1:50 compared with 1:340 in NIDDM. Coeliac disease is common in adults with IDDM and may cause malabsorption and ill health. It should be suspected in any IDDM patient with gastrointestinal symptoms or unexplained anaemia.},

   abstract = {At age 5 years coeliac disease was diagnosed in a boy with Williams-Beuren syndrome. Gastrointestinal symptoms may be similar in both disorders. Short stature, not only in comparison to the normal population but also in comparison to syndrome-specific growth standards, and failure to thrive led to the diagnosis coeliac disease. During the first year of dietetic therapy the boy showed marked weight gain, catch-up growth and a normalisation of red blood count. Gliadin-IgG antibodies and endomysium-IgA antibodies who were positive before treatment were no longer detectable. Our case demonstrates that syndrome-specific growth standards are helpful even though the combination of Williams-Beuren syndrome with a second disorder is very unlikely (Williams-Beuren syndrome and coeliac disease are to be expected in 1:13.7-1:25 millions).},

   abstract = {This study measured the values of cyclic nucleotides and adenylate and guanylate cyclase activities in duodenal mucosa homogenates to verify if they played a part in coeliac disease. Nine controls, 13 patients who did not receive treatment and nine patients who received treatment were studied. Cyclase activity assays were performed under basal conditions and in the presence of gliadin derived peptides. Duodenal mucosa cyclic nucleotide values and adenylate cyclase activity were significantly higher in patients who did not receive treatment than in those who did and in controls, whereas guanylate cyclase activity was similar in all groups. Gliadin derived peptides did not affect guanylate cyclase activity, but significantly increased adenylate cyclase activity in homogenates from patients who did not receive treatment. As extracellular cyclic nucleotide concentrations could reflect changes in their intracellular metabolism, plasma and urine cyclic nucleotide values were also measured in 25 controls and in 55 patients studied at different stages of their disease. Extracellular cyclic nucleotides were considerably high in patients who were not healed and became normal after about one year of treatment. These data suggest that cyclic nucleotides may participate in the pathophysiological processes of coeliac disease.},

Mean total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not show significant change, while mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol rose and triglycerides decreased significantly after the diet. The Lp(a) concentration remained unchanged in all patients (median values, 35 mg/L before and 40 mg/L after the diet).

   abstract = {Since their introduction in clinical practice, antigliadin antibodies (AGA) have simplified the diagnostic iter of coeliac disease. In addition they have allowed us to recognize an even high number of new cases and also to identify new clinical forms. While AGA are widely used in the diagnostic phase, their determination during follow-up of the disease has been always limited. With the present work we observe the behaviour of AGA during the various phases of coeliac disease. The study was carried out on 288 coeliac children divided as follows: 96 at diagnosis, 136 on gluten-free-diet (75 diet adherent and 61 non adherent) and 56 on gluten-challenge. 145 healthy children were also studied as a control group. In all children AGA (IgA and IgG) were determined, with a micro-ELISA method, every two months in the children on gluten-free-diet and monthly in the children on gluten-challenge. Data obtained showed AGA behaviour strictly related to the diet. In fact while children with good compliance to the diet had AGA normalization within the 2nd and 6th month, respectively for IgA and IgG, children with poor adherence to diet had constantly positive AGA. Noteworthy was the AGA behaviour during challenge. Gluten introduction determined a rapid increase of IgA and a slow increase of IgG. Our results confirm the usefulness of AGA determination during the follow-up of coeliac children giving us the possibility to avoid one or more biopsies included in the ESPGAN protocol.},

Clinical findings included short stature, prominent kyphoscoliosis, proximal weakness, and brisk reflexes. Recognition of an increased level of serum alkaline phosphatase and hypophosphatemia led to the diagnosis of osteomalacia. Identification of iron deficiency anemia and hypocholesterolemia implicated previously unrecognized gluten-sensitive enteropathy with associated vitamin D malabsorption as the cause of the osteomalacia. Adherence to a gluten-free diet and treatment with vitamin D2 resulted in weight gain, resolution of pain, and improvement in strength within 3 months. Painful proximal weakness and hyperreflexia may be the initial and primary manifestations of osteomalacia, a readily treatable cause of muscle and bone disease.},

Two control populations entered the study as well: 151 adults with biopsy proven celiac disease, as true positives; and 520 controls (healthy and diseased) as true negatives. IgA-EmA positivity was found in 145 of 151 (96%) celiac disease patients but in none of the controls (100% specificity). EmA were positive in 12 of 383 (3.13%) IDDM patients: 10 of these positives underwent intestinal biopsy, which showed either partial or total villous atrophy. Only one patient presented with gastrointestinal complaints, but severe iron deficiency was found in all. The IDDM celiac patients were started on a gluten-free diet: four refused both the diet and the follow-up protocol. Approximately one year after gluten withdrawal no significant change in the degree of diabetes control was observed, while an increased requirement for insulin was observed in three of four patients who strictly complied with the diet. The prevalence of biopsy-proven celiac disease among adult IDDM patients (1:38), eight times higher than that recently estimated for the general Italian population and the absence, except in one case, of gastrointestinal symptoms emphasizes the benefit of screening programs on populations at risk.},

Using an indirect immunofluorescent method, we evaluated the kinetics of the antibody titers both during a gluten-free diet and after gluten was added, comparing them with the intestinal histological pattern. The IgA-EmA titers were evaluated on sera from 91 untreated adults with biopsy-proven celiac sprue and, when positive, were reappraised after different durations of gluten-free diet. Antibody titers were also retested in eight adolescents who had voluntarily discontinued the diet while they were on a free diet. The IgA-EmAs were detectable in 85 of 91 (93.40%) patients but in none of the 438 controls (100% specificity). The antibody titers ranged from 1:5 to 1:2,000 or more and the intestinal histopathological pattern paralleled the antibody titers. After gluten withdrawal, IgA-EmA titers declined to zero in all patients complying with their diet. Modifications in gut histopathologic condition paralleled IgA-EmA kinetics, although seroconversion to negativity preceded mucosal recovery. After a gluten rechallenge, deterioration in gut histopathologic condition followed EmA reversion to positivity. Three negative IgA-EmA tests did not reflect a worsening in gut histopathologic condition after a gluten-containing diet, thus making the diagnosis of celiac sprue uncertain.},

In the gluten-sensitive individual, celiac disease is activated by ingestion of cereal glutens. An abnormal immune system response to dietary gluten causes damage to the small bowel mucosa, which results in nutrient malabsorption. When gluten is removed from the diet, malabsorption resolves. Nursing intervention in celiac disease requires careful nutritional assessment and dietary instruction.},

Repeated endoscopic investigations in the past had revealed no abnormality of the gastrointestinal system on macroscopic examination. Oral iron supplementation was shown to have no effect on serum iron levels and had no influence on the anemia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed at our hospital confirmed normal macroscopic findings. However, jejunal biopsies revealed subtotal villous atrophy of the mucosa of the small intestine. A strict gluten-free diet led to an increase in serum iron, resolution of the anemia, and restitution of normal mucosal architecture. Thus iron-deficiency anemia may be the lone manifestation of celiac disease.},

Fortunately, if diagnosed correctly and promptly, it can be effectively treated with very satisfactory outcomes. A careful history will often suggest the diagnosis, but definitive diagnosis requires finding the typical lesion on small bowel biopsy and clinical improvement with a gluten-free diet. If symptoms and mucosal abnormalities persist, glucocorticoids should be tried. Malignancy is a rare complication of longstanding CS that should be looked for if there is no response to gluten withdrawal or if symptoms relapse despite adherence to diet.},

   abstract = {There is now substantial evidence that coeliac sprue is associated with infertility both in men and women. In women it can also lead to delayed menarche, amenorrhoea, early menopause, recurrent abortions, and a reduced pregnancy rate. In men it can cause hypogonadism, immature secondary sex characteristics and reduce semen quality. The real mechanism by which coeliac sprue produces these changes is unclear, but factors such as malnutrition, iron, folate and zinc deficiencies have all been implicated. In addition in men gonadal dysfunction is believed to be due to reduced conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone caused by low levels of 5 alpha-reductase in coeliac sprue. This leads to derangement of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Hyperprolactinaemia is seen in 25% of coeliac patients, which causes impotence and loss of libido. Gluten withdrawal and correction of deficient dietary elements can lead to a return of fertility both in men and women.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of infertility, abortions and perinatal mortality, age at menarche and menopause in coeliac disease (CD). It was a case control study in which patients and controls matched for age and sex were sent questionnaires about their fertility profile and other obstetric and gynaecological problems. All 80 patients and 70 controls replied but only 68 groups could be matched for this study. The mean age of menarche in patients was significantly older at 13.6 years than in controls at 12.7 years. The mean age at menopause in patients and controls were 47.6 and 50.1 years respectively. The study showed the mean number of children born to patients with CD was significantly less at 1.9 (SD +/- 0.9) compared to 2.5 (SD +/- 1.2) in controls. Before diagnosis the mean number of children born to patients was 1.4 and 1.8 in controls. After diagnosis and treatment, patients had 0.5 children (SD +/- 0.9) compared to 0.7 in controls (SD +/- 1.2). It seems likely that the overall difference in fertility is due to relative infertility prior to diagnosis and its correction by a gluten-free diet. Significantly more conceptions amongst women with CD (15%) ended in miscarriage prior to diagnosis than amongst controls (6%). After diagnosis and treatment the rate of miscarriage was similar at 7 and 12% respectively. There were 120 live babies and 7 stillbirths to patients compared with 161 live babies and 1 stillbirth to controls. In conclusion, this study shows that patients with CD are subfertile and have an increased incidence of stillbirths and perinatal deaths.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To highlight the pitfalls in the diagnosis of coeliac disease and to make recommendations for its diagnosis and the management of refractory cases with equivocal histology. METHODS: Six patients, referred since 1989 with a diagnosis of coeliac disease based on duodenal biopsy specimens taken at endoscopy, and who failed to respond to a gluten-free diet were studied. All patients were subjected to peroral jejunal biopsy. Morphometric analysis of villus height:crypt depth ratios, surface enterocyte cell heights, and intraepithelial counts was used to aid in the assessment of equivocal histology. RESULTS: Subsequent small intestinal biopsy specimens both taken when the patients were following a gluten-free diet and after gluten challenge were normal in all cases. Morphometric analysis and intraepithelial counts were normal. CONCLUSIONS: Misinterpretation of the original slides was often due to poor sample quality and tangential sectioning. Failure to respond to a gluten-free diet should always raise doubt regarding the initial diagnosis, especially when the findings are normal. For correct diagnosis at least three distal duodenal biopsy specimens should be taken simultaneously, and these should be of an adequate size and correctly orientated. Review by a histopathologist experienced in gastrointestinal diagnosis is essential in difficult cases. Quantitative morphometric analysis is helpful in equivocal cases, and jejunal suction biopsy, following a gluten challenge, may be necessary in patients refractory to treatment.},

Six patients were already known to have coeliac disease. A total of 436 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 2-21 years and with age at onset at 2 months to 17 years at three paediatric departments agreed to participate in the study. All patients were tested for gliadin IgA antibodies with a commercial kit (Pharmacia Gluten IgA EIA). Later, serum was tested for reticulin IgA/IgG antibodies. Nineteen patients had elevated gliadin IgA levels (> 25 AU). Eighteen underwent jejunal biopsy. Ten had total or subtotal villous atrophy. These 10 patients were reticulin IgA-positive. Of 417 gliadin IgA-negative patients, 408 were reticulin IgA/IgG-negative. Of 6 reticulin IgA-positive patients, 3 had total or subtotal villous atrophy. All 3 had become gliadin IgA-positive at the time of biopsy. Among 3 reticulin IgG-positive patients with IgA deficiency, 2 had total villous atrophy: 1 was not willing to be biopsied. Patients with total or subtotal villous atrophy were judged as having coeliac disease and were recommended a gluten-free diet. Within 2 months, gliadin IgA levels were normal in patients adhering to the diet. Five patients have gone through a second jejunal biopsy to date with normal histology in all 5. The 15 newly diagnosed patients with coeliac disease plus 6 already known patients with coeliac disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus gave a minimum prevalence of coeliac disease in diabetic children and adolescents of 21/459 = 4.6%.},

Thirty-eight deaths occurred under the age of 85, slightly fewer than expected on the basis of national general population rates [standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 61-119]. All-cause mortality was somewhat lower in patients who had followed a gluten-free diet (SMR = 51; 17-120) than in those who had not (SMR = 97; 66-136), but the difference in SMRs was not significant (P = 0.3). Cancer mortality was non-significantly below expectations from national rates (SMR = 72; 31-142), but cancer incidence was significantly increased [standardized registration ratio (SRR) = 394; 180-749]. No particular cancer site accounted for the cancer incidence excess. One death occurred from cancer of the small intestine (SMR = 4953, P = 0.04), and one lymphoma was incident (SRR = 1555, P = 0.12). Increased risks of these malignancies have previously been found to be associated with coeliac disease (which is present in many patients with dermatitis herpetiformis), and with dermatitis herpetiformis, respectively. Mortality from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was significantly below national rates (SMR = 37; 95% CI 12-86), and was similar in patients who had followed a gluten-free diet and those who had not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

All patients were challenged with gluten for a minimum of 4 weeks to 4 years before a peroral proximal jejunal biopsy was performed between 1973 and 1976.

The abnormal immune response in CD is polyclonal, without evidence of restriction or significantly increased expression of any TCR variable region gene families, compared to normal small bowel.

   abstract = {Celiac sprue, also termed celiac disease or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is a chronic disease in which malabsorption of nutrients is caused by a characteristic, but nonspecific, lesion of the small-intestinal mucosa. The lesion is produced, through unclear mechanisms, by protein constituents of some cereal grains. Exclusion of wheat gluten and rye, barley, and oat prolamins from the diet results in a prompt improvement in absorption, along with reversion, toward normal, of the associated small-intestinal lesion. The spectrum of manifestations of celiac sprue is remarkably broad, but the severity of disease generally correlates with the length of small intestine that is damaged. When most or all of the small-intestinal mucosa is involved, symptoms are severe and malabsorption is generalized. In such patients, a diagnosis of celiac sprue is usually considered. When, on the other hand, the mucosal lesion is limited to the duodenum and proximal jejunum, overt gastrointestinal symptoms and steatorrhea may be absent. In those patients, clinical manifestations, if present at all, may reflect malabsorption of only one or two substances, notably iron and folate, that normally are absorbed somewhat selectively by the proximal intestine. Arriving at the correct diagnosis in such cases may be quite challenging.},

The challenge was preceded by a biopsy; clinical symptoms, the cellobiose/mannitol permeability test, and gliadin and endomysial antibody measurement were used to determine the timing of the confirmatory biopsy: it was performed if one test result was repeatedly abnormal or two results were concomitantly abnormal. Gliadin antibodies increased early (already 7 days after the reintroduction of gluten to the diet), but in many cases they returned to normal values thereafter. Increased intestinal permeability to sugars and even more positivity of endomysial antibody were good predictors of histologic relapse. The sequential use of laboratory tests during gluten challenge may significantly shorten its duration.},

   abstract = {IgA-class anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) and IgA-, IgG-, IgM-class anti-reticulin antibodies (ARA) were determined in 1461 persons, representing 84% of a population from the village of Karksi-Nuia. AGA were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ARA by indirect immunofluorescence. Fifty-two (3.5%) persons had IgA-class AGA, of whom 48 and an additional three of four persons with diarrhea were biopsied. All biopsies showed normal small intestinal mucosal architecture. All 1461 persons were negative for ARA. Our results demonstrate that AGA are frequently detected in an adult Estonian population and positivity increases with age in persons with normal small intestinal mucosa. Positivity for AGA does not predict silent undetected celiac disease but rather represents a normal response to dietary antigens in the elderly. Inability to detect ARA suggests that celiac disease does not exist in this population. As none of the AGA-positive but ARA-negative biopsied persons had celiac disease, ARA might be a more specific serologic marker for celiac disease than AGA.},

   abstract = {AIM: A retrospective study was carried out in the greater Wellington area. The objectives of this study were to identify an incidence rate, presenting symptoms and clinical features of coeliac disease. METHODS: Histology archives from the Wellington hospital department of pathology over the last eight years (1985-92) were retrieved and analysed. Abnormal duodenal and jejunal histological sections were reviewed. One hundred and seventy seven biopsy specimens from 127 patients were identified for further study from a total of 367 abnormal duodenal and jejunal biopsy specimens. Diagnosis of coeliac disease was based on information from hospital notes, biopsy request forms, and histology reports. Diagnostic criteria used for coeliac disease were evidence of malabsorption, abnormal histology consistent with coeliac disease and clinical improvement following a gluten free diet. RESULTS: Thirty eight patients were diagnosed with coeliac disease 1985-92 in a population of 267,252. Of these 38 only four were children (0-12 years). Overall incidence was 1.8 per 100,000. The estimated overall prevalence was 70 per 100,000, with 14 per 100,000 for children. The live birth rate was 0.1 per 1000. There was a female predominance of 3:1. Patients presented with a diverse range of problems, most commonly diarrhoea, anaemia, weight loss and steatorrhoea. Three out of the 6 patients who had a single problem had anaemia. CONCLUSIONS: The study has demonstrated an overall incidence and prevalence of coeliac disease in the Wellington region similar to overseas figures. However only 11% of the total were children, which is a very low proportion compared to the 50% reported in Sweden and 25% in Edinburgh. Patients presented with a wide range of clinical features. The threshold for small bowel biopsy should be relatively low in any patient considered to have clinical features of malabsorption.},

Little is known about the effects of a gluten-free diet and villous restitution on the bone mineral density in adult patients with coeliac disease. Of the 288 patients with coeliac disease in our unit, 13 (5%) had persistent villous atrophy of the small bowel despite dietary recommendations over at least the previous 4 years. For each of these 13 patients, 1 or 2 controls with coeliac disease, matched for age, gender, menopausal state, and dermatitis herpetiformis, whose intestinal mucosa had normalized at least 4 years earlier, were identified (n = 17). Bone mineral density was measured in the forearm using single-photon absorptiometry and in the femoral neck and trochanter using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Bone mineral density was reduced at all sites in patients with persistent villous atrophy compared with patients responsive to diet and healthy controls. Bone mineral density in patients responsive to diet did not differ from that in healthy controls. Persistent villous atrophy is associated with low bone mineral density, underlining the importance of keeping to a proper diet.},

In 33 of them, we also investigated the relationship between circulating antiendomysium antibody and the persistence of jejunal lesions after the institution of a gluten-free diet. Although 24 treated coeliac patients turned out to be antiendomysium antibody negative, in 17 of them jejunal lesions persisted. The present study shows that IgA antiendomysium antibody is a highly sensitive and specific marker for both subclinical and classical coeliac disease, but that it is not a reliable test in the follow up of coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {That symptomatic celiac disease (CD) can occur in several members of a family has long been recognized. Given the possible complications of untreated CD, it is also important to diagnose those family members with "silent" disease, to offer them the benefit of a gluten-free diet. We studied 642 first-degree relatives of 210 patients with CD, two of the latter belonging to the same family. IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies and IgA antiendomysium antibodies were studied in all. Jejunal biopsy was performed in 59 subjects, 47 with positive and 12 with negative serological markers. Celiac disease was diagnosed de novo in 18 cases (2.8%). Diagnosis in a symptomatic mother was made by jejunal biopsy despite the negativity of all immunological markers. We conclude that the risk of having CD is higher in siblings than in parents of patients with CD, that the most useful marker for diagnosis is the study of IgA antiendomysium antibodies, and that the absence of positive serological markers does not completely exclude the diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {Serum IgA antibodies to jejunum (JAB) were found in 78 (96%) of 81 adults and children with untreated celiac disease. Not only did IgA JAB display a significant higher prevalence than IgA antigliadin antibodies (AGA) (72%) in untreated gluten-sensitive enteropathy, but they also allowed us to identify another three celiacs in addition to those detected by IgA antiendomysial antibodies (EmA). Like IgA EmA, IgA JAB persisted at low titer in seven (14%) of 50 celiacs tested after 12 months of gluten-free diet (GFD) despite the regrowth of jejunal villi, whereas IgA AGA disappeared in all these patients consistently with the normalization of intestinal mucosa. IgA JAB and EmA reappearance was close to 100% in the 13 celiacs studied after six months of gluten challenge, while IgA AGA reached the highest prevalence (about 70%) after one month of gluten ingestion without any increase in the following months. All disease and healthy controls were always negative for the three IgA antibodies. Our results prove that IgA JAB and EmA are the best screening tests for active (untreated and on gluten challenge) celiac disease, whereas IgA AGA should be used for monitoring the response to gluten withdrawal. IgA JAB are an expression of a specific immunity directed against the target organ of gluten-sensitive enteropathy, but, before ascribing them a role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease, it should be ascertained whether their production is a primary event leading to jejunal lesions or whether it is a secondary phenomenon due to antigen release from a previously damaged jejunal mucosa.},

Twenty normal volunteers (13 males and seven females) and 24 patients (19 males and five females) with visceral artery stenosis on angiography were examined in the supine position (angle of insonation 60.5) with colour flow Duplex imaging (CFDI) (3.5 MHz probe), in the fasting state and after a standard meal at 15, 40, 60 and 90 min. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end diastolic velocity (EDV) were determined in both CA and SMA. The PSV was the best indicator of stenosis. After the meal, there was an increase in both PSV and EDV but neither of the postprandial measurements improved the accuracy of the test. The results indicate that CFDI can detect the presence of significant stenosis (> 50% in the CA and SMA with a sensitivity and specificity of > 80%.},

The basal condition was characterized by low cholesterol absorption, enhanced cholesterol synthesis, and high removal and transport rate of LDL apo B. The GFD markedly improved cholesterol absorption and decreased intestinal influx of cholesterol, fecal neutral steroids, and cholesterol synthesis. Of plasma total and lipoprotein cholesterol levels, only plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was enhanced by the GFD proportionately to cholesterol absorption. The plasma LDL apo B level remained unchanged because of simultaneous decreases in the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and transport rate of LDL apo B. In fact, the more cholesterol absorption was improved by the GFD, the more the FCR and transport rate for LDL apo B were decreased, and their reductions were closely related to the decrease in cholesterol synthesis. The present results show that cholesterol absorption, cholesterol synthesis, hepatic B/E receptor activity, and LDL apo B transport rate are closely associated with each other and that their levels can change markedly with no detectable change in serum levels of LDL cholesterol or apo B.},

Celiac disease belongs to the former, the temporary food sensitive enteropathies of early childhood to the latter. A food sensitive enteropathy is characterized by an abnormal small intestinal mucosa while having the offending food in the diet; the abnormality is reversed by an elimination diet, only to recur once more on challenge with the relevant food. These disorders are temporary and may follow gastroenteritis. Cow's milk sensitive enteropathy is the most frequent and best known example but soy protein, egg, fish, chicken meat, ground rice and probably gluten may also temporarily damage the small intestinal mucosa in infancy. Treatment is with an elimination diet and protein hydrolysates as a cow's milk substitute. The reason why these enteropathies are temporary has not yet been established.},

Ten celiac children changing from a gluten-containing to a gluten-free diet presented a significant rise in IGF-I (+1.54 mM per month). In a group of eight celiac children challenged with gluten, seven had a significant decrease in IGF-I (-1.11 mM per month), and five celiac children returning to the gluten-free diet after challenge with gluten had a marked but not significant increase in IGF-I (+1.7 mM per month). Eight children not suffering from celiac disease, but challenged with gluten, had a significant increase in IGF-I (+0.29 mM per month), corresponding to the expected age-dependent increase. The significant changes in IGF-I described under the diagnostic dietetic phases of celiac disease reflect the extent of growth retardation caused by the disease. IGF-I may be a supplementary aid in the diagnosis of celiac disease in describing individual changes under the dietetic phases.},

The authors describe a patient diagnosed with isolated IH at age 57 and celiac disease at age 64. Testing of patients' serum show antibodies of the immunoglobulin A isotype against endomysium, reticulin, and gliadin antigens, as well as immunoglobulin G against gliadin. The circulating immunoglobulins reacted with bovine parathyroid tissue, specifically smooth muscle of the blood vessels and glandular cells, as detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Testing of celiac disease positive sera showed similar parathyroid reactivity. When the patient was placed on a gluten-free diet, endomysial, reticulin, and gliadin antibodies decreased to undetectable levels, which was parallel with disappearance of the parathyroid immunoreactivity. The gluten-free diet also produced severe hypercalcemia that responded to calcitriol withdrawal, and ultimately required a reduction by half of the original calcitriol dose. It is possible that in this case the same antibody or antibodies may have caused both hypoparathyroidism and celiac disease. We conclude that, as in the case of childhood-onset IH variants, patients with late-onset isolated IH should be monitored for additional endocrine and extra-endocrine autoimmune disorders.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND--Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH), a rare and possibly immune disease, is sometimes associated with coeliac disease and myocardiopathy. CASE REPORTS: CASE NO 1--A 2 year-old boy with IPH was investigated because he suffered from frequent, soft stools. Small bowel biopsy showed partial villous atrophy. Circulating gliadin antibodies were present. The patient was placed on a gluten-free diet. CASE NO 2--An 8 year-old girl was admitted because she suffered from severe anemia (Hb: 4 g/100 ml). She was found to have IPH and myocardiopathy. She had no manifestation, but a systematic search for coeliac disease was positive (total villous atrophy; presence of circulating gliadin and alveolar basement membrane antibodies). The patient was placed on a gluten-free diet, prednisone and diuretics, but she died during a relapse 2 months later. CONCLUSION--It is worthwhile checking for coeliac disease in all patients with IPH. The presence of myocardiopathy is a negative prognosis.},
