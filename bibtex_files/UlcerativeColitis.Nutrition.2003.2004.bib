   abstract = {The abundance of the oligopeptide transporter (Pept-1) in the brush-border membrane of the intestinal epithelium is the central mechanism for regulation of transport of products of protein digestion (dipeptides and tripeptides) and peptidomimetic drugs (for example, beta-lactam antibiotics). Within the past few years, there has been substantial progress in identifying the factors controlling this regulation and the mechanisms of their actions. The purpose of this report is to review this progress. The studies of individual substrates and hormones in a human intestinal cell line (Caco-2) have shown that dipeptides, certain amino acids, insulin, and leptin increase and epidermal growth factor and triiodothyronine decrease the membrane population of Pept-1. In the case of dipeptides, epidermal growth factor, and thyroid hormone, there are parallel changes in the gene expression brought about by alteration of transcription and/or stability of Pept-1 mRNA. In contrast, the treatment with insulin and leptin does not induce any alteration in the Pept-1 gene expression, and the mechanism of increased protein expression appears to be increased trafficking from a preformed cytoplasmic pool to the apical membrane. In vivo studies in rats have shown modulation of protein and gene expressions of the intestinal oligopeptide transporter during the day and during development and in nutritional and metabolic alterations, such as high-protein diet, fasting, and diabetes. Patients with intestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and short-bowel syndrome, may have induction of the Pept-1 expression in their colon. Finally, pharmacological studies have shown that the expression of Pept-1 can be upregulated by agents such as 5 fluorouracil and downregulated by agents such as cyclosporine. In conclusion, the above studies have produced a wealth of new information on regulation of a key transporter in the intestine. This information may have useful applications in nutritional and pharmacological treatments, for example, in diabetic patients needing enteral nutrition or in ulcerative colitis patients needing the suppression of the intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abnormal linear growth and deficient bone mineral acquisition may coexist in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Traditionally, bone mineral assessment by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) involves comparison to age- and gender-matched reference ranges, and these studies in children with IBD show a high prevalence of osteopenia. AIMS: To compare the prevalence of osteopenia using two methods of interpretation; one adjusted for age and gender and the other adjusted for bone size and gender. PATIENTS: Forty-seven patients with Crohn disease (CD) and 26 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) with a median age of 13.5 years (range, 5.5-18.2 years) were evaluated. METHODS: Lumbar spine (LS) and total body (TB) bone mineral content (BMC) were measured by DXA and converted to bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm) corresponding to BMC divided by the bone area. Age and gender-matched BMD standard deviation scores (SDS) were based on reference data providing age- and gender-matched BMC and bone area. These data also allowed calculation of percentage of predicted bone area for age and gender (ppBone Area) and percentage of predicted BMC for Bone Area (ppBMC). RESULTS: Patients with CD were shorter than those with UC (median height, SDS, -0.9 v 0, P < 0.05). Median ppBone Area for LS and TB for the whole group was 85% (10th centile, 68; 90th centile 99) and 81% (10th centile 66; 90th centile, 97), respectively. The ppBone Area at both sites was directly related to height SDS and BMI SDS (r > 0.5; P < 0.005). Median BMD SDS for LS and TB was -1.6 (10th centile -3.6; 90th centile, -0.2) and -0.9 (10th centile, -2.4; 90th centile, 0.4), respectively. Median ppBMC for LS and TB was 98% (10th centile, 84%; 90th centile, 113%) and 101% (10th centile 94%; 90th centile, 107%), respectively. The ppBMC showed no relationship to ppBone Area (r = 0.1, NS). Failure to account for bone area led to a label of moderate or severe osteopenia in 65% of cases. After adjustment for bone area, the proportion of children with osteopenia fell to 22%. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that children with IBD often have small bones for age because they have growth retardation. When DXA data are interpreted with adjustment for bone size, most children were found to have adequate bone mass. Correct interpretation of DXA is important for identifying children who may be at a real risk of osteoporosis.},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is often a major clinical problem in patients affected by IBD. Assessment of nutritional status should be routinely carried out in these patients and, in case of severe malnutrition, artificial nutrition should be used. In ulcerative colitis and in Crohn disease localized to colonic segments both Parenteral Nutrition (PN) and Enteral Nutrition (EN) have similar results as support treatments but they have no primary therapeutic effects and then they are indicated only in case of severe malnutrition and/or when a surgical procedure is planned. Some theoretical advantages derived from supplementation of short chain fatty acids and omega3-series is still debated. More evident are the advantages of nutritional support in Crohn enteritis. Both PN and EN have a role as a primary therapy capable to induce remission although these results are not prolonged in time when nutrition is not associated with pharmacological treatments. Experiments of pharmaco-nutrition with glutamine and fish fatty acid have to be validated in the clinical practice. In case of integrity of the small bowel and tolerance of the patient, EN is preferable to PN for its lower costs and reduced related complications. PN is still indicated in more severe cases or in acute phase when the need of restoring rapidly the hydroelectrolitic and nitrogen/caloric balance prevails.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the diagnosis and treatment of colovaginal fistulas from various causes. DATA SOURCES: Papers on colovaginal fistulas were identified using Ovid and PubMed. The search terms used were as follows: colovaginal fistulas, rectovaginal fistulas, diverticular disease and fistulas. METHODS OF STUDY: Articles were selected based on their relevance to colovaginal fistulas and were then further subdivided into epidemiology, etiology, presentation, diagnosis and management. RESULTS: English-language papers were selected based on their relevance to all aspects of colovaginal fistulas. CONCLUSION: Optimizing nutrition is paramount prior to surgery. Medical management rarely corrects the problem. Diverticular colovaginal fistulas arise in patients who have previously undergone a hysterectomy. Radiation-related fistulas often involve the distal sigmoid colon and rectum, and recurrent cancer must be ruled out. Often symptoms are associated with radiation cystitis and terminal ileitis. When indicated, restoration of intestinal continuity is preferred. Malignant fistulas carry a poor prognosis, and when surgical removal is not practical, they are treated palliatively with fecal diversion or an endoluminal stent. Those arising from inflammatory bowel disease most frequently arise due to Crohn's disease, and extirpation of diseased bowel and associated abscess will successfully treat the condition. Fistulas arising from ulcerative colitis can be malignant. There remains a small role for colostomy as a nondefinitive procedure to alleviate symptoms. Colovaginal fistulas require a multidisciplinary approach and focused diagnostics, successful treatment can dramatically improve the patient's quality of life.},

Undernutrition has been thought to be the main reason for delayed puberty in these patients. However, puberty may be delayed despite a normal nutritional status. Observations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in rats with experimental colitis suggest that inflammatory mediators may have a direct adverse influence, independent of undernutrition, on the onset and progression of puberty. Serum androgens are consistently reported to be reduced in patients with delayed puberty and inflammatory bowel disease. This reduction is not necessarily secondary to a reduction in gonadotrophins as serum concentrations of gonadotrophins have been reported to be normal or even increased in some studies. Management of delayed puberty involves calorie supplements to correct undernutrition and treatment of inflammation. Observations in boys with delayed puberty and controlled studies in experimental models of intestinal inflammation suggest that testosterone therapy can accelerate puberty.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The potential pathogenicity of free radicals may have a pivotal role in ulcerative colitis. Fish oil omega-3 fatty acids exert anti-inflammatory effects on patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), but the precise mechanism of the action of fish oil on oxidative stress is still controversial. The aim of the present work was to verify the blood oxidative stress in patients with UC and determine whether the association of sulfasalazine to fish oil omega-3 fatty acids is more effective than isolated use of sulfasalazine to reduce the oxidative stress. METHODS: Nine patients (seven female and two male; mean age = 40 +/- 11 y) with mild or moderate active UC were studied in a randomized crossover design. In addition to their usual medication (2 g/d of sulfasalazine), they received fish oil omega-3 fatty acids (4.5 g/d) or placebo for 2-mo treatment periods that were separated by 2 mo, when they only received sulfasalazine. Nine healthy individuals served as control subjects to study the oxidative stress status. Disease activity was assessed by laboratory indicators (C-reactive protein, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, alpha1-antitrypsin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin, hemoglobin, and platelet count), sigmoidoscopy, and histology scores. Analysis of oxidative stress was assessed by plasma chemiluminescence and erythrocyte lipid peroxidation, both induced by tert butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) and by plasma malondialdehyde. Antioxidant status was assayed by total plasma antioxidant capacity (TRAP) and microsomal lipid peroxidation inhibition (LPI). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase erythrocyte enzymatic activities were also determined. RESULTS: No significant changes were observed in any laboratory indicator or in the sigmoidoscopy or histology scores, with the exception of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which decreased with both treatments. Oxidative stress was demonstrated by significant decreases in TRAP and LPI levels, increased chemiluminescence induced by t-BuOOH, and higher SOD activity in patients with UC. Treatment with fish oil omega-3 fatty acids reverted the chemiluminescence induced by t-BuOOH and LPI to baseline levels but that did not occur when patients received only sulfasalazine. Levels of plasma malondialdehyde, erythrocyte lipid peroxidation, and catalase were not different from those in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that plasma oxidative stress occurs in patients with UC, and there was a significant decrease when the patients used sulfasalazine plus fish oil omega-3 fatty acids. However, there was no improvement in most laboratory indicators, sigmoidoscopy, and histology scores. The results suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may act as free radical scavengers protecting the patients against the overall effect of oxidative stress.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by periods of relapse and remission. Treatment is aimed at reducing symptoms during relapse and prolonging the duration of remissions. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its prodrug azathioprine (AZA) are commonly used to prolong clinical remissions. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are two widely used laboratory markers of inflammation. The authors observed an unexplained discordance between ESR and CRP in children with asymptomatic IBD who were being treated with AZA or 6-MP. OBJECTIVE: To characterize children with IBD in remission treated with 6-MP or AZA who have persistently elevated ESR but normal CRP. METHODS: All patients seen in Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2002, with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis who received AZA or 6-MP continuously for at least 6 months were identified and their medical records reviewed. RESULTS: One hundred twenty patients met the eligibility criteria. Twelve had an ESR >18 mm/hour on at least three occasions during at least 12 consecutive months with a simultaneous CRP <0.8 mg/dL. Eleven of these 12 had no signs or symptoms of active disease and had Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index scores <10 for at least 12 consecutive months while the ESR was elevated. Disease duration was similar in the 11 children with asymptomatic disease and with discordant ESR and CRP and in 108 children with concordant ESR and CRP (69.2 + 22.5 months v 54.3 +/- 40.1 months, P = 0.0709). Duration of AZA or 6-MP therapy was greater in the 11 children with asymptomatic disease and discordant ESR and CRP than in those with or without symptoms and with concordant ESR and CRP (58.1 +/- 16.4 months v 36.6 +/- 24.1 months, P = 0.0043). There were no differences between the groups with respect to diagnosis, location of disease, or age at onset of symptoms. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was somewhat larger in the children with discordant ESR and CRP than in the children with concordant ESR and CRP (91.4 +/- 6.97 fL v 87.0 +/-7.07 fL, respectively, P = 0.0373); however, in both groups, the MCV was in the normal range. There were no significant differences in hematocrit, white blood cell count, serum albumin, total serum protein, or estimated serum globulin between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that among children treated with AZA or 6-MP, CRP may be a more reliable indirect indicator of inflammation than ESR. This report alerts clinicians that some children taking AZA or 6-MP may have persistent elevation of the ESR with a normal CRP and have no clinical evidence of active disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cytokines appear to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with a predominant Th2 pattern in colonic mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Chemokines and their receptors also regulate the migration of Th1 or Th2 lymphocytes to inflammatory tissues during the immune response. Although adult UC is usually confined to the colon, pediatric UC not uncommonly affects the stomach. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare expression of cytokines, chemokine receptors, and homing molecules in the rectal and the histologically characterized gastric mucosa of pediatric patients with UC. SUBJECTS Sixteen patients (11 girls and 5 boys; median age, 9 years) having all the features of UC were included in the study. METHODS: Rectal and gastric mucosa obtained from UC cases were immunostained with antibodies against L-selectin, beta 7 integrin, CXCR3, CCR3, and CCR5. IL-4 and IL-12 p40 transcript expression was studied by in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Chronic gastritis was found in 93.7% of cases and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) was found in 2 (13.3%) cases. In the rectal and gastric mucosa, CXCR3 was found in perivascular lymphocytes and CCR5 in a subset of CXCR3+ cells in the lamina propria. CCR3+ lymphocytes and IL-4-positive cells were always found, but there was no evidence of IL-12 production. Most of the lymphocytes infiltrating the gastric mucosa expressed beta 7 but not CD62L. In contrast, beta 7-positive cells were randomly dispersed in the rectal lamina propria, and the fraction of CD3+beta 7+ was low. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that gastritis is common in pediatric UC. The presence of CCR3+ lymphocytes, IL-4 transcript expression, without IL-12 p40 production in the stomach and in the rectum suggests a Th2 immune response. The presence of CCR3+, CD62L- activated Th2 cells may suggest that these gastric cells are recruited from colorectal primary lesions.},

Because the high ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids (FAs) of the Western diet might promote rheumatic disorders, we sought to compare the effects of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil and n-6-rich soy oil on IBD-related joint pain. METHODS: Nineteen patients with IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 9 had Crohn disease and 10 had ulcerative colitis. Ten millilitres seal oil (n = 10) or soy oil (n = 9) was self-administered through a nasoduodenal feeding tube 3 times daily for 10 days. RESULTS: Compared with soy oil treatment, seal oil significantly reduced the duration of morning stiffness (P = 0.024), number of tender joints (P = 0.035), intensity of pain (P = 0.025) and the doctor's scoring of rheumatic disease activity (P = 0.025) at the end of the 10-day treatment period. Analysis of the effects as area under the curve (area between the curve and baseline, zero) for the entire period from start of treatment until 6 months' post-treatment suggested a long-lasting beneficial effect of seal oil administration on joint pain, whereas soy oil tended (not significantly) to aggravate the condition. Consistently, the serum ratios of n-6 to n-3 FAs (P < 0.01) and arachidonic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid (P < 0.01) were reduced after treatment with seal oil. CONCLUSION: The results suggest distinctive, differential prolonged effects on IBD-related joint pain of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil (significant improvement) and n-6-rich soy oil (tendency to exacerbation).},

They have been used for centuries in the form of dairy-based fermented products, but the potential use of probiotics as a form of medical nutrition therapy has not received formal recognition. A detailed literature review (from 1950 through February 2004) of English-language articles was undertaken to find articles showing a relationship between probiotic use and medical conditions. Medical conditions that have been reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive, hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary tract infections, and others. The use of probiotics should be further investigated for possible benefits and side-effects in patients affected by these medical conditions.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory Bowel Diseases--ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease--are chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases of unknown etiology. Decreased oral intake, malabsorption, accelerated nutrient losses, increased requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions cause nutritional and functional deficiencies that require proper correction by nutritional therapy. The goals of the different forms of nutritional therapy are to correct nutritional disturbances and to modulate inflammatory response, thus influencing disease activity. Nutritional intervention may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the costs and complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted. Total parenteral nutrition has been used to correct and prevent nutritional disturbances and to promote bowel rest during active disease, mainly in cases of digestive fistulae with a high output. Its use should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing clinical remission of disease in adults and promoting growth in children. Recent research has focused on the use of specific nutrients as primary treatment agents. Although some reports have indicated that glutamine, short-chain fatty acids, antioxidants and immunonutrition with omega-3 fatty acids are an important therapeutic alternative in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases, the beneficial reported effects have yet to be translated into the clinical practice. The real efficacy of these nutrients still need further evaluation through prospective and randomized trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Discrimination between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD) may be difficult on ileo-colonoscopy alone because of a lack of definitive lesions. Retrospective studies show upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may be helpful in confirming diagnosis in such cases. AIMS: To prospectively determine importance of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and assess factors predictive of upper gastrointestinal involvement in IBD. METHODS: All pediatric patients were enrolled prospectively and consecutively over a 2-year period and investigated with an ileo-colonoscopy and barium meal follow-through. Children with procto-sigmoiditis, later confirmed histologically to be typical of UC, were excluded from the study. The remainder underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The protocol and methodology were determined a priori. RESULTS: 65 children suspected of IBD underwent colonoscopy. Of the total, 11 had recto-sigmoiditis with typical macroscopic appearances of UC; once this was confirmed on histology these patients were excluded from the study. Of the 54 children (males, 31; median age, 11.1 years) remaining, 23 were initially diagnosed with CD on ileo-colonoscopy and 18 (33%) were diagnosed with UC. The diagnosis remained ambiguous in 13 (six colonic, four ileo-colonic, three normal colon) on clinical, radiologic and histologic grounds. Upper GI endoscopy helped to confirm CD in a further 11 (20.4%). Two patients were diagnosed with indeterminate colitis. Upper gastrointestinal inflammation was seen in 29 of 54 (22 CD; 7 UC ). Epigastric and abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, weight loss and pan-ileocolitis were predictive of upper gastrointestinal involvement (P < 0.05). However, 9 children with upper gastrointestinal involvement were asymptomatic at presentation (31%). Overall upper gastrointestinal tract inflammation was most common in the stomach (67%), followed by the esophagus (54%) and duodenum (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy should be part of the first-line investigation in all new cases suspected of IBD. Absence of specific upper gastrointestinal symptoms do not preclude presence of upper gastrointestinal inflammation.},

The present study examined the effects of psyllium and fat on the enzymes responsible for sphingomyelin metabolism and apoptosis in the colon. Mice were fed control, psyllium-containing (100 g/kg), high-fat (313 g/kg, 53 % energy as fat) or high-fat plus psyllium diets for 4 weeks. The activities of acid, neutral and alkaline sphingomyelinase (SMase), neutral ceramidase, and caspase 3, 8 and 9 in colonic mucosa were determined. The expressions of alkaline SMase and caspase 3 were examined. The psyllium-containing diet was found to increase significantly the activities of alkaline SMase and caspase 3 and decreased those of acid SMase and neutral ceramidase. The high-fat diet had opposite effects on these enzymes and attenuated the effects of psyllium. Western blotting showed that psyllium increased and high-fat decreased the levels of alkaline SMase and caspase 3 in colonic mucosa. The change in caspase 3 activity was positively correlated with that of alkaline SMase and negatively with acid SMase. No similar changes of acid and alkaline phosphatase activities in the colon or acid and neutral SMase activity in the liver were identified. In conclusion, colonic sphingomyelin metabolism and apoptosis were affected by psyllium and fat in an opposite manner. The results may have implications for colorectal tumourigenesis and inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: At the present time procto-colectomy is the only potentially curative therapeutic measure for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to its morbidity and mortality, several prognostic indexes have been proposed to identify subjects in whom surgery could be beneficial. However, they have limited availability or they are very cumbersome for the individual patient. AIM: To analyze demographic, clinical and biochemical variables in a group of 184 Mexican patients with UC in order to identify predicting factors for procto-colectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Subjects were divided into two groups: A. Those in whom a procto-colectomy was performed (n = 52) and B. Patients on medical treatment in = 132). Continuous variables were analyzed by means of the Student's t test and categorical variables by means of chi-square statistic. A multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression. RESULTS: The main indication for surgery was failure to medical treatment (78%). Procto-colectomy was elective in 28 cases and an emergency procedure in 14 (7 failures to medical treatment, 4 colonic perforations, 2 toxic megacolons and 1 uncontrolled hemorrhage). All operated subjects had pancolitis and showed more bloody bowel movements per day (> 10), fever (> 38.5 degrees C), tachycardia, hipoalbuminemia and hospitalizations. Only hypoalbuminemia in subjects with universal colitis was consistently associated to procto-colectomy. CONCLUSION: Pancolitis, hypoalbuminemia and previous hospitalizations were the strongest predictors of procto-colectomy in our cohort. Thus, serum protein determinations can be useful in patients with universal UC to decide surgical therapy.},

However, smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease and worsens its course, increasing the need for steroids, immunosuppressants and reoperations. Smoking cessation aggravates ulcerative colitis and improves Crohn's disease. The effects of smoking are the sum of contradictory effects of various substances, including nicotine and carbon monoxide, and are modulated by gender, genetic background, disease location and activity, cigarette dose and nicotine concentration. Smokers with ulcerative colitis should not be discouraged from stopping smoking but encouraged to stop, to reduce their risk of cardiopulmonary tobacco-related diseases. In Crohn's disease, smoking cessation has become a major therapeutic goal, particularly in young women and in patients with ileal involvement. A large amount of supportive information, use of nicotine-replacement therapies and antidepressants, and individual counselling might aid the patient in quitting.},

AIM: To determine the rate of reactions in children following infliximab infusions, and to identify variables that might be predictive of those reactions. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all infliximab infusions performed at Columbus Children's Hospital from December 1998 through September 2001. RESULTS: Fifty-seven children received 361 infusions. Three hundred and fifty-five of the 361 infusions (98.3%) were completed. Fifty children had 304 repeat infusions. There were a total of 35 infusion related reactions. Female gender and the use of immunosuppressive medications for less than 4 months were risk factors for a reaction to infusion number 2. A reaction to infusion 2 and immunosuppressive use for less than 4 months were risk factors for infusion number 3. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of infusion reactions in children receiving infliximab is similar to that in adults. Female gender, immunosuppressive use for less than 4 months and prior infusion reactions may be risk factors for subsequent infusion reactions in children.},

   abstract = {There is increasing evidence that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), produced by intestinal sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of chronic diseases such as ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer. The activity of SRB, and thus H2S production, is likely determined by the availability of sulfur-containing compounds in the intestine. However, little is known about the impact of dietary or inorganic sulfate on intestinal sulfate and SRB-derived H2S concentrations. In this study, the effects of short-term (7 day) and long-term (1 year) inorganic sulfate supplementation of the drinking water on gastrointestinal (GI) sulfate and H2S concentrations (and thus activity of resident SRBs), and the density of large intestinal sulfomucin-containing goblet cells, were examined in C3H/HeJBir mice. Additionally, a PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)-based molecular ecology technique was used to examine the impact of sulfate-amended drinking water on microbial community structure throughout the GI tract. Average H2S concentrations ranged from 0.1 mM (stomach) to 1 mM (cecum). A sulfate reduction assay demonstrated in situ production of H2S throughout the GI tract, confirming the presence of SRB. However, H2S generation and concentrations were greatest in the cecum and colon. Sulfate supplementation of drinking water did not significantly increase intestinal sulfate or H2S concentrations, suggesting that inorganic sulfate is not an important modulator of intestinal H2S concentrations, although it altered the bacterial profiles of the stomach and distal colon of 1-year-old mice. This change in colonic bacterial profiles may reflect a corresponding increase in the density of sulfomucin-containing goblet cells in sulfate-supplemented compared with control mice.},

   abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), produced by commensal sulfate-reducing bacteria, is an environmental insult that potentially contributes to chronic intestinal epithelial disorders. We tested the hypothesis that exposure of nontransformed intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-18) to the reducing agent sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) activates molecular pathways that underlie epithelial hyperplasia, a phenotype common to both ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer. Exposure of IEC-18 cells to NaHS rapidly increased the NADPH/NADP ratio, reduced the intracellular redox environment, and inhibited mitochondrial respiratory activity. The addition of 0.2-5 mM NaHS for 4 h increased the IEC-18 proliferative cell fraction (P<0.05), as evidenced by analysis of the cell cycle and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, while apoptosis occurred only at the highest concentration of NaHS. Thirty minutes of NaHS exposure increased (P<0.05) c-Jun mRNA concentrations, consistent with the observed activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK). Microarray analysis confirmed an increase (P<0.05) in MAPK-mediated proliferative activity, likely reflecting the reduced redox environment of NaHS-treated cells. These data identify functional pathways by which H2S may initiate epithelial dysregulation and thereby contribute to UC or colorectal cancer. Thus, it becomes crucial to understand how genetic background may affect epithelial responsiveness to this bacterial-derived environmental insult.},

Using colonic explant cultures from 132 IBD and control subjects, we examined tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) production in vitro in response to bacterial activators. Unstimulated TNF-alpha release was increased significantly in rectal biopsies from involved IBD tissue, correlating with inflammation severity. Whereas lipopolysaccharide (LPS) only moderately stimulated TNF-alpha production from inflamed tissue, pokeweed mitogen (PWM) induced its release in all groups, with a stronger response in involved IBD tissue. Superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) had a similar, but weaker effect. SEB was observed to be the strongest inducer of TNF-alpha for all groups, again with a more marked response in inflamed tissue. Stimulated release of IL-1 was considerably less than for TNF-alpha. The superantigens' superior potency over LPS was not as marked for IL-1 as it was for TNF-alpha. In addition to IL-1, IL-1RA release was also triggered by the bacterial products. The net effect of activation on the IL-1RA/IL-1 ratio was relatively modest. Release of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1, as well as that of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1RA was increased by incubation of colonic tissue with bacterial factors. TNF-alpha production and release was increased significantly in involved colonic explants from IBD. SEB was even capable of inducing TNF-alpha release from uninvolved colonic tissue.},

The records of all patients with IBD who were receiving temporary home TPN between June 1996 and July 2000 were reviewed. A quality-of-life phone interview was conducted at the time of review. Fifteen patients (11 men and 4 women) were identified whose average age was 35 years. The underlying diagnosis was Crohn's disease in 10 and ulcerative colitis in five. The indications for home TPN were complex internal fistulas and resolving sepsis in two, postoperative septic complications (anastomotic leak/enterocutaneous fistula) in five, high-output proximal stomas in four, prolonged ileus/partial obstruction in three, and spontaneous enterocutaneous fistula in one. The average duration of home TPN was 75 days (range 7 to 240 days). Two patients (13%) failed home TPN (1 with uncontrolled sepsis; 1 with dehydration) and were readmitted to the hospital. Home TPN was discontinued in one patient whose enterocutaneous fistula failed to heal with nonoperative treatment. Home TPN was successful in 12 patients (80%): eight (53%) who underwent planned definitive surgery and four (27%) whose conditions resolved without surgery. Complications of home TPN were line sepsis and pulmonary aspergillosis in one patient. All patients preferred home TPN to further hospitalization and reported good or excellent quality of life at home. Home TPN is a safe alternative to prolonged hospitalization or early surgery in patients with complicated IBD.},

A chronic colitis was induced by oral administration of 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 9 days followed by 2% DSS for 18 days. DSS-treated rats showed increased colonic MUC2,3 mRNA levels compared pair-fed controls. The mucin FSR was unaffected while mucin-containing goblet cells were depleted in the vicinity of lesions. In the small intestine, no inflammatory lesions were observed but ileal MUC2 mRNA levels and mucin FSR were decreased by 46% and 21%, respectively. Finally, DSS-treated rats showed a marked decrease in mucin's threonine + serine content all along the gut, which may lead to a reduction of potential O-glycosylation sites. Our data indicate that the chronic colitis may impair the mucus layer protective function all along the gut.},

There are few large-scale pediatric studies on the complications of infliximab therapy. METHODS: A retrospective review of all infliximab infusions administered to IBD patients at a tertiary children's hospital was undertaken. Data was obtained from an infliximab infusion database maintained in the section of Pediatric Gastroenterology, pharmacy records and patient charts. RESULTS: 594 infusions were administered to 111 IBD patients (88 CD and 23 UC; 55 male and 56 female; ages 4 to 20 years; mean age, 13.4 years). The number of infusions ranged from 1 to 24 with a mean of 5.4/patient. Infusion reactions occurred in 8.1% of patients (seven early and two delayed) and in 1.5% of all infusions. Reactions occurred more frequently in female patients (14% versus 2%; P = 0.03). All reactions were mild and responded rapidly to treatment. Four patients had infections deemed unusual, including three cutaneous tinea infections and one case of shingles. CONCLUSION: Infliximab is safe in pediatric IBD patients with a low incidence of generally mild reactions that respond rapidly to intervention. Infusion reactions are more common in female patients. Our patients had no serious infectious complications, although cutaneous tinea infection may represent a newly reported associated complication.},

Growth retardation, osteopenia and thromboembolic phenomena are some of the inflammatory bowel disease complications in which nutritional deficits are involved. Moreover, nutrients can play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease and, in some cases, can be a primary therapeutic tool. Enteral nutrition has proven to play a therapeutic role in Crohn's disease. The nutrient(s) responsible for this effect are not well identified but dietary fat appears to be a major factor. In ulcerative colitis, unabsorbable carbohydrates can modulate the intestinal microbial environment, thus contributing to improve colonic inflammation.},

   abstract = {Nutrients may be involved in the modulation of the immune response through at least three different mechanisms. First, the intestinal ecosystem plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, triggering the uncontrolled inflammatory response in genetically predisposed individuals. Nutrients, together with bacteria, are major components of, and can therefore influence, the intestinal environment. Second, as components of cell membranes, nutrients can mediate the expression of proteins involved in the immune response, such as cytokines, adhesion molecules and nitric oxide synthase. The composition of lipids in the cell membrane is modified by dietary changes and can influence cellular responses. Indeed, various epidemiological, experimental and clinical data suggest that the immune response may be sensitive to changes in dietary composition. Finally, suboptimal levels of micronutrients are often found in both children and adults with inflammatory bowel disease, although, with the exception of iron and folate, it is unusual to discover symptoms attributable to these deficits. However, subclinical deficits may have a pathophysiological significance, as they may favour the self-perpetuation of the disease (due to defects in the mechanisms of tissue repair), cause defective defence against damage produced by oxygen free radicals and facilitate lipid peroxidation. These events can occur even in clinically inactive or mildly active disease, as well as in the development of dysplasia in the intestinal mucosa. Some dietary manipulations have been attempted as primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and specially formulated diets for enteral nutrition have proved to be an effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Most trials, although lacking sufficient patient numbers, have demonstrated a role for dietary manipulation as primary therapy for inflammatory disease. Dietary lipids are one of the most active nutritional substrates modulating the immune response. Recently, it has been demonstrated that lipids may be a key factor explaining the therapeutic effect of clinical nutrition in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Major advances in the understanding of the aetio-pathogenesis and genetics of inflammatory bowel disease have been accompanied by an escalation in the sophistication of immunomodulatory inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics. However, the basic 'triple' therapy (5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, azathioprine) and nutrition have maintained their central role in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease over recent decades. This review provides an overview of the supportive and therapeutic perspectives of nutrition in adult inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of supportive nutrition is to correct malnutrition in terms of calorie intake or specific macro- or micronutrients. Of particular clinical relevance is deficiency in calcium, vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and zinc. There is justifiably a growing sense of unease amongst clinicians and patients with regard to the long-term use of corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. This, rather than arguments about efficacy, should be the catalyst for revisiting the use of enteral nutrition as primary treatment in Crohn's disease. Treatment failure is usually related to a failure to comply with enteral nutrition. Potential factors that militate against successful completion of enteral nutrition are feed palatability, inability to stay on a solid-free diet for weeks, social inconvenience and transient feed-related adverse reactions. Actions that can be taken to improve treatment outcome include the provision of good support from dietitians and clinicians for the duration of treatment and the subsequent 'weaning' period. There is evidence to support a gradual return to a normal diet through exclusion-re-introduction or other dietary regimen following the completion of enteral nutrition to increase remission rates. We also review the evidence for emerging therapies, such as glutamine, growth factors and short-chain fatty acids. The future may see the evolution of enteral nutrition into an important therapeutic strategy, and the design of a 'Crohn's disease-specific formulation' that is individually tailored, acceptable to patients, cost-effective, free from adverse side-effects and combines enteral nutrition with novel pre- and pro-biotics and other factors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our purpose was to study the concordance of serological tests for inflammatory bowel disease with clinical diagnosis established by traditional testing in children. METHODS: All children seen in our division who had IBD Diagnostic System (ie, pANCA, ASCA IgA, and ASCA IgG) performed over a 21-month period (June 1998 to February 2000) were identified. Their medical records were reviewed for basic demographics, test results (endoscopy, histology, and radiology), IBD Diagnostic System results, and patient symptoms/medications. Results of the IBD Diagnostic System were compared with several patient characteristics including age, sex, absence/presence of symptoms, medication use, disease activity and duration. RESULTS: One hundred seven patients were divided into 6 groups based on clinical diagnosis and IBD Diagnostic System results. The sensitivity, specificity and +/- predictive values of the IBD Diagnostic System for ulcerative colitis were 69.2, 95.1, 90.0, and 87.1%, respectively, and for Crohn's disease were 54.1, 96.8, 90.9, and 80.8%, respectively. Overall, the results of the IBD Diagnostic System were concordant with the clinical diagnosis in 76 of the 107 (71%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the specificity of IBD Diagnostic System is better than the sensitivity; the sensitivity is better for ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease (69.2% vs 54.1%). The low sensitivity, especially for Crohn's disease, precludes the possibility that the IBD Diagnostic System can replace traditional studies when evaluating for inflammatory bowel disease. Though we do not exclude inflammatory bowel disease solely by IBD Diagnostic System results, it is reassuring to note that all patients without clinical evidence of inflammatory bowel disease also had negative IBD Diagnostic System results.},

Nevertheless, debates continue regarding the optimization of treatment with aminosalicylates and the short- and long-term benefits of immunomodulation in ulcerative colitis. This article focuses on the most recent clinical studies pertaining to the management of ulcerative colitis and explores both the advances and controversies pertaining to aminosalicylate therapy, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and the purine antimetabolites. Novel therapeutic approaches--including preliminary experience with biological therapies directed at tumor necrosis factor and other cytokines, adhesion molecules, growth factors, and probiotics--will be reviewed. Recent data regarding potential chemoprevention in long-standing ulcerative colitis and management of postoperative complications and pouchitis will also be discussed.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), afflict an estimated one million Americans and produce symptoms that impair quality of life and ability to function. Progress in IBD management strategies has led to optimized approaches for achieving the two primary clinical goals of therapy: induction and maintenance of remission. Although surgery is indicated to treat refractory disease or specific complications, pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of IBD management. The efficacy of aminosalicylates for induction of remission in mild to moderate UC and CD is well established, as is their role for maintenance of remission in UC. The sulfa-free mesalamine formulation offers an adverse effect profile similar to that of placebo, enabling the administration of higher, more effective doses. Although corticosteroids provide potent anti-inflammatory effects, their benefits are countermanded by the risk of intolerable and serious adverse effects, and they are ineffective for maintenance therapy. Other agents effective in inducing or maintaining remission are azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, infliximab, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and antibiotics. Ongoing clinical trials of experimental therapies will generate new tools for IBD treatment. Currently, a broad range of options allows physicians to tailor treatment to each patient's needs and preferences. Such considerations are essential for maximizing adherence to therapy.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The past year has brought forth several controversies regarding the treatment of ulcerative colitis along with several potentially important clinical advances. The aim of this review is to provide the practicing gastroenterologist with a summation of these recent developments, with particular emphasis on advances that have already moved toward acceptance into clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Controversies remain regarding the optimal formulations and doses of aminosalicylates. At the same time, the potential for chemoprotective effects in patients using maintenance therapy with mesalamine derivatives has been expanded. In addition, advances in biologic therapy for Crohn disease are beginning to be formally evaluated in ulcerative colitis, although the benefits of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy in this condition remain to be established. Biologic therapies are beginning to be explored as adjunctive therapy for steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis, where trials of calcineurin inhibitors are also advancing clinical practice for this poor prognostic subgroup of patients. Finally, after surgery for ulcerative colitis, the treatment and prevention of pouchitis has become the one established indication for probiotic therapy. SUMMARY: Despite some inroads into the medical therapy of ulcerative colitis, controversies remain regarding the optimal dosing and delivery systems of the most fundamental therapies, and how to optimize therapy for severe ulcerative colitis. Clinical research will continue to investigate new biologic agents that inhibit tumor necrosis factor and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, and ongoing trials with leukocyte apheresis are currently under way.},

Both sulfasalazine and newer derivatives are effective in preventing relapses. It remains to be determined whether certain high-risk groups of patients may benefit from higher doses of mesalamine induction or maintenance therapy. Mesalamine derivatives are also of benefit in the treatment of Crohn's disease. Sulfasalazine is likely not effective in the maintenance of Crohn's disease, although other mesalamine formulations continue to show some prophylactic activity after mesalamine induced remissions and for patients with disease of the ileum who have undergone surgical resection.},

   abstract = {Phthalates are a group of multifunctional chemicals used in consumer and personal care products, plastics, and medical devices. Laboratory studies show that some phthalates are reproductive and developmental toxicants. Recently, human studies have shown measurable levels of several phthalates in most of the U.S. general population. Despite their widespread use and the consistent toxicologic data on phthalates, information is limited on sources and pathways of human exposure to phthalates. One potential source of exposure is medications. The need for site-specific dosage medications has led to the use of enteric coatings that allow the release of the active ingredients into the small intestine or in the colon. The enteric coatings generally consist of various polymers that contain plasticizers, including triethyl citrate, dibutyl sebacate, and phthalates such as diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). In this article we report on medications as a potential source of exposure to DBP in a man who took Asacol [active ingredient mesalamine (mesalazine)] for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. In a spot urine sample from this man collected 3 months after he started taking Asacol, the concentration of monobutyl phthalate, a DBP metabolite, was 16,868 ng/mL (6,180 micro g/g creatinine). This concentration was more than two orders of magnitude higher than the 95th percentile for males reported in the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The patient's urinary concentrations of monoethyl phthalate (443.7 ng/mL, 162.6 micro g/g creatinine), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (3.0 ng/mL, 1.1 micro g/g creatinine), and monobenzyl phthalate (9.3 ng/mL, 3.4 micro g/g creatinine) were unremarkable compared with the NHANES 1999-2000 values. Before this report, the highest estimated human exposure to DBP was more than two orders of magnitude lower than the no observable adverse effect level from animal studies. Further research is necessary to determine the proportional contribution of medications, as well as personal care and consumer products, to a person's total phthalate burden.},

Although the exact cause of ulcerative colitis remains undetermined, the condition appears to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While conventional treatments can be effective in maintaining remission and decreasing the length of active disease periods, the treatments are not without side effects, and a significant number of people suffering from UC fail to respond to even the strongest drugs. This article reviews potential unconventional treatments - transdermal nicotine, heparin, melatonin, DHEA, probiotics, fiber, dietary changes, botanicals, essential fatty acids, and other nutrients - that may be considered in conjunction with conventional approaches or as part of a comprehensive alternative treatment protocol. In addition this review addresses risk factors, pathogenesis, nutrient deficiencies, conventional treatment approaches, and extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are complex genetic disorders resulting from the complex interplay between several genetic and environmental risk factors. The number of IBD genes is currently unknown but it is expected to be equal or higher to 8. None of these genes are expected to be neither necessary nor sufficient for disease development. Among the candidate genes investigated to date, only CARD15/NOD2 has been definitively associated with Crohn Disease (CD) but not Ulcerative Colitis (UC). This gene explains about 20% of the genetic predisposition to CD. Because it is involved in the innate immunity, it allows to speculate that CD is the result of a defect in host-bacteria interaction. However, it is not known if CD is caused by specific bacteria or the gut flora as a whole.},

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomised clinical trial of the use of a bifidobacteria-fermented milk (BFM) supplement as a dietary adjunct in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. METHODS: The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: a group with BFM supplementation (BFM group, 11 subjects) and a control group (control group, 10 subjects). The BFM group was given 100 mL/day of BFM for one year. Colonoscopies, general blood markers and examinations of intestinal flora including the analysis of fecal organic acids were performed at the commencement of the study and after one year. RESULTS: Exacerbation of symptoms was seen in 3 out of 11 subjects in the BFM group and in 9 out of 10 in the control group. Log rank statistic analysis of the cumulative exacerbation rates showed a significant reduction in exacerbations for the BFM group (p = 0.0184). The analysis of microflora and the organic acids in the feces showed a significant reduction in the relative proportion of B. vulgatus in Bacteroidaceae and butyrate concentration, respectively, after supplementation with BFM, in comparison with before. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with the BFM product was successful in maintaining remission and had possible preventive effects on the relapse of ulcerative colitis.},

Our aim was to assess body composition in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and to evaluate possible differences between the patient groups and healthy subjects. METHODS: A total of 60 patients with CD, 60 patients with UC, and 60 healthy subjects were investigated. Each group consisted of 24 men and 36 women. Body composition was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and Z scores were obtained by comparison to age- and sex-matched normal values. RESULTS: Bone mineral content and lean body mass were significantly lower in patients with CD compared with patients with UC and healthy subjects. The body composition of CD men was more strongly affected than that of women. UC patients had significantly higher fat mass and body mass index than patients with CD and healthy subjects. There was no difference in the percentage of fat mass between the two patient groups. Corticosteroid treatment and smoking had a negative impact on bone mineral content and lean body mass in CD patients independently of each other. CONCLUSIONS: CD was associated with disturbances in body composition: both bone mineral content and lean body mass were significantly reduced, especially in men with CD. Corticosteroid therapy and smoking had a significant influence on body composition in patients with CD. When studying the effects of inflammatory bowel disease on body composition and nutritional status, patients with CD and UC should be evaluated separately.},

The aim of this study was to characterize chemokine receptor expression in peripheral blood memory T cells in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and to correlate the expression with disease activity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 24 patients with CD, 30 patients with UC, 24 normal controls and 10 disease controls. PBMCs were stained by anti-CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO and beta 7 integrin, and the expression of the chemokine receptors were determined by flow cytometry. CCR4 expression on memory T cells was significantly lower in UC than in CD or normal controls, and that of memory CD4+ T and beta 7(high) memory CD4+ T cells was significantly higher in CD than in UC or normal controls. CCR4 expression on memory CD4+ T cells exhibited significant positive correlation with disease activity in CD, and this decreased significantly after treatment. Such a decrease was not found in the disease controls. CCR5 and CXCR3 expression on memory CD8+ T cells was significantly lower in CD than in normal controls. CXCR3 expression on beta 7(high) memory CD4+ T and CXCR3 expression on memory CD8+ T cells were lower in UC than in normal controls. These findings suggest that in peripheral blood memory T cells, chemokine receptor expression is different between CD and UC. Enhancement of CCR4 and suppression of CCR5 and CXCR3 seem to be the characteristic chemokine receptor profile in peripheral blood memory T cells of CD.},

The aim of this study was to determine which dietary factors are associated with an increased risk of relapse of UC. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed with UC patients in remission, recruited from two district general hospitals, who were followed for one year to determine the effect of habitual diet on relapse. Relapse was defined using a validated disease activity index. Nutrient intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and categorised into tertiles. Adjusted odds ratios for relapse were determined using multivariate logistic regression, controlling for non-dietary factors. RESULTS: A total of 191 patients were recruited and 96% completed the study. Fifty two per cent of patients relapsed. Consumption of meat (odds ratio (OR) 3.2 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.3-7.8)), particularly red and processed meat (OR 5.19 (95% CI 2.1-12.9)), protein (OR 3.00 (95% CI 1.25-7.19)), and alcohol (OR 2.71 (95% CI 1.1-6.67)) in the top tertile of intake increased the likelihood of relapse compared with the bottom tertile of intake. High sulphur (OR 2.76 (95% CI 1.19-6.4)) or sulphate (OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.08-6.3)) intakes were also associated with relapse and may offer an explanation for the observed increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially modifiable dietary factors, such as a high meat or alcoholic beverage intake, have been identified that are associated with an increased likelihood of relapse for UC patients. Further studies are needed to determine if it is the sulphur compounds within these foods that mediates the likelihood of relapse and if reducing their intake would reduce relapse frequency.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Ulcerative colitis usually follows a relapsing and remitting course. Patients believe that dietary factors are important. We wished to determine the nature of and reasons for patients' dietary beliefs and their effect on relapse and nutrient intake. METHODS: In a 1-year prospective cohort study, patients' nutrient intake and disease activity were measured with a validated food frequency questionnaire and disease activity index. Food beliefs, demographics and disease characteristics were recorded. The influence of beliefs on the risk of relapse and nutrient intake were examined using chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U-tests. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three patients were studied and 52% relapsed. Sixty-eight per cent held dietary beliefs and reported modifying their intake accordingly. The most common reported behaviour was the avoidance of milk and dairy products. Food beliefs were more common amongst those who had received dietary advice. No reported behaviour reduced the risk of relapse, but patients who avoided dairy products had a significantly lower intake of calcium. Folate intake was below UK recommended levels in 13% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ulcerative colitis believe that many foods are harmful or helpful to their disease activity. Commonly held beliefs do not modify the risk of relapse, but do adversely affect nutrient intake.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a multifunctional cytokine whose net principle action is to diminish inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of IL-13 production has been proposed to contribute to intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Previous studies implicate IL-13 in IBD pathogenesis; however, they fail to accurately reflect in vivo intestinal IL-13 production. We evaluate IL-13, IL-6, and IL-1beta elaborations from colonic organ cultures of pediatric IBD patients METHODS: Endoscopic lamina propria biopsies or surgical specimens from pediatric patients with IBD were organ cultured and supernatants evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-13. RESULTS: IL-13 concentrations were significantly reduced in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients when compared with normal controls (P = 0.002) and Crohn disease (CD) patients (P = 0.001). End-stage UC patients at colectomy had lower intestinal IL-13 production than all other UC patients (P = 0.002). No significant correlation was found between IL-13 concentration and histologic disease severity (P = 0.134). CONCLUSIONS: Diminished intestinal IL-13 production is present in UC patients and wanes further with clinical disease progression. These findings suggest that UC patients may be differentiated from CD patients by intestinal IL-13 quantitation, and UC patients may benefit from IL-13 enhancing therapies.},

   abstract = {Because the intestinal microflora play an important role in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there is currently some interest in the manipulation of the composition of the microflora towards a potentially more remedial community. This review summarizes the clinical and experimental efficacy of the manipulation of microflora by the use of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and antibiotics in IBD. Prebiotics, defined as nondigestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth or activity of one or a limited number of bacterial species already resident in the colon, can modulate the colonic microbiota by increasing the number of specific bacteria and thus changing the composition of the microbiota. Prebiotics for IBD include lactosucrose, oligofructose, inulin, bran, psyllium, and germinated barley foodstuff (GBF). GBF, which mainly consists of dietary fiber and glutamine-rich protein, is a prebiotic foodstuff for ulcerative colitis. GBF has shown to be converted into a preferential nutrient for colonocytes through Eubacterium and Bifidobacterium and also inactivate nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB). Moreover, it exhibits a potent water-holding capacity and bile-acid binding capacity. Probiotics, which are microbial food supplements that beneficially affect the host by improving the intestinal microbial balance, have been used to change the composition of colonic microbiota. The approaches for IBD include VSL#3, Nissle1917, Clostridium butyricum and Bifidobacterium-fermented milk. Use of Lactococci secreting IL-10 provides excellent results. The combination of prebiotics and probiotics in a synbiotic has not been studied in IBD but is promising. The use of antibiotics continues to be of interest. Although these strategies hold great promise and appear to be useful in some settings, more clinical study is needed to firmly establish the relevance of these therapies.},

In our previous study, we carried out a clinical trial of GBF with mildly to moderately active UC patients and showed that GBF treatment was able to attenuate the symptoms of UC in a relatively short-term. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of long-term administration of GBF in the treatment of UC in a multi-center open trial. Twenty-one patients with mildly to moderately active UC received 20-30 g of GBF for 24 weeks in an open-label protocol while baseline treatments (5-amino-salicyrate compounds and/or steroids) were continued. The response to the GBF treatment was evaluated using a clinical scoring and after 24 weeks of observation, the GBF group showed a significant decrease in clinical activity index (especially, the degree of visible blood in stools and the presence of nocturnal diarrhea) compared with the control group (p<0.05). No side effects related to GBF were observed. In conclusion, GBF can reduce the clinical activity of UC over long-term as well as short-term administration. Nutraceutical GBF therapy may have a place in long-term management of UC, but controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its efficacy in the treatment of this disorder.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of GBF on colitis in terms of the epithelial inflammatory response. METHODS: Mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis were used. The effects of GBF on the colitis were evaluated by measuring the body weight; disease activity; mucosal damage (histology, mucosal inflammatory parameters, nuclear factor kappa B [NFkB] activation, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 [STAT3]); serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) level; cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs); and bile acid contents. RESULTS: GBF significantly prevented disease activity and body weight loss after induction of colitis. Serum IL-6 level and mucosal STAT3 expression were also significantly attenuated, with a conspicuous reduction of mucosal damage; NFkB activity showed the same tendency. Cecal butyrate content was significantly higher and, interestingly, GBF mice had lower bile acid concentrations than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: GBF has the potential to reduce the epithelial inflammatory response by depressing STAT-3 expression and inhibiting NFkB binding activity. These effects may be brought about by an increase of butyrate production and adsorption of bile acids.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Restorative proctocolectomy is the elective surgical procedure of choice for ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. Most patients have a satisfactory outcome, but at ten years 15 percent or more will have failed, needing indefinite defunctioning or excision of the pouch. There is little information on the morbidity of pouch excision. The study was designed to present the early results of surgical removal of the pouch after failed restorative proctocolectomy with reference to the indications and intermediate complications, particularly of the perineal wound. METHODS: Between 1977 and 2002, 996 patients underwent a restorative proctocolectomy at our hospital and 245 patients were referred for potential salvage. The pouch was excised in 58 and 10 patients respectively. There were 40 females and 28 males (median age, 34 (14-65) years) including 47 with ulcerative colitis, 10 with Crohn's disease, and 11 with familial adenomatous polyposis. The median follow-up was 79 (range, 3-312) months from excision. RESULTS: There was one (1.4 percent) postoperative death. The overall morbidity rate was 62.3 percent (immediate 30 days (25 percent), late (53.7 percent)). Thirty-six patients (53.7 percent) were readmitted on 67 occasions for a late complication. The risk of readmission from the time of pouch excision was 38 and 58 percent at one and five years, respectively. Surgical treatment was required during 48 of these readmissions. A persistent perineal sinus was the most common late complication. The perineal wound was not healed at 6 months in 27 patients (40 percent) and at 12 months in 7 patients (10 percent). No factor, including age at the time of pouch excision, gender, indication for excision, or final histologic diagnosis, was associated with an unhealed perineal wound. Two males (7 percent) had impotence. One female suffered from short-bowel syndrome with the need of permanent parenteral nutrition. The median overall hospital stay for all admissions was 20 (range, 8-220) days. CONCLUSIONS: Pouch excision is associated with high morbidity. Perineal wound-delayed healing is the commonest late complication and often requires further surgery.},

   abstract = {It was initially hypothesized that resistant starches, i.e., starch that enters the colon, would have protective effects on chronic colonic diseases, including reduction of colon cancer risk and in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Recent studies have confirmed the ability of resistant starch to increase fecal bulk, increase the molar ratio of butyrate in relation to other short-chain fatty acids, and dilute fecal bile acids. However the ability of resistant starch to reduce luminal concentrations of compounds that are damaging to the colonic mucosa, including fecal ammonia, phenols, and N-nitroso compounds, still requires clear demonstration. As such, the effectiveness of resistant starch in preventing or treating colonic diseases remains to be assessed. Nevertheless, there is a fraction of what has been termed resistant (RS1) starch, which enters the colon and acts as slowly digested or lente carbohydrate in the small intestine. Foods in this class are low glycemic index and have been shown to reduce the risk of chronic disease. They have been associated with systemic physiological effects such as reduced postprandial insulin levels and higher HDL cholesterol levels. Consumption of low glycemic index foods has been shown to be related to reductions in risk of coronary heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes has in turn been related to a higher risk of colon cancer. If carbohydrates have a protective role in colon cancer prevention this may lie partly in the systemic effects of low glycemic index foods. The colonic advantages of different carbohydrates, varying in their glycemic index and resistant starch content, therefore, remain to be determined. However, as recent positive research findings continue to mount, there is reason for optimism over the possible health advantages of those resistant starches, which are slowly digested in the small intestine.},

Many aspects of inflammatory bowel disease, including initial evaluation, nutritional support, medical and surgical intervention, and the direction of future research, are encountered in both adult and pediatric patients. However, it is important to delineate issues specific to pediatric patients, especially growth velocity impairment, derangements in and treatment of abnormal bone mineralization, and transitional care issues; the lack of extensive randomized, controlled pediatric therapeutic trials is also a concern. This article reviews the epidemiology of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease incidence and prevalence worldwide, clinical issues (including impairments of growth velocity and bone density), diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, and psychosocial issues unique to pediatric patients. Future research directions defined by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and opportunities provided by existing pediatric research databases are highlighted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has long been believed that breastfeeding provides protection against ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. Studies designated to test this hypothesis were conducted without reaching conclusive results. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analysis was to examine the role of breastfeeding in preventing inflammatory bowel disease and to summarize the evidence gathered about this subject. DESIGN: A meta-analysis was performed on 17 relevant articles that were found by using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Internet, and articles' references. The publications were fully reviewed and divided, on the basis of their quality, into 3 groups. RESULTS: Studies showed heterogeneous results. The pooled odds ratios of all the 17 reviewed studies, calculated according to the random-effects model, were 0.67 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.86) for Crohn disease and 0.77 (0.61, 0.96) for ulcerative colitis. However, only 4 studies for Crohn disease and 4 for ulcerative colitis were eventually included in the highest quality group. In this group, the pooled odds ratio was 0.45 (0.26, 0.79) for Crohn disease and 0.56 (0.38, 0.81) for ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis support the hypothesis that breastfeeding is associated with lower risks of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. However, because only a few studies were graded to be of high quality, we suggest that further research, conducted with good methodology and large sample sizes, should be carried out to strengthen the validity of these observations.},

METHODS: A retrospective review of patients originally diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, status post colectomy and IPAA, who developed findings compatible with Crohn's disease was undertaken. Refractory pouchitis developed in all patients as well as protracted symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, joint pain, and incontinence. All patients received infliximab. RESULTS: Four pediatric patients (2 males and 2 females) with mean age of 14.5 years (range 11-18 years) were studied. The development of perianal fistulas in 2 patients, granuloma on biopsy in 1 patient and perianal skin tag in 1 patient, led to a diagnosis change of CD. After failure to respond to antibiotics, aminosalicylates and immunomodulators such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), all patients were treated with infliximab. Patients received infliximab infusions at a dose of 5 mg/kg, initially at weeks 0, 2 and 6 and subsequently at 8 weeks intervals in combination with an immunomodulator drug. All patients showed marked improvement clinically, endoscopically, and histologically. CONCLUSION: Infliximab can be used successfully for the treatment of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease and IPAA who are refractory to conventional therapies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of newly diagnosed pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a large population-based model. STUDY DESIGN: All pediatric gastroenterologists providing care for Wisconsin children voluntarily identified all new cases of IBD during a 2-year period. Demographic and clinical data were sent to a central registry prospectively for analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of IBD in Wisconsin children was 7.05 per 100,000, whereas the incidence for Crohn's disease was 4.56, more than twice the rate of ulcerative colitis (2.14). An equal IBD incidence occurred among all ethnic groups, and children from sparsely and densely populated counties were equally affected. The majority (89%) of new IBD diagnoses were nonfamilial. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel, prospective, and comprehensive information on pediatric IBD incidence within the United States. The surprisingly high incidence of pediatric IBD, the predominance of Crohn's disease over ulcerative colitis, the low frequency of patients with a family history, the equal distribution of IBD among all racial and ethnic groups, and the lack of a modulatory effect of urbanization on IBD incidence collectively suggest that the clinical spectrum of IBD is still evolving and point to environmental factors contributing to the pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Pouchitis has been associated with abnormal bacterial flora responding to antibiotics. Dietary factors may play a role in modifying the qualitative and quantitative components of the microflora. We evaluated interactions between nutritional factors, fecal and mucosal bacterial flora, and mucosal morphology in patients with a history of pouchitis compared with patients with optimal outcome at least five years after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the study: 11 (7 males; mean age, 49.8 years) with optimal outcome and 21 (11 males; mean age, 47.3 years) with pouchitis history. A seven-day food diary was recorded, endoscopy performed, and biopsies taken from the pouch for histology, mucin staining, and bacterial culture. Fresh fecal samples were quantitatively cultured, and fecal bile acids analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: No differences existed in mean nutrient intake, composition of fecal bile acids, or microbial tissue biopsy cultures between the groups with and without pouchitis. Those with optimal outcome tended to have more benign disease course of ulcerative colitis than patients with pouchitis. In those patients, fecal concentrations (log10 colony-forming unit/g) of anaerobes and aerobes were significantly higher (P = 0.007). Degree of villous atrophy and colonic metaplasia were both associated with fecal anaerobic flora. Low intake of lactose was associated with sulfomucin predominance. A negative correlation existed between fecal aerobes and dietary lactose consumption. CONCLUSIONS: A higher total load of fecal anaerobic bacterial flora is strongly associated with degree of colonic metaplasia, villous atrophy, and inflammation activity after surgery for ulcerative colitis. An association existed between dietary lactose, fecal bacteria, and pouch morphology. Lactose may have prebiotic properties.},

In a historical cohort study, we evaluated the usefulness of baseline gastric antral biopsies in the differentiation of pediatric chronic colitides. METHODS: During initial investigation for suspected inflammatory bowel disease, 39 children and adolescents with colitis but normal small bowel radiography underwent pretreatment upper endoscopy concurrently with colonoscopy. Two reviewers assigned a colonoscopic diagnosis (colonic CD, UC, or indeterminate colitis) based on the macroscopic and microscopic appearances of the colonic mucosa. Antral histological findings were compared between groups using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Five (14%) of colonoscopic diagnoses (four indeterminate, one UC) were changed to CD by the finding of granulomatous inflammation in antral biopsies. Nonspecific antral gastritis was found in similar proportions of children and adolescents with Crohn's colitis and UC (92% vs 75%). Focal antral gastritis was more common in patients with Crohn's colitis than UC (52% vs 8%). CONCLUSIONS: Nonspecific antral gastritis is common in all forms of chronic colitis. Nevertheless, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy is useful in the differentiation of inflammatory bowel disease confined to the colon, particularly when colonoscopic findings are indeterminate.},

Since the discovery of sulfasalazine's efficacy in ulcerative colitis and the subsequent development of sulfa-free mesalamine delivery systems, aminosalicylates have evolved to become an integral part of our therapeutic armamentarium and are now first-line therapies for the treatment of mildly to moderately active inflammatory bowel disease and for maintenance of remissions after successful induction therapy. Despite the substantial body of evidence supporting the use of aminosalicylates in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, gaps in our evidence base and controversies surrounding aminosalicylates clinical application have emerged. In this review, issues of dose response and optimization of the treatment regimen in ulcerative colitis, the discrimination between oral mesalamine formulations in left-sided colitis, and their efficacy in active and quiescent Crohn's disease are discussed.},

Fifty female 8-wk old Swiss-Webster mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups for a pre-treatment "prevention" study: (1) GSH (1% of diet); (2) CoQ10 (200 mg/kg/d); (3) DSS only (3% of drinking water); (4) control (no treatment). The mice in groups 1 and 2 were fed with GSH or CoQ10 for 21 wks, and the mice in groups 1, 2 and 3 were provided DSS from wk 7 for 4 cycles (1 cycle = 1 wk DSS followed by 2-wk water). Another 50 mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups for a 21-wk "treatment" study where the mice in groups 1, 2, and 3 were administered DSS for 6 cycles (18 wks) to induce colitis. GSH and CoQ10 were added from wk 7 until the completion of the protocol. Loose stools and hemocult positivity were modestly but significantly reduced with GSH or CoQ10 at several periods during the intervention in both the prevention and treatment studies. In contrast, histological evaluation revealed increases in colonic dysplasia and ulceration with GSH or CoQ10. Thus, in this mouse model, GSH and CoQ10 appear to have a beneficial effect on acute signs of IBD, but may have an adverse impact on the chronic pathophysiology of the disease. Further studies using additional animal models are required to determine whether GSH or CoQ10 provide a favorable or unfavorable benefit:risk ratio in the prevention or treatment of IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a rye, high-fibre diet (HFD) vs a wheat, low-fibre diet (LFD), meal frequency, nibbling (Nib, seven times a day) or ordinary (Ord, three times a day), and their combined effects on blood glucose, insulin, lipids, urinary C-peptide and ileal excretion of energy, cholesterol and bile acids in humans. DESIGN: LFD period with Nib or Ord meal frequency followed by an HFD diet with Nib or Ord meal frequency in randomized, crossover design. SETTING: Outpatients of ileostomy volunteers were called for an investigation in research word. SUBJECTS: A total of 10 subjects (two female subjects, age 34 and 51 y; eight males, mean age 54.4 y, range 43-65 y) participated in the experiment. All subjects were proctocolectomized for ulcerative colitis (mean 16.0 y, range 8-29 y before the study). INTERVENTION: In total, 10 ileostomy subjects started with LFD for 2 weeks, the first week on either Nib (five subjects) or Ord (five subjects) and the second week on the other meal frequencies, in a crossover design, followed by a wash-out week, and continued with HFD period for 2 weeks in the same meal frequency manner. All foods consumed in both Nib or Ord regimens were identical and a high-fibre rye bread was used in the HFD period and a low-fibre wheat bread in the LFD period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Day-profiles of blood glucose, insulin and lipids, blood lipids before and after dietary intervention, and excretion of steroids in the effluents and C-peptide in the urine. RESULTS: During the Nib regimen, plasma glucose and insulin peaks were lower at the end of the day with HFD compared with LFD. Urinary C-peptide excretion was significantly higher in the day-time on LFD compared with HFD (LFD-Ord vs HFD-Ord, P < 0.01; LFD-Nib vs HFD-Nib, P < 0.01). Plasma free-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids were significantly higher (P < 0.05) after LFD than after HFD with the Nib regimen. A higher excretion of energy (P < 0.05) and chenodeoxycholic acid (P < 0.05) were observed with HFD compared with LFD regardless of meal frequency. A higher daily excretion of cholic acid, total bile acids, cholesterol, net cholesterol and net sterols (P < 0.05) was observed on HFD compared with LFD with the Nib regimen. CONCLUSIONS: An HFD decreased insulin secretion measured as a decreased excretion of C-peptide in urine and as decreased plasma insulin peaks at the end of the day during a Nib regimen. The smoother glycaemic responses at the end of the day during a Nib regimen may be a consequence of a second meal phenomenon, possibly related to the nature of dietary fibre complex.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recent experience with surgery for enterocutaneous fistulae (ECF) at a specialist colorectal unit is reviewed to define factors relating to a successful surgical outcome. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: ECF cause significant morbidity and mortality and need experienced surgical management. Previous publications have concentrated on mortality resulting from fistulae, while factors affecting recurrence have not previously been a focus of analysis. METHODS: Records were reviewed of patients who had ECF surgery (1994-2001). Management strategy involved early drainage of sepsis and nutritional support prior to elective ECF repair, with selective defunctioning proximal stoma formation. RESULTS: A total of 205 patients were available (89 males, 43%; median age, 51 years; range, 16-86) years). ECF were related to Crohn's disease in 95, ulcerative colitis in 18, diverticular disease in 17, carcinoma in 25 (16 after radiotherapy), mesh ventral hernia repair in 21, and other causes in 29. Forty-one (20%) had undergone attempted fistula repair at other institutions. Initial management included CT-guided drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess in 23 patients, and total parenteral nutrition in 74 (36%). A total of 203 patients had definitive ECF repair. Forty-four had oversewing or wedge resection of the fistula, and 159 had resection and reanastomosis of the involved small bowel segment or ileocolic anastomosis. Ninety-day operative mortality was 3.5%. A total of 42 (20.5%) patients developed ECF recurrence within 3 months. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that recurrence was more likely after oversewing (36%) than resection (16%, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: A strategy of drainage of acute sepsis, maintenance of nutritional support prior to surgery, and selective use of PS allows for primary closure in 80% of complicated ECF. Resection should be performed when feasible.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The role of infliximab in treating pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) is not defined. The authors previously have described their experience with the open label use of infliximab in nine children with moderate to severe UC. The aim of this study was to describe the outcome of these patients after a minimum 2-year follow-up and to describe the responses of eight additional patients to this medication. METHODS: The authors reviewed all pediatric patients with UC who received infliximab at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from its first use until February 2003. Tolerance of the infusions and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: Follow-up information for a minimum of 2 years was reviewed for the nine initial patients. A total of 73 infliximab infusions were administered to these patients. Seven of nine (78%) patients were considered to be responders to the initial dose of infliximab. Two of these patients became nonresponders within 9 months of the first dose of infliximab and underwent colectomy. Of the remaining five (56%) patients with sustained response, two continue to receive infliximab infusions and three are doing well without infliximab. One patient experienced an infusion reaction, and one experienced herpes zoster infection. We have treated eight additional UC patients with infliximab. Seven (88%) patients were considered responders. One responder experienced relapse within 2 months. Overall, a short-term improvement was seen in 14 of 17 (82%) patients, and sustained improvement in 10 of 16 (63%) patients followed up for more than 9 months. All five patients with severe or fulminant UC, unresponsive to 2 weeks of intravenous corticosteroid therapy, experienced improvement with infliximab. Infliximab was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Infliximab is associated with short- and long-term clinical improvement in children and adolescents with moderate to severe UC.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Pediatric studies on immunogenicity of infliximab have not been published. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of human antichimeric antibody (HACA), relationship to infusion reactions (IR), and the role of concomitant immunomodulatory therapies. METHODS: An inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) database was queried, and a retrospective review of patients who had HACA performed was undertaken. RESULTS: HACA was conclusively determined in 34 patients with IBD (14 male, Crohn disease/ulcerative colitis: 30/4), median age 14.8 years (range, 6.4-22.5 years). Twenty-nine (85.3%) patients were receiving immunomodulatory therapy. A total of 234 infliximab infusions were administered (mean, 6.9; range, 1-26). HACA was detected in 12 (35.3%) patients. IR occurred in 8 (23.5%) patients. HACA-positive patients had a higher proportion of infusions associated with IR than did HACA-negative patients (P < 0.01). HACA levels > or =8.0 microg/mL were more likely to be associated with IR (P = 0.03). Levels of > or = 8.0 microg/mL were more common in patients who had an average interval between infliximab infusions of 8 weeks or less (P = 0.04). Concomitant immunomodulatory therapy was associated with a lower risk of developing HACA (P = 0.02) and lower titer of HACA (P = 0.04). Patients did not have HACA at a greater rate when there was an extended interval (more than 12 weeks) between infliximab infusions (P = 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: In children and adolescents with IBD, HACA formation is related to IR and to the duration of response to treatment. Immunomodulatory agents seem to have a protective role against development of HACA or high titers of antibodies. The interval between infusions does not influence the development of HACA.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Thromboembolism is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a risk factor for vascular disease and has been implicated as a mediator of thromboembolic events in adults with IBD. The authors studied the link between tHcy and IBD in children, in whom associations may be clearer, and investigated associations with plasma von Willebrand factor antigen, a marker of vascular damage. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 43 patients with IBD (27 Crohn disease, 9 ulcerative colitis, and 7 indeterminate colitis) and 46 control subjects from a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Plasma tHcy, plasma 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate, red cell folate, plasma vitamin B12, plasma von Willebrand factor antigen, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype (for the C677T mutation) were measured. RESULTS: Plasma tHcy concentrations were higher in children with IBD than in control subjects, when corrected for age (P < 0.05), and plasma tHcy was negatively correlated with plasma 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate (P < 0.0005). Plasma 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate and age were the main predictors of plasma tHcy. Neither MTHFR genotype nor von Willebrand factor showed any association with any other measure, and there were no differences between children with IBD and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma tHcy is a consequence of IBD in children, probably mediated by poor folate status associated with diet or the pathophysiology of the disease.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease result from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Only one gene, NOD2/CARD15, has been clearly identified; a minority of people with alteration of this gene develop Crohn's disease. The NOD2/CARD15 protein is thought to be involved in defence against intracellular bacteria. This supports the idea that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis result from altered immunological responses to the normal intestinal flora. Life expectancy is normal in ulcerative colitis and nearly so in Crohn's disease, but both conditions cause considerable morbidity. Approximately 80% of patients with Crohn's disease eventually require surgery, and about 25% of patients with ulcerative colitis require colectomy. Treatment of ulcerative colitis is generally by corticosteroids for acute disease and mesalazine for maintenance, but the range of therapies for Crohn's disease is expanding. Alternative therapies include immunosuppressives, enteral nutrition, antibiotics, anti-TNF antibody (infliximab), corticosteroids, and surgery. High dosages of corticosteroids may provide symptomatic relief in Crohn's disease but do not affect the long term natural history of the disease, and management strategies should avoid using steroids whenever possible.},

   abstract = {There is considerable loss of DM during wet heat treatment of vegetables, leading to an increase in dietary fibre. Correction for the loss of DM indicates that the effects on total dietary fibre are minor. There is, however, depolymerization of the dietary fibre polysaccharides. The degradation is related to the severity of the heat treatment. Souring, freezing and mild microwave treatment have no effects. The viscosity is in general related to the extent of polymerisation. Microwave treatment has different effects on various cultivars of green beans, and the addition of salt (NaCl and CaCl2) to the boiling water changes the physico-chemical properties of soluble fibre in carrots, depending on the cation. The higher viscosity of the soluble fibre in raw carrots may partly explain the lower glucose and hormonal responses observed in healthy subjects when compared with blanched and microwave-cooked carrots. In studies on rats the amount of butyric acid in the distal colon has been shown to be higher with dietary components containing high amounts of resistant starch. Further, the fermentability is lower and the butyric acid concentration higher with composite foods than with the corresponding purified fibre fractions. In human studies the faecal concentration of butyric acid has been shown to increase in patients with ulcerative colitis when [beta-glucan-enriched oat bran (20 g fibre) is added to the diet for 12 weeks. Also, an improvement of symptoms was reported.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the most frequent inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with a prevalence of approximately one out of 500. Cytokine research opened new and potent treatment options and thus stimulated clinical and basic research.However, the IBD still remain a challenge for patients and physicians,demanding close cooperation between gastroenterologists,radiologists and surgeons. The basic understanding of IBD,which is necessary for efficient diagnostic and therapeutic concepts is reviewed. METHODS: Based upon recent publications and our clinical experience we discuss aspects of etiology,pathogenesis,diagnostics,and therapy of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. RESULTS: A genetically influenced, exaggerated and sustained immune response against the own gut flora seems to be one of the most important factors in the pathogenesis of IBD. Not less important are environmental influences. For instance, cigarette smoking had been judged to have some negative influence on the natural course of Crohn's disease.Now,however, recent studies show that smoking is even a significant independent risk factor in the pathogenesis of IBD. Since IBD and especially Crohn's disease can effect the whole body, detailed analysis of inflammatory organ involvement is necessary before therapy. For instance, the MRI enteroclysis technique adds a necessary diagnostic tool for the exploration of those parts of the small bowel that cannot been reached by routine endoscopy like the upper ileum and the lower jejunum. In terms of therapy, a change of paradigms can be observed: patients will no longer be treated only when symptoms arise, but will early be integrated into a therapeutic concept, which is determined by site and extent of the disease and adapted to the abilities and needs of the patient.Furthermore,immunosuppressive agents like azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine will establish as central concept in the medical treatment of IBD. DISCUSSION: IBD-therapy should rather be adapted to the patient's individual inflammatory pattern than be oriented to schematic treatment rules. New endoscopic and radiologic techniques provide the necessary diagnostic tools.},

Ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease are chronic with remissions and recidives. Crohns disease involves any part of digestive tube. Histological changes in ulcerative colitis are: inflammation of mucosa and submucosal tissue, crypt abscesses and ulcerations, pseudopolpys, bowel shortening and toxic megacolon in severe inflammation. In Crohns disease, transmural inflammation, "jumping lesions", deeper ulcerations, coble-stone mucosa, progressive fibrosis, granuloma with gigantic epithelial cells. TREATMENT: ulcerative colitis: mesalazine, rectal 5-ASA and hydrocortisone enemas, surgery. Crohns disease: mesalazine and prednisolone. For terminal ilcitis, corticosteroid budesonid could be applied. Severe symptomatic disease: hospitalization, parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, prednisone, surgery in partial bowel obstruction, fistulas, abscessus, perforation.},

The question has been raised whether IC can be assigned to a diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis through the characterization of immunogenetic similarities, or whether IC may represent a distinct subgroup within these heterogeneous disorders. In this article, the use of serologic markers, genetics, and immune responses to understand the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and define clinically important subgroups of patients will be discussed. Then, how these scientific advances have been applied to the entity of IC will be reviewed. Importantly, a recent prospective study suggests that the absence of IBD-associated serologic markers defines the majority of IC as a separate entity within the spectrum of IBD. The development of serologic, genetic, and immune response markers will allow for rational description of clinically important subgroups, redefine natural history, and predict responses to therapy in IBD.},

A few studies have reported rectal sparing in UC and suggested that this might indicate a more severe form of the disease. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and prognostic significance of rectal sparing in children with newly diagnosed, untreated UC. METHODS: The records of all children with untreated UC presenting to a regional pediatric gastroenterology service between January 1996 and December 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups according to the endoscopic appearance of the rectum: Group 1 (proctitis) and Group 2 (rectal sparing). Clinical features, intractability index (duration of active disease as a proportion of length of follow-up), response to treatment, relapse index (number of recurrences per year), and the need for surgery were compared. RESULTS: Thirty children with untreated UC were identified. Seven (23%) had rectal sparing at initial endoscopy, but disease distribution was otherwise similar in both groups. Presenting symptoms were similar in those with and without rectal sparing. In Group 1, 20 (87%) children achieved remission with initial medical treatment, compared with 3 (43%) in Group 2 (P < 0.05). The intractability index was higher in children with rectal sparing, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.22). During a median follow-up period of 2 years, one (4%) child in Group 1 and two (29%) children in Group 2 experienced primary sclerosing cholangitis, and two (29%) children with rectal sparing required colectomy, compared with none in Group 1. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic rectal sparing was seen in 23% of children with newly diagnosed, untreated UC, but this feature did not correlate with presenting symptoms. However, the presence of rectal sparing may indicate more aggressive disease that is less responsive to medical treatment.},

Symptoms of proctitis include rectal bleeding, urgency, tenesmus, diarrhea or constipation, and occasionally rectal pain. The causes of proctitis include infection, medication, ischemia, radiation, and ulcerative proctitis. Ulcerative proctitis is an important and increasingly common subcategory of ulcerative colitis (UC) in which inflammation is limited to the rectum. Historically, oral aminosalicylates have been the mainstay of acute and maintenance therapy. A growing body of data, however, indicates that topical aminosalicylates are effective first line agents in ulcerative proctitis and distal UC. Topical aminosalicylates act more effectively and rapidly to induce and maintain remission compared with their oral counterparts or topical steroids. Rarely ulcerative proctitis is refractory to topical therapy and in these instances systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, immunomodulators, or surgery is required. This review highlights the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of ulcerative proctitis.},

The aim of the present study was to further investigate the mechanisms involved in the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of dietary fiber in an experimental model of rat colitis. METHODS: HLA-B27 transgenic rats (8-10 weeks old) were fed a fiber-supplemented diet (5% Plantago ovata seeds) for 13 weeks before evaluation of the colonic inflammatory status, both histologically and biochemically. The luminal colonic production of SCFA was quantified. In vitro studies were also performed to test the interaction between two SCFA (butyrate and propionate) as inhibitors of cytokine production in THP-1 cells. RESULTS: Dietary fiber supplementation ameliorated the development of colonic inflammation in transgenic rats as evidenced by an improvement of intestinal cytoarchitecture. This effect was associated with a decrease in some of the pro-inflammatory mediators involved in the inflammatory process: nitric oxide, leukotriene B(4), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). The intestinal contents from fiber-treated colitic rats showed a significant higher production of SCFA, butyrate and propionate, than non-treated colitic animals. In vitro studies revealed a synergistic inhibitory effect of butyrate and propionate on TNFalpha production.

This effects was associated with an increased production of SCFA, which can act synergistically in inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The causes for the increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with ulcerative colitis have not been fully defined. Colonic tissue of ulcerative colitis patients was examined for changes in chromosome-17-centromere copy number, loss of the p53 gene, and alterations in serum levels of the 53-kDa protein. This study was performed under the assumption that these molecular events correlate with ulcerative colitis status and duration. METHODS: Ulcerative colitis patients (n = 42) and healthy controls (n = 37) participated in the study. All participants were histopathologically and medically diagnosed. The stage of ulcerative colitis patients was stratified according to increasing risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer: left-sided colitis, pancolitis, sclerosing cholangitis, and dysplasia-associated lesions or masses. Changes in centromere number of chromosome 17 alone or in association with changes in copy number of the p53 gene were analyzed in colon tissue biopsies by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Serum p53 level was determined in blood samples by immunoprecipitation followed by separation using high-pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Changes in chromosome 17 and p53 copy number and lower levels of serum p53 protein in ulcerative colitis patients directly correlated with colorectal cancer risk factors. All values significantly differed from controls. Significant direct correlations were obtained for ulcerative colitis disease duration, levels of p53 in the serum, and extent of aneuploidy. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that in the colonic mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients, high levels of genomic instability, changes in p53 gene copy number, and lower levels of p53 in the serum directly correlate with the extent of disease duration and increased risk factors for colorectal cancer. Any of the measurements described herein can provide an acceptable prognostic tool in the assessment of colorectal cancer risk in ulcerative colitis patients.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The authors report their experience with infliximab in pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Fourteen patients were reviewed. Group 1 included five patients with newly diagnosed, fulminant colitis refractory to 7 to 10 days of intravenous steroids. Group 2 included four patients with ulcerative colitis in remission off steroid therapy who experienced relapse and were hospitalized with fulminant colitis refractory to intravenous steroids for 7 to 10 days. Group 3 included five patients chronically dependent on steroids with colitis refractory to medical management. All patients were treated on an open-label basis with infliximab infusions of 5 mg/kg/dose at 0, 2, and 6 weeks and every 6 to 8 weeks thereafter. Follow-up was maintained for at least 6 weeks. Clinical status was scored with the Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index (LCAI) at each visit. LCAI >or=10 was considered treatment failure. We defined success as LCAI <or=2, a score consistent with UC remission. Response was categorized for each group. RESULTS: All patients began the study with LCAI >or=11 before infliximab treatment. All group 1 patients experienced response to infliximab. All but one (75%) patient in group 2 had a response. Only one (20%) group 3 patient had a response to infliximab. CONCLUSION: Infliximab was an effective agent in the treatment of acute UC in our patients. Long-term steroid use and emergency colectomy were avoided. Infliximab was less effective in patients who were dependent on steroids.},

AIMS: To prospectively document the presenting features, delay in presentation, disease localisation, and growth in newly diagnosed cases of IBD. METHODS: For 13 months, between June 1998 and June 1999, 3247 paediatricians, adult gastroenterologists, and surgeons across the UK and Ireland were prospectively surveyed each month and asked to report every newly diagnosed case of childhood IBD. RESULTS: A total of 739 new IBD cases aged less than 16 years were identified. Only one quarter of Crohn's disease (CD) cases presented with the "classic triad" of diarrhoea, weight loss, and abdominal pain; nearly half did not report diarrhoea. The median delay from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 5 months (mean 11 months), with one fifth having symptoms of more than one year. Delays were most common in CD and in younger children. Short stature was noted only in those with CD and not with ulcerative colitis. One fifth of CD cases had disease activity in the jejunum and this group had significantly reduced stature. Ileo-colonic involvement was documented in most CD cases, with only a small minority having isolated ileal or isolated colonic disease. Pan-colitis was reported in most UC cases, with very few having only an isolated proctitis. CONCLUSIONS: Many children are diagnosed after prolonged delays and have growth failure. Improved knowledge of the presenting features of IBD, and earlier investigation of suspected cases, may help reduce the delays noted.},

The etiology, prevalence, and inflammatory process of CGD colitis are unclear. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the inflammatory process of CGD colitis and to compare it with other inflammatory bowel disorders. METHODS: Colonic mucosal biopsies from 8 CGD patients were immunostained for eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and adhesion molecules (ICAM; VCAM, E-selectin) and compared with normal and diseased controls (allergic colitis, ulcerative colitis, and melanosis coli). Cell types were counted and expressed as cell/mm2. RESULTS: The inflammatory infiltrate in CGD colitis differed from the normal controls by an increase in eosinophils (110; 48-176 [median and range] versus 14.5; 3-30; P < 0.005) and macrophages (291.5; 203-480 versus 38.5; 27-64; P < 0.005). There was a paucity of neutrophils compared to ulcerative colitis (10; 0-101 versus 315.5; 78-688; P < 0.005). Expression of HLA-DR was increased in the epithelium and vascular endothelium in CGD compared with normal controls. Patterns of expression of the adhesion molecules differed significantly in CGD from those in other inflammatory bowel diseases: intracellular adhesion molecule-1 was more strongly expressed in the lamina propria, vascular adhesion molecule-1 was more patchily expressed, and E-selectin was present only in the small vessels. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of inflammation and profile of inflammatory mediators in CGD colitis differs from that in other inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {Germ-free (GF) interleukin 10-deficient (IL-10) mice develop chronic colitis after colonization by normal enteric bacteria. Muc2 is the major structural component of the protective colonic mucus. Our aim was to determine whether primary or induced aberrations in Muc2 synthesis occur in GF IL-10 mice that develop colitis after bacterial colonization. GF IL-10 and wild-type mice were colonized with commensal bacteria for various intervals up to 6 weeks. Colitis was quantified by histologic score and IL-12 secretion. Muc2 synthesis, total level of Muc2, and Muc2 sulfation were measured quantitatively. GF IL-10 mice showed 10-fold lower Muc2 synthesis and Muc2 levels compared with GF wild-type mice, but Muc2 sulfation was not different. When bacteria were introduced, IL-10 mice developed colitis, whereas wild-type mice remained healthy. Muc2 synthesis was unchanged in wild-type mice, but IL-10 mice showed a peak increase in Muc2 synthesis 1 week after bacterial introduction, returning to baseline levels after 2 weeks. Total Muc2 levels decreased 2-fold in wild-type mice but remained at stable low levels in IL-10 mice. Upon introducing bacteria, Muc2 sulfation increased 2-fold in wild-type mice, whereas in IL-10 mice Muc2 sulfation decreased 10-fold. In conclusion, a primary defect in colonic Muc2 synthesis is present in IL-10 mice, whereas bacterial colonization and colitis in these mice led to reduced Muc2 sulfation. These quantitative and structural aberrations in Muc2 in IL-10 mice likely reduce the ability of their mucosa to cope with nonpathogenic commensal bacteria and may contribute to their susceptibility to develop colitis.},

   abstract = {The chronic inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis (UC) occurs commonly in the US and other Western countries, but its etiology is unknown. An association between UC and an elevated risk for colorectal cancer is well established. UC-associated colorectal carcinogenesis is probably driven by chronic inflammation, but the mechanism is unclear. The morphological development of UC-associated cancer differs from that of its sporadic counterpart. Similarly, detailed molecular analyses have indicated that whereas many of the genetic alterations observed in sporadic colon cancers also occur in UC-associated neoplasms, the timing and frequency of those changes in the setting of UC are different. These histological and molecular signatures may very well be reflective of an inflammation-driven carcinogenesis process in UC patients. Studies in animal models of UC have helped to shed light on the mechanisms of inflammation-driven colorectal carcinogenesis. The available evidence suggests that DNA damage caused by oxidative stress in the characteristic damage-regeneration cycle is a major contributor to colorectal cancer development in UC patients. Based on this concept, iron over-nutrition is proposed as a risk factor and dietary antioxidants as protective factors for UC and associated carcinogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The quantity and quality of mucins are affected in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) both because of a reduction in the number of goblet cells and a decrease in the number of sugar residues per oligosaccharide side chain. Alteration in the types of mucins and aberrant location may contribute to the underlying pathology by affecting the mucus barrier function or may instead be a response to inflammation. The authors used the periodic acid-Schiff/Alcian blue stain to distinguish neutral and acidic mucins, and used specific antibodies to the mature goblet cell mucin MUC2, MUC2 core antigen, foveolar cell mucin MUC5AC, and gastric trefoil factor (TFF1), to characterize their presence and distribution in colonic tissue sections from patients with IBD. RESULTS: Both core and mature MUC2 were expressed in all colonic goblet cells from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease and from healthy controls. MUC5AC and TFF1, which are not normally expressed by colonic tissue, also were expressed in scattered goblet cells, coexpressing with MUC2. In areas of goblet cell depletion, MUC2 was present in cytoplasmic granules of flattened, cuboidal, nongoblet-cell-like surface cells. The staining was more intense and homogenous with the MUC2 core antibody, suggesting expression of relatively immature mucin. Some of these cells also coexpressed MUC5AC but to a lesser extent. These findings are not unique to IBD but were also found in other types of intestinal inflammation. CONCLUSION: The study confirms earlier observations that MUC2 is the major colonic mucin in IBD. It appears in two forms: mature MUC2 in goblet cells and immature MUC2 especially in secretory granules of cells that are not phenotypically goblet cells. MUC5AC and TFF1 expression in goblet cells is common in IBD and other inflammatory conditions of the colon. These changes may represent a nonspecific repair function of the colon cells to compensate for damage to barrier function.},

However, the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs against UC has not been examined in children. Therefore, the authors investigated the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on fatty acid composition and leukotriene (LT) production in children with UC. METHODS: For 2 months the authors administered highly purified EPA ethyl ester (EPA-E) (1.8 g/d) to children with UC in remission. Colonic mucosal histology, fatty acid composition of erythrocyte membrane phospholipids, and LTB4 production by leukocytes and colonic mucosa were measured before and 2 months after the initiation of EPA-E treatment. RESULTS: No patients relapsed during the study period, and no significant differences were detected in laboratory findings obtained before and 2 months after the initiation of EPA-E ingestion. There were no significant differences in mucosal histologic scores before and 2 months after EPA-E treatment. The EPA levels in erythrocyte membranes 2 months after the initiation of EPA-E treatment were significantly higher than before treatment, but the other fatty acids showed no significant changes. LTB4 production by leukocytes and rectal mucosa after 2 months of EPA-E treatment was significantly lower than before treatment. CONCLUSION: EPA-E treatment increased the levels of EPA in erythrocytes and decreased LTB4 levels produced by leukocytes and colonic mucosa. To assess the concomitant clinical changes, we should examine the long-term effects of EPA-E ingestion on the maintenance of remission in children with UC.},

We examined differences in the severity of DSS-induced colitis as a function of the concentration of DSS administered and sought to establish a DSS-induced colitis model in young rats. METHODS: We administrated different concentrations of DSS solution (2%, 3%, and 4%) to 4-week-old weanling rats and compared their clinical findings, colonic histologic findings, mucosal leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production, and mucosal blood flow with control weanling rats and 8-week-old adult rats given 4% DSS for induced colitis. RESULTS: Clinical symptoms, such as diarrhea and rectal bleeding, histologic findings, and disturbance of mucosal microcirculation in weanling rats given 4% DSS were significantly more severe than those in adult rats given the same treatment. Three of 10 rats given 2% DSS had no bloody stool and 2 of 10 rats given 4% DSS died during the experimental periods. Clinical symptoms, hemoglobin levels, histologic damage scores, mucosal LTB4 production, and mucosal blood flow became more severely deranged as the concentration of DSS increased from 2% to 4%. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that we can adjust disease severity in UC model for young children by giving different concentrations of DSS to weanling rats.},

The Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis groups were compared according to demographic characteristics, diagnoses, procedures and hospital stay. In Crohn's disease, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, x-rays/barium enema, number of procedures and number of diagnoses were significantly associated with a hospital stay longer than 10 days. In ulcerative colitis, this association was found for parenteral nutrition, malnutrition, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging and number of procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease was confirmed as a disabling disorder requiring more frequent hospital treatment than ulcerative colitis. For the latter, parenteral nutrition and malnutrition were related to a longer hospital stay. The number of procedures, especially abdominal computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, was a major item for both pathologies.},

Perception of difficulties of life was assessed using a scale developed by the authors and others. Physical condition of patients was assessed according to their disease state, disease symptoms, and nutritional state. Additional related factors such as mental condition, demographic attributes, and psychosocial states were also investigated. Multiple regression analyses was used to assess the relationships among variables and showed that perception of difficulties of life and disease symptoms were the main explanatory factors for the self-evaluation of physical condition. Perception of difficulties of life was comprised of physical and mental conditions, the latter being further influenced by the patients' psychosocial state.},

   abstract = {Cutaneous manifestations are well-recognized complications of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The incidence of these manifestations varies widely but, at the time of diagnosis, the mean incidence is around 10%. During the course of the disease, a great variety of skin lesions may develop, many of which are secondary to granulomatous cutaneous disease, reactive skin eruptions, nutritional deficiency and other associated conditions. The disorders that are directly related to the inflammatory process of Crohn's disease include perianal and peristomal ulcers and fistulae, metastatic Crohn's disease and oral granulomatous lesions. Histologically, the features are similar to those found in the inflamed bowel. These lesions usually respond to treatment of the underlying intestinal disease. The most common forms of reactive skin eruption are erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum. Certain subsets of patients are more susceptible to the development of erythema nodosum; in a previous report from our group, erythema nodosum was seen mainly in females, and in patients with colonic involvement and/or arthritis. This manifestation tends to occur during the first 2 years of the clinical course of the disease and may recur in approximately one-half of cases. Infliximab is highly effective in healing refractory lesions of erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum. Manifestations that are secondary to nutritional deficiency or associated conditions include acrodermatitis enteropathica, psoriasis and autoimmune disorders. For most of the cutaneous manifestations, the primary therapeutic target remains the bowel. Early aggressive therapy can minimize severe complications and maintenance treatment may prevent some devastating consequences.},

   abstract = {Patients with Crohn's disease are at high risk for recurrent disease and often undergo multiple operations. Our aims were to evaluate surgical management and outcome of patients with Crohn's disease who develop short bowel syndrome (SBS) and to identify factors leading to this complication. We reviewed the records of 170 adult patients with SBS evaluated over a 20-year period. Thirty (18%) had Crohn's disease. SBS was defined as an intestinal remnant less than 180 cm with associated malabsorption. There were 20 women and 10 men ranging in age from 18 to 62 years. Eighteen (60%) presented initially with ileocolonic disease, seven (23%) with colonic disease, and five (17%) with small intestinal disease. The interval from initial diagnosis to development of SBS ranged from 2 to 32 years, with 21 patients (71%) having an interval greater than 15 years. The number of resections leading to SBS varied from 2 to 12 with 24 patients (80%) having four or fewer resections. Nineteen patients (63%) had an ostomy. Small intestinal remnant length was less than 60 cm in 10 patients, 60 to 120 cm in six patients, and greater than 120 cm in 14 patients. Only one patient underwent stricturoplasty before developing SBS. Five patients were initially diagnosed as having ulcerative colitis and underwent a pouch procedure, which was subsequently resected. Twenty patients (67%) required parenteral nutrition. Three patients have undergone reversed intestinal segment to slow intestinal transit. Two patients underwent intestinal transplantation. Two patients have died: one from parenteral nutrition-related liver failure and the other after intestinal transplantation. Crohn's disease remains a common cause of SBS. Aggressive resectional therapy, surgical complications, and errors in initial diagnosis contribute to development of SBS in these patients. Selected patients are candidates for surgical therapy for SBS.},

(2) Treatment with steroids, which can cause growth disturbances, should not be continued for long periods of time. (3) Pulsed steroid therapy, selective removal of blood cells, and intravenous infusion of cyclosporin should be included in the therapeutic option for severe and fluminant cases.},

   abstract = {In addition to being involved in nutrient uptake, the epithelial mucosa constitute the first line of defense against microbial pathogens. A direct consequence of this physiological function is a very complex network of immunological interactions that lead to a strong control of the mucosal immune balance. The dysfunction of immunological tolerance is likely to be a cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). HLA-G is a non-classical major histocompatibility complex (HLA) class I molecule, which is highly expressed by human cytotrophoblast cells. These cells play a role in immune tolerance by protecting trophoblasts from being killed by uterine NK cells. Because of the deregulation of immune system activity in IBD, as well as the immunoregulatory role of HLA-G, we have analyzed the expression of HLA-G in intestinal biopsies of patients with UC and CD. Our study shows that the differential expression of HLA-G provides a potential way to distinguish between UC and CD. Although the reason for this differential expression is unclear, it might involve a different mechanism of immune regulation. In addition, we demonstrate that in the lamina propria of the colon of patients with UC, IL-10 is strongly expressed. In conclusion, the presence of HLA-G on the surface of intestinal epithelial cell in patients with UC lends support to the notion that this molecule may serve as a regulator of mucosal immune responses to antigens of undefined origin. Thus, this different pattern of HLA-G expression may help to differentiate between the immunopathogenesis of CD and UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) seems to be rising. Incidence studies could provide more insight into geographical differences and thereby lead to the identification of etiological factors. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the incidence of pediatric IBD in the Netherlands from 1999 to 2001, using both an active physician case-reporting registry and a nationwide pathology database. METHODS: All pediatricians in the Netherlands were sent monthly identification cards to be returned if they had diagnosed a new case of IBD in a pediatric patient. Follow-up questionnaires were sent to physicians reporting new cases of IBD. The pathology database contains reports from all cytologic and histologic diagnoses made in the Netherlands. Two independent raters searched the database for new IBD cases. Cases identified from the pathology database were labeled as "probable IBD" and "possible IBD." Cases were cross-checked across databases on the basis of gender, date of birth, date of biopsy, and place of residence. Age-specific incidence rates were calculated for the Dutch population for the year 2000. RESULTS: Five hundred forty-six probable cases of IBD were identified; 217 cases were labeled as possible. The incidence rate was 5.2 new cases per 100000 children (<18 years) per year. An increase in incidence with age was observed. Only 24% of the cases were ascertained through the clinical registry. CONCLUSION: The incidence of IBD cases in the Netherlands is comparable with that reported in other European countries. Epidemiological studies using case reporting by physicians may be underestimates of true incidence rates.},

For that purpose, an in vitro model of the colon was inoculated with fresh feces of six healthy individuals and eight inflammatory bowel disease patients. Samples were taken from the model over time to analyze metabolites from both saccharolytic and proteolytic fermentation. Microbiotas from inflammatory bowel disease patients produced significantly more short-chain fatty acids and ammonia than microbiotas from healthy individuals. Furthermore, the branched-chain fatty acid production was 25% higher after inoculation with microbiotas from patients than after inoculation with microbiotas from healthy individuals. Phenolic compounds were produced by all microbiotas, with large interindividual variation. The production of (potentially toxic) metabolites may play a role in the onset or chronicity of inflammatory bowel disease, because they were produced in higher amounts by microbiotas from these patients than by microbiotas from healthy individuals.},

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies (ASCA) have remained the most widely studied markers, but immune reactivity against a new group of bacterial antigens such as I2, OmpC (outer membrane porin C), and flagellin, has been described in Crohn's disease. Several clinical avenues have been explored, such as the usefulness of serologic markers as screening tools for IBD and in accelerating a diagnosis in patients with indeterminate colitis. Another area of interest is disease stratification. Emerging data suggest there is a diversity of qualitative and quantitative responses to environmental antigens that differs among groups of IBD patients and may be associated with different clinical behaviors. As a result, it may be possible to tailor therapy on the basis of serologic responses. Prospective studies are needed before translating this concept into clinical practice. Clustering of IBD patients into more homogeneous subgroups based on antibody responses may help to unravel the pathophysiology of subsets of IBD.},

From these deficits, an increase in overall fracture risk of 1.1-1.3 should be expected. The observed excess fracture risk was limited compared to the general population in both Crohn's disease (RR=1.2, 95% CI: 0.9-1.6 for any fracture and 2.2, 95% CI: 1.2-4.0 for spine fractures) and ulcerative colitis (RR=1.1, 95% CI: 1-1.2 for any fracture, and 1.5, 95% CI: 0.9-2.5 for spine fractures). The observed excess fracture risk was close to that expected from the changes in BMD. Despite the limited excess fracture risk, a relatively large percentage of all fractures may be attributable to corticosteroid use among users of corticosteroids.},

It does not depend on the form of therapy that Crohn's disease is highly recurrent, whereas colitis ulcerosa is curable by proctocolectomy. For both forms of disease surgery is an important option. It has to be included early in the therapy concept and not as last choice. Quality of life in patients with Crohn's disease can be raised significantly by surgery. Meticulous selection of the patients are essential to the policy of surgery as well as a regular aftercare. Best profit for those patients are treatment with an interdisciplinary team, consisting of gastroenterologists, nutrition advisers, psychologists, surgeons and radiologists.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Young children are thought to be a unique subset of pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The authors' objective was to evaluate the differences in initial clinical presentation of young and older children with IBD and to determine whether a positive family history of IBD is associated with the age of presentation. METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of all patients with new diagnoses of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) who presented between July 1996 and July 1999. Initial evaluation included assessment of growth parameters and laboratory values (hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum albumin). Inquiry regarding a family history of IBD was made in every patient. RESULTS: There were 153 patients with new diagnoses (82 with CD and 71 with UC), with a mean age of 11.9 years (range, 16 months-18 years). The children with CD had a higher sedimentation rate and platelet count and a lower mean hemoglobin concentration and serum albumin at presentation than did children with UC. Body mass index (BMI) was significantly lower in patients with newly diagnosed CD than in those with UC. The only significant laboratory differences between patients younger than 11 years and those 11 years or older was a higher mean platelet count in patients with CD who were younger than 11 years. Of the younger patients with CD, 41.7% had a positive family history of IBD, which was significantly greater that that found in the older patients with CD. CONCLUSIONS: Except for higher platelet counts, a lower BMI, and a higher frequency of positive family history in young children with CD, there were no significant differences in the presentation of young children with IBD compared with older children.},

   abstract = {Left-sided diverticulosis coli is a common condition in western communities, with 30% to 50% of adults over the age of 60 being affected. It predominantly involves the sigmoid colon. The diverticula (pseudodiverticula) are pockets of mucosa bounded by muscularis mucosae and invested with a thin layer of submucosa, that are forced out through weak points in the muscularis propria, the tips ending in the colonic subserosa. The weak points in the muscle coat are the sites of entry of the nutrient vessels of the colonic mucosa. Diverticulosis is attributed to increased colonic intraluminal pressure while straining at stool in individuals who eat low-fiber diets. Muscular hypertrophy, shortening of the bowel, and thickened mucosal folds due to mucosal redundancy are characteristic of this condition. Complications of diverticulosis include bleeding, diverticulitis, peridiverticular abscess, perforation, stricture, and fistula formation. However, most individuals with diverticulosis are asymptomatic, without evidence of complications. Mucosal changes in the diverticula in uncomplicated diverticulosis include an increased lymphoid infiltrate, development of lymphoglandular complexes, mucin depletion, mild cryptitis, architectural distortion, Paneth cell metaplasia, and ulceration. The mucosa of the remainder of the sigmoid colon (ie, the nondiverticular mucosa) is usually normal, but in about 1% of cases it has features that are indistinguishable from ulcerative colitis or from Crohn's disease (segmental colitis associated with diverticular disease, SCAD). Such cases pose a difficult diagnostic challenge as patients with SCAD respond to medical or surgical therapy for diverticular disease, whereas those with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease will develop other manifestations of their disease in time and require different treatment. In SCAD, the mucosal changes are confined to the area of diverticulosis; therefore, histologic evaluation of the rectum (which is unaffected by diverticulosis) and more proximal bowel can be helpful in the differential diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Genetic factors have a definitive role in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). The mode of inheritance suggests a polygenic disease with the penetrance of the genetic factors being strongly influenced by environmental factors. Several studies have been reported associations between UC and the polymorphism of genes that are located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the short arm of chromosome 6. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes are candidates for a role in the pathogenesis of UC, because their products play a central role in the immune response. The MHC region contains numerous immune related genes, and it has now become clear that different alleles of the MHC genes are strongly linked. Association studies have suggested a role for HLA-DR alleles in disease susceptibility to UC. Thus, HLA-DRB1*0103, DRB1*1502 and DRB1*12 were found to be positively associated with UC. On the other hand, the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene encodes a proinflammatory cytokine that is found in increased concentrations in the mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The regulation of TNF expression is in part genetically determined because the polymorphisms -238, -308, -863, -857, and -1031 found in the promoter region are associated with increased TNF production. Recent data suggests that TNF polymorphism may be more important in determining susceptibility to UC and these TNF markers could predict response to infusion with chimeric anti-TNF antibody.},

Two polymorphisms in the promoter region of the TNF-alpha gene (-308 and -238) have been associated with the genetic susceptibility to develop ulcerative colitis in both Caucasian and Asian populations. The aim of this study was to determine the role of TNF-alpha gene polymorphisms and those from the HLA-DRB1 locus in the susceptibility to develop ulcerative colitis (UC). Eighty Mexican mestizo patients suffering from UC and 99 ethnically matched unrelated healthy controls were genotyped for two TNF-alpha polymorphisms located in the promoter region (positions -308, -238) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) as well as high resolution DNA typing for HLA-DRB1 alleles were performed. The frequency of individuals positive for allele 2 of the TNF(-308) polymorphism was significantly higher in UC patients than healthy controls (23.7% versus 3%, pC = 0.00002; OR = 10.1; CI 95% = 2.69-26.8). No statistically significant deviation from normality was found between TNF*A (-238) and UC Mexican patients. Clinical manifestations such as pancolitis, extraintestinal manifestations and colectomy were not associated with any of the TNF promoter region polymorphisms. However, HLA-DRB1*15 was found to be associated with pancolitis and HLA-DRB1*0103 with the need of proctocolectomy. In conclusion, this clinical differential pattern of association distinguished in two neighboring loci within the MHC region suggest an independent role of the TNF locus in the genetic susceptibility to develop UC.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology. Genetic factors implied on its onset and severity may include genes located within the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 alleles with the clinical disease patterns of UC in Mexican Mestizo patients. High-resolution HLA typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide (PCR)-SSO reverse dot blot and PCR-single-strand polymorphism in 67 patients with UC and 99 ethnically matched healthy controls. UC patients overall showed an increased frequency of HLA-DR1 as compared with healthy controls (17.1% versus 5%, [pC = 0.003, OR = 3.9]). Patients with extensive colitis showed increased frequencies of HLA-DR1 (pC = 1 x 10(-10), OR = 13.9), HLA-DRB1*0103 (pC = 1 x 10(-3), OR = 21.7), HLA-DRB1*0102 (pC = 0.007, OR = undetermined), and HLA-DR15 (pC = 1 x 10(-3), OR = 8.5) when compared with healthy controls. We also found a statistically increased frequency of HLA-DR15 in UC patients with extensive colitis compared with UC patients with only distal colitis (18.7% versus 1.8%, pC = 0.03; OR = 12.2). When patients who underwent proctocolectomy were compared with those who did not, an increased frequency of HLA-DRB1*0103 was observed (21.8% versus 4.9%; pC = 0.03; OR = 5.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-21.93). Also, patients with proctocolectomy showed increased frequencies of HLA-DR1 (pC = 1 x 10(-3), OR = 24.2) and HLA-DRB1*0103 (pC = 1 x 10(-3), OR = 50.6) when compared with healthy controls. We concluded that HLA-DR1 is associated with genetic susceptibility to UC in the Mexican Mestizo population. HLA-DR15 distinguishes a subgroup of patients with extensive colitis and the HLA-DRB1*0103 allele distinguishes a subgroup of severe form of disease that might require surgical management.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Serologic testing is increasingly being utilized to evaluate children with suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this paper was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a currently available panel involving four antibodies: deoxyribonuclease (DNase)-sensitive perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (DNase-sensitive pANCA), IgA and IgG antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (IgA and IgG ASCA), and antibody to Escherichia coli outer membrane porin (anti-OmpC). We also wished to determine whether antibody levels correlated with disease activity, and whether a specific antibody pattern correlated with location and outcome of disease in children. METHODS: We studied sera from 81 children with Crohn's disease (CD), 54 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 63 controls. Clinical data, disease activity, and disease diagnosis were gathered at the time of serum sampling, and charts were re-reviewed at time of the study to determine long-term outcome. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was utilized to determine titers of antibodies to ASCA, DNase-sensitive pANCA, and anti-OmpC; the presence of perinuclear staining for ANCA was confirmed by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: We identified ASCA antibodies in 44% of CD patients, 0% of UC patients, and 1 control patient. DNase-sensitive pANCA antibodies were found in 70% of patients with UC, 18% of CD patients (predominantly Crohn's colitis), and 3% of controls. Anti-OmpC as an isolated assay had low sensitivity for both CD (24%) and UC (11%), and displayed a 5% false-positive rate. However, anti-OmpC did identify a small number of IBD patients not detected by the other assays. If any one or more of the four antibodies was positive, the overall sensitivity of the four antibody panel was 65% for CD and 76% for UC, with a specificity of 94%. Patients who were ASCA-positive were more likely to have disease of the ileum or ileum and right colon than patients who were ASCA-negative (58%vs 18%, p < 0.001). Patients with ASCA-positive were also more likely to require ileocecal resection (36%vs 13%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A currently available commercial antibody panel has good sensitivity and excellent specificity for CD and UC. The ASCA antibodies, while highly specific for CD, identify predominantly the subset of children with disease of the ileum and ascending colon who may be at increased risk of surgery.},
