In the second patient, Crohn's disease was less severe and remission occurred without treatment. Prophylactic cesarean was required due to multiple perineal scars resulting from surgical treatment of Crohn-related fistulae. The main problems with pregnancy in patients with Crohn's disease are discussed.},

In this group study, results for 69 patients with Crohn's disease who underwent strictureplasty were analyzed by sending questionnaires to 13 institutions belonging to the Research Committee of Inflammatory Bowel Disease of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare. No mortality and anastomotic leakage were observed. Strictureplasties of both the Heineke-Mikulicz and Finney varieties were considered to be safe procedures, even though the sutures had to be applied at the slightly inflammed site. The median follow up was 37 months (range, 0-133 months), and 12 patients needed reoperation. The cumulative 3-year operation-free rate was 92.5% and the 5-year rate was 70.3%. The site of the lesion, the strictureplasty procedure, and previous history of small bowel resection did not significantly influence the operation-free intervals. The cumulative 5-year operation-free rate of the group treated with home elemental enteral nutrition (83.3%) was better than that of the non-treated group (65.3%). Strictureplasty was found to be a safe and effective surgical procedure for high-risk patients with Crohn's disease in whom an appropriate length of bowel should be saved.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Artificial nutrition prior to bowel resection has not been evaluated fully. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of preoperative artificial nutrition upon postoperative complications, length of resected bowel and relapses of Crohn disease. RESULTS: Between 1990 and 1994, 108 consecutive patients underwent bowel resection for Crohn disease. Thirty nine patients had received exclusive enteral nutrition (n = 14) or parenteral nutrition (n = 25) for 19 +/- 10 days. Patients who had received artificial nutrition were more malnourished and had complicated Crohn disease (fistulae, abscesses) more often than patients operated without artificial nutrition. After 19 days of artificial nutrition, the nutritional state of patients was not significantly improved. Postoperative complication rate was higher in patients operated after artificial nutrition (33 vs. 16%; P = 0.03). Using multivariate prognosis analysis, the extent of colic resection was significantly associated with postoperative complications (P = 0.0003). Length of resected bowel and relapse rates were similar in patients with or without preoperative nutrition. CONCLUSION: Artificial nutrition prior to bowel resection for Crohn's disease is indicated in patients with the most severe form of the disease. A preoperative nutrition of 19 days does not seem to reduce postoperative complications nor the length of resected bowel.},

Eighty-three patients residing in the Paris area were included in the study and they had all undergone continuous clinical monitoring throughout the first three years of the disease. During this period, the clinical activity of the disease was ranked monthly on a semi-qualitative scale ranging from 0 to 4. The dates of corticosteroid treatment and of resection surgery carried out during the first three years of the disease were also recorded. The mean clinical score varied significantly (P < 0.0001) for different months of the year, the three highest scores being recorded during the three months of Spring-time (April, May and June). The number of months of corticosteroid treatment differed significantly (P < 0.05) for the various seasons, the six highest values being reported during Spring and Summer months. The number of intestinal resections differed significantly (p < 0.05) during different seasons, the highest incidence again being reported during Spring. This study demonstrates seasonal variations in the clinical course of Crohn' disease in the Paris area, with a peak occurring in the Spring.},

However the effect of treatment on these lymphokines has not been studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a reverse haemolytic plaque assay the percentage of lymphokine-secreting cells was determined in the intestinal mucosa of children with Crohn's disease before and after 8 weeks of treatment with either enteral nutrition, cyclosporin or steroids. RESULTS: Before treatment, a high percentage of cells isolated from mucosal biopsies secreted IL-2 or interferon-gamma. Eight weeks' treatment with the immunosuppressive agents cyclosporin, or with corticosteroids, produced a significant reduction in the percentage of IL-2 secreting cells, although only for the former was there also a reduction in interferon-gamma secreting cells. Enteral nutrition however, produced a reduction in lymphokine-secreting cells equivalent to cyclosporin and produced the best histological and clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Enteral nutrition and cyclosporin can down-regulate lymphokine secretion in the gut in Crohn's disease.},

The aim of our study was to compare serum IL-6 and IL-2R levels to see if one marker better distinguished IBD from other intestinal disorders or better reflected disease activity. Blood samples were obtained from 41 pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, 22 with ulcerative colitis, 19 with other gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders, and 13 with functional abdominal pain. Disease activity and disease location were determined for patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Serum levels of IL-6 and IL-2R were determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mean serum levels of IL-6 were significantly elevated (p < 0.05) in patients with Crohn's disease when compared with individuals with ulcerative colitis, other gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders, or functional abdominal pain. By comparison, there was no significant difference in mean serum levels of IL-2R in individuals with Crohn's disease compared with these other groups. Patients with moderate/severe Crohn's disease had elevated mean serum levels of IL-6 and IL-2R when compared with those with mild and inactive disease (p < 0.05); however, neither marker distinguished between inactive and mild disease. IL-6 correlated better with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; r = 0.57, p < 0.001) than did IL-2R (r = 0.28, p < 0.01). Our results suggest that elevated IL-6 levels a.e more likely to be seen in patients with Crohn's disease. Although IL-6 may be a better marker for Crohn's disease and active disease than IL-2R, it does not appear to offer any advantage over the ESR.},

Host defense mechanisms that mediate enteric colonization include gastric acidity and intestinal motility. The small bowell overgrowth syndrome is a condition characterized by large numbers of bacteria, often anaerobes, in the upper intestine. Steatorrea, carbohydrate malabsorption and abdominal pain are frequently present. Predisposing conditions are localized anatomic disorders (surgical blind loops, small bowel strictures caused by surgery or Crohn's disease, short-gut syndrome without ileocaecal valve), motility derangements or reduction of gastric acidity. Diagnosis of the overgrowth syndrome is often difficult and quantitative cultures of jejunal-aspirated fluid is the best diagnostic test. Antimicrobial therapy directed against anaerobes is often successful, but the best therapeutic approach is the correction of predisposing conditions, if present.},

The effect of pregnancy on Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis after pregnancy has been investigated here. During the survey period, 29 pregnancies occurred in 18 Crohn's patients, and 25 in 19 ulcerative colitis patients. Incidence of relapses during pregnancy and post-partum was 14 and 17% in Crohn's, and 36 and 12% in ulcerative colitis. Fourteen Crohn's patients (17 pregnancies) and 17 ulcerative colitis patients (19 pregnancies) were followed for 3 years before pregnancy and for 4 years after delivery. During the 3 years after pregnancy, the number of relapses/year was significantly lower compared to the 3 years before pregnancy and to the incidence in controls, both in Crohn's (p < 0.05) and ulcerative colitis (p < 0.005). Changes in nutritional status were recorded in 41% of Crohn's, but in none of the ulcerative colitis patients. The reduced incidence of relapses following delivery in Crohn's patients was more marked in the 10 with normal nutritional status at the time of conception (70% reduction in number of relapses, p < 0.05), while in the 7 significantly underweight patients, the reduction was slight (27% reduction in number of relapses, p = NS). In conclusion, the incidence of relapses in the first 3 years after pregnancy is lower than in the pre-pregnancy period. In Crohn's disease, the effect is more evident in patients with normal nutritional status at the time of conception than in malnourished patients.},

   abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: Fish oil, rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, can alter leukotriene production and hence neutrophil function, factors which may be important in the inflammation of Crohn's disease (CD). Therefore we studied the effect of dietary PUFA on neutrophil mediated ileal inflammation and neutrophil function in the rat. METHODS: Animals were ad libitum-fed pellet diets containing 9.5% fish oil (menhaden oil, rich in n-3 PUFA) with 0.5% safflower oil, 10% safflower oil (rich in n-6 PUFA) or standard chow (6% fat) for 50 days prior to the study. Weight and circulating leukocyte and total neutrophil counts were identical in all three groups. Neutrophil mediated ileal inflammation induced by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) perfusion was evaluated by measuring macromolecular uptake of radiolabelled dextran (MW 70,000) and changes in mucosal neutrophil infiltration. RESULTS: The fish oil diet group showed no difference in fMLP-induced permeability changes relative to the Chow Control group. However, the Safflower Oil supplemented diet group had a reduced permeability response (p < 0.01). Mirroring the permeability changes, there was diminished mucosal neutrophil infiltration in the Safflower Oil group following ileal perfusion with fMLP (< .005). Chemotaxis and chemiluminescence, two important neutrophil functions, were also significantly suppressed in the Safflower Oil animals (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The failure of a n-3 PUFA enriched diet to diminish the ileal inflammatory response to a bacterial peptide and suppress neutrophil function in the rat suggests such therapy would not be expected to be highly successful in CD. However, it requires confirmation in man, especially under the more complicated inflammatory conditions found in CD. On the other hand, the decreased neutrophil mediated responses with a high linoleic acid (n-6 PUFA) diet warrant further investigation.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Perineal involvement in Crohn's disease is a common and distressing condition, often refractory to medical or surgical treatments. Recent reports suggest the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) in the healing of perineal lesions. We evaluated HBO in severe patients with perineal Crohn's disease. METHODS: Ten consecutive patients (8 women, 2 men; mean age, 30 years) were studied. There were four superficial fissures, four cavitating ulcers, six low or superficial fistulas, two high fistulas, and one irreversible anal stenosis. All patients had received one or more medical treatments without healing the perineal lesions, and all had had previous surgery for perineal lesions. RESULTS: Two patients discontinued HBO after a few sessions and did not complete treatment. Eight patients completed at least 30 HBO sessions and were evaluable. At the end of the procedure, six of eight patients treated were healed, three completely and three partially. All patients who healed completely received HBO as an additional treatment to local perineal surgery. CONCLUSION: HBO might be useful as a last resort treatment of chronic perineal Crohn's disease, resistant to other treatments or as a complement to surgery.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Inflammatory bowel diseases have an important impact on the daily life of patients. This impact can be measured by the evaluation of the health related quality of life. The aim of this study was to develop and to validate a questionnaire of quality of life in a French population. METHODS: The questionnaire comprised 70 items and was completed in 15 min. It was made up of a) a general questionnaire of 36 items (SF-36) exploring daily physical and social functioning, mental and general health, body pain and vitality. A sleep module of 6 items was added. b) a specific questionnaire of 28 items (RFIPC), exploring the concerns of the patients. The questionnaire was self-administered to 101 patients with Crohn's disease (57 F. 44 M. mean age: 35 years, acute disease: 28%, inpatients: 27%), 96 patients with ulcerative colitis (38 F. 58 M. mean age: 39 years, acute disease: 53%, inpatients: 21%). Each patient was sex and age matched with a healthy control. RESULTS: The psychometric analysis confirmed the validation of the questionnaire for the item's convergent validity, internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient being > 0.70), analyses of discrimination. Scores of each scale of SF-36 were worse in patients than in controls. Scores of patients with active disease were worse than those of patients with quiescent disease. Scores were comparable in patients with Crohn's disease and with ulcerative colitis except for score of pain which was worse in acute Crohn's disease. The most important concerns of patients were the uncertain nature of the disease, energy level and having surgery. CONCLUSION: This study allowed the validation of a questionnaire for the evaluation of the quality of life in French patients with inflammatory bowel disease and provides first indications which need to be confirmed by future epidemiological studies.},

The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of smoking on the long-term course of Crohn's disease and the relationship between smoking and therapy. METHODS: The medical charts of 400 consecutive patients whose smoking habits were specified by direct interview were reviewed. RESULTS: Frequency and extent of excisional surgery were not significantly different in smokers and nonsmokers, but smokers required more glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs. The effect of smoking on the need for immunosuppressive drugs was dose-dependent and was significant in women but not in men. For female smokers, the 10-year risk of immunosuppressive therapy was 52% +/- 11% compared with 24% +/- 10% for nonsmokers (P < 0.001). The risk of surgery increased only in patients who smoked and did not take immunosuppressive drugs. The surgical rate increased significantly during smoking in 19 patients who started smoking after diagnosis and decreased significantly in 34 patients who stopped compared with matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who smoke, particularly women and heavy smokers, run a high risk of developing severe disease. Immunosuppressive therapy neutralizes the influence of smoking on surgical rates.},

CASE REPORT: A 12-year-old girl suffered from recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea and growth impairment due to Crohn's disease of ileocaecal region. After six months of nutritional rehabilitation, an ileo-caecal resection was performed because of intestinal stenosis. The surgical procedure was followed by parietal abcess and cutaneous fistula. One year later, a purulent secretion came out of the fistula associated with fever, hematuria and acute renal failure. Renal biopsy confirmed IgA nephropathy. The course was favorable under parenteral nutrition and after surgical closure of the sigmoido-cutaneous fistula. The microscopic hematuria only persisted but the nephropathy did not relapse even during a further digestive exacerbation. CONCLUSION: IgA nephropathy has been reported in association with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Its mechanism remains unclear: increased mucosal IgA production in inflammatory bowel, increased serum IgA and/or immune complex deposition in the renal mesangium appear the most relevant hypotheses.},

   abstract = {: Mesalamine is an enteric-coated 5-aminosalicylic acid formulation effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, and in decreasing the relapse rate in Crohn's disease. However, little data are available regarding its use in children and adolescents. To determine the modalities of use, safety, and the optimal dose in this age group, charts of 153 pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with mesalamine were reviewed, representing >150 patient years of use. Among these, more than half of the children diagnosed with Crohn's disease (120 patients) had ileocolonic involvement, and pancolitis predominated in those with ulcerative colitis (33 patients). Patients with ulcerative colitis were diagnosed at a younger age than those with Crohn's disease, and thus mesalamine therapy was initiated earlier. When used as monotherapy, no difference was noted in the average dose used for the treatment of active disease versus maintenance therapy (36 mg/kg/day). However, the average dose used did increase since 1992, for both the treatment of active disease and relapse prevention (43 mg/kg/ day). Overall, 18 patients (11.8%) were withdrawn from mesalamine therapy; however only 8 (5.2%) had objective side effects. Exacerbation of diarrhea was the most common reason for withdrawal. Although reported rarely, no serious adverse reactions such as pancreatitis or hepatic or renal dysfunction were observed. This study suggests that mesalamine is a safe and well-tolerated medication in the long-term treatment of pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

Eleven patients were studied, of which six were women and five were men, during a hospital stay for an active episode of Crohn's disease. In three patients the small intestine was affected, in five the colon, and in the last three both the ileum and the colon were affected. Van Hees' activity index on admittance was 196 +/- 52 (132-265). The energy expenditure at rest (ECR) on admittance, was 11% higher than that found in the normal population (p: n.s.). The energy expenditure decreased weekly, in a statistically significant way, during hospitalization. No significant relationship was found between the Van Hees activity index and any of the parameters used to evaluate the energy needs. Those patients whose body weight was less than 90% of the ideal body weight, presented pathologically elevated energy needs when the energy expenditure was expressed in kcal/kg (p = 0.003). Fever was the only analyzed parameter which showed a significant correlation with the changes in energy expenditure: measured by the oxygen consumption index (p = 0.003) and by the percentage of REE (p = 0.006).},

Although our understanding of the mechanisms of the disease is incomplete, increasing knowledge of the pathogenesis of inflammation in general and Crohn's disease in particular allows targeting of therapies at various points in the immunoinflammatory cascade. In addition, the division of Crohn's disease into subtypes by location, aggressiveness, and the presence or absence of perianal and fistulizing disease allows the tailoring of medical therapy to the individual patient. For those patients with moderate to severe symptoms or frequent flares of disease activity, and those who have required surgical resection, maintenance therapy can substantially reduce the rate of recurrence. Despite these advances, available medical therapies for Crohn's disease remain imperfect, as evidenced by their sometimes substantial toxicities and the continued frequent need for surgery.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to evaluate, using meta-analysis techniques, whether enteral nutrition is effective in inducing clinical remission in active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Randomized trials either comparing enteral nutrition with steroids or comparing elemental (amino acid-based) with nonelemental diets were selected using MEDLINE (1984 to 1994), reference lists from published articles, reviews, and abstracts from major gastrointestinal meetings. Sixteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria (four published as abstracts). Crude rates for induction of remission were collected on an intention-to-treat basis by three independent observers. Each study was given a quality score, based on predetermined criteria. RESULTS: The pooled odds ratio (OR) for all type of enteral diets compared with steroid therapy was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.53). This result was similar for the best studies (by quality score) combined, for trials using tube feeding combined, and when noncompliant patients were withdrawn. Further subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of the type of diet administered. Peptide-based diets were significantly inferior to steroids (pooled OR, 0.32; CI, 0.20 to 0.52). There was a trend to lower remission rate after elemental diets than after steroids (pooled OR, 0.44; CI 0.17 to 1.12). On the other hand, pooled OR for whole protein-based diets compared with elemental diets was 1.28 (CI, 0.40 to 4.02). CONCLUSIONS: Data available to date show that steroids are better than enteral nutrition to induce remission in active Crohn's disease. These results are more evident when peptide-based diets are administered, but they are not conclusive when either elemental or whole protein-based diets are used.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: : Growth retardation is common in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The most sensitive measure of impaired growth, growth velocity, is abnormal in 65% of children with Crohn's disease. With treatment, growth velocity may return to normal, but catch-up growth is often incomplete and ultimate height lower than predicted. In some patients delayed puberty may compensate for poor growth earlier in life, and there is good evidence that even after menarche, significant growth can occur. Surgery may have a favorable impact on growth in the short term, but final height often remains reduced. The mechanism for growth failure in IBD is thought to be related to both prolonged periods of suboptimal nutritional intake and persistent inflammation. Growth throughout childhood is dependent on growth hormone and insulin-like growth factors (IGF). At puberty, androgens and estrogens also play a significant role in normal growth. Both malnutrition and inflammatory bowel disease result in low levels of IGF-1. With recovery, levels return to normal. Although little work has been done to measure the effects of chronic maintenance drug therapy on growth, it is known that children taking alternate-day prednisone grow normally and can exhibit catch-up growth. Nutritional therapy with tube feeding of elemental diets also improves nutrition and decreases inflammation. Children with either small-bowel Crohn's or Crohn's ileocolitis respond to tube feedings of both elemental or semielemental diets.},

   abstract = {Mortality and post-operative complications are elevated in Crohn's disease, for many reasons: pre-existing septic complications, malnutrition, impaired cell-mediated immunity, failure to identify enteric fistulas and/or abdominal abscess during surgical operation. From 1984 to 1996 in 383 patients with Crohn's disease we performed 426 surgical procedures, observing post-operative complications in 28 of these (6.5%). However, septic complications in the surgical field were only 7 (1.6%). A 83-year-old patient died after surgery because of heart failure. The risk of post-operative complications was significantly higher in patients with elevate Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI). We treated patients with malnutrition pre-operatively using parenteral nutrition (TPN). In 100 patients undergoing TPN we observed a significant PNI reduction (from 53.3 +/- 13 to 42.1 +/- 6.9) and a significative improvement of transport proteins correlated with nutritional status, such as pre-albumin (from 21.2 mg/dl +/- 9.8 to 26.5 mg/dl +/- 7.8) and retinol binding protein (from 3.8 mg/dl +/- 1.6 to 4.6 mg/dl +/- 1.7). During surgical operations we recorded fistulas caused by disease, observing 336 fistulas in 258 patients. The treatment of fistulas (by suture or less frequently by resection of the intestinal tract involved in the inflammatory process) prevented septic post-operative complications: indeed we did not observe enteric fistulas in any patient post-operatively. We conclude that the improvement of nutritional status and the adequate treatment of enteric fistulas prevents septic complications in nearly all patients.},

   abstract = {We investigated the effect of nutritional therapy with an elemental diet (ED) for active Crohn's disease. One hundred and thirty-nine patients with Crohn's disease were enrolled in this study. Remission was judged to be present when the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease score was < or = 1 and the CRP and ESR values were within the respective normal ranges. An amount of 30kcal per 1kg of ideal body weight (IBW) per day was administered enterally, and the effect on the induction of remission in relation to various patient background factors, such as disease type, history of bowel resection, and the presence/absence of complications, was determined. An excellent remission rate was achieved in those patients to whom an adequate amount of ED could be administered. Remission rates were lower in the patient groups with any of the following complications: stenotic bowel lesions, abdominal masses, fistulas, and anal lesions. Even in those groups in which stenotic lesions or abdominal masses were present, when adequate amounts of ED could be administered, the remission rate did not differ from that in the groups without these complications. The remission rates in the groups with and without fistulas at any site, including fistulas in the anal region, were 40.0% and 82.5%, respectively, with remission being considerably easier to achieve in the patients without fistulas. Similarly, remission was difficult to achieve when anal lesions were present. These results suggest that, for active Crohn's disease, nutritional therapy with ED ( > or = 35kcal/kg IBW) should be enthusiastically administered, and in patients in whom the presence of complications necessitates therapy for 3 months or more, this point be considered to indicate a possible surgical approach.},

We have included 7 patients (4 male and 3 female) with an acute episode of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Each received 1780 kcal/day (1500 non-protein kcal 66% as fats, and 33% as glucose), with a kcal/g of N ratio of 160 by means of the preparation technique of "all in one". The anthropometric parameters: initial and final weight (58.5 +/- 12 vs. 57.3 +/- 11); triceps skin fold (14.1 +/- 4 vs. 14.1 +/- 4), and mean circumference of the arm (25.1 +/- 3 vs. 25.0 +/- 3), did not give any significant differences during the treatment period. In the biochemical data there were no significant differences either, except for the final level of serum albumin (3.44 +/- 0.28), which was significantly higher than the initial value (3.11 +/- 0.38) (p < 0.05). The mean duration of the treatment was 12 days (range 6-18). There was no case of phlebitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {: Stricture formation in Crohn's disease is a complication of an important wound healing process in the intestine. The smooth muscle cells of the intestinal musculares bear a responsibility for the repair of injured intestine, and effect this wound healing process by proliferating and laying down collagen at the site of injury. Injury in the submucosa, and chronicity of injury, are important factors in the development of stricture. The resultant accumulation of collagenous scar, thickening of the muscle layers, and contracture, all play a role in producing the critical architectural changes in the intestinal wall that impede the aboral movement of chyme. Important putative facets of intestinal smooth muscle cell biology that are involved in stricture formation include: the synthesis and secretion of procollagen; the peculiar response of these cells to cytokines, ascorbate, and corticosteroids; and changes in cell phenotype that result from chronic inflammation. Therapeutic modalities designed to ameliorate the stricturing process will need to modulate these biological activities in resident intestinal smooth muscle cells.},

   abstract = {The main aims of therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease) in children and adolescents are (1) the induction and maintenance of remission, (2) the correction of nutrient deficits and (3) the restoration of growth and maturation. These goals are reached with the use of a combination of therapeutic methods, including pharmacologic agents, nutritional and psychological support, and surgical intervention. The commonly used drugs sulfasalazine, corticosteroids and metronidazole have all been shown to be safe and efficacious when given to children. Newer steroid preparations that are rapidly degraded either in the target tissue or elsewhere are being studied. Of these, budesonide currently shows promise as an efficacious drug with few side effects, but its use in children needs further study. Newer 5-amino-salicylate preparations such as Asacol have been shown to be effective in children, but the number of patients studied is small. Immunomodulatory drugs such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine appear to be safe and efficacious for children; cyclosporine has been used infrequently to treat refractory Crohn disease in children. The use of other agents such as methotrexate, tacrolimus, monoclonal antibodies to cytokines, antibiotics and specific dietary products such as fish oils have not been intensively studied in children with Crohn disease. Nutritional therapy remains a mainstay of treatment because it corrects nutritional deficits, replaces losses and stimulates growth.},

The aim of the study was to compare by meta-analysis the likelihood of clinical response to liquid diet therapy vs. corticosteroids and to assess the importance of formula composition to efficacy. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials comparing exclusive enteral nutrition with corticosteroids and elemental with nonelemental formulas were identified through a combination of computerized and hand-searching techniques. Rates of clinical remission of active Crohn's disease, based on the intention-to-treat principle, were extracted from the studies by two independent reviewers. Odds ratios for likelihood of clinical response were calculated. RESULTS: In eight trials comprising 413 patients, enteral nutrition was inferior to corticosteroids (pooled odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.53). In five trials comprising 134 patients, there was no difference in the efficacy of elemental versus nonelemental formulas (pooled odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-1.83). CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids are more effective than enteral nutrition in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. Limited sample size precludes definitive conclusions about the importance of formula composition in the efficacy of enteral nutrition; however, data analyzed in this study do not support an advantage to elemental feedings compared with a polymeric formulation.},

   abstract = {In view of a high recurrence rate of Crohn's disease after surgical resection prophylaxis is desirable. The value of various medical therapies to maintain remission after surgery has thus far only partially been established in clinical trials. Therefore, no clear guidelines are presently available. In patients with complete resection and a low risk of recurrence prophylactic treatment seems not to be necessary. In patients with a high risk of recurrence prophylactic treatment is recommended. This recommendation is supported by some clinical trials, although major trials are still ongoing. 5-Aminosalicylic acid in a daily dose of ca. 2-3 g is the primary choice for prophylaxis of recurrence. It reduces the risk of recurrence presumably by about 50%. In patients with a complicated course of the disease who have undergone several previous resections immunosuppressive treatment with azathioprine (1-2 mg/kg body weight/day) is recommended to avoid further recurrences. Conventional corticosteroids are not effective for postoperative prophylaxis. Ongoing studies evaluate the non-systemic steroid budesonide as prophylactic treatment. There is no specific nutritional therapy to prevent recurrences; however, patients are advised to avoid nutrients which they do not tolerate. When patients have a clinical relapse systemic or topical corticosteroids are the treatment of choice. In moderately active disease and in patients who refuse to take corticosteroids high dose 5-aminosalicylic acid (at least 4 g/day) may be used alternatively. In patients with chronic complicated disease azathioprine is recommended.},

Crohn's disease, chronic intractable diarrhea, chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and Hirschsprung's disease. During the period, two patients died; one of sepsis and the other from hepatic failure. Three of the remaining patients have since moved on to oral feeding, but four patients continued on HPN. The majority of these patients have attained a normal weight and height for age while receiving HPN. All patients were fed via an implanted silicone catheter. Catheters were removed and replaced due to complications including nine episodes of infection, four episodes of occlusion, three episodes of breakage and two episodes of dislodgement. Catheter-related sepsis was the most common cause of morbidity and hospital readmission in patients receiving HPN, but was acceptably rare. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently cultured organism from either the catheter tip or the blood. HPN is a relatively safe feeding method for patients who would otherwise remain hospitalized for prolonged periods on parenteral nutrition for permanent or prolonged intestinal failure.},

Chart review identified 555 subjects (318 Crohn's disease [CD], 237 ulcerative colitis [UC]). An alanine aminotransferase measurement of >/=80 U/L was used to identify the presence of a hepatic abnormality. Seventy-five patients (47 CD, 28 UC) had at least one ALT level >/=80 U/L. Persistent ALT elevation (>6 months) was found in 14 patients: 10 with sclerosing cholangitis (SC) (eight UC, two CD) and four with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (CAH) (one UC, three CD). One patient with SC has had hepatic transplantation, and one other has end-stage liver disease. The remainder are clinically well. Two patients with CAH have developed cirrhosis. Nonpersisting ALT elevations (<250 U/L) were noted during disease course in 61 patients and were associated with medications, parenteral nutrition, bowel obstruction, and flare-ups of disease. Most ALT elevations in children with IBD are transient and appear to relate to medications or disease activity. Sclerosing cholangitis was noted in 3.5% of UC patients and <1% of CD patients, while CAH was found in <1% of UC or CD patients. Unless evidence of chronic liver disease is present, the initial finding of mild to moderate ALT elevation (80-250 U/L) should prompt observation before extensive evaluation.},

The present study assessed the relationship of mucosal IL-1ra levels to histologic severity of inflammation and the related proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-6 in children with inflammatory bowel disease. Colonic biopsy specimens from 29 patients with ulcerative colitis, 27 with Crohn's disease, and 24 noninflammatory control subjects were assayed for IL-1ra, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Histologic activity was graded as none, mild, moderate, or severe. Mucosal IL-1 beta levels, but not IL-1ra levels, were significantly elevated in moderate/severely inflamed biopsies from patients with either ulcerative colitis (p < 0.01) or Crohn's disease (p < 0.001) compared with those with none/mild inflammation. The mucosal molar ratio of IL-1ra/IL-1 beta was significantly lower for moderate/severe inflammation compared with none/mild inflammation for patients with ulcerative colitis (p < 0.05) and Crohn's disease (p < 0.01). The mucosal IL-1ra/IL-1 beta ratio was similar in controls to none/mild inflamed biopsies from subjects with either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Our observations suggest that increasing mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease in children is associated with a decrease in the "normal" effective IL-1ra/IL-1 beta ratio in which IL-1ra predominates. The importance of this abnormality to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease awaits further study.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety of gastrostomy tube (G-tube) placement in children with Crohn's disease and the efficacy of prolonged enteral hyperalimentation in children with growth failure complicating Crohn's disease. METHODS: Twenty children with Crohn's disease and growth failure were offered enteral hyperalimentation via nasogastric tube (NG-tube) for treatment of growth arrest, with follow-up for complications, compliance, and response to nutritional support. The use of a G-tube was offered to children who refused to use the NG-tube. Medical and surgical management were provided as dictated by the disease activity. RESULTS: Thirteen children were started on NG-tube feeds, and five were started on G-tube feeds after refusal to use an NG-tube at the outset. Two children required surgery at the time of diagnosis and had a G-tube placed during the operation. Nine of 13 children found the use of an NG-tube too disruptive and were later changed to a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or surgically-placed G-tube. A total of 16 children had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (eight children) or a surgically-placed G-tube (eight children) for 6-29 months. Two of those children had endoscopic evidence of gastroduodenal Crohn's disease, and six had microscopic patchy chronic gastritis. Minor complications occurred in five of the 16, including external leakage, button dislodgement, local pain, and local wound infection. At this time, the G-tube has been removed from 13 children, 12 of whom had prompt and complete healing of the G-tube site and one of whom had a small gastrocutaneous fistula that required suture for successful closure. Poor compliance with G-tube feeds was observed in four of 16 children. During the period of nutritional support, there was resumption of normal growth rates for all; in addition, eight of 16 had catch-up growth. CONCLUSION: Nutritional therapy is important in the management of children with growth failure due to Crohn's disease, though it may not be the only factor affecting growth. G-tubes are safe and well tolerated by children with Crohn's disease and should be offered to those children who do not tolerate prolonged use of an NG-tube.},

   abstract = {Although many foods have been suggested to play a role in the cause of IBD, there are not yet definitive data to support diet as a cause of either CD or UC. Malnutrition is a common occurrence in IBD, and this must be considered in the treatment of these diseases. Nutritional support in IBD has limited use as primary therapy (Table 2). Even though parenteral and enteral nutrition have been associated with remission, relapse frequently occurs when normal food intake is resumed. Likewise, fistulae may resolve with aggressive, nutritional therapy, but they frequently recur with reinstitution of food. In short bowel syndrome caused by extensive intestinal resection performed in CD, parenteral nutrition provides an important mode of therapy. In addition, perioperative use of nutritional support may decrease the incidence of postoperative complications in patients who are malnourished. Nutritional support in pediatric patients with CD who have growth failure has been effective in stimulating growth.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effect of nasogastric feeding with high- and low-fat, peptide-based diets on body composition and disease activity was studied in adolescents with active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Fourteen patients with active Crohn's disease (12 to 17 years) were fed exclusively through nasogastric feedings with two isocaloric, isonitrogenous, peptide-based diets, either with low- or high-fat content, for 3 weeks each in a randomized manner then were "crossed over" to the other diet for another 3 weeks of feeding. At the end of each 3-week period, urine and stools were collected for 72 hours for measuring energy absorption and nitrogen utilization (n = 6). Weight, height, triceps skin folds, fat free body mass, and disease activity were also monitored (n = 14). RESULTS: There was no difference in any parameter of energy absorption or nitrogen utilization between the two formulas irrespective of the order in which they were administered. The changes in nutritional parameters were also comparable with both formulas. There was a significant increase in weight, fat free body mass and triceps skinfold thickness during both the 3-week periods of feeding (p < .05). This was accompanied by a significant reduction in the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Peptide-based diets may be useful in restoring the fat free body mass and improving the disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease. A high fat (high medium-chain triglycerides) diet did not offer any nutritional advantage over a similar but low-fat diet. The improvement in disease activity during feeding with a low-fat diet was comparable to that with a high-fat diet. The improvement in disease activity seems to be associated with improvement in lean body mass irrespective of the type of diet used to achieve it.},

   abstract = {Proinflammatory mediators, including leukotriene (LT) B4, are elevated in the intestinal mucosa in active chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). LTE4 is the major peptidoleukotriene metabolite and it is stable in urine. The aim of this study was to measure LTE4 levels in the urine of 27 children with Crohn's disease and 27 control subjects including 12 children with functional recurrent abdominal pain and 15 unaffected siblings of IBD patients. LTE4 levels were measured in urine using high-performance liquid chromatography separation and radioimmunoassay with specific antibody. The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index and physician global assessment were used to categorize patient groups. C-reactive protein, orosomucoid, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were employed as laboratory markers of mucosal inflammation. Urinary LTE4 levels were elevated in the 13 children with active Crohn's disease (160.5 +/- 59.4 pg/ml; mean +/- SEM) compared with both levels in the 14 patients with inactive disease (67.1 +/- 18.1 pg/ml; p < 0.05) and controls (45.0 +/- 10.9 pg/ml; p < 0.05). We conclude that measurement of urinary LTE4 is a useful test for monitoring the activation of peptidoleukotrienes in patients with Crohn's disease. It provides a noninvasive, objective adjunct for assessment of disease activity and could be employed in future trials examining the role of the leukotriene inhibitors in the medical therapy of IBD.},

Although pharmacologic approaches to maintaining Crohn's disease in remission have significantly improved, most of the currently available modalities are associated with significant morbidity. Recently, an enteric-coated preparation of fish oil has been shown to be effective in reducing the rate of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease in remission who are at high risk of relapse. Because of minimal side effects, fish oil appears to be an ideal maintenance agent in Crohn's disease. However, until results from studies that compare the therapeutic effect of fish oil to the currently available maintenance agents are available, fish oil supplementation cannot be recommended as a sole maintenance agent at present. It does, however, seem prudent to promote a diet rich in fish oil in patients with Crohn's disease.},

The aim of the study was to compare by meta-analysis the likelihood of clinical response to liquid diet therapy vs. corticosteroids and to assess the importance of formula composition to efficacy. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials comparing exclusive enteral nutrition with corticosteroids and elemental with non-elemental formulas were identified through a combination of computerised and hand-searching techniques. Rates of clinical remission of active Crohn's disease, based on the intention to treat principle, were extracted from the studies by two independent reviewers. Odds ratios for the likelihood of clinical response were calculated. RESULTS: In eight trials comprising 413 patients, enteral nutrition was inferior to corticosteroids (pooled odds ratio 0.35; 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.53). In five trials comprising 134 patients, there was no difference in the efficacy of elemental versus non-elemental formulas (pooled odds ratio 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.41-1.83). CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids are more effective than enteral nutrition in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. Limited sample size precludes definite conclusions about the importance of formula composition in the efficacy of enteral nutrition; however, data analysed in this study do not support an advantage to elemental feedings compared with a polymeric formulation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We recently demonstrated that 65% of patients operated on for Crohn's disease (CD) had lesions of the small bowel at perioperative endoscopy (POE). These lesions were unrecognized before surgery in more than half of the patients. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of endoscopic small bowel lesions let in place at time of surgery on further anastomotic endoscopic relapse. METHODS: Twenty one patients (10 women, 11 men, mean age 34 yr) had an enteroscopy from the terminal ileum to the ligament of Treitz during an ileocolectomy performed for CD. All patients were subsequently enrolled in a placebo-controlled trial of mesalazine for the prevention of early endoscopic relapse; 10 patients received placebo, and 11 received mesalazine (1.5 g/day) for 12 wk after surgery. At the end of this trial, they all had a colonoscopy with inspection of the anastomosis and the neoterminal ileum. RESULTS: POE was completed up to the angle of Treitz in all 21 patients. In 10/21 cases (47%), mild lesions were found distributed at random along the small intestine 30 cm beyond the resection margin. At colonoscopy performed 12 wk later, lesions were found in 11/21 cases (52%) between section margin and were estimated to be 25 cm over the anastomosis. Endoscopic recurrence occurred in 5/10 patients who received placebo and 6/11 patients who received mesalazine. Endoscopic recurrence occurred in 5/10 patients having lesions at POE and in 6/11 patients who had no lesions. There was no relationship between endoscopic recurrence at 12 wk and presence of lesions at initial POE, whatever the postoperative treatment. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic lesions let in place after "curative" surgery have no influence on early endoscopic anastomotic recurrences in CD.},

METHODS: We compared changes in systemic arterial blood pressure (BP) before and after 48 courses of TPEN in 34 patients with CD and 19 courses of TPEN in 10 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases. We simultaneously measured the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and biochemical parameters. RESULTS: BP increased significantly during TPEN in CD patients (after: 85.1 +/- 7.4 mmHg vs. before: 75.2 +/- 7.9 mmHg, P < 0.001). The increase in BP was negatively correlated with changes in the Crohn's disease activity index. BP decreased significantly after TPEN in patients with other diseases (P < 0.001), despite an improvement in their general condition. There was no significant difference in volume status between CD patients and patients with other diseases. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that determination of arterial blood pressure may be useful for assessing disease severity in patients with CD and that a fall in blood pressure may contribute to disease activity.},

   abstract = {Short-bowel syndrome is a state of severe malabsorption secondary to extensive bowel resection. The most common reasons for extensive bowel resection are Crohn's disease and mesenteric infarction. The pathophysiological consequences depend on extent and site of resection, integrity and adaptation of the remaining bowel, and secondary effects on other organs. Most extensively bowel resected patients can be adequately nourished by mouth, especially since they develop compensatory hyperphagia. For patients with colon in function a high-carbohydrate low-fat diet is beneficial compared to a diet with a normal fat content, because it results in decreased diarrhoea, decreased faecal mineral losses, and increased energy assimilation. The relative amount of dietary fat does not influence stool mass or energy assimilation in jejunostomy patients. Patients with jejunostomy have a high faecal output of water, sodium, and divalent cations, and they often need permanent parenteral supply of saline as well as calcium and magnesium if their small intestinal remnant is < 200 cm and parenteral nutritional support if they retain < 100 cm small bowel. In contrast, 50 cm of the jejunum often suffices for adequate oral nutrition if most of the colon is preserved. The majority of patients needing long-term intravenous supply are trained to administer parenteral nutrition at home (HPN). Most patients on HPN obtain a good or fair quality of life with hospital readmissions corresponding to an average of 10% of the HPN duration and an overall HPN related mortality of about 4%.},

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of patient education in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Participation in a patient education program should increase the patient's disease-related knowledge and positively influence the patient's quality of life, depression, beliefs of internal control and social activity. METHODS: We studied 36 patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: 18 were educated in four sessions, 18 were not educated (control-group). The following topics were presented: diagnosis, causes and course of disease; medication and surgery; nutrition and social benefits and stress management and coping with the disease. RESULTS: The effects of the program were evaluated before, immediately and three months after the intervention using questionnaires. Participants in the program showed a significant increase in knowledge after three months compared with the non-participants. There were positive, although not significant effects on psychosocial variables. CONCLUSION: Patient education is a valuable means to increase knowledge of disease and treatment in patient's with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Effects on psychosocial variables need to be examined on a long term basis in larger patient groups.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This prospective, open trial of treatment was conducted to determine whether cyclosporine A (CSA) is effective in inducing remission in children with severe, active Crohn's colitis refractory to other medical treatment and if remission may be maintained by 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) after discontinuing CSA. METHODS: Ten children (five males, five females), ages 1.2-16 yr (mean 11), all had failed to respond to 4 wk of treatment with i.v. methylprednisolone and total parenteral nutrition/elemental diet; three were already receiving 6-mercaptopurine. CSA was initially given as a twice daily i.v. dosage and was switched to oral CSA when a clinical response was observed. At the same time, corticosteroids were switched to the oral route and tapered over the next 3 months. Patients were grouped by treatment outcome. "Responders" were those who achieved remission with i.v. CSA therapy, "relapsers" were those who achieved remission with i.v. CSA but relapsed later, and nonresponders had not achieved remission after 4 wk of i.v. CSA. Responders were given 6-MP with intent to discontinue CSA after 6 months and maintain remission by 6-MP and 5-ASA. RESULTS: There were seven responders to CSA. For all patients, the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) (score range 0-100) had a mean value of 55 (range 40-65) just before treatment; PCDAI improved to a mean of 19 (range 5-42.5) after 2 wk of CSA therapy. Four of the seven responders discontinued CSA after 6 months and remain well on 6-MP and 5ASA alone for 22, 13, 8, and 3 months. One patient had massive GI bleeding (from active Crohn's colitis), which stopped within 48 h of CSA treatment. There were three relapsers (at 2-6 months of CSA), and three were nonresponders. Three patients who were already receiving 6-MP before CSA therapy either did not respond to CSA or relapsed while receiving it. The six nonresponders and relapsers required surgical resection. Transient side effects included hypertension responding to nifedipine in one child and hirsutism and tremors in another. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that CSA offers a good remission rate for children with severe Crohn's colitis failing other medical treatment, although relapse was common especially if the child was already on 6-MP. In addition, CSA may offer "temporizing" therapy in severe, active Crohn's colitis; this may allow surgery to be performed electively, with time for psychosocial and nutritional preparation before surgery.},

Eleven patients were in clinical remission and showed no biological evidence of inflammation (group II). Hemoglobin and red cell indices, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum iron, transferrin, serum ferritin and basic red cell ferritin were determined in all patients. The usual indicators of iron status, particularly serum ferritin, were affected by the inflammatory processes, but basic red cell ferritin appeared to be independent of inflammation. Basic red cell ferritin can therefore be considered to be a reliable indicator of iron status in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease.},

During oral bacteriotherapy, the gut immune response was indirectly assessed by solid-phase enzyme-linked immunoassay in 14 children with Crohn's disease, in 9 with juvenile chronic arthritis, and in 7 controls. The immunostimulatory effect of Lactobacillus GG was specific for Crohn's disease, irrespective of its activity: the mean (95% confidence interval) number of specific antibody secreting cells in the IgA class to beta-lactoglobulin increased significantly from 0.2 (0.04-1.3) to 1.4 (0.3-6.0)/10(6) cells and to casein from 0.3 (0.1-1.4) to 1.0 (0.2-4.8)/10(6) cells. The results indicate that orally administered Lactobacillus GG has the potential to increase the gut IgA immune response and thereby to promote the gut immunological barrier. Consequently, Lactobacillus GG could provide an adjunct nutritional therapy for Crohn's disease.},

In a previous study a whole protein containing diet proved less effective than one in which food antigens were excluded, suggesting that exclusion of food antigens from the gut was a possible mechanism. This study was designed to test whether an oligopeptide diet of hydrolysed proteins was as effective as an amino acid based diet. These diets were equally antigen free but with different nitrogen sources. Forty four patients with active Crohn's disease were randomised in a controlled trial of amino acid versus oligopeptide diet. The feeds were given by nasogastric tube in equicaloric quantities and were the sole form of nutrition. Treatment was continued for four weeks although failure to improve by day 10 resulted in withdrawal. Quantitative leucocyte scintigraphy was used to investigate the effect of diet treatment on gut inflammation. Clinical and nutritional responses to treatment were also measured. Sixteen patients entered remission (including withdrawal of corticosteroids), six patients could not tolerate the nasogastric tube, and 22 patients failed to respond. The two diets were equally effective. Patients who responded had a rapid drop in clinical index of disease activity and a major reduction in the bowel uptake of leucocytes on scintigraphy. The oligopeptide and amino acid based enteral feeds were equally effective at inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. With both diets clinical improvement was accompanied by a reduction in intestinal inflammation.},

While these lesions are often chronic and variably responsive to medical therapy, only rarely are they severely destructive. In this report, we characterize the frequency, severity, and clinical course of a highly destructive form of perianal disease (HDPD) that we have noted in a number of children and adolescents with Crohn's disease. A database containing records from 350 children with inflammatory bowel disease was reviewed to identify all children with CD treated between 1970 and 1993. For each, the occurrence or absence of significant perianal pathology, including fistula, abscess, and HDPD, was determined. Pertinent clinical details were recorded for all patients. In addition, the clinical characteristics of those children with HDPD were compiled, and the courses of those with HDPD characterized. A search of the database identified 230 children and adolescents with CD followed for a total of 1,518 patient years. Sixty-seven of these patients (29% of the CD population) had significant perianal pathology. This included 6 with HDPD, 8 with complicated fistulae [rectourethroperineal (1), rectovaginal (1), rectolabial (2), and multiple communicating perineal (4)], and 53 with simple perianal fistulae or abscesses. All six with HDPD had deeply destructive perineal ulcerations, marked undermining of the perineal and perirectal tissues, and copious exudate, and often there was a deeply cleaved or fileted perineum on separating the buttocks. Two children with HDPD had fecal incontinence.},

Cyclic home elemental enteral alimentation (C-HEEA) was developed to prevent flare-up of CD and to minimize patient hospitalization. However, its therapeutic efficacy has not been studied in a large patient population. Therefore, questionnaires were sent to members of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Research Group of Japan to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA and to define the factors that may affect the efficacy of the treatment. Data for 410 patients (C-HEEA-treated n = 322; drug-treated n = 88) were collected from 29 institutions and analysis showed the following results. The cumulative remission and non-hospitalization rates of the C-HEEA treated group were significantly higher than the rates of the drug-treated group in all patients and in those with ileitis and ileo-colitis (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.01, respectively), but no significant difference was noted in patients with colitis. Cumulative remission and non-hospitalization rates were also influenced by the daily calorie content of the elemental diet (ED); more than 1200 kcal of the ED per day was found to be more effective than lower amounts to maintain remission and to prevent hospitalization. The therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA was shown to be superior to that of drug treatment in patients with CD with ileal involvement, and it is suggested that more than 1200kcal per day should be supplied by the ED to enhance its therapeutic efficacy.},

The patients were randomly allocated to receive 200 mg/day (group 1) or 400 mg/day (group 2) of ranitidine by continuous infusion. The mean basal 24-h gastric pH was sustained at a low value. After raintidine administration, the mean pH increased significantly both in group 1 (from 2.13 to 3.28) and in group 2 (from 1.91 to 3.36), with the mean holding-time at pH-3 also increasing significantly in both groups. There were no differences in the mean pH or holding-time at pH-3 between the two groups during ranitidine administration; however, the plasma ranitidine concentration was significantly higher in group 2. These findings indicate that the continuous infusion of a standard dose of ranitidine exerted a maximal inhibitory effect on the sustained hyperacidity induced by TPN, but that this infusion was unable to maintain the intragastric pH level at above 3.5.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a quantitative measurement of subjective perception of health state, including emotional and social aspects. It can be reliably measured with several valid instruments. Previous reviews of the literature suggested inadequate attention to HRQOL in studies of interventions in inflammatory bowel disease. PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to assess the current status of the quality of measurement of HRQOL in studies of inflammatory bowel disease and to review the clinical conclusions warranted by the literature. METHOD: Medicine was searched for articles relating to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or inflammatory bowel disease and quality of life since 1981. The articles found were reviewed for citations of further articles. The adequacy of HRQOL measure was assessed and graded, and the study design was categorized to assess the strength of the literature on the whole. RESULTS: A trend was found toward higher quality of HRQOL measurement in the period 1988 to 1994 compared with 1981 to 1987. Most of the improvement was because of increased use of standardized and multidomain but unvalidated and unpublished questionnaires for measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Confidence in the following clinical conclusions in studies of surgical interventions in inflammatory bowel disease is limited by study design: that pelvic pouch is not inferior to ileostomy, that specific domains of HRQOL are differentially affected by different surgical procedures, and (with less confidence) that surgery is helpful in Crohn's disease. Medical studies have demonstrated that high quality HRQOL measures can be integrated into randomized, prospective trials. Clinically equivalent treatments have shown differential effects or HRQOL: 9 mg daily of budesonide is superior to 15 mg, and hydrocortisone foam enemas are superior to prednisolone. Home parenteral nutrition has received modest support, limited again by study design. It is recommended that standard tests of HRQOL be used to increase comparability of studies and to increase the quality of this literature in general. In particular the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, Rating Form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Concerns, and Direct Questioning of Objectives are recommended.},

   abstract = {The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown. Several potential mechanisms are discussed. The etiological and therapeutic importance of nutrition is controversial. Though changes in dietary habits and incidence of inflammatory bowel disease during the last century were in parallel, no specific nutritional factor has been isolated. No dietary prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease is yet known; all dietary therapies in inflammatory bowel disease aim to improve nutritional support and to diminish inflammation by bowel rest. Children and adolescents gain in weight and height. Total parenteral nutrition will not substantially reduce disease activity and operation rates. Total parenteral nutrition can only be recommended in ulcerative colitis patients with severe disease in the initial phase and in Crohn's patients with severe malnutrition and intestinal complications. Enteral nutrition support is less effective in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. Reported remission rates on enteral nutrition are 25% for ulcerative colitis and up to 80% for Crohn. However, in active Crohn's disease enteral nutrition is less effective than standard therapy with methylprednisolone and sulfasalizine. It is generally believed that nutrition therapy in combination with drugs is the best treatment modality. There is no evidence to support the importance of any combination of the formula diets such as elemental, oligopeptide, or polymeric formulations. Administration of formula diets by nasogastric tubes all show similar remission rates. Whether newer diets supplemented with arginine, glutamine, omega-3-fatty acids or short chain fatty acids increase remission rates is not known. Further studies in this field are warranted.},

   abstract = {Elemental diets are effective treatments for active Crohn's disease. To determine which dietary constituents are of therapeutic importance, the effectiveness of four separate feeds was related to their compositions, and the findings substantiated by meta-analysis of previous dietary studies. 76 patients with active Crohn's disease were recruited. 17 were randomised to an amino acid-based elemental diet (E028), 22 to E028 with added long-chain triglyceride (E028 LCT), 18 to a semi-elemental, peptide based diet (Pepdite 2+) and 19 received E028 with added medium-chain triglyceride (E028 MCT). Disease activity fell in all groups and remission rate was negatively correlated with the amount of energy derived from LCT (r = -0.97, p = 0.016). Inflammatory indices fell in the groups (E028 + E028 MCT) containing least LCT. No other dietary constituents correlated with remission rate. A meta-analysis of published studies confirmed a negative correlation between remission rate and LCT (r = -0.63, p = 0.006) but not other constituents. The association between dietary LCT and remission rate may have pathogenic significance and allow the development of more effective enteral feeds.},

   abstract = {Recently, latent pulmonary involvement has been described in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease. It is unknown, however, whether this also occurs in children, and whether the pulmonary abnormalities differ between the acute phase and remission. The incidence of pulmonary abnormalities has been investigated in 26 children with acute or quiescent Crohn's disease in terms of the following parameters: clinical pulmonary symptoms, chest roentgenograms and pulmonary function tests, including lung transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TLCO). One child had a severe digital clubbing. Chest radiographs were normal in all subjects. No significant differences were found between acute and quiescent phase for pulmonary volumes and expiratory flows, but TLCO (% predicted) was significantly decreased during the active phase of the disease as compared to remission (53 +/- 15 vs 81 +/- 19% predicted). These data suggest that latent pulmonary involvement is also present in a paediatric population with active Crohn's disease, despite a short disease history and absence of smoking. Although the nature of this abnormality remains unclear, this extradigestive epiphenomenon should be taken into account with respect to the aetiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1[7-36 amide]) is an incretin hormone primarily synthesized in the lower gut (ileum, colon/rectum). Nevertheless, there is an early increment in plasma GLP-1 immediately after ingesting glucose or mixed meals, before nutrients have entered GLP-1 rich intestinal regions. The responsible signalling pathway between the upper and lower gut is not clear. It was the aim of this study to see, whether small intestinal resection or colonectomy changes GLP-1[7-36 amide] release after oral glucose. In eight healthy controls, in seven patients with inactive Crohn's disease (no surgery), in nine patients each after primarily jejunal or ileal small intestinal resections, and in six colonectomized patients not different in age (p = 0.10), body-mass-index (p = 0.24), waist-hip-ratio (p = 0.43), and HbA1c (p = 0.22), oral glucose tolerance tests (75 g) were performed in the fasting state. GLP-1[7-36 amide], insulin C-peptide, GIP and glucagon (specific (RIAs) were measured over 240 min. STATISTICS: Repeated measures ANOVA, t-test (significance: p < 0.05). A clear and early (peak: 15-30 min) GLP-1[7-36 amide] response was observed in all subjects, without any significant difference between gut-resected and control groups (p = 0.95). There were no significant differences in oral glucose tolerance (p = 0.21) or in the suppression of pancreatic glucagon (p = 0.36). Colonectomized patients had a higher insulin (p = 0.011) and C-peptide (p = 0.0023) response in comparison to all other groups. GIP responses also were higher in the colonectomized patients (p = 0.0005). Inactive Crohn's disease and resections of the small intestine as well as proctocolectomy did not change overall GLP-1[7-36 amide] responses and especially not the early increment after oral glucose. This may indicate release of GLP-1[7-36 amide] after oral glucose from the small number of GLP-1[7-36 amide] producing L-cells in the upper gut rather than from the main source in the ileum, colon and rectum. Colonectomized patients are characterized by insulin hypersecretion, which in combination with their normal oral glucose tolerance possibly indicates a reduced insulin sensitivity in this patient group. GIP may play a role in mediating insulin hypersecretion in these patients.},

   abstract = {Patients with a short bowel have usually had a bowel resection for Crohn's disease. Two types of short-bowel patient can be distinguished: those with a jejunostomy and those with their jejunum anastomosed to a functioning colon. Both types of patient have problems with macronutrient absorption, although those with a colon experience fewer problems because some energy from unabsorbed carbohydrate is salvaged in the colon. Patients with a jejunostomy have problems with large stomal losses of water, sodium and magnesium, whereas those with a jejuno-colic anastomosis rarely have problems with water and electrolyte absorption. Patients with a jejunostomy 100-200 cm from the duodeno-jejunal flexure ('absorbers') usually absorb more from the diet than they pass through the stoma and therefore require oral electrolyte or nutrient supplements. Those with a residual jejunal length of less than 100 cm usually secrete more from the stoma than they take in orally ('secretors') and therefore require long-term parenteral fluid or nutrient supplements. A high output resulting from a jejunostomy is treated by reducing the oral intake of hypotonic fluid, administering a sipped glucose-saline solution and, often, by giving drugs that reduce intestinal motility (most effective in absorbers) or gastrointestinal secretions (most effective in secretors). Gallstones are common both in short-bowel patients with and in those without a colon (45%), and calcium oxalate renal stones occur in the former (25%). However, it is now possible to provide adequate nutrition and fluid supplements for most patients with a short bowel, and the prospects for the rehabilitation of such patients are good.},

Their cumulative rates of continuous remission and non hospitalization were statistically compared in relation to following five factors; type of disease, history of bowel resection, duration of disease, oral bile acid tolerance test (OBATT) and radiological lesion score (RLS). As to the cumulative rates of continuous remission and non hospitalization, there was no significant difference between two groups treated with Elental and Enterued. In patient with ileocolitis type, > or = 5-year history, and a high score of RLS, few cases could continuously maintain remission following a long-term HEN. Especially, patients with low absorption in OBATT had a significantly lower cumulative rate of continuous remission than those with normal absorption in OBATT. The present results suggest that above factors may be useful in the application of HEN to patients with Crohn's disease.},

Disordered protein and carbohydrate metabolism have been reported in children with Crohn's disease, but little is known about their fat utilization. To assess fat oxidation, 13C-Hiolein was administered to 11 children with active Crohn's disease (age range, 10.5-16.9 years; mean, 12.6) before and after treatment with steroids. Expired breath samples were collected at hourly intervals for 12 h, and 13CO2 excretion was measured by mass spectrometry. The mean 95% confidence interval (CI) time to peak 13CO2 excretion was 9 h (range, 7.73-9.97) before treatment and 6.95 h (range, 5.75-8.15) after treatment (p < 0.02). Mean 95% CI cumulative 13CO2 excretion up to peak time (7 h) was 47.53% (range, 24-69%) before treatment and 68.7% (range, 35-80.5%) after treatment with steroids (p < 0.02). Our results demonstrated impaired lipid utilization during active disease and improvement following steroid treatment. The oral 13C-Hiolein test is simple and noninvasive, and its results are reproducible. It provides a new method for estimating fat utilization in paediatric patients, along with the possibility of discriminating between patients with and without impaired utilization during the acute phase of the disease.},

   abstract = {Nutrition and intestinal function are intimately interrelated. The chief purpose of the gut is to digest and absorb nutrients in order to maintain life. Consequently, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease commonly results in malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality. For example, studies have shown that 50-70% of adult patients with Crohn's disease were weight-depleted and 75% of adolescents growth-retarded. On the other hand, chronic malnutrition impairs digestive and absorptive function because food and nutrients are not only the major trophic factors to the gut but also provide the building blocks for digestive enzymes and absorptive cells. For example, recent studies of ours have shown that a weight loss of greater than 30% accompanying a variety of diseases was associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%, villus atrophy and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption. Finally, specific nutrients can induce disease, for example, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, whilst dietary factors such as fibre, resistant starch, short-chain fatty acids, glutamine and fish-oils may prevent gastrointestinal diseases such as diverticulitis, diversion colitis, ulcerative colitis, colonic adenomatosis and colonic carcinoma. The role of dietary antigens in the aetiology of Crohn's disease is controversial, but controlled studies have suggested that elemental diets may be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing a remission in patients with acute Crohn's disease. In conclusion, nutrition has both a supportive and therapeutic role in the management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. With the development of modern techniques of nutritional support, the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic GI disease can be reduced. On the other hand, dietary manipulation may be used to treat to prevent specific GI disorders such as coeliac disease, functional bowel disease, Crohn's disease and colonic neoplasia. The future development of nutria-pharmaceuticals is particularly attractive in view of their low cost and wide safety margins.},

We examined the local and systemic appearance of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in an experimental animal model of inflammatory bowel disease. Colitis was induced in CBA/J mice by adding dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), 5% (wt/vol), to their water. DSS-induced colitis is a reproducible animal model for evaluating the role of cytokines in the pathology of colitis. Animals were weighed daily, and stools were checked for the presence of blood. Groups of mice were killed daily, blood samples were taken for measurement of plasma cytokine levels, and colonic samples were taken for histology and measurement of TNF and IL-6 bioactivity. Mice fed DSS developed colitis with bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and colonic inflammation by days 5-9. Histologic examination of the colons showed focal crypt destruction and ulceration. In mice with DSS-induced colitis no TNF was detectable in colonic tissue extracts or in plasma. In contrast, plasma IL-6 was detectable from days 4 to 9 and was detectable in colonic tissue in only a few (two of four) terminally ill animals on day 9. Animals were injected with a neutralizing, polyclonal anti-TNF antiserum that maintained high in vivo neutralizing titers for > or = 48 h. This anti-TNF antiserum failed to block or modify the severity of colitis induced by DSS. Failure to detect local or systemic TNF and failure to prevent colonic inflammation with anti-TNF antiserum showed that TNF is not an inflammatory mediator in DSS-induced murine colitis.},

   abstract = {Several activity indexes, including clinical variables, laboratory variables or both, have been proposed to assess the activity and severity of Crohn's disease (CD). Although activity indexes are commonly used in clinical trials, doubts exist as to whether it is correct to group together and quantify under the same numerical expression the very heterogeneous clinical manifestations of CD. The aim of our study was to try to establish a correlation between clinical and laboratory activity indexes of CD in subgroups of patients with primarily inflammatory or primarily fibrostenosing clinical characteristics. At least two activity indexes were calculated among 232 outpatient examinations in 61 CD patients. Indexes were classified as clinical, laboratory, or both. A close correlation was observed when indexes calculated on clinical variables were compared or when those that include only or prevalently laboratory parameters were compared. Conversely, the correlation between clinical and laboratory indexes tended to be poor. Taking into consideration the subgroups of patients, the correlation between clinical and laboratory indexes was high in primarily inflammatory disease but low in the primarily fibrostenosing form. The clinical activity of CD does not always reflect the quantity of inflammation measured by laboratory parameters. This is particularly true in primarily fibrostenosing disease. Different clinical patterns of CD should always be considered in the attempt to quantify with an activity index the activity and severity of disease.},

   abstract = {Leukocyte scintigraphy (LS) was performed in 20 pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD: 10 with ulcerative colitis, 2 with indeterminate colitis, and 8 with Crohn disease) in different stages of clinical activity. Leukocytes were separated from 15 to 60 ml venous blood and were labeled in vitro with [99mTc]HM-PAO. The segmental extent (small intestine; ascending, transverse, and descending colon; and recto-sigmoideum) of the process was determined by LS. The uptake of each bowel segment was scored in relation to the bone marrow uptake. The scintigraphic activity, calculated by summing the segment scores, was compared with laboratory parameters. The mean labeling efficacy was 76% (60-86%). The segmental extent of the process determined by LS was compared with the results of barium enema or colonoscopy with regard to 32 bowel segments. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of LS were 93, 88, and 91%, respectively. Two extraintestinal manifestations (abdominal abscess and joint involvement) were also detected by LS. These lesions were verified by computed tomography (CT) (abscess) and on the basis of the clinical outcome (arthritis). The scintigraphic activity correlated with the C-reactive protein (CRP) level (r = 0.82, p < 0.001), the alpha 2-globulin level (r = 0.63, p < 0.02), the sedimentation rate (r = 0.51, p < 0.05), and the fS iron level (r = -0.66, p < 0.005). LS is applicable in pediatric patients. The method is an excellent technique for assessment of the extent of IBD in children. Extraintestinal manifestations of IBD can also be investigated by LS. The scintigraphic activity is a useful parameter for determination of the activity of IBD in children.},

When it is to be seen at the beginning of the disease, it may cause difficulties in the diagnostic, especially with Crohn's disease. CASE REPORT: Gastric ulcers were detected in a 12 year-old girl, of African origin, who complained about epigastric pain. Eighteen months later, diarrhea, poor growing, uveitis and inflammatory biological signs led to a probable diagnostic of Crohn's disease. Endoscopy seemed to confirm this diagnostic with granulomatous lesions on gastric biopsies. The absence of radiological anomalies of the digestive tract and the poor efficiency of the medical treatment led to question this diagnosis and to assert that of sarcoidosis. CONCLUSIONS: This case allows to emphasize the rare involvement of the digestive tract in sarcoidosis and the aspects common both to Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis.},

The serum alpha1-AT level, ESR, platelet count, and hemoglobin values of 154 children who were initially evaluated for possible IBD, as well as of 113 children with known IBD, were compared to evaluate their value as markers of inflammatory activity. Of the 154 children evaluated for IBD, 103 did not have IBD, 28 were diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD), and 23 were found to have ulcerative colitis (UC). The sensitivity and specificity for CD was for alpha1-AT, 100%, 92%; for ESR, 68%, 94%; and for UC was for alpha1-AT, 70%, 92%; for ESR, 61%, 94%. In the 113 children with known IBD (66 CD, 47 UC), the sensitivity and specificity for predicting disease activity was for CD for alpha1-AT, 94%, 59%; for ESR, 52%, 63%; and for UC was for alpha1-AT, 79%, 76%; and for ESR, 59%, 82%. The determination of serum alpha1-AT levels was more sensitive and specific than the ESR in the initial diagnosis of CD and in predicting subsequent disease activity in both CD and UC.},

Presently available techniques are not ideal in clinical practice for serial analysis as they are time-consuming and require unpleasant and prolonged handling of the stools. The present study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and precision of near infrared reflectance analysis (NIRA) in routine measurement of fat, nitrogen and water faecal contents compared with Van de Kamer (VDK), Kjeldahl (KJ) and gravimetric-by-lyophilization (LY) methods, respectively. Fat, nitrogen and water (n = 34), were measured in the 1-day faecal collections of 15 healthy subjects and 19 patients (10, coeliac disease; 6, chronic pancreatitis; 3, small-bowel Crohn's disease). A highly significant linear correlation was found between VDK, KJ, LY methods and NIRA analysis. Very low values of intra-assay coefficient of variation indicated a remarkable analytical precision of NIRA. A recovery test at different concentrations in the useful range was performed for all three nutrients, to assess the accuracy of NIRA. Quantitative recoveries were between 95 and 105%. Data from the present study show that NIRA analysis is reproducible, accurate and rapid (less than 1 min). These characteristics make NIRA serial analysis useful in clinical practice to monitor progress and response to therapy in patients with malabsorption/maldigestion syndromes.},

   abstract = {In a 10-week randomised cross-sectional study we used an 88-item questionnaire to assess the quality of life in 16 children (ages 8-17 years) with Crohn's disease and their families. The questionnaire covered six domains of health-related quality of life, including disease and its treatment, social, emotional, family, education, and future aspects. Crohn's disease affected education, with absenteeism in 12 and distraction during school work in six. Three children had had a home tutor, and five stated their need for one. Engaging in sports was a problem for eight children, mainly because of a lack of energy in five and the presence of a stoma in three children. Three children had missed every PE lesson in 1 year. Five children cited the social problem of being unable to stay over at friends' houses. Bullying concerned parents more than the children. Holiday difficulties included long distance traveling or lack of toilet facilities during school trips. Elemental diet was the preferred treatment, although the majority complained about the taste. Surgery was the most effective method of symptom control, though the resulting stoma was upsetting and restricted sports activities. Children on steroids had more depressive symptoms. Using the Rutter A Questionnaire, five children were designated "neurotic." Parents' views of the severity of symptoms significantly correlated with their children's views regarding rectal bleeding, poor growth, lack of energy, and poor appetite (p < 0.01). The main parental concerns were the side effects of medications and issues concerning their children's future, including schooling, job prospects, and marriage. The parents of 11 children cited problems with children's behaviour. The parents of seven cited disruption of work, and those of six named taking holidays. Crohn's disease in children, in addition to being a symptomatically disabling condition, has a great impact on the health-related quality of life of both sufferers and their parents. The questionnaire was a useful instrument, and with some adjustment it can be used again in large group studies.},

Two boys and six girls (six with ulcerative colitis and two with Crohn's disease; ages 3-17 years) received 100-200 micrograms/kg/day cyclosporine intravenously and then 4-10 mg/kg/day orally. Doses were adjusted to achieve trough serum cyclosporine levels of 100-200 mu/L (Abbott's TDX assay). Seven of the eight patients received azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, and all were given a 5-aminosalicylate preparation and corticosteroids. The latter drugs were continued and then tapered off as clinical status allowed. Cyclosporine was continued for 3-10 months in those who responded. In seven of eight patients, there was a rapid clinical response; one patient showed a transient response, but recurrent bleeding led to total colectomy 9 days after starting cyclosporine. Of the seven responders, three were able to discontinue prednisone and cyclosporine and are doing well on azathioprine at long-term follow-up (2-5 years). One who did not receive azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine maintained remission for 2 years after cyclosporine was stopped, one experienced a disease flare-up 5 months after start of cyclosporine treatment and required colectomy, one who did not tolerate 6-mercaptopurine had a flare-up during cyclosporine tapering and underwent surgery at 6 months, and one started to flare up with cyclosporine tapering at 6 months and was scheduled for surgery. No significant complications of treatment were observed. Seven patients had an initial response and four of them have so far not required surgery. These preliminary findings suggest that azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine can be used safely to maintain cyclosporine-induced remission in children with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies using indirect calorimetry in Crohn's disease have suggested that with weight loss there is a proportionally greater decrease in body fat along with a spring of lean mass. This study analyzed body composition (compared with that of controls) by direct methods in a group of 30 patients with active Crohn's disease and further evaluated the effects of nutrition support on body composition. METHODS: Total body protein was assessed by neutron activation, fat was assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, water was assessed by bioelectric impedance analysis, and potassium was assessed by gamma-ray technique. These measurements were repeated in patients with Crohn's disease after 3 weeks of enteral nutrition by feeding tube that provided 35 nonprotein kcal/kg of ideal body weight. RESULTS: Compared with age- and sex-matched controls, patients had lost (on average) 11.3 kg (16%) of body weight (p < .0005), including 5.1 kg (30%) of fat (p < .0005), 2.2 kg (19%) of protein (p < .025), 3.7 kg (10%) of water (p = NS), and 24.9 g (21%) of total body potassium (p < .01). After enteral feeding, body weight increased by 1.9 +/- 0.3 kg (p < .0005). Weight gain was accompanied by an increase in body protein (0.3 +/- 0.1 kg), fat (0.3 +/- 0.1 kg), and water (1.1 +/- 0.4 kg) (all p < .025), and by a nonsignificant increase in total body potassium. The weight gain of approximately 2 kg consisted of 65% water, 18% fat, and 18% protein, thus comprising a normal proportion of body composition. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced body weight in patients with Crohn's disease compared with that in controls was due to less fat tissue. With modest nutritional repletion, proportionate gains in all body compartments are possible.},

The incidence and daily intake of each dietary component were compared annually from 1966 to 1985. The univariate analysis showed that the increased incidence of Crohn disease was strongly (P < 0.001) correlated with increased dietary intake of total fat (r = 0.919). animal fat (r = 0.880), n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (r = 0.883), animal protein (r = 0.908), milk protein (r = 0.924), and the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acid intake (r = 0.792). It was less correlated with intake of total protein (r = 0.482, P < 0.05), was not correlated with intake of fish protein (r = 0.055, P > 0.1), and was inversely correlated with intake of vegetable protein (r = -0.941, P < 0.001). The multivariate analysis showed that increased intake of animal protein was the strongest independent factor with a weaker second factor, an increased ration of n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The present study in association with reported clinical studies suggests that increased dietary intake of animal protein and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids with less n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may contribute to the development of Crohn disease.},

   abstract = {Patients with chronic intestinal disorders causing malabsorption, nutritional losses through diarrhea, or catabolic illness would be expected to have essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency (EFAD), but such deficiency has not been demonstrated in patients treated in accordance with the prevailing standard of care. We studied plasma fatty acid patterns of 56 reference or control subjects and 47 patients with chronic intestinal disorders (mostly Crohn's disease) using high-resolution capillary column gas-liquid chromatography. Patients exhibited a shift in fatty acid metabolism similar to that previously shown to be associated with EFAD. Compared with control subjects, patients had (1) decreased polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels (43.7% v 50.4%, P < .0001), (2) increased monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) levels (25.8% v 22.0%, P < .0001), (3) higher ratios of mead (20:3 omega 9) to arachidonic (20:4 omega 6) acid (0.020 v 0.013, P < .04), and (4) lower concentrations of total (214 v 284 mg/dL, P < .01), saturated ([SFA] 63 v 75 mg/dL, P < .001), MUFA (56 v 63 mg/dL, P < .001), and PUFA (93 v 143 mg/dL, P < .001). Patients had metabolic shifts toward increased production of MUFA and an increased ratio of derivatives to precursors of omega 6 fatty acids, shifts that occur when cells are EFA-deficient. More than 25% of the patients had biochemical evidence of EFAD according to at least one criterion. Optimal diagnosis requires a concurrent evaluation of concentrations of fatty acids in plasma and in lipoproteins (percent fatty acids). On indices of EFA status that depend on percents, ratios, or concentrations of fatty acids or on the production of abnormal fatty acids, the patients were between patients with severe whole-body EFAD and healthy subjects, a state referred to as absolute EFA insufficiency. Patients with chronic intestinal disease should be evaluated for likely EFA deficiencies and imbalances, and treated with substantial amounts of supplements rich in EFAs, such as oral vegetable and fish oils, or intravenous lipids if necessary.},

   abstract = {The history of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is relatively short. In 1980, a report entitled "Gastrostomy without laparotomy: A percutaneous endoscopic technique" by Ponsky and Gaudere was first published in the Journal of Pediatric Surgery. Thereafter, PEG soon saw widespread use in Western countries because of its clinical efficacy and economy. It has been performed in about 170,000 cases annually in the US. In contrast, its spread in Japan has been extremely slow: only about 10,000 cases have undergone this procedure annually, and this number accounted for less than 5% of patients receiving enteral alimentation. The reason why PEG has not spread may be the medical insurance system in Japan and the local distaste for operation scarring. However, in consideration of the unprecedented ageing of society that is surely coming in the near future, the role of PEG in Japan must be reexamined. In this report, we presented the methodology of enteral alimentation at home by means of PEG, giving special consideration to: (1) "What points are improved by using enteral alimentation at home by means of PEG in various diseases; (2) dysphagia due to cerebral angiopathy; (3) terminal cancer; (4) otolaryngological diseases; and (5) Crohn disease. We also discussed "Why PEG is important now?" in performing enteral alimentation at home.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition regimens achieve remission from active Crohn's disease at rates comparable to steroids and total parenteral nutrition. Despite their increasing use there has to date been no assessment of patient tolerance or practical difficulties involved. METHODS: We investigated 147 treatments with elemental diet in 89 patients and followed this with an anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS: Sip feeding was successfully introduced in 85% with nasogastric feeding being necessary in 22 (15%). Nausea and postural hypotension were common in the first week of treatment but vomiting was only seen in three patients who were sensitive to the formula used. Two patients each had caffeine withdrawal symptoms and hypoglycemia and a further four had food-related night terrors. Our experience suggests that caution is necessary if this treatment is used in elderly subjects. Although the diets are perceived as being unpalatable, only six patients found taste to be a problem after the first week of treatment. The main problem with long-term treatment was the large daily volume requirement, which was overcome by increasing the concentration of the feed. Eighty percent of patients responded to the questionnaire, and 65% stated that they would opt for treatment with elemental diet again in the case of a further relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Elemental diet seems to be an acceptable and well-tolerated form of treatment in Crohn's disease.},

METHODS: We assessed sequential changes in disease activity (clinical and laboratory indices and faecal excretion of indium-111-labelled leucocytes) and nutritional status (anthropometry, body composition variables), hepatic secretory proteins (albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin), and trace elements (iron, magnesium, copper, zinc) during treatment of acute Crohn's disease with an elemental diet. RESULTS: Disease activity indices improved significantly by 2 weeks and were maintained at 4 weeks of treatment. There was a significant increase in pre-albumin at 4 weeks and an increase in serum iron and a decrease in serum copper during the study period. The changes occurring in the measures of nutrition did not correlate significantly with the changes in disease activity. CONCLUSION: The fact that changes in disease activity appear to precede any detectable changes in nutritional state, it suggests that the beneficial action of elemental diet in patients with active Crohn's disease is not due to an improvement in nutritional status.},

Elemental or low-fat, low-residual diets in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis are reported to decrease anaerobic bacteria and to change the composition of the intestinal microflora. We examined the effect of an indigestible agent, 4G-beta-D-galactosylsucrose (lactosucrose), which is selectively utilized by intestinal Bifidobacterium, on the composition of the intestinal microflora. After the administration of lactosucrose to two patients with Crohn's disease and five patients with ulcerative colitis for 2 weeks, significant induction of the growth of Bifidobacterium was observed, and significant reduction in the population level of Bacteroidaceae was seen. Bowel movements improved in four patients. The intestinal environment, estimated by measuring fecal pH, fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids and putrid products, and the urinary secretion of indican, also improved in these patients. These results suggest that lactosucrose may be useful for patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease.},

DESIGN: Retrospective clinical review of cohort of consecutive patients. SETTING: Tertiary care, academic medical center. PATIENTS: Fifty adult (age, > 16 years) patients with intestinal remnants less than 180 cm were evaluated over a 15-year period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and natural history of cholelithiasis, postoperative morbidity, and mortality rates. RESULTS: Prophylactic cholecystectomy was performed in 5 patients (10%). Ten patients (20%) died within 20 days without evidence of gallstones. Eleven (31%) of the other 35 patients at risk developed biliary disease; 6 of these patients had inflammatory complications or common bile duct stones. Biliary disease was more likely (P < .05) in patients with intestinal remnant length less than 120 cm (47% vs 13%), an absent ileocecal junction (41% vs 0%), long-term total parenteral nutrition (45% vs 13%), and Crohn's disease (67% vs 24%). Patients with mesenteric vascular disease had high initial mortality (50%) and a 38% incidence of biliary disease. Patients with cancer and/or irradiation had a lower initial mortality (7%) and no biliary disease. Patients with benign conditions had a significant incidence of cholelithiasis (57%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the short-bowel syndrome have a significant risk for cholelithiasis if the intestinal remnant length is less than 120 cm, total parenteral nutrition is required, and the terminal ileum is resected. Prophylactic cholecystectomy is indicated in patients with benign conditions and anticipated long-term survival. It should also be considered in patients with mesenteric vascular disease who, despite significantly shortened survival, may have a high incidence of early biliary problems.},

METHODS: Records of 141 children and adolescents with Crohn's disease were reviewed. Of these, 18 patients (eight female, 10 male) between 9 and 18 yr of age (nine blacks and nine whites) had significant perianal disease. The disease was classified on the basis external appearance, degree of inflammation, presence of infection or abscess formation, spread to vulva, loss of perineal body, and occurrence of anal canal stricture as being mild, moderate, or severe. RESULTS: Eight patients had severe involvement, whereas moderate and mild degree of perianal disease was seen in six and four patients, respectively. Disease localization was as follows: pancolitis, 12; ileocolitis, four; and left colitis, two. Therapy with Azulfidine or 5-amino salicylic acid preparation, local and systemic steroids, metronidazole, immunosuppressives, and enteral and/or parenteral nutrition was used in various combinations. Surgery was necessary in eight patients: in four for management of anal canal stricture, incision and drainage of abscess in two, total proctocolectomy in one, and fecal diversion in an additional patient. Over a follow-up period ranging from 18 months to 15 yr, nine patients had partial improvement, whereas in the rest, the disease either did not improve or worsened. CONCLUSIONS: Severe, mutilating perianal Crohn's disease, causing significant tissue destruction, occurs in both sexes and is extremely refractory to treatment in the majority of patients. The outcome in mild and moderate disease is better.},

Infectious causes should be ruled out before other disease is assumed to be present. No single test is sufficient to diagnose ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Laboratory testing, histologic assessment, endoscopy, radiology, and bowel studies are often necessary in differential diagnosis. Because of the systemic nature of colitis, manifestations in the musculoskeletal, ocular, dermatologic, hepatobiliary, and other systems may occur and provide clues. Treatment depends on the type and severity of disease. Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), sulfa-free 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds, and corticosteroids are mainstays of treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Supportive care and judicious use of antimicrobial therapy are usually effective in colitis due to bacterial, parasitic, and sexually transmitted infections and are useful for symptoms caused by colonic ischemia and vasculitis. Colitis resulting from radiation therapy may present several years after the procedure and can be difficult to diagnose and treat. In many cases of inflammatory colon disease, especially chronic conditions, consultation with a gastroenterologist is highly recommended.},

DESIGN: We studied dietary habits immediately prior to the onset of disease in 104 patients enrolled in a prospective, epidemiological study of the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Italy. METHODS: Each patient was interviewed using a recall questionnaire to provide information on the daily intake of nutrients. The differences in diet between patients and healthy subjects matched for age, sex and city of residence were determined. RESULTS: Our data confirm that patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have a high intake of total carbohydrate, starch and refined sugar. This resulted in a significantly higher relative risk (P < 0.001) in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. Total protein intake was significantly higher in ulcerative colitis, but not in Crohn's disease patients, than in controls. Fibre consumption did not differ between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that carbohydrate consumption is significantly higher in IBD patients than in healthy controls. Ulcerative colitis patients also consumed more total protein than controls. The pathogenetic significance of these findings, however, remains unclear.},

Metabolic complications can occur in patients with longterm HPN. In patients with non-malignant diseases, probability of survival at 5 years is about 65%. Quality of life is considered very good in about 60% of these cases. Prognosis of cancer patients is very limited.},

   abstract = {A retrospective survey was performed in 1994, involving 496 adult home parenteral nutrition (HPN) cases, newly enrolled in the year 1993 from 13 European countries from 75 centres. From the 8 countries having registered more than 80% of cases (423 patients), incidence and prevalence ranged from 0.2 to 4.6 and 0.3 to 12.2 patients/10(6) population/year. In the patients studied, the diagnosis was cancer (42%), Crohn's disease (15%), vascular diseases (13%), radiation enteritis (8%), AIDS (4%) and other nonmalignant non-AIDS diseases (18%). Short bowel syndrome and intestinal obstruction were the two major indications for HPN in 31% and 22%, respectively. Seventy-three percent of the centres had a nutrition team. HPN was administered through a tunnelled venous central catheter in 73%, cyclical nocturnal infusions were used in 90% of patients, and intravenous feeding was the sole source of nutrition in 33%. Only 44% undertook HPN unaided. The present report indicates that cancer has now become the main indication for HPN in Europe; there was, however, a heterogeneous distribution of diseases amongst the reporting countries. The observed 9 (6-12)-month probability of survival was poor in AIDS (n = 8; 12%) and cancer patients (n = 78; 29%) but better for the other HPN indications (n = 115; 92%).},

   abstract = {In pediatric Crohn's disease (CD), resection of gut lesions is necessary to remove stenoses and when frequent relapses occur despite nutritional support and medical treatment. After surgery, improved nutritional status and accelerated growth usually follow increased nutritional intake and lower doses of steroids. The aim of this study was to compare energy balance before and after surgery while nutritional intake and steroid therapy were unchanged. Eleven patients, aged 14.5 +/- 2.5 years and with mildly active CD, were explored 1 week before and 1 month after gut resection for stenosis (n = 7) and medical treatment failure (n = 4). Eleven matched children participated in the study as controls. Disease activity was assessed by the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index and serum orosomucoid concentration. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured by indirect calorimetry, and fat-free body mass (FFM) was measured by anthropometry. The patients' mean REE decreased from 46.6 +/- 10.5 kcal/kg FFM/day before surgery to 42.6 +/- 10.3 kcal/kg FFM/day after surgery, while the controls' mean REE was 39 +/- 7 kcal/kg FFM/day (analysis of variance, p = 0.02). After surgery, body weights were not significantly different, but the mean protein oxidation rate was reduced and arm muscle area was increased. Changes in REE per kilogram of FFM per day were not correlated with changes in orosomucoid serum concentrations (r2 = 0.35; p = 0.4). In conclusion, in children with mildly active CD, while nutritional intake and steroid therapy were maintained at preoperative levels, a significant decrease in REE and improved nitrogen utilisation were observed 1 month after resection of the CD gut lesion. This finding suggests better use of energy substrates when CD lesions are removed.},

   abstract = {The mechanism of anorexia in inflammatory bowel disease is poorly understood. To gain insight into possible pathophysiologic mechanisms, the feeding indices and food intake were studied in an animal model of Crohn's disease. The anorexia of indomethacin-induced ulcerative ileitis was compared with that of the well-known anorexia of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Forty-five female Lewis rats were randomized to four groups: Control, Indomethacin, Indomethacin + TPN, and TPN. Feeding indices and food intake were continuously measured using the Automated Computerized Rat Eater Meter. Interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) were assayed in plasma, mononuclear cell culture, or ileum to determine their role in mediating anorexia. In the TPN group, spontaneous food intake (SFI) decreased (52%; p < 0.05), primarily via reduction in meal number (MN, 54%; p < 0.05) and, to a lesser extent, meal size (MZ, 35%; p < 0.05). In comparison, in the Indomethacin group SFI decreased (74%; p < 0.05) primarily via reduction in MZ (67%, p < 0.05); MN also decreased but to a lesser extent (27%; p < 0.05). In the Indomethacin + TPN group, SFI decreased (55%; p > 0.05) primarily via reduction in MN (79%; p < 0.05), whereas MZ decreased slightly (19%; p < 0.05). Only in the Indomethacin group were IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha detected in the mononuclear cell culture and plasma, respectively. In the Indomethacin group, an inverse correlation existed between MZ and TNF-alpha (p < 0.05). In the Indomethacin group, IL-1 alpha, PGE2, and LTB4 concentrations did not correlate with feeding indices. SFI reduction in this model was mediated primarily via a decrease in MZ. TNF-alpha is proposed to mediate this effect and TPN was shown to overcome the effect on MZ.},

The study was undertaken in December. The nutritional status (height-weight index) was similar in both groups. The dietary vitamin D intake was as low in patient with CD (1.0 microgram/d; 0.5-1.3) as in the controls (1.1; 0.4-1.6) whereas the recommended daily intake is 5 micrograms/d. Vitamin D intake correlated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels in patients with low 25-OHD levels (tau = 0.45, p = 0.04). Bone mineral content (BMC)-measured by single photon absorptiometry on the radius- was decreased in 9 patients (31%) with CD. Patients with CD tended to have a lower sun exposure in summer (p = 0.10), which also correlated with BMC (p = 0.03). Hence, a specific diet with a high vitamin D content, or vitamin D supplementation is recommended in patients with CD to overcome the negative effects of low sun exposure on bone mineral density.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liquid diets given enterally combined with "bowel rest' are efficacious in the treatment of active Crohn's disease, but rapid recrudescence of gastrointestinal symptoms after resumption of a normal diet is common. AIMS: This study examined whether continuation of enteral nutrition as a nocturnal supplement to an ad libitum daytime intake of a normal diet increased the length of remission of Crohn's disease in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children and adolescents with active Crohn's disease treated successfully with exclusive enteral nutrition were classified retrospectively according to whether they continued supplementary enteral nutrition or not. Time to relapse and linear growth were compared between the two cohorts. RESULTS: Between January 1986 and December 1992, 65 patients aged 7-17 years (mean (SD) 13.6 (2.1) years) (36 males, 29 females) with Crohn's disease in exacerbation were treated for > or = four weeks by bowel rest and nasogastric tube feeding of an oligopeptide or amino acid based formula. At first follow up visit, remission (fall in Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index, PCDAI to < or = 20) was achieved in 47 of 65 (72%) patients. Subsequently, 20 of these 47 (43%) relapsed by six months and 28 of 47 (60%) by 12 months. Patients who continued nasogastric supplementary feeding (n = 28) after resumption of an otherwise normal diet remained well longer than those who discontinued nocturnal supplements completely (n = 19) (p < 0.02). Furthermore, continued use of nasogastric supplements before completion of puberty was associated with improved linear growth. CONCLUSION: After successful treatment of active Crohn's disease by exclusive enteral nutrition, supplementary enteral nutrition without restriction of normal diet is associated with prolongation of remission and improved linear growth in children and adolescents.},

   abstract = {The value of intense nutritional support in inflammatory bowel disease is still debated. Claims have been made that total enteral nutrition is as effective as total parental nutrition. In this review, the use of parenteral and enteral nutritional support as primary therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease has been critically evaluated. Most studies have been uncontrolled and nonrandomized with short-term follow-up. The literature does suggest, however, that intense nutritional support may have an adjunctive role to drug therapy in achieving remission in Crohn's disease, especially in corticosteroid-refractory patients. Nutritional support has a lesser role in chronic ulcerative colitis, except for assistance in pre- and postoperative management. The data do not support one variety of nutritional support over another, although enteral support should be used if possible, as it is less costly and potentially less complicated.},
