   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. The etiology of IBS is still unclear and the relationship between foods and IBS is controversial; psychological factors have always been considered as a major cause of IBS and we recently showed a possible association via anxiety and depression between IBS and food allergy (FA). The aim of the present study was to confirm our preliminary observation. METHODOLOGY: Sixty-high IBS, 44 FA, 48 non-healthy controls with lactose intolerance (LI) and 52 healthy controls were considered for the study. All the subjects were given the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Zung depression scale. RESULTS: The percentage of subjects with high levels of state anxiety, trait anxiety and depression was significantly higher in IBS than in both LI and healthy controls; psychological findings in patients with FA were very similar to those of IBS. There were higher levels of state anxiety in LI compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: A higher prevalence of state anxiety found in patients complaining of bowel symptoms could be linked to the presence of chronic ill status. The higher presence of trait anxiety and depression in IBS and FA patients could be responsible for an increase in the activity of the autonomic nervous system and could provoke motility alterations through mast cell mediator release as well as enhancing release due to allergen crosslinking with IgE at the mast cell surface. However, it is debatable whether psychological findings are characteristic of all IBS or FA patients, or just represent the subset that see physicians.},

Analysis showed that more people got involved in stress reducing (watching TV, listening to the radio and visiting) and spiritual activities (prayers and reading Kotan) during this month. They drank less caffeine-containing beverages and smoked less. Food intake appeared to improve during Ramadan with higher proportions eating foods from all food groups. The amount of foods did not differ significantly except in the case of foods from the cereal, meat and vegetable groups. Even though less, cereal consumption was still in the adequate range. Change in weight was variable. Weight loss was significantly more among the sick. A large proportion of the latter improved during the month especially those with irritable bowel syndrome and constipation. Reduced activity, study desire and concentration ability were reported by more than 50% of subjects.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the action of pinaverium bromide a calcium channel blocker acting selectively on the gastrointestinal tract on basal and post-prandial recto-anal motility of 40 irritable bowel syndrome patients in a random, double blind and placebo controlled trial. METHODS: Pinaverium bromide (50 mg) or placebo was taken orally t.i.d. with food. Myoelectrical and mechanical activities of the rectum and the internal anal sphincter were recorded before treatment for 2 h in the fasting state and for an additional 2 h post-prandial. RESULTS: Post-prandial rectal spike amplitude and frequency as well as the spontaneous recto-anal inhibitory reflex frequency decreased after pinaverium bromide (P < 0.01) but not after placebo. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the calcium channel blockers acting selectively on the gastrointestinal tract may have a therapeutic role in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.},

This study describes a new method to measure it, based on the progress of radio-opaque markers, and shows the results in healthy subjects and in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Thirty healthy subjects and 43 patients suffering from IBS were studied. Two studies of colonic transit time (CTT), at rest and after eating a standard test meal, were performed. CRF was quantified by calculating the variation in number of markers in each zone of interest of the large bowel using X-ray films of the abdomen taken before and after eating. The results were as follows: (1) CRF is characterised by caudal propulsion of the colonic contents in the two groups. In controls, there is emptying of the cecum-ascending colon region and filling of the distal large bowel. In IBS patients, only emptying of the left transverse colon and the splenic flexure is found. (2) IBS patients have a delayed CTT because of slowing in the right and left colon, and this is both before and after a meal. The determination of the movements of markers after eating is a simple method that is useful in clinical practice to evaluate CRF.},

It is the most common gastrointestinal complaint seen in primary practice and accounts for 50% of referrals to gastroenterologists. Although the pathology of the disease currently is unclear, the diagnosis is not one of exclusion. When confronting this clinical syndrome of abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and changes in bowel habits, the clinician is called upon to balance the need to rule out organic causes with the expense and risk of testing. Optimally, the clinician can use established guidelines that clarify the most efficient approach to diagnosing and treating IBS, while providing the patient with the reassurance and education needed to deal with this chronic disease. This article deals with the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The pathophysiology underlying chronic constipation in older people is poorly understood. Our objective was to determine if functional bowel disease (particularly constipation) in this population is associated with risk factors (age, immobility, low dietary fiber intake, and medication use) or directly with slow colonic transit. METHODS: A previously validated questionnaire was administered to a random sample of older residents (age range 65-104 years, n = 1609) of Olmsted County, MN. A random subset who met standard diagnostic criteria for functional constipation (n = 52) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (n = 55) and a group without gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 93) were selected for further study. Each subject underwent structured interview and physical examination. Total caloric and fiber intake were assessed by dietitian interview, a food frequency questionnaire, and a food diary. Physical activity was assessed using a previously validated instrument. Medication use was determined by self-report, physician interview, and review of medical records. Total and segmental colonic transit was assessed radiographically using radioopaque markers. RESULTS: Total colonic transit times were prolonged in subjects with functional constipation (median 50.4 hours) but not in subjects with IBS (median 34.2 hours) or in healthy controls (median 28.8 hours); however, only rectosigmoid transit was delayed significantly. Age, gender, physical activity, and dietary fiber intake were not associated with total transit times, nor could they discriminate among the three patient groups. Laxative use was associated with prolonged total transit times independent of patient group. CONCLUSIONS: Older subjects can be classified by abdominal pain and bowel symptoms, which reflect colonic transit times. Older subjects with constipation symptoms generally have prolonged rectosigmoid transit. Other potential risk factors do not distinguish symptom subgroups, nor are they associated with altered colonic transit although older people who use laxatives regularly have prolonged colonic transit.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We investigated the possibility that a variant of the normal colonic flora, a high concentration of methanogens, influences the host's response to ingestion of nonabsorbable, fermentable materials. METHODS: To better evaluate symptomatic and breath H2 and methane (CH4) responses, subjects were placed on a basal diet (primarily rice and hamburger) that contained minimal amounts of nonabsorbable, fermentable substrate. A breath CH4/H2 ratio of greater or less than 1 on the second day of the basal diet was used to categorize subjects as high (N = 9) or low (N = 25) CH4 producers. After stabilization of the breath gas excretion (day 3 or 4 on the basal diet), the subjects ingested either sorbitol (8.8 g) or oat fiber (10.2 g). RESULTS: The low CH4 producers had a significantly higher (p < 0.05) breath H2 concentration than the high producers on the basal diet and after ingestion of sorbitol (27.1 +/- 2.7 ppm vs 15.8 +/- 3.6 ppm) or oat fiber (13.1 +/- 0.08 ppm vs 9.6 +/- 1.2 ppm). Low producers of methane reported significantly increased bloating and cramping after sorbitol ingestion and increased bloating after fiber ingestion, whereas high CH4 producers reported no significant increase in these symptoms. CONCLUSION: The presence of a methanogenic flora is associated with a reduced symptomatic response to ingestion of nonabsorbable, fermentable material in healthy subjects. Manipulation of the normal flora could be of therapeutic value in nonmethanogenic patients with irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cause of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is unknown. It may follow gastroenteritis and be associated with an abnormal gut flora and with food intolerance. Our study was designed to assess whether these factors were associated with colonic malfermentation. METHODS: We carried out a crossover controlled trial of a standard diet and an exclusion diet matched for macronutrients in six female IBS patients and six female controls. During the final 72 h on each diet, faecal excretion of fat, nitrogen, starch, and non-starch polysaccharide NSP was measured, and total excretion of hydrogen and methane collected over 24 h in a purpose-built 1.4 m3 whole-body calorimeter. Breath hydrogen and methane excretion were then measured for 3 h after 20 g oral lactulose. FINDINGS: The maximum rate of gas excretion was significantly greater in patients than in controls (2.4 mL/min IQR 1.7-2.6 vs 0.6, 0.4-1.1). Although total gas production in patients was not greater than in controls (median 527 mL/24 h IQR 387-660 vs 412, 234-507), hydrogen production was higher (332, 318-478 vs 162, 126-217, p=0.009). In patients, the exclusion diet reduced symptoms and produced a fall in maximum gas excretion (0.5 mL/min IQR 0.3-0.7). After lactulose, breath hydrogen was greater on the standard than on the exclusion diet. INTERPRETATION: Colonic-gas production, particularly of hydrogen, is greater in patients with IBS than in controls, and both symptoms and gas production are reduced by an exclusion diet. This reduction may be associated with alterations in the activity of hydrogen-consuming bacteria. Fermentation may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of IBS.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with IBS that can respond well to an exclusion diet with/without oral disodium cromoglycate and to document the effects of this combination. We selected 120 ambulatory patients with diarrhoeic type IBS; 66 of them (55%) had a concomitant food intolerance (assessed by skin prick test), showing a positive reaction to one (32%) or more foods (68%). Sixty-three (52.5%) tested by cytotoxic test showed more positive reactions. The results were evaluated by means of semiquantitative subjective and objective scores. Thirty patients were randomly treated with a strict exclusion diet, while the other 36 were treated with both exclusion diet and oral disodium cromoglycate (250 mg four times daily) for four months. We observed an improvement of symptoms in 18 (60%) of the 30 patients that had received the only exclusion diet, whereas thirty-two of 36 patients (89%) who had undergone both dietary and cromoglycate treatments showed an improvement that was clinically and statistically significant (p = 0.01).Thus it is concluded that dietary exclusion in association with disodium cromoglycate is most effective in carefully selected patients with diarrhoeic type IBS, with a very high probability of prolonged symptomatic benefit in those subjects that do respond.},

This appears to be a possible explanation for the adverse effects of bran on hospital patients with this disorder, but we do not yet know how this product affects community IBS sufferers. We cannot ignore the fact that fiber and bran have major beneficial effects in other areas, not least in the reduction of colonic carcinoma. In conclusion, it is probably best to recommend that patients with IBS be left to judge for themselves whether bran helps or exacerbates their symptoms, but there is enough evidence to suggest that the current dogma of routinely treating all IBS sufferers with bran should be challenged. Proprietary sources of fiber, such as ispaghula, may be more appropriate for those IBS subjects (for example, constipated) for whom fiber supplementation is believed justified.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To measure the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms six months after bacterial gastroenteritis and determine risk factors and associations with postdysenteric symptoms. DESIGN: Postal questionnaire. SETTING: Nottingham Health Authority. SUBJECTS: 544 people with microbiologically confirmed bacterial gastroenteritis between July 1994 and December 1994. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and relative risks for development of the irritable bowel syndrome and self reported altered bowel habit. RESULTS: A quarter of subjects reported persistence of altered bowel habit six months after an episode of infective gastroenteritis. Increasing duration of diarrhoea, younger age, and female sex increased this risk, whereas vomiting as part of the illness reduced the risk. One in 14 developed the irritable bowel syndrome with an increased risk seen in women (relative risk 3.4: 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 9.8) and with duration of diarrhoea (6.5; 1.3 to 34 for 15-21 days). CONCLUSIONS: Persistence of bowel symptoms commonly occurs after bacterial gastroenteritis and is responsible for considerable morbidity and health care costs.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We undertook to determine whether adverse food reactions play a role in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: A systematic review of the literature using Medline (1980-1996), targeting IBS and adverse food reactions, was performed. All clinical trials whereby dietary exclusion was followed by food challenge were selected. Each study was reviewed using a structured format to examine methodological issues and study outcomes. RESULTS: Of the seven studies included, the positive response to an elimination diet ranged from 15% to 71%; double-blind placebo-controlled challenges identified problem foods in 6% to 58% of cases. Milk, wheat, and eggs were most frequently identified to cause symptom exacerbation; of the foods identified the most common trait was a high salicylate content. Foods high in amines were also identified. Studies of diarrhea-predominant IBS identified a higher percentage of adverse food reactions. However, all studies had major limitations in their trial designs, including inadequate patient selection, appropriateness of--and duration of--exclusion diets, and methods of food challenge. CONCLUSION: Whether adverse reactions to foods are a key factor in exacerbating IBS symptoms or whether dietary manipulation is a valid treatment option is unclear. Carefully designed controlled clinical trials are now needed to specifically test the potential role of adverse food reactions in diarrhea-predominant IBS.},

Other diseases were excluded by physical examination, rectoscopy, blood tests and in patients older than 35 years X-ray of the colon or colonoscopy. The study was designed as a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The patients were randomized to either Appital or placebo. Following two weeks without medicine, the patient had Appital or placebo for eight weeks. Fifty-nine patients were randomized, 47 completed the study. The results were based on symptom scores registered by the patients. The symptom score was significantly reduced in patients treated with Appital (p = 0.002), but when compared to placebo, the difference was insignificant (p = 0.081). We concluded that Appital has no effect in relieving symptoms of IBS compared to placebo, although due to the possibility of type two error we cannot exclude a small, but hardly clinically relevant effect.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequently occurring, benign functional gastrointestinal disorder with a complex poorly understood pathology which appears to be multifactorial in nature. There is no association with structural or biochemical abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract. Functional variations in myoelectrical activity, visceral hypersensitivity and illness behaviours have all been observed in patients experimentally. In conjunction with environmental, psychological and alimentary factors, these mechanisms have been proposed as the major determinants of symptom genesis. Certainly, dietary factors are frequently perceived by sufferers as powerful symptom triggers, with many reporting multiple food intolerance. Physicians, however, remain divided upon the relevance of food to the disorder, with many eschewing a nutritional connection. This is unsurprising as, despite much experimental work to determine the clinical relevance of food intolerance and allergy to the aetiology of the disorder, the vast range of foodstuffs available for testing, inherent procedural problems with test foods, methodological insufficiencies and the continually evolving knowledge of the disorder, particularly the subgrouping of sufferers, have restricted the scientific validity of current findings. At the present time, it is difficult to make informed judgement upon the importance of food in IBS, and rigorously designed, large scale trials devised in the light of recent knowledge are required before conclusions can be drawn.},

   abstract = {Large intestinal disease, and more especially colitis, is a commonly seen problem in small animal practice. Although colitis is most frequently diagnosed in dogs, it is becoming increasing common in cats. The etiology of colitis is not known, but there is general agreement that an immune-mediated response to luminal antigen is involved. In particular, parasites, bacteria and dietary factors may be involved. In approximately 10% of dogs presented with typical signs of colitis, no pathologic lesion will be found on investigation. These dogs have a functional diarrhea associated with some stress factor and are thought to have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This condition is most frequently observed in working dogs, although highly nervous and excitable dogs may also exhibit similar clinical signs. Until the underlying etiology of colitis is determined, treatment regimens will remain symptomatic. Recent studies have placed considerable importance on the value of diet in the prevention, immediate and long-term therapy of colitis in dogs and cats. In particular the value of "novel" protein diets, fermentable fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids is receiving the most attention. It is now possible to maintain patients in long-term remission and to modify the severity and chronicity of colitis by using diet alone. This paper will review the subject of dietary management of colitis and IBS and present results from the author's clinical research program.},

Daily ingestion of less than 240 mL of milk is well tolerated by most lactose-intolerant adults. Some persons with normal lactase activity may become symptomatic on consumption of products containing lactose. Lactose maldigestion may coexist in adults with irritable bowel syndrome and in children with recurrent abdominal pain. Management consists primarily of dietary changes. People who avoid dairy products should receive calcium supplementation and should be advised to read ingredient labels carefully. Several lactase replacement products are available, but their efficacy varies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The production of free radicals is increased in inflammatory bowel disease, and trace elements are crucial components of several antioxidants. Trace elements deficiency may therefore compromise the defense against oxidative damage. The aims of this study were to measure plasma and tissue concentration of trace elements and antioxidants and to relate this to disease activity. METHODS: A 10-ml blood sample and six colonic biopsy specimens were obtained from 24 patients with either active ulcerative colitis or in remission and 10 patients with irritable bowel syndrome for measurement of trace elements and trace element-dependent enzymes. RESULTS: Patients with moderately active disease had significantly lower plasma iron, selenium, and glutathione peroxidase levels than patients in remission and controls, whereas no significant differences were found between the zinc and copper values of patients and controls. Mucosal concentrations of zinc and metallothionein were reduced, whereas iron and glutathione peroxidase concentrations were increased in patients with endoscopically active disease as compared with controls and patients in remission. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ulcerative colitis have altered plasma and tissue levels of trace elements and antioxidant-related enzymes. The resulting reduced protection against free radicals may contribute to the inflammatory process.},

Questions related to probiotic origin, survivability, and adherence are all important considerations for further study. More important, each probiotic proposed must be studied individually and extensively to determine its efficacy and safety in each disorder for which its use may be considered.},

   abstract = {It has been suggested that the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be wrongly attributed to lactose intolerance. We examined the relations among IBS, demographic factors, living habits, and lactose intolerance. On the basis of a lactose tolerance test with ethanol, 101 of the 427 healthy subjects studied were lactose maldigesters and 326 were lactose digesters. IBS was diagnosed by means of the Bowel Disease Questionnaire, according to the Rome criteria. The use of dairy products and symptoms experienced after their consumption were recorded. IBS was found in 15% of both the lactose maldigesters and lactose digesters. One-third of the subjects reported intolerance to dairy products containing < or = 20 g lactose. About half of this third were lactose maldigesters and about half were lactose digesters. As explanations for this subjective lactose intolerance, the logistic regression model estimated lactose maldigestion (odds ratio: 10.3; 95% CI: 5.2, 20.4), IBS (4.6; 2.1, 10.1), experience of symptoms other than gastrointestinal ones (2.3; 1.2, 4.5), and female sex (2.1; 1.1, 4.0). Characteristics common to both subjective lactose intolerance and IBS were female sex and the experience of abdominal pain in childhood (P < 0.01). Age, regularity of meals, and the amount of physical activity were not associated with either subjective lactose intolerance or IBS. Of the subjects with IBS, the percentage of lactose maldigesters was the same as in the whole study group (24%) but the number who reported lactose intolerance was higher (60% compared with 27%, P < 0.001). We showed a strong relation among subjective lactose intolerance, IBS, the experience of abdominal pain in childhood, and female sex.},
