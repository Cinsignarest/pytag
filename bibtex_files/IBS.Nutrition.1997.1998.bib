   abstract = {A cross-sectional study was carried out to explore the effect of the Ramadan fast on daily practices (life events, diet and smoking), health and performance of 265 university students. Analysis showed that more people got involved in stress reducing (watching TV, listening to the radio and visiting) and spiritual activities (prayers and reading Kotan) during this month. They drank less caffeine-containing beverages and smoked less. Food intake appeared to improve during Ramadan with higher proportions eating foods from all food groups. The amount of foods did not differ significantly except in the case of foods from the cereal, meat and vegetable groups. Even though less, cereal consumption was still in the adequate range. Change in weight was variable. Weight loss was significantly more among the sick. A large proportion of the latter improved during the month especially those with irritable bowel syndrome and constipation. Reduced activity, study desire and concentration ability were reported by more than 50% of subjects.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome is frequently encountered in clinical practice, and it has been repeatedly suggested that abnormal colonic motor activity is one of the major pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the origin of symptoms in such disorder. If this statement is true, then high-amplitude propagated colonic contractions (HAPCs), i.e. the mass movements, may play an important role. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an investigation by recording colonic motility for a prolonged (24 h) period in 25 patients with irritable bowel syndrome and in 18 healthy volunteers, to compare the number of mass movements over 24 h in patients (constipation-predominant, alternating bowel habits) and controls. The overall amount of motility was also assessed in twelve patients and 13 controls. We also looked for the possible changes in mass movements and motility which may occur with defecation and after a meal. The results showed that 1) with respect to HAPCs and motility index, neither group was significantly different from controls; 2) HAPCs and the motility index were significantly reduced during sleep in all groups tested; 3) HAPCs were significantly more common before as compared to after defecation and after as compared to before meals; 4) HAPCs are not independent from the segmental contractile activity; 5) the motility index/24 h was lower in the constipation-predominant group of patients with respect to controls. We conclude that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome colonic motility per se may play a pathophysiological role in the genesis of the symptoms, although other mechanisms are likely to concur, or to be responsible for the complaints of these patients. However, colonic prolonged recordings are very useful for studying physiological and pathophysiological correlates of sleep, eating, and defecation.},

   abstract = {Lactose malabsorption is characterized by a deficiency of mucosal lactase. As a consequence, lactose reaches the colon where it is broken down by bacteria to short-chain fatty acids, CO2, and H2. Bloating, cramps, osmotic diarrhea, and other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are the consequence and can be seen in about 50% of lactose malabsorbers. Having made the observation that females with lactose malabsorption not only showed signs of irritable bowel syndrome but also signs of premenstrual syndrome and mental depression, it was of interest to establish whether a statistical correlation existed between lactose malabsorption and mental depression. Thirty female volunteers were analyzed by measuring breath H2 concentrations after an oral dose of 50 g lactose and were classified as normals or lactose malabsorbers according to their breath H2 concentrations. All patients filled out a Beck's depression inventory questionnaire. Of the 30 female volunteers, six were lactose intolerant (20%) and 24 were normal lactose absorbers (80%). Subjects with lactose malabsorption showed a significantly higher score in the Beck's depression inventory than normal lactose absorbers did. The data thus suggest that lactose malabsorption may play a role in the development of mental depression. In lactose malabsorption high intestinal lactose concentrations may interfere with L-tryptophan metabolism and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) availability. Lactose malabsorption should be considered in patients with signs of mental depression.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Monitoring of intraluminal pressure in standardized enteroclysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pressure monitoring with a double-lumen tube during fluoroscopy-guided adjustment of contrast media instillation rate due to small bowel motility and contrast media transport of 67 patients. Stratification according to patient data and findings in enteroclysis: Crohn's disease (n = 12), non-inflammatory disease (n = 35) and irritable bowel syndrome (n = 20). RESULTS: The amount, instillation period and rate of contrast media and distension media were not statistically different within the study population. Crohn's disease patients showed elevated intraluminal pressure at the end of the distension phase (47.94 +/- 10.42 cm H2O versus 38.03 +/- 10.08 and 39.55 +/- 9.74 cm H2O, respectively, P = 0.0099), as well as at the end of the examination (48.59 +/- 10.42 cm H2O versus 39.66 +/- 6.52 and 35.67 +/- 8.28 cm H2O, P = 0.0002). In comparison with both other patient groups, maximum intraluminal pressure in Crohn's disease is higher and totals 51.75 +/- 9.94 cm H2O versus 43.00 +/- 6.20 and 39.55 +/- 9.74 cm H2O, P = 0.0010. Patients with Crohn's disease require a longer instillation period of distension media (28.05 +/- 12.82 min, not statistically significant). CONCLUSION: Intraluminal pressure differs in standardized enteroclysis with fluoroscopy-guided instillation rate adjustment. Irrespective of stenosis or acute inflammation, patients with Crohn's disease show a higher intraluminal pressure compared to patients with non-inflammatory disease or irritable bowel syndrome.},

This appears to be a possible explanation for the adverse effects of bran on hospital patients with this disorder, but we do not yet know how this product affects community IBS sufferers. We cannot ignore the fact that fiber and bran have major beneficial effects in other areas, not least in the reduction of colonic carcinoma. In conclusion, it is probably best to recommend that patients with IBS be left to judge for themselves whether bran helps or exacerbates their symptoms, but there is enough evidence to suggest that the current dogma of routinely treating all IBS sufferers with bran should be challenged. Proprietary sources of fiber, such as ispaghula, may be more appropriate for those IBS subjects (for example, constipated) for whom fiber supplementation is believed justified.},

Current evidence suggests the presence of at least two subgroups: patients who respond to a prolonged course of acid suppression and patients who show a significant overlap of symptoms with other functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. An enhanced sensitivity of visceral afferent pathways with or without associated autonomic dysregulation appears to play an important role in the aetiology of symptoms in the second group. In the absence of visceral hypersensitivity, neither the slowing of gastric emptying nor the presence of chronic gastritis appears to be sufficient to cause symptoms of functional dyspepsia. The mechanisms and aetiology of visceral hypersensitivity are incompletely understood. An alteration in the interplay between vagal and spinal afferents, and the inadequate activation of antinociceptive systems in response to tissue irritation, may play a role in symptom generation.},

There is no association with structural or biochemical abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract. Functional variations in myoelectrical activity, visceral hypersensitivity and illness behaviours have all been observed in patients experimentally. In conjunction with environmental, psychological and alimentary factors, these mechanisms have been proposed as the major determinants of symptom genesis. Certainly, dietary factors are frequently perceived by sufferers as powerful symptom triggers, with many reporting multiple food intolerance. Physicians, however, remain divided upon the relevance of food to the disorder, with many eschewing a nutritional connection. This is unsurprising as, despite much experimental work to determine the clinical relevance of food intolerance and allergy to the aetiology of the disorder, the vast range of foodstuffs available for testing, inherent procedural problems with test foods, methodological insufficiencies and the continually evolving knowledge of the disorder, particularly the subgrouping of sufferers, have restricted the scientific validity of current findings. At the present time, it is difficult to make informed judgement upon the importance of food in IBS, and rigorously designed, large scale trials devised in the light of recent knowledge are required before conclusions can be drawn.},

   abstract = {Large intestinal disease, and more especially colitis, is a commonly seen problem in small animal practice. Although colitis is most frequently diagnosed in dogs, it is becoming increasing common in cats. The etiology of colitis is not known, but there is general agreement that an immune-mediated response to luminal antigen is involved. In particular, parasites, bacteria and dietary factors may be involved. In approximately 10% of dogs presented with typical signs of colitis, no pathologic lesion will be found on investigation. These dogs have a functional diarrhea associated with some stress factor and are thought to have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This condition is most frequently observed in working dogs, although highly nervous and excitable dogs may also exhibit similar clinical signs. Until the underlying etiology of colitis is determined, treatment regimens will remain symptomatic. Recent studies have placed considerable importance on the value of diet in the prevention, immediate and long-term therapy of colitis in dogs and cats. In particular the value of "novel" protein diets, fermentable fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids is receiving the most attention. It is now possible to maintain patients in long-term remission and to modify the severity and chronicity of colitis by using diet alone. This paper will review the subject of dietary management of colitis and IBS and present results from the author's clinical research program.},

Questions related to probiotic origin, survivability, and adherence are all important considerations for further study.

We examined the relations among IBS, demographic factors, living habits, and lactose intolerance. On the basis of a lactose tolerance test with ethanol, 101 of the 427 healthy subjects studied were lactose maldigesters and 326 were lactose digesters. IBS was diagnosed by means of the Bowel Disease Questionnaire, according to the Rome criteria. The use of dairy products and symptoms experienced after their consumption were recorded. IBS was found in 15% of both the lactose maldigesters and lactose digesters. One-third of the subjects reported intolerance to dairy products containing < or = 20 g lactose. About half of this third were lactose maldigesters and about half were lactose digesters. As explanations for this subjective lactose intolerance, the logistic regression model estimated lactose maldigestion (odds ratio: 10.3; 95% CI: 5.2, 20.4), IBS (4.6; 2.1, 10.1), experience of symptoms other than gastrointestinal ones (2.3; 1.2, 4.5), and female sex (2.1; 1.1, 4.0). Characteristics common to both subjective lactose intolerance and IBS were female sex and the experience of abdominal pain in childhood (P < 0.01). Age, regularity of meals, and the amount of physical activity were not associated with either subjective lactose intolerance or IBS. Of the subjects with IBS, the percentage of lactose maldigesters was the same as in the whole study group (24%) but the number who reported lactose intolerance was higher (60% compared with 27%, P < 0.001). We showed a strong relation among subjective lactose intolerance, IBS, the experience of abdominal pain in childhood, and female sex.},

Our aim was to define how psyllium modified the whole-gut transit of a radiolabeled lactulose-containing test meal by using gamma scintigraphy. Eight subjects participated in a randomized crossover study comparing gastric emptying and small bowel and colonic transit after consumption of 20 mL lactulose three times daily with or without 3.5 g psyllium three times daily. Psyllium significantly delayed gastric emptying: the time to 50% emptying increased from a control value of 69 +/- 9 to 87 +/- 11 min (mean +/- SEM; P < 0.05, n = 8). Small bowel transit was unaltered. However, progression through the colon was delayed with an increase in the percentage of the dose at 24 h in the ascending (control group: 2 +/- 3%, psyllium group: 11 +/- 8%; P < 0.02) and transverse colon (control group: 5 +/- 12%, psyllium group: 21 +/- 14%) with correspondingly less in the descending colon. Although the time for 50% of the isotope to reach the colon was not significantly different with psyllium, psyllium significantly delayed the rise in breath-hydrogen concentrations, which reached 50% of their peak at 217 +/- 34 min compared with control values of 155 +/- 27 min (P < 0.05). Psyllium delays gastric emptying, probably by increasing meal viscosity, and reduces the acceleration of colon transit, possibly by delaying the production of gaseous fermentation products.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) produces a high cost to society in terms of work loss, consultations, medical tests, treatments and even unnecessary surgeries. AIMS: To evaluate the use of medical resources by IBS patients in a tertiary hospital. METHODS: Retrospective study of medical records from patients with IBS younger than 60 years old. Number of clinical studies, consultations to all specialties and number of surgeries were analyzed. RESULTS: Between 1987 and 1996, 98 patients age (mean) 40.8 years, were identified. Follow-up time was 33.4 months (1-243), during a mean of 22.4 studies per patient (1-82) were solicited. Prior to IBS diagnosis, 5.0 studies per patient (I-II) were required. In 87% of the cases, IBS diagnosis was established during the first visit. Each patient consulted 3.6 times/year, 44.2% for gastrointestinal symptoms and 48.6% for non-gastrointestinal symptoms. The consultations with the most demand were internal medicine (53.0%), gastroenterology (38.8%), proctology (31.6%), psychiatry (21.4%), gynecology (18.4%) and urology (13.3%). Surgical history was found in 39%, 17.3% had appendectomy and 13.3% cholecystectomy, 1.02% and 2.04% respectively were done after IBS diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although the availability of the Rome criteria for the diagnosis of IBS, these patients require an excessive quantity of studies to eliminate the possibility of organic disease, and excessive number of annual medical consultations as well. IBS patients also have a high rate of appendectomies and cholecystectomies.},

   abstract = {The aims of this study were to determine whether increased pain sensitivity in patients with irritable bowel is due to physiological differences in perceptual sensitivity or psychological influences on perception, and whether prior sexual abuse accounts for increased pain sensitivity. Seventeen sexually abused and 15 nonabused women with irritable bowel were compared to 13 sexually abused and 14 nonabused women without irritable bowel. Among the nonabused subjects, the volume of rectal distension that produced moderate pain was lower in IBS patients than in controls, replicating earlier studies, but these thresholds were correlated with psychological measures of anxiety and somatization. The ability to discriminate between painful distensions (perceptual sensitivity) was not different between groups. Sexual abuse was not associated with lower pain thresholds. Thus, differences in pain sensitivity appear to be due to psychological influences on perception, but a history of sexual abuse does not contribute significantly to this pain sensitivity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Rectal pain sensitivity has been called a biological marker for irritable bowel syndrome, but this conclusion may be premature. This article is a critical review of the evidence for psychological influences on perception. METHODS: The world literature accessible through Index Medicus from 1973 to 1997 was systematically reviewed. RESULTS: Evidence favoring a biological basis for pain sensitivity is that two thirds of patients report pain at abnormally low thresholds of rectal distention despite normal somatic pain thresholds. Pain thresholds are not correlated with anxiety or depression. Evidence favoring psychological influences on perception is that patients with the irritable bowel syndrome rate even sham distentions as more painful, and when perception tests that minimize psychological influences are used, they have normal sensory thresholds. Also, stress alters sensory thresholds. Sensitization by repeated distention has been cited as evidence of a biological basis for hyperalgesia, but it is not unique to patients with irritable bowel. Brain imaging shows that different regions are activated by painful distention in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, but this is consistent with psychological influences on perception. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological factors influence pain thresholds in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome. Two cognitive traits, selective attention to gastrointestinal sensations and disease attribution, may account for increased pain sensitivity.},
