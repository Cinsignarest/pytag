Additional investigations are indicated in the case of diarrhoea which lasts longer than 2 weeks, especially if the patient is also severely unwell or has rectal bleeding; further investigations are also required if older patients experience the symptoms for the first time, if there is blood loss upon defecation, if unintentional weight loss occurs or if a mass is felt on the left side of the abdomen. Further investigations consist of a rectal examination, measurement of the sedimentation, haemoglobin concentration and leukocyte count, sigmoidoscopy and an X-ray of the colon. Treatment should aim to reduce unnecessary concern and avoidance behaviour, and to positively influence additional stress-inducing factors, nutrition and physical activity. Medication is not indicated except for laxatives if constipation plays an important role and if advice about nutrition and physical activity provide insufficient relief.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Psychological factors have been implicated in the aetiology of irritable bowel syndrome characterised by intestinal altered motility and visceral hypersensitivity. Similar disorders have been found in rats under stressful conditions. The role of tachykinins in bowel dysfunctions caused by stress is not fully documented. Therefore, we investigated the influence of stress on NK1 receptor activation at the colonic level in female rats. METHODS: The stress procedure used consisted of two hours of partial restraint. Histamine release was measured from colonic samples of control and stressed animals and the effect of SR140333, a NK1 receptor antagonist, on substance P induced histamine release was determined. Involvement of steroids has been evaluated in this response. RESULTS: NK1 receptor antagonist was found to inhibit substance P induced histamine release in samples from stressed female rats but not in samples from control animals. Previous treatment of female rats with RU 486 abolished this effect observed in stressed animals. Similarly, in samples from stressed female rats previously ovariectomised, SR140333 failed to inhibit substance P induced histamine release but previous treatment with both progesterone and oestrogen restored its effect. CONCLUSIONS: Stress induces NK1 receptor activation in the colon, and ovarian steroids are involved in this response.},

   abstract = {Stressful life events are frequently associated with outward signs of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Increasing evidence suggests that acute and chronic stress stimuli implicate different physiological mechanisms and neuroendocrine responses. Therefore, we investigated the influence of acute and chronic stress on visceral nociception in female rats and the involvement of colonic mast cells in this effect. The effect of acute and chronic partial restraint stress (PRS) on visceral sensitivity to rectal distension (RD) was assessed by abdominal muscle electromyography. Colonic mast cell activation was determined by measuring histamine release after in vitro stimulation with substance P (SP) in colonic samples from rats experiencing RD vs. controls. Acute PRS significantly enhanced abdominal response to RD compared with sham PRS for all volumes of distension. In contrast, chronic PRS induced a hyperalgesic response for the highest volumes of distension (0.8 and 1.2 mL), but did not affect the number of abdominal contractions for the lowest volume (0.4 mL) compared with controls. Both acute and chronic PRS increased in vitro SP-induced histamine release without affecting mast cell numbers. RD induced similar in vitro histamine release from colonic samples from both acute and chronic PRS rats; this release, however, was significantly higher than that measured in sham-PRS rats. Acute and chronic PRS differently influence visceral sensitivity in response to RD in female rats. This difference, however, cannot be attributed to a different effect of either stress paradigm on mast cell histamine release.},

   abstract = {The aim of this literature review is to produce guidelines for dietetic practice in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by evaluating the research available. In this area randomized control trials (RCT) only account for a small proportion of the literature and have been concentrated in the modification of dietary fibre in patients with IBS. The bulk of the literature is mainly observational trials from which no indisputable conclusions can be extracted. In this review, the evidence available has been interpreted within the context of the current knowledge base. Conclusions are drawn to facilitate the development of guidelines, enabling a starting point for discussion and an evaluation of current practice. The literature available on therapeutic dietary manipulation in IBS patients is centred around non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs), mono and disaccharide sensitivity and food intolerance. The production of these guidelines has focused on research examining the role of dietary components in the therapeutic management of patients with IBS. However, where there is a deficiency in the literature directly relating dietary intake to management of IBS patients, physiological function in relation to dietary components has been relied upon to produce practical guidelines which can be applied realistically in a clinical environment. An interpretation of the evidence has revealed a limited role for exclusion diets, a move away from high-fibre diets towards the manipulation of fibre fractions in the diet, an evaluation of the effects of caffeine on gut function and the necessity for individual dietary assessment to identify dietary issues pertinent to the patient's symptoms. These guidelines outline a positive role for dietitians in the treatment of IBS patients which draws on the unique skills possessed by dietitians regarding the assessment of habitual eating habits and therapeutic dietary manipulation.},

The aim of the study was to investigate fasting and postprandial distal colonic motility in the four groups of patients and to compare the results with normal controls. Distal colonic motility studies were performed in the unprepared colon. 2.5-hr recordings were made from four channels with a standard meal administered at 0.5 hr. The intubated colon was treated as a study segment and data analyzed for study segment activity index (SSAI) and number and mean amplitude of pressure peaks over 30-min epochs. Patients with SCS had significantly higher (P < 0.05) mean amplitude of pressure peaks (60 min, 120 min) and SSAI (120 min) than controls and patients with FD, DPSCS, and MGD. In contrast, patients with FD and DPSCS had significantly (P < 0.05) lower postprandial SSAI than controls and patients with SCS (60 min, 120 min). With the exception of raised postprandial mean amplitude of pressure peaks (120 min), MGD patients had normal distal colonic motility. Division of IBS patients into subgroups has highlighted significant differences in distal colonic motility that provide insights into etiopathogenesis and should assist targeting of current and newly developed therapies, particularly receptor active agents.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are two of the most frequent syndromes in gastroenterology. However, very few epidemiological studies have been conducted in Peru and none in the Peruvian Jungle. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome in a jungle community of Peru and the recurrence percentage of these syndromes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample was taken from 231 persons randomly selected using the "home by home" method, according to the map provided by Punta del Este Medical Center (city of Tarapoto - Department of San Mart n). The persons, considered to best typify the general population of the city, took two tests (Dyspepsia Test and Manning Test) that were previously validated during the months of January through March 1999. RESULTS: The prevalence of dyspepsia was 37.6%, and that of IBS, 22.0%. From those with dyspepsia, 38% had also IBS. From those with IBS, 65% reported dyspepsia symptoms. Prevalence of IBS was higher in individuals with dyspepsia (37.9%) than in individuals without dyspepsia (12.5% p< 0.01). The prevalence of both dyspepsia and IBS decreases as age increases. A statistically significant difference related to ethnicity was found in individuals with IBS. Dyspepsia and ethnicity were associated in 31.4% to individuals having both pathologies (p< 0.0001 and OR=4.28). The dyspepsia/IBS ratio was 1.7/1. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of IBS and dyspepsia in the study population. The high association found between both syndromes may be due to the common etiopathogenic mechanisms they share such as: a visceral hypersensibility due to peripheral or central mechanisms, bowel motility disturbances or parasitosis. Our study suggests that both dyspepsia and IBS are the manifestations of the same digestive disorder, which has not been fully clarified yet.},

Opiates, including morphine as well as compounds such as trimebutine or fedotozine designed for therapeutic use in irritable bowel syndrome, are effective in reducing visceral nociception. Cytokines in the CNS are known to be involved in the modulation of pain and there is also evidence to suggest that centrally acting cytokines may play a role in the production of visceral hypersensitivity. Consequently, they may provide an interesting target for future research.},

   abstract = {Probiotic ingestion can be recommended as a preventative approach to maintaining the balance of the intestinal microflora and thereby enhance 'well-being'. Research into the use of probiotic intervention in specific illnesses and disorders has identified certain patient populations that may benefit from the approach. Undoubtedly, probiotics will vary in their efficacy and it may not be the case that the same results occur with all species. Those that prove most efficient will likely be strains that are robust enough to survive the harsh physico-chemical conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract. This includes gastric acid, bile secretions and competition with the resident microflora. A survey of the literature indicates positive results in over fifty human trials, with prevention/treatment of infections the most frequently reported output. In theory, increased levels of probiotics may induce a 'barrier' influence against common pathogens. Mechanisms of effect are likely to include the excretion of acids (lactate, acetate), competition for nutrients and gut receptor sites, immunomodulation and the formation of specific antimicrobial agents. As such, persons susceptible to diarrhoeal infections may benefit greatly from probiotic intake. On a more chronic basis, it has been suggested that some probiotics can help maintain remission in the inflammatory conditions, ulcerative colitis and pouchitis. They have also been suggested to repress enzymes responsible for genotoxin formation. Moreover, studies have suggested that probiotics are as effective as anti-spasmodic drugs in the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome. The approach of modulating the gut flora for improved health has much relevance for the management of those with acute and chronic gut disorders. Other target groups could include those susceptible to nosocomial infections, as well as the elderly, who have an altered microflora, with a decreased number of beneficial microbial species. For the future, it is imperative that mechanistic interactions involved in probiotic supplementation be identified. Moreover, the survival issues associated with their establishment in the competitive gut ecosystem should be addressed. Here, the use of prebiotics in association with useful probiotics may be a worthwhile approach. A prebiotic is a dietary carbohydrate selectively metabolised by probiotics. Combinations of probiotics and prebiotics are known as synbiotics.},

Prebiotics are non-digestible foodstuffs (fiber, oligofructans - "colonic foods"), which enter the colon and are metabolized by the probiotics. Probiotics should fulfill the following criteria: Phenotypic and genotypic classification, no pathogenic properties, human origin, application in the living state, resistance to gastric acid and bile, ability to adhere to colonocytes, ability to colonize the gut, clinically proved favorable health-effect, and safety. Experimental and clinical studies supplied evidence of the possible use of probiotics in the following diseases: Traveler's diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, relapsing Clostridium difficile colitis, infantile diarrhea, rotavirus enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colon cancer, peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, and diarrhea associated with HIV infection. Probiotics displayed the following effects in these studies: Involvement in production of essential nutrients of the colonic mucosa, beneficial effect on intestinal immunity, recovery of the disturbed gut mucosal barrier and prevention of microbial translocation, elimination of toxins and eradication of microbial pathogens, production of steroids from cholesterol and reduction of its pool in circulation, participation in regulation of intestinal functions, reduced incidence of chemically induced colon tumors in rodents. Probiotics open new therapeutic modalities in a number of diseases and it may be expected that their importance will increase with growing knowledge and experience.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are "living microorganisms which upon ingestion in certain numbers exert health benefits beyond inherent general nutrition". Since 1987, when the first publication on the properties of the Lactobacillus GG was done, overall, there have been over 200 publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals. This paper will report the status and the prospectus of probiotics research at the beginning of the Third Millennium. Probiotics have proven benefits in treatment and prevention of rotavirus diarrhoea in children and reduction of antibiotic-associated intestinal side-effects. Interesting results have recently been published regarding food allergies and atopic eczema in children. Prevention of vaginitis and of travellers' diarrhoea have also been reported. Promising results are being reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, dental caries and irritable bowel syndrome. It has also been suggested that probiotics could enhance oral vaccine administration, and that they may help treatment against Helicobacter pylori infection, but further studies are needed. Future areas of research regard probiotics' role in the process of carcinogenesis, given their influence on the gut microflora, and as immune modulators in autoimmune disorders. The possibility of introducing appropriate genes to the probiotics to make them produce various compounds is also under investigation. However, there is still confusion in the minds of the authorities over whether a probiotic is a drug, a food, or a dietary supplement. The challenge is to continue research to define the appropriate uses of probiotics and discover new applications which will bring benefit to humankind.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can be explained by the interrelation of cognitive components such as illness behavior, emotional such as depression and anxiety, behavioral such as environmental stressors, and physiologic such as pain modulation alterations. The stress symptom rating (SSR) scale is being used in physiologic studies in IBS, but differences between IBS patients and healthy controls in the basal condition is unknown. AIMS: To determine the basal differences in the SSR-Spanish between IBS patients and controls, and between IBS patients according to bowel-habit predominance. METHODS: Forty consecutive IBS-Roma 1 patients [M: 28 (78%), F:8(22.2%), 42.6 +/- 2.7 years] and 36 healthy volunteers paired by gender and age [M: 28 (78%), F:8 (22.2%); 36.7 +/- 2.1 years] were included. IBS were classified as constipation, diarrhea, or alternating. All completed the SSR prior to the medical visit. Mean group values of the different SSR parameters were compared by ANOVA. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Compared with controls, IBS patients reported higher anxiety (p = 0.005), attention (p = 0.04) fatigue (p = 0.04), and lower arousal (p = 0.003). There were no differences in stress and anger either in IBS patients according to bowel-habit predominance. CONCLUSIONS: Under basal conditions, there are differences in anxiety, weakness, attention, and arousal between IBS patients and controls that correspond to intrinsic characteristics of IBS independent of bowel-habit predominance. Higher anxiety is in agreement with psychological comorbidity, higher attention with hypervigilance, and fatigue and lower arousal with sleep disturbances known to be present in IBS. Absence of differences in stress and anger under basal conditions suggests that SSR-Spanish is a good instrument to evaluate response to stress during physiologic paradigms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fructose malabsorption is frequently seen in the general population and is characterised by the inability to absorb fructose efficiently. Due to fructose malabsorption, fructose reaches the colon where it is broken down by bacteria to short fatty acids, CO(2) and H(2). Bloating, cramps, osmotic diarrhea and other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are the consequence. We recently found that fructose malabsorption is associated with low plasma folic acid concentrations and low serum tryptophan and zinc. Because fructose malabsorption apparently is associated not only with malabsorption of other nutrients, but also with abdominal discomfort, it was of interest to examine whether mild pancreatitis may be involved. METHODS: We retrospectively examined our data in 159 otherwise healthy adults (110 females, 49 males) aged 14-84 years (mean 45.6+/-14.4 S.D.) with gastrointestinal complaints for serum amylase and serum lipase concentrations. The patients have been tested earlier for fructose malabsorption and lactose maldigestion by measuring breath H(2) concentrations after an oral dose of 25 g fructose and 50 g lactose, respectively, 1 week apart. RESULTS: Fructose malabsorption (H(2) concentrations > or =20 ppm over baseline values) was detected in 107 of 159 individuals (67.3%). These subjects with fructose malabsorption presented with significantly higher serum amylase concentrations (73.1 U/l+/-25.7 S.D.) compared to individuals with normal fructose absorption (59.6 U/l+17.9 S.D; p=0.0009). Fructose malabsorbers also presented with higher serum lipase concentrations (122.0 U/l+/-100.3 S.D.) compared to normals (89.5 U/l+/-46.5 S.D.; p<0.05). To determine whether this finding is a consequence of any sort of malabsorption syndrome or whether it is specific for fructose malabsorption, all subjects were screened for lactose maldigestion. Lactose maldigestion (H(2) concentrations>20 ppm over baseline after lactose loading) was found in 50 of 159 individuals (31.4%). There were no significant differences in either amylase or lipase concentrations in lactose maldigestors. CONCLUSION: Serum amylase and lipase concentrations are higher in subjects with fructose malabsorption compared to normals. Therefore, fructose malabsorption should be considered as a differential diagnosis in moderately elevated serum amylase.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fructose malabsorption is characterized by the inability to absorb fructose efficiently. As a consequence fructose reaches the colon where it is broken down by bacteria to short fatty acids, CO2, H2, CH4 and lactic acid. Bloating, cramps, osmotic diarrhea and other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are the consequence and can be seen in about 50% of fructose malabsorbers. Recently it was found that fructose malabsorption was associated with early signs of depressive disorders. Therefore, it was investigated whether fructose malabsorption is associated with abnormal tryptophan metabolism. METHODS: Fifty adults (16 men, 34 women) with gastrointestinal discomfort were analyzed by measuring breath hydrogen concentrations after an oral dose of 50 g fructose after an overnight fast. They were classified as normals or fructose malabsorbers according to their breath H2 concentrations. All patients filled out a Beck depression inventory questionnaire. Blood samples were taken for plasma tryptophan and kynurenine measurements. RESULTS: Fructose malabsorption (breath deltaH2 production >20 ppm) was detected in 35 of 50 individuals (70%). Subjects with fructose malabsorption showed significantly lower plasma tryptophan concentrations and significantly higher scores in the Beck depression inventory compared to those with normal fructose absorption. CONCLUSIONS: Fructose malabsorption is associated with lower tryptophan levels that may play a role in the development of depressive disorders. High intestinal fructose concentration seems to interfere with L-tryptophan metabolism, and it may reduce availability of tryptophan for the biosynthesis of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). Fructose malabsorption should be considered in patients with symptoms of depression and disturbances of tryptophan metabolism.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multi-factorial gastrointestinal condition affecting 8-22 % of the population with a higher prevalence in women and accounting for 20-50 % of referrals to gastroenterology clinics. It is characterised by abdominal pain, excessive flatus, variable bowel habit and abdominal bloating for which there is no evidence of detectable organic disease. Suggested aetiologies include gut motility and psychological disorders, psychophysiological phenomena and colonic malfermentation. The faecal microflora in IBS has been shown to be abnormal with higher numbers of facultative organisms and low numbers of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Although there is no evidence of food allergy in IBS, food intolerance has been identified and exclusion diets are beneficial to many IBS patients. Food intolerance may be due to abnormal fermentation of food residues in the colon, as a result of disruption of the normal flora. The role of probiotics in IBS has not been clearly defined. Some studies have shown improvements in pain and flatulence in response to probiotic administration, whilst others have shown no symptomatic improvement. It is possible that the future role of probiotics in IBS will lie in prevention, rather than cure.},

Breath hydrogen tolerance tests utilizing lactose, sucrose, and apple juice in the amount they typically consumed were positive in 32%, 0%, and 50%, respectively. Subjects were asked to refrain from the ingestion ofjuice for 1 month: 13 of the 28 (46%) subjects improved while 15 (54%) showed no change in their symptoms. In fact, none consuming 6 to 12 oz of apple or pear juice daily improved, 27% of those consuming 12 to 16 oz improved, and 91% of those consuming > 16 oz improved (P < 0.02). Subjects were then given comparable amounts of white grape juice for 1 year. The initial symptoms did not recur in any of the subjects who initially responded to the juice-free diet. Of the 15 subjects who did not respond to the juice-free diet, seven became asymptomatic. Overall, 20 subjects (71%) were asymptomatic, and eight (29%) had no change in their symptoms. Some individuals with irritable bowel syndrome have their symptoms based on their malabsorption of carbohydrates present in apple juice and pear nectar and may improve with adequate choices of fruit juice such as changing to white grape juice.},

   abstract = {The current understanding is that functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) result from dysregulation of the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain (i.e., the brain-gut axis), modulated by various psychosocial and environmental factors (i.e., the biopsychosocial model). This concept has led to a growing interest in the research of brain function in relation to gut motor and sensory function. Brain research on the mechanisms that are involved in the generation of gastrointestinal symptoms includes studies of the gut response to brain stimulation with technique such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or studies of the brain response to gut stimulation by cortical evoked potentials, positron emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Studies using these techniques have shown that visceral/gut sensation involves activation of several brain regions that are associated with various brain functions, including sensation, cognition, and affect. The complexity of the brain response to visceral stimulation and the multidetermined nature of FGIDs make studies of brain function in FGID patients difficult and demands great caution in interpreting their results. Nevertheless, brain research in FGIDs is an emerging field and suggests that patients with irritable bowel syndrome differ from healthy subjects in the way that their brain response to visceral (e.g., rectal) distention. These studies emphasize the role of the central nervous system in conducting and processing visceral signals and suggest that alteration in brain processes involving perception and affective responses might be key factors in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal symptoms.},

These can include: (1) early life (e.g., genetic or environmental) factors; (2) physiological factors including increased motor reactivity, visceral hypersensitivity, which may be enabled by postinfectious events, and dysregulation of brain-gut communication (e.g., altered central pain control mechanisms). In addition, psychosocial factors including psychiatric co-morbidity, major trauma (e.g., abuse history), and maladaptive coping may amplify the clinical expression of the disorder and its outcome.

In the western world, 8% to 23% of adults have IBS and its socioeconomic cost is substantial. Research-generated insights have led to the understanding of IBS as a disorder of brain-gut regulation. The experience of symptoms derives from dysregulation of the bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain, mediated by neuroendocrine and immunological factors and modulated by psychosocial factors. The biopsychosocial model integrates the various physical and psychosocial factors that contribute to the patient's illness. This model and the recently revised symptom-based criteria (i.e. the "Rome II criteria") form the basis for establishing a comprehensive and effective approach for the diagnosis and management of the disorder.},

   abstract = {Three decades ago, the observations of Trowell and Burkitt gave rise to the "fibre theory", in which it was contended that there was a link between the consumption of a diet rich in fibre and non-processed carbohydrates and the level of protection against many of the "first world diseases" such as constipation, diverticulosis, cancer of the colon, diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. Since that time, numerous studies have been presented to analyze the relationship between fibre and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and other processes with severe health implications. The present revision looks at the experience accumulated over this period regarding the importance of the consumption of fibre for certain phatologies. It not only deals with the epidemiological relationship existing between fibre intake and the development of diseases such as cancer of the colon or cardiovascular disorders but also reviews the interest of fibre a therapeutic agent, in view of the current information available on its different mechanism of action. Thus the possibility of using soluble fibre has taken on renewed interest for the treatment of inflammatory intestinal disease, for control of diarrhoea, in irritable bowel syndrome or no modulate the concentrations of glycaemia or cholesterol. Three is a discussion of the discrepancies found between the consumption of fibre and diverticular disease, the treatment of constipation and the association with obesity and cardiovascular disease. Despite the accumulated evidence on the consumption of fibre, there is currently no consensus as to recommendations on what type of fibre and the optimal amount that should be consumed. A high fibre intake (> 25-30 g/day) based on a variety of food sources (fruit, vegetable, legumes, cereals) is the only way to avoid many of the disorders mentioned. The consumption of a particular type of fibre (soluble or insoluble) is limited to the treatment of certain processes, because its individual relationship with many disorders is still pending determination.},

   abstract = {Low-digestible carbohydrates represent a class of enzyme-resistant saccharides that have specific effects on the human gastrointestinal tract. in the small bowel, they affect nutrient digestion and absorption, glucose and lipid metabolism and protect against known risk factors of cardiovascular disease. In the colon they are mainly degraded by anaerobic bacteria in a process called fermentation. As a consequence, faecal nitrogen excretion is enhanced, which is used clinically to prevent or treat hepatic encephalopathy. Low-digestible carbohydrates are trophic to the epithelia of the ileum and colon, which helps to avoid bacterial translocation. Short-chain fatty acids are important fermentation products and are evaluated as new therapeutics in acute colitis. They are considered in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer. The bifidogenic effect of fructo-oligosaccharides merits further attention, Unfermented carbohydrates increase faecal bulk and play a role in the treatment of chronic functional constipation, symptomatic diverticulosis and, possibly, the irritable bowel syndrome. In conclusion, low-digestible carbohydrates may play a role in the maintenance of human digestive health. However, the strength of evidence differs between disease entities.},

   abstract = {Knowledge on the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome has evolved, beginning with disturbances in motility to visceral hypersensitivity, and ultimately to alterations in brain-gut bi-directional communication, where neurotransmitters such as serotonin play a key role. Recently, a multicomponent disease model that integrates all these alterations was proposed. This model is divided into physiological, cognitive, emotional and behavioral components that explain the gastrointestinal as well as the constitutional symptoms. In recent years there has been an explosion of research together with new developments in pharmacological treatments for IBS that support each component of this model. This review presents recent data in favor of these alterations in IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of irritable bowel syndrome on personal relationships and working practices. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 60-item questionnaire about personal relationships, working practices and treatment was sent to 3090 subscribers of the IBS Bulletin, a quarterly educational publication. A total of 1855 completed questionnaires were returned. Analysis was restricted to 1597 questionnaires (86.1%), returned by respondents in whom the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome had been made by a general practitioner or hospital specialist. RESULTS: Of these respondents, 57% were aged 55 or over and the male to female ratio was 1:3.4. On average, respondents had suffered from irritable bowel syndrome for 16.6 years, with 57% reporting their symptoms daily, 25% weekly and 14% monthly. Of the married or cohabiting respondents, 19% stated that their partner experienced difficulties in having a personal relationship with them and 45% stated that irritable bowel syndrome interfered with their sex life. Irritable bowel syndrome had caused 12% of respondents to give up work altogether, while 47% of employed respondents reported having lost time off work, although only 35% of these respondents gave irritable bowel syndrome as the reason. In contrast employers, when informed of the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome, accepted these symptoms as a valid reason for absence in 61% of instances. Over half of those employed (53%) suffered embarrassment using toilets at work and 32% stated that irritable bowel syndrome had stopped them from applying for promotion or a new job. At the time of completing the questionnaire, 80% of respondents were actually taking some form of treatment. Smooth-muscle relaxants and fibre supplements remained the commonest treatments prescribed. CONCLUSION: Irritable bowel syndrome impacts significantly on personal relationships and working practices. Items that stimulate responsiveness in the areas of personal relationships and working practices should be included in the construction of disease-specific questionnaires used to assess the impact of new treatments for irritable bowel syndrome on health-related quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Visceral hypersensitivity is a feature of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Postprandial symptoms are common in these patients. The effects of nutrients on colonic perception in IBS are incompletely understood. SUBJECTS: We studied 13 healthy subjects and 16 patients with IBS-eight had diarrhoea predominant (IBS-D) and eight constipation predominant (IBS-C) IBS. METHODS: Colonic perception thresholds to balloon distension and viscerosomatic referral pattern were assessed before and after duodenal infusion of lipid or saline, respectively. At the end of the infusions, plasma levels of gastrointestinal peptides were determined. RESULTS: Lipids lowered the thresholds for first sensation, gas, discomfort, and pain in the IBS group but only for gas in the control group. The percent reduction in thresholds for gas and pain after lipids was greater in the IBS and IBS-D groups but not in the IBS-C group compared with controls. IBS patients had an increased area of referred discomfort and pain after lipids compared with before infusion whereas the referral area remained unchanged in controls. No group differences in colonic tone or compliance were observed. In both groups higher levels of cholecystokinin, pancreatic polypeptide, peptide YY, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and neuropeptide Y were seen after lipids. Motilin levels were higher in patients and differences in the subgroups were observed. Levels of corticotrophin releasing factor were lower in the constipated group than in the diarrhoea group. CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial symptoms in IBS patients may be explained in part by a nutrient dependent exaggerated sensory component of the gastrocolonic response.},

The focus is on presenting clinically useful information for the practising gastroenterologist. Selected important clinical learning points include the following: (1) numerous peptides are being identified which stimulate the proliferation and functional response of the small intestine to disease or resection, and may in time find a clinical use; (2) under usual in vivo conditions, absorption of nutrients has little effect on the paracellular movement of water; (3) the permeability of the intestine is modified by the function of the tight junctions, and measuring intestinal permeability may be useful to reflect the presence of disease; (4) the release of serotonin is influenced by cholinergic, adrenergic, and nonadrenergic, noncholinergic mechanisms, and serotonin agonists and antagonists may play an important future role in the treatment of motility disorders; (5) the use of endothelin receptor antagonists may be useful for the treatment of intestinal anaphylaxis; (6) the alterations in intestinal pH and motility in patients with Crohn's disease may influence the action of pH- or time-dependent release medications; and (7) patients with irritable bowel syndrome may also have abnormalities in gastric and small intestinal motility.},

   abstract = {The philosophy that food can be health promoting beyond its nutritional value is gaining acceptance. Known disease preventive aspects of nutrition have led to a new science, the 'functional food science'. Functional foods, first introduced in Japan, have no universally accepted definition but can be described as foods or food ingredients that may provide health benefits and prevent diseases. Currently, there is a growing interest in these products. However, not all regulatory issues have been settled yet. Five categories of foods can be classified as functional foods: dietary fibers, vitamins and minerals, bioactive substances, fatty acids and pro-, pre- and symbiotics. The latter are currently the main focus of research. Functional foods can be applied in pediatrics: during pregnancy, nutrition is 'functional' since it has prenatal influences on the intra-uterine development of the baby, after birth, 'functional' human milk supports adequate growth of infants and pro- and prebiotics can modulate the flora composition and as such confer certain health advantages. Functional foods have also been studied in pediatric diseases. The severity of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal allergy and lactose intolerance may be reduced by using functional foods. Functional foods have proven to be valuable contributors to the improvement of health and the prevention of diseases in pediatric populations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Children with chronic abdominal pain have a heterogeneous clinical presentation, but no organic cause can be identified in most of them. Some children present with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We hypothesized that visceral hypersensitivity and motor abnormalities may be underlying mechanisms in these children. METHODS: Rectal sensation and rectal contractile response to a meal were studied in 8 children with IBS and 8 children with functional abdominal pain (FAP) and were compared with those of 9 healthy volunteers (HVs). RESULTS: The threshold for pain, but not that for first sensation and urge to defecate, was significantly decreased in IBS patients (6 +/- 1 mm Hg) compared with FAP patients and HVs (17 +/- 1 and 22 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively). In HVs and patients with FAP, ingestion of a meal induced a decrease in rectal volume with an early and late component. This motor pattern was absent in children with IBS. In IBS patients, no rapid volume waves were observed during fasting in contrast to FAP patients (2.7 +/- 0.3/10 min) and HVs (1.8 +/- 0.5/10 min). CONCLUSIONS: Children fulfilling the Rome II criteria for IBS have a significantly lowered threshold for pain and a disturbed contractile response to a meal. Comparable to results reported in adults, sensory and motor abnormalities might play a pathophysiologic role in childhood IBS.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal illnesses and is characterized by altered visceral perception. Previous studies in IBS have failed to demonstrate altered somatic or cutaneous perception. The aims of the study were to determine whether IBS patients have visceral hypersensitivity and cutaneous heat-induced hyperalgesia restricted to lumbosacral dermatomes, consistent with a localized segmental mechanism. Twelve patients (ten women, two men) with IBS and 17 control subjects (13 women, four men) rated pain intensity and unpleasantness to distension of the rectum (35, 55 mmHg) and thermal stimulation (45, 47 degrees C) of the hand and foot. Patients with IBS demonstrated cutaneous allodynia/hyperalgesia to thermal pain applied to the hand and foot. The cutaneous hyperalgesia was pronounced in the lower extremity yet present in the upper extremity to a lesser extent. Psychological testing revealed the IBS patients report more state anxiety and a greater number of somatic symptoms that significantly correlated with most of the pain measures. However, they did not differ from controls on several personality trait measures. These results suggest that patients with IBS have visceral hyperalgesia and cutaneous hyperalgesia that is distributed over a considerable rostral-caudal distance yet optimally expressed in lumbosacral dermatomes. This distribution is consistent with patterns of spinal hyperexcitability observed in experimentally induced persistent pain conditions.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a problem reported to affect 22% of the general population. It is characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habit, but has so far defied elucidation of its pathogenesis and proved difficult to treat. There is a growing body of evidence which indicates therapeutic properties for artichoke leaf extract (ALE). Dyspepsia is the condition for which the herb is specifically indicated, but the symptom overlap between dyspeptic syndrome and IBS has given rise to the notion that ALE may have potential for treating IBS as well. A sub-group of patients with IBS symptoms was therefore identified from a sample of individuals with dyspeptic syndrome who were being monitored in a post-marketing surveillance study of ALE for 6 weeks. Analysis of the data from the IBS sub-group revealed significant reductions in the severity of symptoms and favourable evaluations of overall effectiveness by both physicians and patients. Furthermore, 96% of patients rated ALE as better than or at least equal to previous therapies administered for their symptoms, and the tolerability of ALE was very good. These results provide support for the notion that ALE has potential value in relieving IBS symptoms and suggest that a controlled trial is justified.},

Although the clinician may feel compelled to exclude disease in all cases, the authors suggest that it is more appropriate to take a biopsychosocial approach. In so doing, there can be an appreciation of the close interaction of the gut and the brain, allowing the child, family, and physician the opportunity to address the pain on many levels. Although the parameters set forth by the pediatric ROME II committee have facilitated the authors' description of these disorders greatly, basic research likely will further delineate biochemical processes in the enteric and central nervous systems that will expand therapeutic horizons.},
