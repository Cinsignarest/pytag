   abstract = {The idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases, broadly classified as either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, are caused by a dysregulated mucosal immune response to a luminal antigen, possibly a bacterium, in a genetically predisposed host. A rapid expansion of knowledge in recent years has greatly increased our understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders. For example, the relatively recent discovery of the NOD2 gene, a protein involved in bacterial sensing, has provided further evidence of the complex interplay between hosts and microbes in Crohn's disease. Significant recent advances have also occurred with the discovery of the role of Toll-like receptors and dendritic cells in the development of gut inflammation, and the role of proinflammatory cytokines in the development and potentiation of gut inflammation. This article presents an update on these key developments and emphasizes the translational aspects of research that are directly related to patient care.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate state and trait form of anxiety and current depression in patients affected by gastrointestinal diseases. METHODS: We studied 1641 outpatients with gastrointestinal disorders, consecutively referred to our Internal Medicine outpatients from 1997 to 2005. State and trait anxiety were assessed by the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory. Current depression was assessed by the Zung self-rating depression scale. RESULTS: Among patients, 1379 (84.1%) showed state anxiety, 1098 (67%) showed trait anxiety and 442 (27%) showed current depression. The number of gastrointestinal diseases was directly correlated to state anxiety (p < 0.001) and trait anxiety (p = 0.04). Females showed higher levels of anxiety and depression than males (p < 0.001). State anxiety was related to food allergies (p < 0.001), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) (p = 0.001), Hp infection (p = 0.01) and ulcerative colitis in active phase (p = 0.03). Trait anxiety was related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (p < 0.001), Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection (p = 0.001), food allergies (p = 0.001) and SIBO (p = 0.001). Current depression was related to IBS (p < 0.001) and coeliac disease (p = 0.01), SIBO (p = 0.02). A predicted probability of 0.77 +/- 0.16 to have state anxiety, of 0.66 +/- 0.12 to have trait anxiety and of 0.39 +/- 0.14 to have depression was found in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients who seek medical consultation for gastrointestinal problems show an associated affective disorder. These patients should be managed by a team including gastroenterologists, psychologists and/or psychiatrists, or by a gastroenterologist having expertise in the treatment of psychological disorders.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is not fully understood. The interaction between intestinal environmental factors of food and intestinal microbes and the immunological system of hosts seems to be an important aspect. We have reviewed the relationship of the daily consumption of dietary animal meat and fats, dairy products, sugar, and other factors that may be linked to the occurrence of CD and UC from the literature and Japanese epidemiological data. In the present study, we reviewed the association between food and intestinal microbes and other factors contributing to the occurence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from epidemiological data and case-control studies of IBD in the literature that appeared on Medline, and assessed the reports of intestinal microbes involved in the occurrence of IBD. We found several papers describing the positive association of animal meat and sweets and sugar with the occurrence of CD and UC. An analysis of Japanese epidemiological data suggested that the registered number of patients with CD or UC started to increase more than 20 years after an increased daily consumption of dietary animal meat and fats, and milk and dairy products, and after a decreased consumption of rice. Many studies implied a positive role of intestinal microbes in the occurrence of IBD. Intestinal environmental factors, such as Westernized food and intestinal microbes, seem to be involved in the increased occurrence of IBD.},

   abstract = {Apart from genetic and environmental factors, the mucosal immune system of the gut plays a central role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In the healthy gut, the mucosal immune system ensures the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators and thereby allows an effective defence against luminal pathogens but at the same time prevents an overwhelming immune reaction directed against the huge amount of harmless luminal antigens (for example, components of food or nonpathological bacteria). In both entities of IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) this immunological balance is severely impaired and shifted towards the pro-inflammatory side. The chronic mucosal inflammation in IBD is caused by hyperactivation of effector immune cells, which produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 and interferon-gamma, resulting in colonic tissue damage. The nuclear transcription factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) was identified as one of the key regulators in this immunological setting. Its activation is markedly induced in IBD patients and through its ability to promote the expression of various pro-inflammatory genes, NF-kappaB strongly influences the course of mucosal inflammation. Considering the different cell-type specific effects which are mediated by NF-kappaB, this review aims at describing the complex role of NF-kappaB in IBD and discusses existing pharmacological attempts to block the activation of NF-kappaB to develop new therapeutic strategies in IBD.},

METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis established between Jan 2000 and Dec 2007 were investigated according to the age, gender and inductive factors of onset. Assessment of living condition of the patients was performed according to the place of living: city or countryside. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 293 ulcerative colitis patients were involved in the study. The onset age of the rural patients was earlier than that of the urban patients (p=0.00295), while there was no difference in onset age between male and female patients (p=0.067995). Some inductive factors, such as psychological stress, fatigue, cold catching, and spicy or unwashed food, may contribute to the progress of ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSION: Both gender-related and city- and countryside-related differences were found in the expression of ulcerative colitis in the Chinese population. Lifestyle factors such as psychological stress and fatigue may contribute to the expression of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of a new oral preparation, highly concentrated in fish cartilage, in a group of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients with chronic iron deficient anemia. METHODS: In an open label pilot study, we supple-mented a group of 25 patients (11 with Crohn's disease and 14 with ulcerative colitis) in stable clinical conditions and chronic anemia with a food supplement which does not contain iron but contains a standardized fraction of fish cartilage glycosaminoglycans and a mixture of antioxidants (Captafer Medestea, Turin, Italy). Patients received 500 mg, twice a day during meals, for at least 4 mo. Patients were suggested to maintain their alimentary habit. At time 0 and after 2 and 4 mo, emocrome, sideremia and ferritin were examined. Paired data were analyzed with Student's t test. RESULTS: Three patients relapsed during the study (2 in the 3rd mo, 1 in the 4th mo), two patients were lost to follow up and two patients dropped out (1 for orticaria, 1 for gastric burning). Of the remaining 18 patients, levels of serum iron started to rapidly increase within the 2nd mo of treatment, P < 0.05), whereas serum ferritin and hemoglobin needed a longer period to significantly improve their serum levels (mo 4) P < 0.05. The product was safe, easy to administer and well tolerated by patients. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a potential new treatment for IBD patients with iron deficiency chronic anemia and warrant further larger controlled studies.},

Biopsy-associated bacteria are assumed to be particularly relevant in bacteriological investigations of IBD because they are assumed to be located on the mucosal surface and hence close to immunological cells. This investigation analysed the bacterial collections associated with bowel biopsies, aspirates of residual fluid after bowel cleansing and faeces from IBD patients and non-IBD subjects in Edmonton, Canada, and Mexico City, Mexico. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA gene sequences produced profiles of the bacterial collections and their similarities were compared. Similarity analysis showed that the profiles did not cluster according to disease status, but that Canadian and Mexican profiles could be differentiated by this method. Comparison of biopsy, aspirate and faecal samples obtained from the same subject showed that, on average, the profiles were highly similar. Therefore, biopsy-associated bacteria are likely to represent, at least in part, contaminants from the fluid, which resembles a faecal solution, that pools in the bowel after cleansing prior to endoscopy.},

Until recently, only infliximab (humanized monoclonal anti-TNF-alpha antibody) had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to induce and maintain remission in patients with active mild to moderate and/or fistulizing Crohn's disease who are refractory to conventional therapy. Two recent trials, ACT 1 and ACT2, observed high efficacy of infliximab in inducing and maintaining clinical remission, mucosal healing, and corticosteroid-sparing effects in patients with moderate to severe UC. This agent also was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of ulcerative colitis to reduce signs and symptoms, to induce clinical remission and healing of the intestinal mucosa, and to eliminate the use of corticosteroids in patients with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. There have been many randomized, double-blind, controlled and open-label uncontrolled studies of large and small numbers of patients assessing the efficacy and safety of various biologic agents considered potentially useful in the treatment of IBD. Among all the biologic agents, infliximab has the most robust data on safety. This is because it has been evaluated in many more trials than has any other biologic agent. In addition, postmarketing experience provides very valuable information about adverse events occurring during treatment with this agent.},

At regular intervals, cookies were analyzed for moisture, water activity, and concentrations of EPA, DHA, and dienes. Results showed that there were no significant losses of EPA and DHA during storage under the conditions of study. A maximum loss of 5% was observed after 28 d of storage. The concentration of dienes obtained under different conditions were low (< 25 mmol/kg) as compared to a salmon oil sample with appreciable signs of oxidation (600 mmol/kg). Sensory evaluation of cookies by an untrained panel of healthy consumers and ulcerative colitis patients revealed no aftertaste and high acceptability of the cookies.

It is known that T and B cells of patients with Crohn's disease can be stimulated with the yeast antigen, mannan. We evaluated the impact of eating habits with special respect to food containing yeast on the course of inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to 180 German-speaking patients of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Outpatient Clinic at the University Hospital Bern, Switzerland. The following information was obtained by the questionnaires: (1) course of disease, (2) eating habits, (3) environmental data, and (4) inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire. The survey was anonymous. RESULTS: A total of 145 patients (80.5 percent 95 with Crohn's disease, and 50 with ulcerative colitis) responded. Food items containing yeast were better tolerated by patients with ulcerative colitis than by patients with Crohn's disease. A significant difference between the two groups was observed concerning food containing raw yeast (dough, P = 0.04; and pastry, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Food items containing raw yeast led to more frequent problems for patients with Crohn's disease than for patients with ulcerative colitis. This observation supports our previous data, which showed the stimulatory effect of the yeast antigen, mannan, on B and T cells of patients with Crohn's disease but not of controls.},

   abstract = {Fermented foods have been used since prehistoric times. Their number, variety and geographic origin are considerable, and different substrates and agents including bacteria, yeasts and moulds have been used in their preparation. In the last few decades the scientific approach to the study of the participating microorganisms and the resulting products have provided a better understanding of their biological importance. Among the many health-related properties of fermented foods, effects on blood pressure have been described after casein hydrolysis by lactic acid bacteria. Peptides with antimicrobial activity, mainly against Gram-negative bacteria, and derived from casein have also been identified. This could explain, at least in part, the antidiarrheal effects of fermented products including those on traveler's diarrhea and against colonization by Helicobacter pylori. One of the best known advantages of fermented milk products is their capacity to improve lactose tolerance in hypolactasic subjects. With the growing prevalence of allergies and inflammatory bowel diseases, considerable interest has been focused on the effects of lactic acid bacteria in these conditions; there is evidence that these agents are associated with improvements in allergy; no such evidence exists for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. A cholesterol-lowering capacity has also been described for some microorganisms. Not all the fermenting microorganisms have probiotic capacities as the latter are strain-specific.},

   abstract = {VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, and B. infantis), and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {The tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is synthesized as a 26-kDa membrane-bound protein on certain cell types, e.g., T cells. The membrane-bound protein is cleaved to release a 17-kDa soluble form that exists as a homotrimer. It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of different diseases including cancer and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (1, 2). The stimulation of TNF-alpha induction is known to activate several pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and endothelial adhesion molecules that attract cells known to promote inflammation (3). Because of its role in the pathogenesis of different inflammatory diseases, a variety of anti-TNF-alpha agents have been developed and investigated for the treatment of these conditions (4). Several anti-TNF-alpha antibodies such as infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab are now available for the treatment of TNF-alpha-mediated inflammatory diseases (2). Infliximab is an anti-TNF-alpha, chimeric mouse-human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is commercially available and is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases (2, 4). This mAb is known to bind TNF-alpha in the serum or on the cell membranes and to inhibit its biological activity mediated through the TNF-alpha receptor. To evaluate its in vivo use for the detection of TNF-alpha in the various inflammatory diseases, infliximab was labeled with radioactive meta-stable technetium (99mTc) and used as detailed below (2, 5-7).},

   abstract = {Colorectal cancer is a major cause of mortality and treatment costs are considerable. Advocating lifestyle modification, faecal occult blood testing and surveillance colonoscopy in appropriate populations are already in practice. A developing concept is chemoprevention. Several models of carcinogenesis in colorectal cancer have been developed and there is an increasing database on the major molecular mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis mainly from preclinical experiments and phase I trials. There have been several large epidemiological and observational studies to evaluate possible protective effects of >200 agents. More recently, case-control and cohort studies and well-conceived, phase II/III clinical trials have been done or are under way to evaluate putative chemopreventive agents including established drugs like aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 5-aminosalicylates and statins; more controversial drugs like cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, ursodeoxycholic acid; various vitamins and micronutrients including calcium, selenium, folic acid, and dietary fibre, fat and protein content. Despite promising outcome in preclinical studies, there is currently very limited data from well-controlled and appropriately powered clinical studies. The most promising agents currently are aspirin, traditional NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. The recent reports of cardiovascular risks of the COX-2 inhibitors and some traditional NSAIDs have resulted in stagnation of the field. Pending the expected release of results from several phase III trials in the near future, chemoprevention for colorectal cancer can only be practically considered in the very-high-risk population like those with familial adenomatous polyposis and ulcerative colitis, in conjunction with surveillance colonoscopy. This article reviews the major models of colorectal carcinogenesis, the concept of chemoprevention with special reference to colorectal cancer and the current state of clinical literature and the future direction of colorectal cancer chemoprevention for both researcher and clinician alike.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Panproctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the operation of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis. The long-term nutritional consequences after pouch surgery are unknown. We have assessed the nutritional status of the essential trace elements-zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium-in patients several years (median, 10 (range, 2-15) years) after surgery. METHODS: Fifty-five patients with uncomplicated ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and 46 healthy control subjects were studied. A dietary assessment of trace element intake was undertaken by using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. The patients' trace elements status for zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium was assessed by measuring their concentrations in blood. RESULTS: The dietary intake of individual trace elements was similar in both groups (all P values > 0.4). There was no significant difference in the concentrations of plasma copper, zinc, and selenium between patients and healthy control subjects (all P values > 0.07). The concentration of whole blood manganese was significantly higher (P = 0.004) in patients (median, 178.5 nmol/l; range, 59-478 nmol/l) compared with healthy control subjects (median, 140 nmol/l; range, 53-267 nmol/l). Four (7 percent) patients had manganese concentrations more than three standard deviations of the mean of control group (>255 nmol/l). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that patients who have had uncomplicated pouch surgery have a normal dietary intake of trace elements and do not develop deficiencies in copper, zinc, manganese, and selenium. However, these patients may be at increased risk of manganese toxicity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe two cases of successfully prevented refeeding syndrome in a high-risk group of patients. METHODS: Case 1 was a 70-y-old woman who presented with a 4-mo history of poor dietary intake and ill health due to a connective tissue disease leading to myositis and dysphagia and complicated by respiratory failure needing mechanical ventilation. Twelve hours after starting nasogastric tube feeding, she developed a cardiac arrest from which she was successfully resuscitated. Repeated attempts to wean her from the ventilator failed. Case 2 was a 15-y-old girl who was readmitted after a total colectomy for severe ulcerative colitis with diarrhea and vomiting leading to significant weight loss. Her body mass index was 11.4 kg/m(2). RESULTS: In case 1, after consultation by the clinical nutrition team, the diagnosis of refeeding syndrome was made and the patient was duly started on a high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, multivitamin and trace-element supplements, and electrolyte infusion. Subsequently she was successfully weaned from the ventilator. In case 2, further investigation by the clinical nutrition team revealed low baseline electrolyte concentrations including potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphate and low serum albumin. Her low body mass index and baseline electrolyte concentrations put her at high risk of developing refeeding syndrome. She was initially started on low-calorie feeding, multivitamin and minerals, and her electrolytes were carefully monitored. She made a good recovery. CONCLUSION: Refeeding syndrome is a life-threatening, underdiagnosed, treatable condition but there is a need for a wider awareness of the condition among health professionals.},

Rats were allocated to three groups, Water + Vehicle, DSS + Vehicle, and DSS + L. fermentum BR11. BR11 was administered twice daily for 14 days. DSS (2%) was provided from days 7 to 14. Small-intestinal tissue was analyzed for sucrase activity, histology, and crypt cell proliferation. Increased ileum crypt depth and cell proliferation was observed in DSS-treated rats compared to controls (P < 0.05). BR11 normalized these parameters. While DSS predominantly induces colonic damage, minor morphological alterations were also detected in the distal small intestine. L. fermentum BR11 normalized these features.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal-pouch anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment in this condition. Recently, we have shown the efficacy of a highly concentrated probiotic preparation (VSL#3, 900 billions/sachet lyophilized viable bacteria) in preventing relapses of chronic pouchitis and in preventing pouchitis onset. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of high-dose VSL#3 in the treatment of mildly active pouchitis. METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive patients with mild pouchitis, defined as a score of between 7 and 12 in the Pouchitis Disease Activity Index, which includes clinical, endoscopic, and histological criteria, were treated with VSL#3, 2 sachets b.i.d. (3,600 billion bacteria/day) for four weeks. Symptomatic, endoscopic, and histologic evaluations were undertaken before and after treatment according to Pouchitis Disease Activity Index. Remission was defined as a combination of a Pouchitis Disease Activity Index clinical score of <or=2, endoscopic score of <or=1, and total Pouchitis Disease Activity Index score of <or=4. Patients in remission after treatment were treated with VSL#3, 1 sachet b.i.d. (1,800 billion bacteria), as maintenance treatment for six months. The quality of life was assessed with the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire. RESULTS: Sixteen of 23 patients (69 percent) were in remission after treatment. The median total Pouchitis Disease Activity Index scores before and after therapy were 10 (range, 9-12) and 4 (range, 2-11), respectively (P < 0.01). The median Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire score also significantly improved from 110 (range, 90-140) to 200 (range, 95-220; P < 0.001). All 16 patients who went into remission maintained remission during maintenance treatment. Only one patient experienced a transient bloating at the beginning of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: High doses of the probiotic VSL#3 are effective in the treatment of mild pouchitis. Further controlled studies are warranted.},

The aim of this work was to study the possible beneficial effects of yoghurt consumption on an experimental model of IBD in mice. Balb/c mice were fed with yoghurt for 10 consecutive days. At the end of the feeding period the mice received three inoculations of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) solutions once a week for 3 consecutive weeks. After TNBS instillation the mice received yoghurt again for 10 consecutive days. IBD control received only TNBS. After treatments we analysed the number of IgA-secreting cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cells population and the number of apoptotic cells in the large intestine. The number of erythrocytes and leucocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was also determined. We demonstrated the antinflammatory effect of yoghurt in an experimental model of IBD induced by TNBS. The effect was mediated by an increase in the number of the IgA+cells, a decrease in CD8+ population and by the induction of apoptosis of the infiltrative cells in the large intestine.},

   abstract = {Although turmeric (Curcuma longa; an Indian spice) has been described in Ayurveda, as a treatment for inflammatory diseases and is referred by different names in different cultures, the active principle called curcumin or diferuloylmethane, a yellow pigment present in turmeric (curry powder) has been shown to exhibit numerous activities. Extensive research over the last half century has revealed several important functions of curcumin. It binds to a variety of proteins and inhibits the activity of various kinases. By modulating the activation of various transcription factors, curcumin regulates the expression of inflammatory enzymes, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and cell survival proteins. Curcumin also downregulates cyclin D1, cyclin E and MDM2; and upregulates p21, p27, and p53. Various preclinical cell culture and animal studies suggest that curcumin has potential as an antiproliferative, anti-invasive, and antiangiogenic agent; as a mediator of chemoresistance and radioresistance; as a chemopreventive agent; and as a therapeutic agent in wound healing, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and arthritis. Pilot phase I clinical trials have shown curcumin to be safe even when consumed at a daily dose of 12g for 3 months. Other clinical trials suggest a potential therapeutic role for curcumin in diseases such as familial adenomatous polyposis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, hypercholesteremia, atherosclerosis, pancreatitis, psoriasis, chronic anterior uveitis and arthritis. Thus, curcumin, a spice once relegated to the kitchen shelf, has moved into the clinic and may prove to be "Curecumin".},

   abstract = {In genetically susceptible individuals, an altered mucosal immune response against some commensal bacteria of the gut ecosystem appears to be the principal mechanism leading to intestinal lesions in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The information currently available does not provide an exact explanation about the origin of this important dysfunction of the interaction between host and commensal bacteria, but an altered microbial composition has been detected in the gut ecosystem of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Prebiotics are food ingredients not digested nor absorbed in the upper intestinal tract that are fermented by intestinal bacteria in a selective way promoting changes in the gut ecosystem. Experimental and human studies have shown that inulin and oligofructose stimulate saccharolysis in the colonic lumen and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation in animal models of IBD. Strong experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that inulin and oligofructose can offer an opportunity to prevent or mitigate intestinal inflammatory lesions in human Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis. Encouraging results have been obtained in preliminary clinical trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains a diverse collection of bacteria, most of which are unculturable by conventional microbiological methods. Increasingly molecular profiling techniques are being employed to examine this complex microbial community. The purpose of this study was to develop a microarray technique based on 16S ribosomal gene sequences for rapidly monitoring the microbial population of the GI tract. RESULTS: We have developed a culture-independent, semi-quantitative, rapid method for detection of gut bacterial populations based on 16S rDNA probes using a DNA microarray. We compared the performance of microarrays based on long (40- and 50-mer) and short (16-21-mer) oligonucleotides. Short oligonucleotides consistently gave higher specificity. Optimal DNA amplification and labelling, hybridisation and washing conditions were determined using a probe with an increasing number of nucleotide mismatches, identifying the minimum number of nucleotides needed to distinguish between perfect and mismatch probes. An independent PCR-based control was used to normalise different hybridisation results, and to make comparisons between different samples, greatly improving the detection of changes in the gut bacterial population. The sensitivity of the microarray was determined to be 8.8 x 104 bacterial cells g-1 faecal sample, which is more sensitive than a number of existing profiling methods. The short oligonucleotide microarray was used to compare the faecal flora from healthy individuals and a patient suffering from Ulcerative Colitis (UC) during the active and remission states. Differences were identified in the bacterial profiles between healthy individuals and a UC patient. These variations were verified by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and DNA sequencing. CONCLUSION: In this study we demonstrate the design, testing and application of a highly sensitive, short oligonucleotide community microarray. Our approach allows the rapid discrimination of bacteria inhabiting the human GI tract, at taxonomic levels ranging from species to the superkingdom bacteria. The optimised protocol is available at: http://www.ifr.ac.uk/safety/microarrays/#protocols. It offers a high throughput method for studying the dynamics of the bacterial population over time and between individuals.},

   abstract = {Human subjects and their enteric microbiota have evolved together to reach a state of mutual tolerance. Mounting evidence from both animal models and human studies suggests that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a malfunction of this relationship. The enteric microecology therefore represents an attractive therapeutic target with few side effects. Probiotics and prebiotics have been investigated in clinical trials as treatments for IBD, with conflicting results. The evidence for the use of probiotics in the management of pouchitis is persuasive and several studies indicate their effectiveness in ulcerative colitis. Trials of probiotics and prebiotics in Crohn's disease are less convincing. However, methodologies vary widely and a range of probiotic, prebiotic and combination (synbiotic) treatments have been tested in a variety of patient groups with an assortment of end points. Conclusions about any one treatment in a specific patient group can therefore only be drawn on evidence from relatively small numbers of patients. The present article reviews the role of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD and addresses the clinical evidence for the therapeutic manipulation of bowel microbiota using probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in IBD.},

   abstract = {Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases(Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's disease and Pouchitis) includes an abnormal immunological response to disturbed intestinal microflora. Therapeutic strategies are designed to intervene in these abnormal host microbial communications. A novel approach in the last decade has been to use other bacteria or selective foods to induce beneficial bacteria to normalize inflammation. In this review we discuss rationale for such use and describe 46 clinical trials gleaned from the literature. Reports are divided into type, indications, and agents used. The search revealed 15 nonrandomized and 31 randomized trials. Of the latter 23 were double-blind and 8 were open-label randomized controlled. In 32 of the total, different probiotics were used, while 10 and 4 used different prebiotics or synbiotics respectively. In 14 nonrandomized trials, outcome was successful. In the randomized controlled trials 12 of 16 ulcerative colitis but only 2 of Crohn's disease trials of biotic therapy were successful. No superiority of any probiotic was clearly evident, but a multi-agent mixture, VSL3# may be better suited in ulcerative colitis and pouchitis while the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG appears less useful in inflammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn's disease. Further studies with uniform stringent criteria are needed to provide proof of this therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.},

E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as an evidence-based probiotic alternative to mesalazine (5-ASA) in adult UC remission maintenance is a promising agent for such a therapy. The present open-labelled pilot study was undertaken to investigate the clinical benefit of EcN for maintenance therapy in young UC patients. 34 patients with UC in remission aged between 11 and 18 years were allocated either to EcN (2 capsules o. d., n = 24) or 5-ASA (median 1.5 g/d, n = 10) and observed over one year. As a result, the relapse rate was 25 % (6 / 24) in the EcN group and 30 % (3 / 10) in the 5-ASA group. Data on the patients' global health and development were favourable and no serious adverse events were reported. In conclusion, maintenance therapy for UC with the probiotic EcN is effective also in young patients.},

   abstract = {Chemoprevention means the use of agents to prevent, delay, or reverse carcinogenesis. This review was designed to critically discuss the most promising agents in colorectal cancer (CRC) chemoprevention. Aspirin is the best studied chemopreventive agent for CRC. Optimal chemoprevention requires long-term use and high dose of aspirin that may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may also be candidates for chemoprevention. The regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, however, causes adverse effects including gastrointestinal bleeding, and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. In patients with ulcerative colitis 5-aminosalicylates reduce the risk of CRC and dysplasia. Ursodeoxycholic acid can reduce the risk of dysplasia or CRC in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis. Current data are insufficient to support the use of hormone replacement therapy to reduce the risk of CRC. Statins may have chemopreventive effects, but further investigation of their overall benefits in preventing CRC is warranted. Antioxidant supplements cannot prevent CRC. The usefulness of selenium, folate, calcium, and vitamin D awaits further evaluation. Chemoprevention cannot yet be accepted as standard medical practice. Use of chemopreventive agents cannot be a substitute for colorectal surveillance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls. DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4 patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20 IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P = 0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7 ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400 microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis should be explored further.},

METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from UC patients or HT-29 cells were co-cultured with heat-killed probiotic bacteria or culture supernatant of Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult (BbrY) or Bifidobacterium bifidum strain Yakult (BbiY) to estimate the amount of IL-10 or IL-8 secreted. RESULTS: Both strains of probiotic Bifidobacteria contained in the BFM induced IL-10 production in PBMNC from UC patients, though BbrY was more effective than BbiY. Conditioned medium (CM) and DNA of both strains inhibited IL-8 secretion in HT-29 cells stimulated with TNF-alpha, whereas no such effect was observed with heat-killed bacteria. The inhibitory effect of CM derived from BbiY was greater than that of CM derived from BbrY. DNAs of the two strains had a comparable inhibitory activity against the secretion of IL-8. CM of BbiY induced a repression of IL-8 gene expression with a higher expression of IkappaB-zeta mRNA 4 h after culture of HT-29 cells compared to that in the absence of CM. CONCLUSION: Probiotic Bifidobacterium strains in BFM enhance IL-10 production in PBMNC and inhibit IL-8 secretion in intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting that BFM has anti-inflammatory effects against ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In the last decades an increase in morbidity of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly of Crohn disease, in children has been observed. OBJECTIVE: Assessment of clinical course and activity of inflammatory bowel disease in children younger than 5 years was the goal of the study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 21 children aged 2 to 5 years (13 boys and 8 girls) who were diagnosed with: Lesniowski-Crohn disease (7 children), ulcerative colitis (7 children) and indeterminate colitis (remaining 7 children). RESULTS: Among studied children boys prevailed (61.9%). In 6 children the disease started in the first and second year of life; the average age of disease onset was 26.9 months and the time between the onset of the disease and the diagnosis was 16.6 months. 46% of patients came from the cities with population above 100000 when only 23% lived in the country. Autoimmune diseases were diagnosed in the families of 6 children, food or pollen allergy in the families of 11 children. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, presence of blood and mucous in the stool, fever and lack of thrive were most apparent in the clinical picture. The pathological changes were present mainly in the large intestine and only in one case in the upper part of the alimentary tract and jejunum. The observed course of the disease was severe or moderate. In two children aged 3 years colectomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS: In children younger than 5 years severe and moderate course of the Lesniowski-Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis is apparent. Fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, presence of blood and mucous in the stool and lack of appetite were the most often seen symptoms. Pathological changes in children younger than 5 years were present mainly in the large intestine and only in single cases in the upper part of the alimentary tract and jejunum. In children with inflammatory bowel disease a frequent occurrence of allergy, bronchitis, pneumonia and urinary tract infection, which required antibiotics, was observed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Probiotics, defined as live micro-organisms with beneficial effects for the host, are widely applied in gastrointestinal and liver diseases. AIM AND METHOD: To review the available evidence of clinical trials on probiotics in gastrointestinal and liver diseases, with a major focus on irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis and chronic liver diseases. RESULTS: Evidence for the therapeutic or preventive application of particular probiotic strains is available for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, rota-virus-associated diarrhoea and pouchitis. Results are encouraging for irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and for reducing side effects by Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies, but are less clear for Crohn's disease, lactose intolerance and constipation. In general, for most of these patient groups, more placebo-controlled methodologically well-designed studies that pay attention to both clinical outcome and mechanistic aspects are required. The application in liver disease and pancreatitis is promising, but more human trials have to be awaited. Possible mechanisms of probiotics include modulation of the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, but different bacterial may have different effects. CONCLUSION: Further insight into disease entities and the functioning of probiotic strains is required to be able to select disease-specific strains, which have to be tested in well-designed placebo-controlled studies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) is a prebiotic product made from malt which contains glutamine-rich protein and hemicellulose-rich fiber. Although GBF has been observed to attenuate colonic mucosal inflammation and bowel movements in ulcerative colitis, both experimentally and clinically, the details of the immune response remain elusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of GBF on the colonic epithelium immune response in a CD45RB(high) T cell chronic colitis model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Colitis was induced by transferring CD4+ CD45RB(high) T cells to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice (control n=8, GBF n=8) and the effects of GBF on the colitis were evaluated. The evaluation included measurement of body-weight, occult blood tests, histological examination, mucosal cytokine reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis (interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)) as well as IL-6 measurements. RESULTS: Seven weeks after transferring the above cells, body-weight loss and occult blood were significantly reduced in the mice that had been fed with GBF. In these mice, there were also significant reductions in IFN-gamma mRNA expressions and IL-6 in the colonic mucosa, as compared with the control group. GBF also significantly attenuated, mucosal damage and mucin positive goblet cell depletion. Conversely, TGF-beta expression significantly increased in the GBF group, compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study using an experimental model in which colitis was induced by transferring CD4+ CD45RB(high) T cells to SCID mice, GBF reduced inflammation by modulating the colonic microflora.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by anorexia, malnutrition, altered body composition, and development of mesenteric white adipose tissue (WAT) hypertrophy. Increasing evidence suggests that adipokines synthesized either in WAT or in immune cells, are involved in these manifestations of IBD. Among adipokines leptin, adiponectin and resistin hold a fundamental role while the role of ghrelin in inflammation is not well established. Preliminary studies have shown overexpression of leptin, adiponectin, and resistin in mesenteric WAT of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and significant alterations of circulating serum levels of these adipokines in IBD. It has also been demonstrated that intestinal inflammation causes an increase in endogenous ghrelin production. In animal models of intestinal inflammation, existing data suggest that leptin, adiponectin, and resistin are pivotal mediators of inflammation. Interesting therapeutic interventions based on these data have been suggested. A specific role for hypertrophic WAT has also been implicated in CD. Further efforts with experimental and clinical studies are needed to better understand the role of adipokines in IBD.},

   abstract = {Nutrition may play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of ulcerative colitis. Several studies suggest an association between dietary factors and the onset of ulcerative colitis; however, only few studies have examined the relationship between dietary intake and relapse of ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to assess the dietary intake and antioxidative capacity of ulcerative colitis patients and to elucidate the efficacy of dietary therapy for ulcerative colitis. Dietary intake, fatty acid composition of phospholipids in plasma and neutrophils, serum fat-soluble vitamin levels, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity were analyzed in 29 ulcerative colitis patients (7 males and 22 females), who were treated at the Department of Gastroenterology, Okayama University Hospital. Total fat intake, fat energy ratio and linoleic acid intake were significantly lower, while protein and carbohydrate intakes were significantly higher, in the patients than age- and sex-matched controls. In the neutrophil phospholipids of ulcerative colitis patients, significantly higher levels of linoleic aicd and arachidonic acid and a lower level of eicosapentaenoic acid were observed. The concentrations of serum retinol and beta-carotene but not alpha-tocopherol were significantly lower and serum oxygen radical absorbance capacity was also lower than in the controls. Significant correlations between serum oxygen radical absorbance capacity and retinol (r = 0.567, p = 0.0031), alpha-tocopherol (r = 0.560, p = 0.0036) and beta-carotene (r = 0.440, p = 0.0279) concentrations were observed in the ulcerative colitis patients. A diet restricting the intake of linoleic acid and supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid and antioxidative vitamins may be recommendable for the nutritional management of ulcerative colitis patients.},

STUDY DESIGN: We studied 27 children (15 girls, mean age 9.8+/-4.8 years) with JIA/CTD and GI symptoms, including nine with oligoarthritis, nine with polyarthritis, two with systemic arthritis, three with enthesitis-related arthritis, and four with various CTDs. The control group consists of 54 children (31 girls, mean age 11.3+/-6.3 years) with GI symptoms but shown to have no significant GI or rheumatoid disorder. The subjects were examined by gastroduodenoscopy (22 patients, 50 controls) and colonoscopy (23 patients, 16 controls). Intraepithelial CD3+, alpha/beta+, and gamma/delta+ lymphocytes were counted from duodenal and ileal biopsies. RESULTS: Five patients with JIA/CTD (19%) had ulcerative colitis. Lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) was more common in the patients [74% (20/27)] than in the controls [16% (8/50), p = 0.001], as well in the duodenal bulb [29% (7/24) vs. 10% (5/50)], terminal ileum [74% (14/19) vs. 38% (5/13)], and the colon [50% (11/22) vs. 14% (2/14)]. In the duodenum, CD3, alpha/beta+, and gamma/delta+ lymphocytes counts were higher in JIA/CTD (p<0.05). In the ileum, gamma/delta+ cell numbers had increased in JIA/CTD (p<0.05). Either LNH, increased gamma/delta+ count, or both were more common in JIA/CTD [89% (24/27)] than in the controls [13% (7/54), p<0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of children suffering from JIA or CTD with GI symptoms show abnormalities consistent with activation of the intestinal immune system. The aetiology of this reaction remains unknown, but similar features are seen in delayed-type food allergy.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. While a cure remains elusive, both can be treated with medications that induce and maintain remission. With the recent advent of therapies that inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha the overlap in medical therapies for UC and CD has become greater. Although 5-ASA agents have been a mainstay in the treatment of both CD and UC, the data for their efficacy in patients with CD, particularly as maintenance therapy, are equivocal. Antibiotics may have a limited role in the treatment of colonic CD. Steroids continue to be the first choice to treat active disease not responsive to other more conservative therapy; non-systemic steroids such as oral and rectal budesonide for ileal and right-sided CD and distal UC respectively are also effective in mild-moderate disease. 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its prodrug azathioprine are steroid-sparing immunomodulators effective in the maintenance of remission of both CD and UC, while methotrexate may be used in both induction and maintenance of CD. Infliximab and adalimumab are anti-TNF agents approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of Crohn's disease, and infliximab is also approved for the treatment of UC.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK), menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of these vitamins.},

   abstract = {Significant changes have been observed in the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in the last two decades. Traditionally, the incidence of IBD was higher in the developed, industrialized countries, in contrast, nowadays it became more prevalent in the previously low incidence areas. In particular, the incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is similar to that observed in North America and Western Europe, while the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) in developing countries is still low, suggesting that the environmental factors may act faster or differently in UC than in CD. In Europe, the North to South gradient disappeared, and also the West to East gradient is diminishing. Smoking and appendectomy may be considered as important environmental factors in both UC and CD, however, with opposite effects. In addition, the use of oral contraceptives is associated to disease susceptibility in both diseases. The role of diet, perinatal events, stress and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the pathogenesis is still controversial.},

However, it is an important cause of severe infection in neonates, pregnant women, elderly and immunosuppressed patients. Listeriosis has unique preference for pregnant women. Maternal listeriosis is a diagnostic challenge, and intrauterine infection can lead to severe complications such as amnionitis, preterm labor, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and neonatal sepsis. From 2001 to 2005, 16 patients with L. monocytogenes were identified in this hospital; four (25%) were pregnant women. Clinical and laboratory findings are described. There were 3 preterm deliveries and 1 spontaneous second trimester abortion. Three women with listeriosis had no predisposing factors other than pregnancy. One patient was on immunosupressive drugs for ulcerative colitis. Fever was the most common symptom. Infected neonates were most commonly diagnosed with early-onset listeriosis (two cases) or fetal demise (one case). Pregnancy can be the only risk factor for listeriosis. Listeriosis should be considered during the evaluation of febrile syndrome in pregnancy as this condition can be the only risk factor. Blood and amniotic fluid cultures are useful diagnostic tests. Perinatal complications remains high.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, also called chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), affect up to 500 per 100,000 persons in the Western world. Recent studies in the etiology of IBD suggest that these diseases are caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Results from humans and especially animal models of colitis reported by our group and others have indicated that these diseases result from a lack of tolerance to resident intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts. Probiotic bacteria have health-promoting effects for the host when ingested and have also shown efficacy in ulcerative colitis and refractory pouchitis. In light of the efficacy of providing probiotic bacteria to patients with IBD, there has been interest in the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of inulin, oligofructose, and other prebiotics for patients with or at risk of IBD. Prebiotics are nondigestible dietary oligosaccharides that affect the host by selectively stimulating growth, activity, or both of selective intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Prebiotics are easy to administer and, in contrast to probiotic therapy, do not require administration of large amounts of (live) bacteria and are therefore easier to administer. Studies using prebiotics, especially beta-fructan oligosaccharides, for the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation have shown benefit in animal models of colitis. Studies using these prebiotics alone or in combination with probiotics are emerging and have shown promise. These dietary therapies could lead to novel treatments for these chronic debilitating diseases.},

We studied 20 healthy controls and 20 subjects with IBD, 15 of whom had Crohn's disease and five with ulcerative colitis. All the subjects consumed Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 supplemented yogurt for 30 days. The presence of putative regulatory T (T(reg)) cells (CD4(+) CD25(high)) and cytokines in T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) was determined by flow cytometry from peripheral blood before and after treatment, with or without ex vivo stimulation. Serum and faecal cytokine concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The proportion of CD4(+) CD25(high) T cells increased significantly (P = 0.007) in IBD patients, mean (95% confidence interval: CI) 0.84% (95% CI 0.55-1.12) before and 1.25% (95% CI 0.97-1.54) after treatment, but non-significantly in controls. The basal proportion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha(+)/interleukin (IL)-12(+) monocytes and myeloid DC decreased in both subject groups, but of stimulated cells only in IBD patients. Also serum IL-12 concentrations and proportions of IL-2(+) and CD69(+) T cells from stimulated cells decreased in IBD patients. The increase in CD4(+) CD25(high) T cells correlated with the decrease in the percentage of TNF-alpha- or IL-12-producing monocytes and DC. The effect of the probiotic yogurt was confirmed by a follow-up study in which subjects consumed the yogurt without the probiotic organisms. Probiotic yogurt intake was associated with significant anti-inflammatory effects that paralleled the expansion of peripheral pool of putative T(reg) cells in IBD patients and with few effects in controls.},

Owing to sampling restrictions, most of the studies done to date have concentrated on luminal material. Recently, however, there has been an upsurge in interest in the role of microbial communities that occur in biofilms on surfaces in the gut. In the human biota, biofilms have been shown to exist on artificial surfaces and devices implanted in the host, on particulate materials in the gut lumen, and on the colonic mucosa. Owing to their proximity to host tissues, mucosal bacteria interact more readily with the gut epithelium and immune system than their luminal counterparts, and recent research indicates that they play an important role in health and disease processes. Because bacteria growing in biofilms are more resistant to antibiotics than their luminal counterparts, there is increased interest in the use of alternative therapeutic strategies to target potential pathogens on the mucosal surface, especially with respect to applications involving probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.},

   abstract = {Collagenous and lymphocytic colitis are the two recognized major presentations of microscopic colitis. Both diseases present with chronic watery diarrhea and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the colonic mucosa without specific endoscopic abnormalities, and hence diagnosis is established by histology. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that microscopic colitis may affect as many patients as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The cause of these diseases is unknown; however, several lines of evidence support the hypothesis of mucosal injury from an unknown agent in the fecal stream. Due to the lack of disease causality, therapeutic management of microscopic colitis is now directed primarily at symptoms' resolution or improvement. Based on current evidence, oral budesonide represents an effective treatment option for patients with microscopic colitis to achieve and maintain remission. Other anti-inflammatory drugs such as mesalazine or bismuth subsalicylate are now under evaluation. The optimal long-term management strategy of microscopic colitis, however, remains an unsolved issue.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is an inflammatory condition affecting the colon with an incidence of approximately 10-20 per 100,000 per year. No existing intervention is effective in all patients with a proportion requiring colectomy. There are significant proportion of patients who experience adverse effects with current therapies. Consequently, new alternatives for the treatment of UC are constantly being sought. Probiotics are live microbial feed supplements that may beneficially affect the host by improving intestinal microbial balance, enhancing gut barrier function and improving local immune response. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of probiotics compared with placebo or standard medical treatment (5-aminosalicylates, sulfasalazine or corticosteroids) for the induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis. SEARCH STRATEGY: A comprehensive search for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT's) was carried out using MEDLINE (1966-January 2006), EMBASE (January 1985- 2006) and CENTRAL. The Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group Specialised Trials Registrar was also searched. The Australasian Medical Index, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and the Japan Information Centre of Science and Technology File on Science, Technology and Medicine (JICST-E) were also used to identify abstracts. Conference proceedings from the Falk Symposium, Digestive Disease Week (DDW) and the United European Digestive Disease week were hand-searched. Authors of relevant studies and drug companies were contacted regarding ongoing or unpublished trials that may be relevant to the review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of probiotics compared to standard treatments in the induction of remission of active ulcerative colitis DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data for analysis. Data were analysed using RevMan 4.2.7. A formal meta-analysis was not preformed due to differences in probiotics, outcomes and trial methodology. MAIN RESULTS: None of the included studies reported any statistically significant differences in remission or clinical improvement rates between probiotic and placebo or active comparator groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Conventional therapy combined with a probiotic does not improve overall remission rates in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. However, there is limited evidence that probiotics added to standard therapy may provide modest benefits in terms of reduction of disease activity in patients with mild to moderately severe ulcerative colitis. Whether probiotics are as effective in patients with severe and more extensive disease and whether they can be used as an alternative to existing therapies is unknown. Further well designed, larger randomised controlled trials are needed to determine whether probiotics can be used as an alternative to current treatment modalities.},

   abstract = {Interleukin-6 (IL-6)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signals play key roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We previously described that both intact cells and a cell wall-derived polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (PSPG) in a strain of lactobacillus [Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS)] inhibited IL-6 production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) isolated from murine IBD. Diets with LcS improve murine IBD by suppression of IL-6 synthesis in LPMCs. Moreover, LcS supplementation with fermented milk ameliorates disease activity in patients with active ulcerative colitis. Here, we focused on the specific roles of PSPG in LcS concerning their anti-inflammatory actions. PSPG derived from LcS, and no other strain of lactobacilli, inhibited IL-6 production in LPS-stimulated murine IBD LPMCs. Purified PSPG-I from LcS inhibited IL-6 synthesis in LPS-stimulated murine IBD LPMCs through the inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB. The anti-IL-6 action of LcS PSPG was abrogated by masking with monoclonal anti-PSPG-I. Furthermore, PSPG-I-negative L. casei strains (PSPG-I-negative mutant LcS: LC(DeltaPSPG-I), L. casei ATCC 334) did not inhibit IL-6 production. Finally, we confirmed the effects of PSPG-I on LcS in the models of both IBD and colitis-associated cancer (CAC). In the IBD model, ingestion of LcS improved ileitis and inhibited activation of IL-6/STAT3 signaling, while ingestion of the LC(DeltaPSPG-I) strain did not. In the CAC model, treatment with LcS, but not the LC(DeltaPSPG-I) strain, showed tumour-suppressive effects with an inhibition of IL-6 production in the colonic mucosa. These results suggested that a specific polysaccharide component in an L. casei strain plays a crucial role in its anti-inflammatory actions in chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the immunoregulatory effects of omega-3 fatty acid and adiponectin have been postulated, their role in intestinal inflammation is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary fat intake influences activity of colonic inflammation through modulating this system. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received dextran sulfate sodium for induction of colitis. Mice were fed a control diet, omega-3 fat-rich diet, omega-6 fat-rich diet, or saturated fat-rich diet. Some mice were administered a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma; agonist, pioglitazone. Messenger RNA expression of adiponectin and its receptors were analyzed. Adiponectin expression in colonic mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients was also analyzed. RESULTS: The receptors for adiponectin were found to be ubiquitously expressed in epithelial cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, lamina proprial mononuclear cells, and subepithelial myofibroblasts from colonic tissue, but adiponectin was only expressed in myofibroblasts. Induction of colitis significantly decreased the expression of adiponectin in colonic mucosa. The omega-3 fat diet group, but not the other fat diet groups, showed exacerbated colitis with a further decrease of adiponectin expression. Pioglitazone treatment ameliorated the level of decrease in adiponectin expression and improved colonic inflammation induced by the omega-3 fat-rich diet. In patients with ulcerative colitis, the expression level of adiponectin in colonic mucosa was also decreased compared with that in control mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin was found to be expressed in myofibroblasts. Adiponectin expression was significantly suppressed by induction of colitis, and aggravation of colitis after exposure to omega-3 fat may be due to a further decrease in the expression level of adiponectin.},

UC is less common in smokers with smoking reported to decrease paracellular permeability. The aim of this study was thus to determine the effect of nicotine, the major constituent in cigarettes and its metabolites on the integrity of tight junctions in Caco-2 cell monolayers. The integrity of Caco-2 tight junctions was analysed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and by tracing the flux of the fluorescent marker fluorescein, after treatment with various concentrations of nicotine or nicotine metabolites over 48 h. TER was significantly higher compared to the control for all concentrations of nicotine 0.01-10 microM at 48 h (p<0.001), and for 0.01 microM (p<0.001) and 0.1 microM and 10 microM nicotine (p < 0.01) at 12 and 24 h. The fluorescein flux results supported those of the TER assay. TER readings for all nicotine metabolites tested were also higher at 24 and 48 h only (p < or = 0.01). Western blot analysis demonstrated that nicotine up-regulated the expression of the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-1 (p < or = 0.01). Overall, it appears that nicotine and its metabolites, at concentrations corresponding to those reported in the blood of smokers, can significantly improve tight junction integrity, and thus, decrease epithelial gut permeability. We have shown that in vitro, nicotine appears more potent than its metabolites in decreasing epithelial gut permeability. We speculate that this enhanced gut barrier may be the result of increased expression of claudin-1 and occludin proteins, which are associated with the formation of tight junctions. These findings may help explain the mechanism of action of nicotine treatment and indeed smoking in reducing epithelial gut permeability.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by impairment of the epithelial barrier and the formation of ulcer-type lesions, which result in local leaks and generalized alterations of mucosal tight junctions. Ultimately, this results in increased basal permeability. Although disruption of the epithelial barrier in the gut is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal infections, it remains unclear whether barrier breakdown is an initiating event of UC or rather a consequence of an underlying inflammation, evidenced by increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. UC is less common in smokers, suggesting that the nicotine in cigarettes may ameliorate disease severity. The mechanism behind this therapeutic effect is still not fully understood, and indeed it remains unclear if nicotine is the true protective agent in cigarettes. Nicotine is metabolized in the body into a variety of metabolites and can also be degraded to form various breakdown products. It is possible these metabolites or degradation products may be the true protective or curative agents. A greater understanding of the pharmacodynamics and kinetics of nicotine in relation to the immune system and enhanced knowledge of gut permeability defects in UC are required to establish the exact protective nature of nicotine and its metabolites in UC. This review suggests possible hypotheses for the protective mechanism of nicotine in UC, highlighting the relationship between gut permeability and inflammation, and indicates where in the pathogenesis of the disease nicotine may mediate its effect.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, the regular consumption of pre- and probiotics is recommended to provide various positive health benefits. The in vitro and in vivo demonstrated actions on the intestinal microflora, the mucosal barrier and the immunological system are very interesting to propose beneficial health effects, but the scientific proof in humans is not demonstrated yet. Pre- and probiotics are very active in the intestinal tract (mainly in the colon) by maintaining a healthy gut microflora and influencing metabolic, trophic and protective mechanism. Prebiotics stimulates the growth of apathogen bacteria and increase the short chain fatty acid concentration by fermentation. Short chain fatty acids are necessary substrates for a healthy gut. Probiotics inhibit the growth of pathogen bacteria, reduce the translocation of bacteria and toxins and modulate the intestinal immune system. For some specific clinical diseases (ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, diarrhoea) a therapeutic and prophylactic effect with pre- and probiotics was shown. In the near future more indications for pre- and probiotics (used as a single strain or as in a combination) will be added. Promising results are already shown in irritable bowel syndrome, prevention of antibiotic induced diarrhoea, in surgical and in intensive care patients. Future studies should focus to determine the characteristics of a healthy gut and the evaluation of specific health benefits by well-designed, controlled human studies of adequate duration.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a spectrum of diseases in which inflammation leads to acute and chronic gut injury. It is a growing health issue for which no cure exists. The pathogenesis is multifactorial with links to infectious and environmental events that trigger disease in genetically predisposed individuals. Treatment of the two major forms of IBD, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, involves the reduction of inflammation with toxic immunosuppressive drugs or blocking of the pro-inflammatory effects of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) with antibodies. Here, we show that the oral administration of transgenic low-alkaloid tobacco expressing the contra-inflammatory cytokine human interleukin-10 (hIL-10) reduces the severity of colitis by down-regulating TNF-alpha expression directly at the sites of inflammation in IBD-susceptible IL-10(-/-) mice. hIL-10 expressed in plants is biologically active and displays resistance to gastrointestinal degradation. Dietary supplementation with plant tissue delivering up to 9 microg of hIL-10 daily for 4 weeks was well tolerated by treated mice. Gut histology was significantly improved relative to controls (P = 0.002), and was correlated with a decrease in small bowel TNF-alpha mRNA levels and an increase in IL-2 and IL-1beta mRNA levels. Transgenic plants expressing IL-10 to directly attenuate TNF-alpha expression at sites of inflammation in the gut may become a useful new approach in the luminal therapy of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the general population, selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors have been associated with fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects (AEs) than NSAIDs, but whether they are associated with exacerbations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review published and unpublished findings to determine whether the use of COX-2 inhibitors increased the risk for IBD exacerbations relative to placebo in the treatment of IBD. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE (1966-July 2007), EMBASE (1980-July 2007), the Cochrane Library (2007 Issue 4), US Food and Drug Administration records, and data on file at Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Pfizer US Pharmaceutical Group, and Merck & Co., Inc., using the search terms celecoxib, rofecoxib, valdecoxib, etoricoxib, lumiracoxib, cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and inflammatory bowel disease, was performed to identify randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 5 COX-2 inhibitors in patients with IBD. The publications were fully reviewed for quality. Data on trial design, patient characteristics, intervention drugs, dosages, and outcomes were collected using a predetermined data-extraction form. A meta-analysis was performed based on the publications that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Of 588 studies identified in the electronic search, 574 were excluded after screening the titles and abstracts. Fourteen related to the use of COX-2 inhibitors in patients with IBD were reviewed. Two randomized, controlled trials comparing COX-2 inhibitors with placebo were identified. In the first trial, 82 patients were randomized to receive etoricoxib (60-120 mg/d) and 77 to receive placebo. The exacerbation rates were 10.5% (8/76) in the active-treatment group and 11.4% (8/70) in the placebo group (relative risk [RR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.37-2.32). In the second trial, 112 patients were treated with celecoxib (200 mg BID) and 110 received placebo. The exacerbation rates were 3.7% (4/107) in the celecoxib group and 2.7% (3/110) in the placebo group (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.17-3.18). Of these patients, 5 were lost to follow-up because of AEs. In the meta-analysis comparing COX-2 inhibitors and placebo, the RR was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.39-1.88). No statistically significant differences in IBD relapse rates were found between COX-2 inhibitors and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this meta-analysis suggest that insufficient data were available to determine the impact of COX-2 inhibitors on IBD exacerbations. The relatively smaller risk for AEs makes the short-term use of COX-2 inhibitors potentially attractive, but the long-term benefits remain unclear. Further studies with sound methodology and large sample sizes are needed to evaluate the tolerability of COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of IBD.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of native, heated and glycated bovine serum albumin (BSA) on the ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-UC colonic microbiota in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: Continuous flow culture (CFC) models of the human colonic microbiota inoculated with faeces from UC and non-UC volunteers were maintained on BSA as growth substrate. Changes in bacterial populations and short-chain fatty acids were determined. UC and non-UC microbiota differed significantly in microbial populations, with elevated numbers of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and clostridia in the microbiota from UC patients. Compared with native BSA, glycated BSA modulated the gut microbiota of UC patients in vitro towards a more detrimental community structure with significant increases in putatively harmful bacteria (clostridia, bacteroides and SRB; P < 0.009) and decreases in dominant and putatively beneficial bacterial groups (eubacteria and bifidobacteria; P < 0.0004). The levels of beneficial short-chain fatty acids were significantly decreased by heated or glycated BSA, but were increased significantly by native BSA. CONCLUSION: The UC colonic microbiota maintained in CFC was significantly modified by glycated BSA. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results suggest that dietary glycated protein may impact upon the composition and activity of the colonic microbiota, an important environmental variable in UC.},

As a result many patients affected by Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are females of reproductive age interested in bearing children. It has been shown that the most important factor in the success of a pregnancy in patients with IBD is the state of disease activity. Therefore, the goal prior to and during pregnancy is to best optimise control of the disease through medical therapy. Unfortunately, many medications utilised to treat IBD are potentially toxic and/or teratogenic, leaving many physicians and patients without a clear answer as to the safest methods of therapy. This review attempts to summarise the medical literature to date, as it pertains to the safety of medical therapy for IBD during pregnancy and the puerperium.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal innate and adaptive immune system continuously faces the challenge of potent stimuli from the commensal microflora and food constituents. These local immune responses require a tight control, the outcome of which is in most cases the induction of tolerance. Local T cell immunity is an important compartment of the specific intestinal immune system. T cell reactivity is programmed during the initial stage of its activation by professional presenting cells. Mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) are assumed to play key roles in regulating immune responses in the antigen-rich gastrointestinal environment. Mucosal DCs are a heterogeneous population that can either initiate (innate and adaptive) immune responses, or control intestinal inflammation and maintain tolerance. Defects in this regulation are supposed to lead to the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). This review will discuss the emerging role of mucosal DCs in regulating intestinal inflammation and immune responses.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Historically, sulfasalazine (SSZ) and 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) have been a mainstay of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) remission induction and maintenance therapy. Considering the pivotal role of intestinal microbial flora in pathophysiology of UC and antimicrobial activity of sulfapyridine, we hypothesized that SSZ might be more effective than 5-ASAs in the management of UC. AIM: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of SSZ with each of the 5-ASAs (mesalamine, olsalazine, and balsalazide) by a meta-analysis technique. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies compared efficacy and/or tolerability of SSZ with 5-ASAs in the management of UC. The search terms were: "sulfasalazine" or "sulfasalazine" and "5-aminosalicylic acid," "mesalazine," "mesalamine," "olsalazine" or "balsalazide" and "ulcerative colitis." Data were collected from 1966 to April 2008. There was no language restriction. "Overall improvement," "relapse rate," "total adverse events," and "withdrawals because of adverse events" were the key outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Twenty randomized placebo controlled trials met our criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Comparison of SSZ with mesalamine yielded a nonsignificant relative risk (RR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval of 0.89-1.21, P = 0.63) for overall improvement, a nonsignificant RR of 0.98 (95% CI 0.78-1.23, P = 0.85) for relapse, a nonsignificant RR of 0.76 (95% CI 0.54-1.07, P = 0.11) for any adverse events, and a nonsignificant RR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.46-1.3, P = 0.33) for withdrawals due to adverse events. Comparison of SSZ with olsalazine yielded a nonsignificant RR of 1.14 (95% CI 0.91-1.43, P = 0.25) for overall improvement, a nonsignificant RR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.77-1.12, P = 0.42) for relapse, a nonsignificant RR of 1.21 (95% CI 0.9-1.61, P = 0.20) for any adverse events, and a nonsignificant RR of 1.53 (95% CI 0.93-2.52, P = 0.09) for withdrawals due to adverse events. Comparison of SSZ with balsalazide yielded a nonsignificant RR of 1.3 (95% CI 0.93-1.81, P = 0.12) for overall improvement, and a significant RR of 0.17 (95% CI 0.06-0.49, P = 0.001) for withdrawals because of adverse events. CONCLUSION: SSZ does not differ from mesalamine or olsalazine in terms of efficacy and tolerability in UC. Withdrawal from study due to adverse events was significantly lower for balsalazide compared with SSZ. Convincing conclusions on the comparison of effectiveness and safety of balsalazide and SSZ in UC remains to be elucidated by further clinical trials. Considering the lower cost of treatment with SSZ and the equal rate of adverse events with other 5-ASAa, it is not surprising to suggest SSZ as a first-choice treatment for UC and reserve 5-ASAs for when SSZ intolerability occurs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Carboxylic acids (CAs), especially butyric acid, have been suggested to counteract colonic diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and colon cancer. Colonic formation of CAs can be influenced by the diet, but the concentrations and pattern formed need to be evaluated for different food products in humans. To elucidate how the colonic concentration of CAs in healthy subjects is influenced by dietary supplementation with oat bran, and whether the concentration varies over time and during consecutive days. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twenty-five healthy subjects (age 24+/-1.3) were recruited to the study. The subjects were given 40 g beta-glucan enriched oat bran per day, corresponding to 20 g dietary fibre, in 4 slices of bread. CAs were analysed in faeces during three consecutive days after 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks on this diet. RESULTS: The concentration of acetic, propionic, butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acid was higher (P<0.05-0.001) after 8 weeks on the oat bran diet as compared with values at entry, whereas that of lactic acid was lower (P<0.05). After 12 weeks, the concentrations of acetic, propionic and isobutyric acid were still higher and that of lactic acid lower. The variation between individuals was considerable, whereas in the same individuals there was little variation. CONCLUSIONS: Oat bran increased the faecal concentration of CAs after 8 weeks, indicating an increased concentration also in the distal colon. The concentration of all main acids increased, except for lactic acid, which decreased. Oat bran may therefore have a preventive potential adjunct to colonic diseases.},

With a high level of evidence, it is concluded that the use of certain strains of probiotics significantly reduces the risk for antibiotic-induced diarrhea. Although further studies are needed, the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics in people suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (particularly ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis) might improve the rates of remission induction/maintenance. The administration of probiotics and symbiotics to patients with liver transplant, severe acute pancreatitis, and intensive and surgical care patients, emerges as a promising therapeutic option that seems to reduce the number of infections; however, it is currently no possible to establish evidence-based recommendations, with a need for a higher number of better designed works. About safety of probiotics and symbiotics, the benefits/risks ratio clearly favors the former since the risk for infection is low, even in immunosuppressed patients.

ONS and/or TF in addition to normal food is indicates in undernourished patients with CD or UC to improve nutritional status. In active CD EN is the first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant differences have been shown in the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and hole protein formulae for TF. In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid dependent patients in CD. In patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the adaptation phase and should be changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in addition to normal food. Special nutrition support should not be used routinely in patients with mild or moderate acute pancreatitis. EN is the preffered route in patients with pancreatitis and should be attempted before initiating parenteral nutrition. Nutrition assessment in patients with liver disease should include screening for micronutrient deficiencies. Protein restriction should be implemented for the acute management of hepatic encephalopathy and should not be implemented chronically in patients with liver disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Short bowel syndrome patients frequently experience impaired health-related quality of life. This syndrome is also associated with increased costs for the individuals concerned and the community. Intake of specially processed cereals has been demonstrated to decrease intestinal secretion. This study evaluates the effect of a supplementary diet with specially processed cereals compared with nonprocessed cereals. METHODS: This investigation is a randomized double-blind, cross-over multicentre prospective study of 26 intestinal resected out patients, considered as short bowel syndrome patients. The patients were divided into groups A or B, in accordance with the first allocated treatment. Subgroup analyses of the underlying diagnoses and type of surgical procedure were performed. The studied parameters were faecal volume, nocturnal stools, abdominal pain/discomfort, health-related quality of life, peripheral blood tests and anthropometric data. RESULTS: In both groups, intake of nonprocessed cereals significantly decreased the faecal volume. The subgroup analyses of patients with a history of ulcerative colitis (compared with Crohn's disease) and nonileostomy-operated procedure (compared with ileostomi-operated procedure) showed significantly decreased faecal volume during nonprocessed cereals intake. Peripheral blood tests, quality of life and anthropometry were not affected. CONCLUSION: In this study, nonprocessed cereals seemed to be as effective as specially processed cereals in decreasing faecal volume in general and especially in ulcerative colitis patients (mainly operated with nonileostomy techniques). Our results indicate that use of supplementary cereals is safe for this group of patients, but should optimally include evaluation of the underlying diagnosis and the surgical method used.},

   abstract = {AIMS: The intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of three probiotics with immunomodulatory properties, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis, were evaluated and compared in the trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) model of rat colitis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Colitis was induced in rats by intracolonic administration of 10 mg of TNBS dissolved in 0.25 ml of 50% ethanol. Each probiotic was administered orally (5x10(8) CFU suspended in 0.5 ml of skimmed milk) for 3 weeks, starting 2 weeks before the administration of TNBS. Colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically 1 week after TNBS instillation. The results obtained revealed that all probiotics assayed showed intestinal anti-inflammatory effects, macroscopically evidenced by a significant reduction in the colonic weight/length ratio. Only B. lactis showed a lower incidence of diarrhoea in comparison with untreated rats. Biochemically, all probiotics restored colonic glutathione levels, depleted as a consequence of the oxidative stress of the inflammatory process. Bifidobacterium lactis treatment reduced colonic tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression; L. acidophilus administration reduced colonic leukotriene B4 production and iNOS expression and L. casei intake was associated with a decrease in colonic COX-2 expression. CONCLUSION: The three probiotics assayed have shown intestinal anti-inflammatory activity in the TNBS model of rat colitis, although each probiotic shows its own anti-inflammatory profile. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These probiotics could be considered as potential adjuvants in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, although more studies are required in order to demonstrate their efficacy in humans.},

Probiotics exhibit strain-specific differences in their resistance to acid and bile, ability to colonise the gastrointestinal tract, clinical efficacy, and benefits to the health of the host. There is level I evidence for the use of probiotics in treating acute infectious diarrhoea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii having the most evidence to support their use for these conditions. There is level II evidence that S. boulardii combined with high-dose vancomycin is more effective than the antibiotic alone in preventing recurrent Clostridium difficile diarrhoea. There is level I evidence that probiotics prevent traveller's diarrhoea. There is level I evidence for use of the high-potency probiotic VSL#3 in preventing pouchitis, and level II evidence for this agent in preventing relapse in patients with ulcerative colitis. Probiotics are generally regarded as safe and well tolerated. Some probiotics may be contraindicated in patients who are immunocompromised or have severe underlying illness, as they have been reported to cause fungaemia and bacteraemia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Probiotics have anti-inflammatory effects in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and appear to regulate mucosal immune response through reductions in proinflammatory cytokines. The probiotic VSL#3 prevents pouchitis if started within a week of ileostomy closure and maintains remission following antibacterial treatment in patients with refractory or recurrent pouchitis. However, the efficacy of probiotics and their effects on regulatory cells if started at a greater time after surgery in patients undergoing ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis are unknown. METHODS: We conducted an open-label study in which 31 patients at different periods from surgery without signs and symptoms of pouchitis were randomized to 2 sachets of VSL#3 once daily or no treatment for 12 months. Pouchitis disease activity index (PDAI) was evaluated at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months. The percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes expressing CD25 and the inactive form of transforming growth factor-beta [latency-associated peptide (LAP)] were evaluated at baseline and after 3 and 6 months in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells and mucosal biopsies. Variation in tissue interleukin-1beta and Foxp3 mRNA expression was also evaluated. RESULTS: During the study period, VSL#3-treated patients showed a significant reduction in PDAI score and a significant increase in the percentage of mucosal CD4+CD25(high) and CD4+ LAP-positive cells compared with baseline values. Tissue samples at different points showed a significant reduction in IL-1beta mRNA expression, and a significant increase in Foxp3 mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that VSL#3 administration in patients with IPAA modulates the PDAI and expands the number of mucosal regulatory T cells.},

   abstract = {Probiotics have been used in humans for almost a century and widely recommended for the treatment of a variety of ills assumed to be of colonic origin, including diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and flatulence. More recently, probiotics have been evaluated in the management of specific colonic disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Clostridium difficile colitis. It is evident that no two probiotics are exactly alike; why then should we expect reproducible results from studies that employ different species or strains, variable formulations, and diverse dosing schedules? When probiotics have been studied with the rigor appropriate to a new therapeutic modality, some coherent results have emerged: specific strains are effective in certain diarrheal states, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis, as well as in the prevention of C. difficile-related colitis. Even here, not to mention other colonic disorders, further adequately powered and appropriately designed trials are needed.},

   abstract = {The present study describes a novel bacterial isolate exhibiting high ability to synthesise and secrete butyrate. The novel isolated bacterium was obtained from human faeces and grown in selective liquid intestinal microflora medium containing rumen fluid under microaerobic conditions. Its probiotic properties were demonstrated by the ability of the isolate to survive high acidity and medium containing bile acids and the ability to adhere to colon cancer cells (Caco-2) in vitro. Phylogenetic identity to Enterococcus durans was established using specific primers for 16S rRNA (99% probability). PCR analyses with primers to the bacterial gene encoding butyrate kinase, present in the butyrogenic bacteria Clostridium, showed that this gene is present in E. durans. The in vivo immunoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of E. durans were assessed in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in Balb/c mice. Administration of E. durans ameliorated histological, clinical and biochemical scores directly related to intestinal inflammation whereas the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus delbrueckii was ineffective in this regard. Colonic cDNA concentrations of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were significantly down regulated in DSS-treated E. durans-fed mice but not in control or DSS-treated L. delbrueckii- fed mice. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation analyses of colonic tissue from mice fed E. durans, using a butyrate kinase probe, demonstrated that E. durans significantly adheres to the colonic tissue. The novel isolated bacterium described in the present paper, upon further characterisation, can be developed into a useful probiotic aimed at the treatment of patients suffering from ulcerative colitis.},

In addition, patients with inflammatory bowel disease are often found to have nutrient deficiencies at the time of diagnosis, whereas others develop features of malnutrition over the course of their illness. Therefore, an understanding of the relationship between nutrients and inflammatory bowel disease is important if these patients are to receive optimal care. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic and basic research has helped to shed light on the interaction between diet and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Numerous clinical trials utilizing various types of lipids, including fish oil and short chain fatty acids, suggest that fats play an important role in the inflammatory response that characterizes inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamins and other micronutrients involved in nutrient metabolism and modulation of oxidative stress are also considered in this review. SUMMARY: This update discusses nutritional issues that can be used to help prevent and treat nutrient deficiencies and ameliorate disease activity in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease.},

Environmental triggers initiate or reactivate inflammation and modulate genetic susceptibility. New pathogenesis concepts include defective bacterial killing by innate immune cells in CD, colonization of the ileum in CD with functionally abnormal Escherichia coli that adhere to and invade epithelial cells and resist bacterial killing, and alterations in enteric microbiota composition in CD, UC, and pouchitis detected by molecular probes. The considerable therapeutic potential of manipulating the enteric microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease patients has not been realized, probably due to failure to recognize heterogenic disease mechanisms that require individualized use of antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, combination therapies, and genetically engineered bacteria to restore mucosal homeostasis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease, an umbrella term used for Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, is often accompanied with the presenting symptom of diarrhea. This symptom can be a great nuisance and emotionally distressing to the individual with inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown, interactions between the host susceptibility, mucosal immunity, and intestinal microflora are thought to be major factors. One intervention that is gaining increasing support by the research and medical community is the use of probiotics, which work on the intestinal flora by altering the bacterial composition and thereby rendering the environment unfavorable to pathogenic organisms. The human response to illness model provides an ideal organizing framework to gain a comprehensive understanding of the human response of diarrhea in the inflammatory bowel disease population. By examining the physiological, pathophysiological, behavioral, and experiential perspectives as well as individual vulnerabilities, this model establishes sound rationale to guide nursing interventions to help the individual better cope with the physical and emotional effects of having diarrhea. This model also facilitates the provision of holistic and personalized care, which may include the use of probiotics to help alleviate this distressing symptom.},

This particular E. coli strain was isolated in 1917 based on its potential to protect from presumably infectious gastroenteritis. Initial therapeutic success was noted in the management of gastrointestinal infectious disorders and infections affecting the urinary tract; the focus shifted later to chronic inflammatory conditions. The unique combination of fitness and survival factors to support intestinal survival, the lack of virulence, and obvious probiotic properties make this microorganism a safe and effective candidate in the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. Three large clinical trials have assessed the potential in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis and equivalence to standard 5-ASA medication was documented. This review aims to discuss important mechanisms of E. coli Nissle 1917 and will review the available literature regarding treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are recurrent and aggressive inflammatory disorders that are most likely the result of an overly aggressive immune response to ubiquitous intestinal antigens in a genetically susceptible host. Despite decades of intense research, our knowledge of factors causing IBD remains incomplete and, therefore, conventional therapy to induce and maintain remission works in a symptomatic fashion, merely suppressing the immune response. Probiotic bacteria have long been known to confer health benefits, especially with regard to intestinal disorders. Although there is mounting evidence from in vitro and animal experiments supporting the use of probiotics in IBD, clinical trials have not provided definite evidence for the therapeutic effect of probiotic therapy in IBD to date. This is with the notable exception of pouchitis and the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis, whereas Crohn's disease and active ulcerative colitis do not seem amenable to probiotic intervention. The next 5 years will see more trials targeting specific clinical settings using tailor-made probiotic combinations, taking into account our increasing knowledge of individual probiotic properties and the diversity of these microorganisms.},

   abstract = {Recently, conventional therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have not received the same amount of attention as biologic therapies, yet they remain the backbone of therapy for IBD because of their efficacy, safety, and relatively low cost. Advances in efficacy and safety continue because of modifications in drug dosing and monitoring. Higher doses of mesalamine per pill, together with once-daily dosing, may help to optimize drug delivery and patient compliance. Budesonide, an effective agent for both induction and short-term remission maintenance in Crohn's disease, is devoid of many of the toxicities common to corticosteroids. Assessments of thiopurine methyltransferase and metabolite levels are helping to fine-tune dose optimization for the thiopurines azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine. The oral calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and cyclosporine have been shown to have expanded roles in IBD, and methotrexate may be useful in some patients with refractory ulcerative colitis. Probiotics are showing promise for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis.},

Ecological treatments including probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are actively studied in Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis. We review herein the literature on the rational use of probiotics in IBD considering efficacy (as evaluated in randomized controlled trials), mechanisms of action and safety issues. A probiotic effect is strictly restricted to one defined strain and cannot be generalized from one to another. There is evidence of efficacy of some probiotic drugs in pouchitis (VSL#3), and in the prevention of recurrence of UC (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917). However, the evidence for efficacy of probiotic drugs in CD is still low as well as that of dietary ecological treatments. Despite an ecological (hopefully nutritional) treatment of IBD is promising, many questions remain unanswered and further clinical and fundamental studies are needed.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: As patients look to complementary therapies for management of their diseases, it is important that the physician know the effectiveness and/or lack of effectiveness of a variety of dietary approaches/interventions. Although the pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) is not fully understood, many suspect that diet and various dietary factors may play a modulating role in the disease process. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The purpose of this article is to present some of what is known about various dietary/nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease, with inclusion of evidence from various studies regarding their putative effect. MedLINE was searched (1965-present) using combinations of the following search terms: diet, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Additionally, references of the articles obtained were searched to identify further potential sources of information. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: While much information is available regarding various dietary interventions/supplements in regard to inflammatory bowel disease, the lack of controlled trials limits broad applicability. Probiotics are one of the few interventions with promising results and controlled trials. CONCLUSION: While there are many potential and promising dietary factors that may play a role in the modulation of inflammatory bowel disease, it is prudent to await further controlled studies before broad application/physician recommendation in the noted patient population.},

The control of lactose digestion phenotypically divides populations into those who can [lactase persistent (LP)] and those who cannot [lactase nonpersistent (LNP)] assimilate lactose. LNP subjects, however, can adapt to lactose intolerance through intestinal bacteria. The DF/LNP status interactions may function as disease risk modifiers. We evaluated the relationship between DF and LNP with colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, and stomach cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD; Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Yearly per capita DF consumption, LNP national prevalence, cancer mortality, and incidence of IBD were obtained from several sources. A negative binomial regression model was used to derive incremental risks. There were statistically significant (P <or= 0.05) increases in risk for colorectal and prostate cancer and ulcerative colitis with DFs and a statistically significant decreased risk for stomach cancer. There were trends (P<0.1) for lung and ovarian cancers and Crohn's disease. As LNP prevalence increased, stomach cancer risk increased, whereas risks of all other conditions decreased (P<0.01). In 3 cancers (prostate, ovarian, and breast), meta-analyses of case-based studies support ecological data. In colorectal cancer, on the contrary, meta-analyses of case-based studies suggest protection. The possible importance of distinguishing LNP/LP status in studies is discussed.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are associated with extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) in approximately 40% of patients. Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha, is effective for induction and maintenance of remission of CD and UC. The role of infliximab for EIMs related to IBD has been less studied, but it is likely as effective. The EIMs may run a course that parallels IBD activity or may present separately. The EIMs that parallel intestinal inflammation (eg, peripheral arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, and episcleritis) generally respond to infliximab. Therefore, treating patients with IBD who have one of these EIMs will more often than not improve the EIM. The EIMs that run a separate course from IBD are more difficult to treat. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) have variable responses to IBD medications. Infliximab is efficacious for uveitis and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AS. The efficacy of infliximab for PSC is unknown. The dosing schedule of infliximab for IBD patients with EIMs should be induction doses with 5 mg/kg at 0, 2, and 6 weeks followed by every 8 weeks. Whether long-term infliximab therapy is necessary to maintain remission of EIMs, as in the case of IBD, has not been established.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation (CI) is commonly found in the anal transition zone (ATZ) after stapled ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC). Yet, its impact on defecatory function and the need for a complete mucosectomy has not been completely elucidated. This study aims to evaluate the long-term functional outcomes of patients with CI of the ATZ after stapled IPAA in comparison with mucosectomy patients. METHODS: Between June 1987 and November 2007, 66 UC patients were found to have CI of the ATZ after stapled IPAA and were compared with 228 UC patients who underwent mucosectomy with hand-sewn (HS) IPAA. Patients were mailed a questionnaire to assess defecatory function and quality of life. Data were analyzed prospectively. RESULTS: No differences were observed in age, sex, number, or consistency of bowel movements (BMs) between groups. Complete continence was reported by 90.3% of CI and 66.8% of HS patients (P < .001). The CI group also had a significantly lower rate of major incontinence (P < .001). Functional parameters in favor of the CI group included the ability to discriminate between gas and stool (P < .001), the use of protective pads during both the day and the night (P < .001), dietary modifications in the timing of meals (P < .001) and type of food (P = .005), and the presence of perianal rash (P = .019). In the CI group, more patients rated their quality of life as improved from before the operation (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Preservation of the ATZ, even in presence of persistent inflammation, confers improved continence, better functional outcomes, and superior quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alkaline sphingomyelinase, an enzyme found exclusively in bile and the intestinal brush border, hydrolyzes sphingomyelin into ceramide, sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate, thereby inducing epithelial apoptosis. Reduced levels of alkaline sphingomyelinase have been found in premalignant and malignant intestinal epithelia and in ulcerative colitis tissue. Probiotic bacteria can be a source of sphingomyelinase. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of VSL#3 probiotic therapy on mucosal levels of alkaline sphingomyelinase, both in a mouse model of colitis and in patients with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Interleukin-10 gene-deficient (IL10KO) and wild type control mice were treated with VSL#3 (10(9) colony-forming units per day) for three weeks, after which alkaline sphingomyelinase activity was measured in ileal and colonic tissue. As well, 15 patients with ulcerative colitis were treated with VSL#3 (900 billion bacteria two times per day for five weeks). Alkaline sphingomyelinase activity was measured through biopsies and comparison of ulcerative colitis disease activity index scores obtained before and after treatment. RESULTS: Lowered alkaline sphingomyelinase levels were seen in the colon (P=0.02) and ileum (P=0.04) of IL10KO mice, as compared with controls. Treatment of these mice with VSL#3 resulted in upregulation of mucosal alkaline sphingomyelinase activity in both the colon (P=0.04) and the ileum (P=0.01). VSL#3 treatment of human patients who had ulcerative colitis decreased mean (+/- SEM) ulcerative colitis disease activity index scores from 5.3+/-1.8946 to 0.70+/-0.34 (P=0.02) and increased mucosal alkaline sphingomyelinase activity. CONCLUSION: Mucosal alkaline sphingomyelinase activity is reduced in the intestine of IL10KO mice with colitis and in humans with ulcerative colitis. VSL#3 probiotic therapy upregulates mucosal alkaline sphingomyelinase activity.},

The following variables were studied: body weight, serum levels of albumin, C-reactive protein and interleucine-6 (IL-6). RESULTS: All animals lost weight between the beginning and the end of the experiment (280+ 16 mg versus 249+21 mg, p< 0.001). There was a significant decrease in the serum albumin between the normal pre-induction level (3.45 + 0.49 mg/dL) and the 1st day after colitis induction (1.61+051 mg/dL, p< 0.001) in all treated groups when compared to the control group. C- reactive protein increased after induction and diminished on the 7th day in all groups. In the control group there was an increase in the IL-6 after colitis induction. None of the treated groups significantly differed from IL-6 pre-colitis status (p>0.05). Only probiotic rats presented a significant decrease of IL-6 than controls (0,30+/-0,08 mg/dL vs. 0,19+/-0,03 mg/dL; p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Probiotics are effective to diminished inflammatory status mediated by IL-6 in experimental colitis.},

Pouchitis is the most frequent complication, occurring in up to 50% of patients with underlying UC. Clinical symptoms of the disease are non-specific. Moreover, surgical complications must be differentiated from idiopathic pouchitis using pouchoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound or MRI of the pelvis in certain cases. The therapy for idiopathic pouchitis, its etiology and pathophysiology being unclear, is based on antibiotic treatment, usually with metronidazole or ciprofloxacin. Probiotics such as VSL#3 can be used to prevent relapse. In summary, the clinical and functional outcomes are excellent and stable for 20 years after surgery.},

   abstract = {The normal colonic microflora is intimately involved in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). These conditions are often refractile to conventional treatments involving the employment of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs, and this has led to a search for alternative therapies based on the use of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. The majority of investigations in this area have been done with probiotics, and while there is increasing interest in the abilities of prebiotics and synbiotics to control the symptoms of IBD, very few randomised controlled trials have been reported. Although the results have been variable, human and animal studies have demonstrated that in many circumstances, these functional foods can alter the composition of the colonic microbiota, reduce inflammatory processes in the gut mucosa, and have the potential to induce disease remission. More work is needed to understand the effects of prebiotics and synbiotics on microbial communities in the gut, and their interactions with the host's immune system.},

Entirely new approaches are being developed that reflect a greater understanding of how to control the inflammatory process. These began with inflixumab therapy for Crohn's disease. Additional tumor necrosis antibodies will soon be employed, and other biological agents are being investigated. Probiotics, helminth ova therapy, alternative and complementary treatments, leukocytophoresis, and bone-marrow and stem-cell transplantation are additional exciting regimens that are being explored. Although some of these approaches provide marked improvement in these parameters, others are unproven or fraught with adverse effects and complications.

METHODS: Antibody to porcine pancreatic amylase (PPA) a protease-resistant dietary protein (anti-PPA), was examined in CD patients (N = 104), ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (N = 85), and healthy controls (N = 83), and its relationship with the clinical characteristics of CD was investigated. Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), and antibodies to I2 from Pseudomonas fluorescens (anti-I2) were also examined. RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent (39/104) of the CD patients expressed anti-PPA antibodies, and this percentage was significantly higher as compared with the control group (5%, 4/83) and the UC group (9%, 8/85) (P < 0.001). A significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibodies was detected in patients with "small bowel disease-dominant" CD than in those with "colitis-dominant" CD (P < 0.05). Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin were not specifically expressed in CD patients. As ASCA was detected in 33% and anti-I2 in 46% of the CD patients, 72% of the CD patients were found positive for at least one of the three antibodies including anti-PPA antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients showed a specific antibody response to PPA, as compared with UC patients and controls. There was a significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibody in patients with "small bowel disease-dominant" CD, suggesting that dietary proteins could play a role in the inflammatory response in CD patients with small bowel disease. Anti-PPA antibodies combined with ASCA/anti-I2 may be useful for the diagnosis of CD.},

Findings revealed the macronutrient intake and dietary fiber (absolute amount) were lower than the national average in men, but this may have been due to differences in the methods used to measure dietary intake. Although the fat intake (%E) of ulcerative colitis patients in this study was similar to that of the Japanese population, it differed greatly from that of people in Western countries. No significant differences in weight, height, or body mass index were found when comparing the sample of individuals living with ulcerative colitis with the general Japanese population. Seventeen patients (65.4%) reported being cautious about what they ate even though in remission, and 6 patients were even more cautious about what they ate now than they had been in the past. The authors suggest further research to clarify the problems that unnecessary dietary restriction cause for ulcerative colitis patients who are in remission.},

Presence of melatonin (M) suggests that this hormone is somehow involved in digestive pathophysiology. Release of GI melatonin from serotonin-rich enterochromaffin EC cells of the GI mucosa suggest close antagonistic relationship with serotonin (S) and seem to be related to periodicity of food intake. Food deprivation resulted in an increase of tissue and plasma concentrations of M. Its also act as an autocrine and paracrine hormone affecting not only epithelium and immune system but also smooth muscle of the digestive tract. Low doses M improve gastrointestinal transit and affect MMC. M reinforce MMCs cyclic pattern but inhibits spiking bowel activity. Pharmacological doses of M delay gastric emptying via mechanisms that involve CCK2 and 5HT3 receptors. M released in response to lipid infusion exerts a modulatory influence that decreases the inhibitory effects of the ileal brake on gastric emptying. On isolated bowel S induces dose dependent increase in tone and reduction in amplitude of contraction which is affected by M. M reduced the tone but not amplitude or frequency of contraction. M is a promising therapeutic agent for IBS with activities independent of its effects on sleep, anxiety or depression. Since of its unique properties M could be considered for prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, gastric ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome.},

To determine the role of Zn and MT in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced model of colitis in mice, a DSS dose-response study was conducted in male C57BL/6 wild-type (MT+/+) and MT-null (MT-/-) mice by supplementing 2%, 3%, and 4% DSS in the drinking water for 6 days. In the intervention study, colitis was induced with 2% DSS, Zn (24 mg/ml as ZnO) was gavaged (0.1 ml) daily, concurrent with DSS administration, and the disease activity index (DAI) was scored daily. Histology, MT levels, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were determined. DAI was increased (P<0.05) by 16% and 21% with 3% and 4% concentrations of DSS, respectively, compared to 2%, evident after 5 days of DSS administration. MPO activity was increased in MT+/+ compared to MT-/- mice and those receiving DSS. Zn administration had a 50% (P<0.05) lower DAI compared to DSS alone. Zn partially prevented the distal colon of MT+/+ by 47% from DSS-induced damage compared to MT-/- mice. MT did not prevent DSS-induced colitis and Zn was partially effective in amelioration of DSS-induced colitis.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics therapy for mild to moderate distal UC refractory to conventional therapies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients with mild to moderate distal UC took 9 BIO-THREE tablets per day for 4 weeks. Clinical symptoms and endoscopic findings were evaluated as ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI) scores before and after administration of BIO-THREE. Fecal samples were collected from all patients before and after probiotics administration, and fecal microflora was analyzed by the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) method. RESULTS: Remission (UCDAI score < or =2) was observed in 45% (9/20) of the patients; response (decrease in UCDAI > or = 3, but final score > or = 3) in 10% (2/20); no response in 40% (8/20); and worsening (UCDAI > 3) in 5% (1/20). T-RFLP analysis indicated that the principal alteration in microflora was an increase in bifidobacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that administration of BIO-THREE improved the clinical symptoms and endoscopic findings in patients with UC, indicating that administration of BIO-THREE is safe and efficacious for the treatment of UC.},

In the TNBS-induced colitis model of rats, milk whey culture significantly accelerated the healing of the colitis in a dose-dependent manner. It has been reported that DHNA inhibited the lymphocyte infiltration through reduction of MAdCAM-1 in DSS colitis model of mice and that the ingestion of milk whey culture was effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis in human pilot study.

Measurement of the fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipid and EMP were performed in 29 UC patients, 20 CD patients, and 31 healthy controls. Anthropometric characteristics and data on dietary intake were also collected. We observed significantly lower lipid intake in UC and CD patients vs controls. The UC and CD patients had significantly higher levels of linoleic acid in their EMP than did controls. There were no significant differences in the levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but there were significantly higher levels of the n-6 in the EMP of UC and CD patients compared with controls. The significant differences persisted after the data were adjusted for potential confounders and lipid intake. Higher levels of linoleic acids and n-6 fatty acids, which are involved in production of proinflammatory mediators, were found in IBD patients compared with controls, thereby implicating n-6 fatty acids in the pathophysiology of the disease.},

   abstract = {Enterotoxemia caused by Clostridium perfringens type D in sheep is believed to result from the action of epsilon toxin (ETX). However, the sole role of ETX in the intestinal changes of the acute and chronic forms of enterotoxemia in goats remains controversial, and the synergistic action of other C. perfringens toxins has been suggested previously. The current study examined 2 goats that were found dead without premonitory clinical signs. Gross lesions at necropsy consisted of multifocal fibrinonecrotic enterocolitis, edematous lungs, and excess pleural fluid. Histologically, there were multifocal fibrinonecrotic and ulcerative ileitis and colitis, edema of the colonic serosa, and proteinaceous interstitial edema of the lungs. Clostridium perfringens type D carrying the genes for enterotoxin (CPE) and beta2 toxin (CPB2) was cultured from intestinal content and feces of 1 of 2 goats, while C. perfringens type D CPB2-positive was isolated from the other animal. When multiple colonies of the primary isolations from both animals were tested by Western blot, most of the isolates expressed CPB2, and only a few isolates from the first case expressed CPE. Alpha toxin and ETX were detected in ileal and colonic contents and feces of both animals by antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CPB2, but not CPE, was identified in the small and large intestines of both goats by immunohistochemistry. These findings indicate that CPB2 may have contributed to the necrotic changes observed in the intestine, possibly assisting ETX transit across the intestinal mucosa.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This prospective, controlled, and multicentric study evaluated nutritional status, body composition, muscle strength, and quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in clinical remission. In addition, possible effects of gender, malnutrition, inflammation, and previous prednisolone therapy were investigated. METHODS: Nutritional status (subjective global assessment [SGA], body mass index, albumin, trace elements), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, anthropometry), handgrip strength, and quality of life were assessed in 94 patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 61 female and 33 male, Crohn's Disease Activity Index 71 +/- 47), 50 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; 33 female and 17 male, Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index 3.1 +/- 1.5), and 61 healthy control subjects (41 female and 20 male) from centers in Berlin, Vienna, and Bari. For further analysis of body composition, 47 well-nourished patients with inflammatory bowel disease were pair-matched by body mass index, sex, and age to healthy controls. Data are presented as median (25th-75th percentile). RESULTS: Most patients with inflammatory bowel disease (74%) were well nourished according to the SGA, body mass index, and serum albumin. However, body composition analysis demonstrated a decrease in body cell mass (BCM) in patients with CD (23.1 kg, 20.8-28.7, P = 0.021) and UC (22.6 kg, 21.0-28.0, P = 0.041) compared with controls (25.0 kg, 22.0-32.5). Handgrip strength correlated with BCM (r = 0.703, P = 0.001) and was decreased in patients with CD (32.8 kg, 26.0-41.1, P = 0.005) and UC (31.0 kg, 27.3-37.8, P = 0.001) compared with controls (36.0 kg, 31.0-52.0). The alterations were seen even in patients classified as well nourished. BCM was lower in patients with moderately increased serum C-reactive protein levels compared with patients with normal levels. CONCLUSION: In CD and UC, selected micronutrient deficits and loss of BCM and muscle strength are frequent in remission and cannot be detected by standard malnutrition screening.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Seventy percent of Crohn's disease (CD) patients exhibit anastomotic recurrence within 1 year after ileo-caecal surgery. Recent clinical trials suggest the beneficial use of probiotics in the control of intestinal inflammation in pouchitis and ulcerative colitis. This study is a multicenter clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of an oral administration of the probiotic LAl on early post-operative endoscopic recurrence of CD. METHODS: Seventy patients with CD were enrolled prior to elective ileo-caecal resection and randomly assigned after surgery to daily treatment with either Lactobacillus johnsonii, LA1, Nestle (1010 colony-forming units, CFU) (group A, n = 34) or placebo (group B, n = 36) for 12 weeks. The primary objective was to assess the effect of LAl on the endoscopic recurrence rate at 12 weeks. Stratification was performed according to smoking status at randomization. RESULTS: Seven and 14 patients were excluded in the LA1 and placebo groups, respectively. In intention-to-treat analysis, the mean endoscopic score was not significantly different between the two treatment groups at 3 months (LA1 versus placebo: 1.50 +/- 1.32 versus 1.22+/-1.37, treatment effect: P = 0.48, smoke effect: P = 0.72). The percentage of patients with severe recurrence (i3 + i4) was 21% and 15% in the LAl and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.33). Using a per-protocol (PP) analysis, the mean endoscopic score was not significantly different between the two treatment groups (LAl versus placebo groups: 1.44 +/-1.31 versus 1.05 +/- 1.21, P = 0.32). The percentage of patients with severe recurrence (i3 + i4) was 19% and 9% in the LAl and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.054). Clinical relapse rate (CDAI [CD activity index] > 150, with an increase of CDAI > 70 points or greater from baseline) in the LAl and placebo groups was 15% (4/27) and 13.5% (3/22), respectively (PP analysis: chi-square test, P = 0.91 and log-rank test: P = 0.79). CONCLUSION: Oral administration of the probiotic LA1 in patients with CD failed to prevent early endoscopic recurrence at 12 weeks after ileo-caecal resection.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) remains unknown. It is thought to be due to an abnormal and uncontrolled immune response to normally occurring constituents of the intestine. Microbial agents appear to be involved in the pathogenesis and intestinal bacteria seem to be an important factor in the development and chronicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the colonic microbiota of a patient with UC. The colonic tissues were taken during surgery from a 12-year-old girl suffering from UC. The microbiota on the colonic samples was studied by cloning and sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA genes. Compared with healthy subjects, alteration of the dominant bacterial group was observed in the UC patient. We found a high incidence of Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides fragilis, and the single phylotype of the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii-like "Butyrate-producing bacterium" L2-6. Furthermore, there was a substantial presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the present case of UC. The high proportion of adverse proinflammatory species is striking in the present case compared with more normal situations. Even if those bacteria are not the cause of the UC, they most probably enhance the symptoms of the disease.},

   abstract = {A unified scenario emerges when it is considered that a major impact of stress on the intestinal tract is reflected by symptoms reminiscent of the diarrhea-predominant form of irritable bowel syndrome. Cramping abdominal pain, fecal urgency, and explosive watery diarrhea are hallmarks not only of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, but also of infectious enteritis, radiation-induced enteritis, and food allergy. The scenario starts with stress-induced compromise of the intestinal mucosal barrier and continues with microorganisms or other sensitizing agents crossing the barrier and being intercepted by enteric mast cells. Mast cells signal the presence of the agent to the enteric nervous system (ie, the brain-in-the-gut), which uses one of the specialized programs from its library of programs to remove the "threat." This is accomplished by stimulating mucosal secretion, which flushes the threatening agent into the lumen and maintains it in suspension. The secretory response then becomes linked to powerful propulsive motility, which propels the secretions together with the offending agent rapidly in the anal direction. Cramping abdominal pain accompanies the strong propulsive contractions. Urgency is experienced when arrival of the large bolus of liquid distends the recto-sigmoid region and reflexly opens the internal anal sphincter, with continence protection now provided only by central reflexes that contract the puborectalis and external anal sphincter muscles. Sensory information arriving in the brain from receptors in the rapidly distending recto-sigmoid accounts for the conscious sensation of urgency and might exacerbate the individual's emotional stress. The symptom of explosive watery diarrhea becomes self-explanatory in this scenario.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an acute and inflammatory disease of the large bowel of unknown aetiology. The use of probiotics for this disease remains controversial. The objective of this systematic review was to identify studies based on randomised controlled trials comparing the effect of probiotics to the effect of anti-inflammatory drugs or placebo in the remission of UC. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of clinical trials comparing the effect of probiotics to the effect of anti-inflammatory treatment or placebo in the remission of UC. PubMed, scienceDirect, Cochrane, Google scholar, metaRegister of Controlled Trials and National Institutes of Health were searched. RESULTS: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies present a significant heterogeneity concerning their methodology and their results. The improvement in UC remission and the frequency of adverse effects do not differ significantly between probiotic and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: There are a limited number of randomised trials published in the field of probiotics used for the remission of UC, and they present many methodological differences. The existing studies suggest a similar safety and efficacy of probiotics in comparison with anti-inflammatory drugs.},

   abstract = {Present-day methods of successful treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) result from a better understanding of their pathophysiology due to advances in preclinical studies in this area of knowledge. Until recently microbiological studies have been focused on the bacterial aspects in pathogenesis of GI disorders, however in the last years an interest in the presence of fungi in the gastrointestinal tract has also increased. In this study using an animal model of ulcerative colitis, the impact of fungal colonization of the colon on the intensity of inflammatory changes in the colonic mucosa and the course of their healing was carried out. The macroscopic and microscopic criteria relating to the changes of weight of examined fragments of the colon were evaluated while assessing differences between groups tested. The intensity of intestinal inflammatory changes was determined by assessment of such parameters, as colonic blood flow (CBF), the level of MPO as a marker of colonic neutrophil infiltration intensity and the plasma levels of IL-1beta; and TNF-alpha concentrations. Results at the 3rd day after TNBS rectal administration revealed an increase of weight of isolated segments of inflammed colon, a decrease of CBF and the 4-5 fold increase of plasma MPO activity. Candida colonization of colon mucosa of rats delayed healing of colonic ulcers, induced by TNBS and this was associated with the increased expression of plasma IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels. Administration of antifungal (fluconazole) or probiotic (Lacidofil) treatment to C. albicans infected rats exerted favorable effect on healing of inflammatory changes in the colon because the area of ulcerations in groups of rats treated with fluconazole or Lacidofil was significantly smaller in comparison with those inoculated with Candida solution only. Administration of fluconazole or Lacidofil significantly decreased the weight of colon segments, the MPO activity and the plasma IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels, as compared with respective values in the group receiving Candida only. The results of our studies indicate the deteriorating influence of Candida on the healing process of inflamed colon in the animal model of ulcerative colitis. Concomitant therapy with probiotic or antifungal treatment improved healing of colonic lesions, decreased the weight of inflamed colonic tissue and also attenuated the MPO activity and plasma proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels.},
