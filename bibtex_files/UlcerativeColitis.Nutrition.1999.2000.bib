   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The list of the therapeutic tools for chronic active ulcerative colitis lacks a potent and reliably absorbed immune modifier to help wean patients from steroids. We investigated whether oral microemulsion cyclosporin (Neoral) can achieve this goal. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Tertiary care referral centre. PARTICIPANTS: Nine consecutive patients facing colectomy because of steroid-dependent chronic active ulcerative colitis were studied: the disease was left-sided in six of them and had lasted a median of 10 years. Two patients depended on prednisone 12.5 mg/day, six on 25 mg, and one on 35 mg. The median cumulative steroid dose in the month preceding the trial had been 750 mg. INTERVENTIONS: Neoral was started at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day, which was then titrated to reach a whole-blood therapeutic range of 60-240 ng/ml. During the three-month trial, previous drugs were continued but steroids were tapered according to the patient's clinical condition. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of patients leaving the trial with quiescent disease and a significantly decreased need for steroids. RESULTS: Eight of the nine patients (89%) showed an initial response and commenced tapering steroids. Remission to the end of the 3rd month was observed in five cases treated with < or = 15 mg steroids daily (median cumulative dose 150 mg). Of the remaining four cases, two were partial responders and two failures, with the failure being linked to poor drug absorption in at least one patient. CONCLUSION: Neoral may help wean patients with chronic active ulcerative colitis from steroids, but this novel indication of cyclosporin must be tested in a specifically designed study.},

   abstract = {The short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are the best nutrients for the colonocytes. Glucose is poorly used as a fuel but may be transformed into SCFA by colonic bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of SCFA or glucose on experimental colitis. Colitis was induced in 30 Wistar rats by colonic instillation of 4% acetic acid. Five days later they were randomized to receive twice a day colonic lavage containing saline (controls, N = 10), 10% hypertonic glucose (N = 10) or SCFA (N = 10) until day 8 when they were killed. At autopsy, the colon was removed and weighed and the mucosa was evaluated macro- and microscopically and stripped out for DNA assay. Data are reported as mean +/- SD or median [range] as appropriate. All animals lost weight but there was no difference between groups. Colon weight was significantly lower in the SCFA group (3.8 +/- 0.5 g) than in the control (5.3 +/- 2.1 g) and glucose (5.2 +/- 1.3 g) groups (P<0.05). Macroscopically, the severity of inflammation was less in SCFA (grade 2 [1-5]) than in control (grade 9 [4-10]) and glucose-treated (grade 9 [2-10]) animals (P<0.01). Microscopically, ulceration of the mucosa was more severe in the glucose and control groups than in the SCFA group. The DNA content of the mucosa of SCFA-treated animals (8.2 [5.0-20.2] mg/g of tissue) was higher than in glucose-treated (5.1 [4.2-8.5] mg/g of tissue; P<0.01) and control (6.2 [4.5-8.9] mg/g of tissue; P<0.05) animals. We conclude that SCFA may enhance mucosal re-epithelialization in experimental colitis, whereas hypertonic glucose is of no benefit.},

Recent studies show that apoptosis may play an important role in the regulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). Therefore, this study was performed to clarify apoptosis of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and colonic mucosa of UC. METHODS: Three-color flow cytometry was used to clarify apoptosis of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and colonic mucosa of patients with active and inactive UC compared with controls using fluorescence-labeled monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies such as Fas (CD95), Fas ligand, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, etc. RESULTS: The ratio of Fas and CD45RO double-positive cells in the peripheral blood of UC patients was significantly increased in CD8 but not CD4 T cells when compared with controls. The ratio of Fas-positive and CD45RO-negative cells was significantly increased in CD4 and CD8 T cells of UC when compared with controls. There was unbalanced immunoregulation between CD4 and CD8 T cells in the colonic mucosa of UC probably due to apoptosis through Fas-Fas ligand system. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal GALT system was found in UC probably due to dysregulation of T cells through Fas-Fas ligand system.},

This study sought to characterize changes in the motility of noninflamed ileum in a rat colitis model and to explore the mechanism(s) potentially involved. The myoelectrical activity of the ileum was recorded in rats with trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. The degree of ileal and colonic inflammation was assessed by quantification of macroscopic damage and myeloperoxidase activity (MPO). The effect on ileal motility of pretreatment with atropine, indomethacin and NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) was investigated. TNBS-induced inflammation was restricted to the distal colon, as evidenced by morphological scores and MPO. Colitis was associated with increased frequency of ileal migrating motor complexes, characterized mainly by a decrease in the duration of phases I and III. The occurrence of ileal giant migrating complexes remained unchanged. The myoelectrical changes observed in the ileum persisted after treatment with atropine, indomethacin and L-NAME. Distal colitis is associated with abnormal myoelectrical activity in the noninflamed ileum of rats. Neither acetylcholine nor prostaglandins and nitric oxide seem to be involved.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: After trauma or surgery, researchers have suggested that medium-chain triglycerides have metabolic advantages, although they are toxic in large doses. To try to reduce this potential toxicity, structured lipids, which provide a higher oxidation rate, faster clearance from blood, improved nitrogen balance, and less accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system, could be used. Therefore, we evaluated, through a blind randomized study, the safety, tolerance, and efficacy of structured triglycerides, compared with long-chain triglycerides (LCT), in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. METHODS: Nineteen patients were randomized to receive long-chain or structured triglycerides as a lipid source. They received the same amount of calories (27.2/kg/d), glucose (4 g/kg/d), protein (0.2 g/kg/d), and lipids (11.2 kcal/kg/d). Patients were evaluated during and after the treatment for clinical and laboratory variables, daily and cumulative nitrogen balance, urinary excretion of 3-methyl-histidine, and urinary 3-methylhistidine/creatinine ratio. RESULTS: No adverse effect that required the interruption of the treatment was observed. Triglyceride levels and clinical and laboratory variables were similar in the two groups. A predominantly positive nitrogen balance was observed from day 2 until day 5 in the LCT group and from day 1 until day 4 in the structured triglycerides group. The cumulative nitrogen balance (in grams) for days 1 to 3 was 9.7+/-5.2 in the experimental group and 4.4+/-11.8 in the control group (p = .2). For days 1 to 5 it was 10.7+/-10.5 and 6.5+/-17.9 (p = .05), respectively. The excretion of 3-methylhistidine was higher in the control group but decreased in the following days and was similar to the experimental group on day 5. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first report in which structured triglycerides are administered in postoperative patients to evaluate safety, tolerance, and efficacy. It suggests that Fe73403 is safe, well tolerated, and efficacious in terms of nitrogen balance when compared with LCT emulsion.},

The first evidence of the importance of dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was derived from epidemiologic observations of the low incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Eskimos. The aim of this paper was to briefly review the literature on the use of n-3 fatty acids in inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease), the results of which are controversial. The discrepancies between studies may reside in the different study designs used as well as in the various formulations and dosages used, some of which may lead to a high incidence of side effects. Choosing a formulation that lowers the incidence of side effects, selecting patients carefully, and paying strict attention to experimental design are critical when investigating further the therapeutic potential of these lipids in inflammatory bowel disease.},

The aim of this study was to determine levels of vitamins A, C and E, as well as beta-carotene, selenium, zinc and copper in blood of 249 patients with precancerous lesions (atrophic gastritis, gastric hyperplastic polyp, gastric, colonic and rectal adenoma, chronic ulcerative colitis) and in 96 individuals with gastric, colonic or rectal carcinoma and to compare these levels with the values of a control group of 130 healthy individuals. We have found that the frequency of average values of analyzed micronutrients in precancerous groups was decreasing in the order vit C > vit E/vit A > Se > beta-car. The average levels of vitamins and beta-carotene were significantly reduced in all carcinoma groups, while selenium level showed a decrease only in the gastric carcinoma group. Copper level was elevated in the ulcerative colitis group and in all groups with carcinoma. The results indicate a frequent insufficient saturation of organism by natural antioxidants in groups with precancerous lesions and carcinomas of stomach and colorectum. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the general consumption of fruits and vegetables in Slovakia as a part of primary prevention of malignant diseases in these organs. Chemoprevention may be recommended in individuals with precancerous lesions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We set out to determine the direct costs of hospitalizations of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis admitted to a university-affiliated tertiary care hospital and to contrast the costs of medical versus surgical inpatient care, Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis, and to identify dominant components of inpatient costs. METHODS: We used a patient-specific case costing system at Saint Boniface General Hospital, Winnipeg, Manitoba, for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. We extracted all inpatients whose hospital discharge abstracts included ICD-9-CM codes 555 (Crohn's disease) and 556 (ulcerative colitis) among the top eight discharge diagnoses, and performed a chart review on all cases to ensure that the hospitalization was for inflammatory bowel disease and the diagnoses were accurate. We analyzed cases based on their disease diagnosis, primary mode of therapy associated with the hospitalization (medical vs surgical), and their major diagnosis-related group (DRG). This study evaluated direct patient care costs only and costs are expressed in Canadian dollars. RESULTS: Of 362 hospital admissions, 325 were eligible and of these admissions 275 belonged to the digestive system DRGs. Seventy-one (37%) were admitted more than once during the 2 yr of the study, accounting for 202 (62%) of the total number of admissions. The mean cost per admission of all cases of Crohn's disease was $3,149 (95% confidence interval [CI], $2,665-$3,634) and for ulcerative colitis was $3,726 (95% CI $3,008-$4,445). Surgical therapy cases accounted for 49.8% of all admissions, 57.8% of all hospital days, and 60.5% of all costs. Patients treated surgically had more costly hospitalizations than those treated medically, particularly when analyzing only nontotal parenteral nutrition (TPN) cases. Surgical treatment admissions were significantly more costly for ulcerative colitis digestive DRG admissions than Crohn's disease. The nondigestive DRG admissions were more costly than the digestive DRGs in all categories although this was only statistically different among medically treated Crohn's disease. Patients treated medically were similarly costly whether they had Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. There was no significant difference in cost per admission among cases admitted multiple times, compared with those admitted only once. TPN cases accounted for 9.5% of cases but 27.1% of costs. TPN-associated hospitalizations were more costly than non-TPN-use hospitalizations but these costs were primarily driven by duration of stay rather than TPN use itself. For all cases, the top five cost categories in descending order were nursing unit bed-days, drugs and pharmacy, diagnostic lab tests, operating room, and diagnostic imaging and endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Using our system we could determine direct costs for inpatients with inflammatory bowel disease and the factors that determined increased costs. Medical therapy admissions were similarly costly between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; however, surgical therapy admissions were costlier among ulcerative colitis patients. Admissions for nondigestive DRGs were more costly than those for digestive DRGs. TPN use identified a sicker group of patients who remained in the hospital longer than nonusers and, not surprisingly, these were the costliest patients.},

Continuous technological and logistical advances in the Western countries have improved the efficacy and reduced the complications of parenteral nutrition (PN) to the extent that despite the constraints of cost and infrastructure, PN is now fast growing in India. Although widespread availability is very much desired, it is important that the technique is developed with considerable expertise and used judiciously with full knowledge of its indications, limitations, dangers and benefits. Indications for PN include surgical conditions (short gut syndrome), very low birth weight infants (particularly with necrotizing enterocolitis and surgical anomalies), malabsorption syndromes, conditions requiring bowel rest (acute pancreatitis, severe ulcerative colitis and necrotizing enterocolitis) and several non-gastrointestinal indications (end stage liver disease, renal failure, multiple trauma and extensive burns). Provision of PN is associated with significant and sometimes life threatening complications. The possible complications are technical (thrombosis, perforation of vein, thrombophlebitis), infections, metabolic disturbances, hepatobiliary stenosis, cholestasis, fibrosis, cirrhosis or cholelithiasis and bone related complications like osteopenia and fractures. Meticulous monitoring is necessary not only to detect complications but also to document clinical benefit.},

In the large bowel, starches which have escaped small intestinal digestion (resistant starch), together with proteins, other undigested carbohydrates and endogenous secretions are fermented by the resident microflora. The resulting short chain fatty acids contribute substantially to the normal physiological functions of the viscera. Specific types of resistant starch (e.g. the chemically modified starches used in the food industry) may be used to manipulate the gut bacteria and their products (including short chain fatty acids) so as to optimise health. In the upper gut, these starches may assist in the transport of probiotic organisms thus promoting the immune response and suppressing potential pathogens. However, it appears unlikely that current probiotic organisms can be used to modulate large bowel short chain fatty acids in adults although resistant starch and other prebiotics can do so. Suggestions that starch may exacerbate certain conditions (such as ulcerative colitis) through stimulating the growth of certain pathogenic organisms appear to be unfounded. Short chain fatty acids may modulate tissue levels and effects of growth factors in the gut and so modify gut development and risk of serious disease, including colo-rectal cancer. However, information on the relationship between starches and the microflora is relatively sparse and substantial opportunities exist both for basic research and food product development.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of oral tacrolimus as an induction agent in steroid-refractory severe colitis. STUDY DESIGN: Open-label, multicenter trial of oral tacrolimus in patients with severe colitis. Patients not responding to conventional therapy received tacrolimus, 0.1 mg/kg/dose given twice a day, and the dosage was adjusted to achieve blood levels between 10 and 15 ng/mL. Response was defined as improvement in a number of clinical parameters (including abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and cessation of transfusions). Patients who responded by 14 days continued to receive tacrolimus, and 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine was added as a steroid-sparing agent 4 to 6 weeks after the tacrolimus was instituted. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled in the study. One patient elected to withdraw after 48 hours. Of the 13 remaining, 9 (69%) responded and were discharged. Tacrolimus was continued for 2 to 3 months in the responders, except for 1 patient who was given tacrolimus for 11 months. After 1 year of follow-up, only 5 (38%) patients were receiving maintenance therapy; the other 4 responders had undergone colectomy. CONCLUSION: Although tacrolimus is effective induction therapy for severe ulcerative or Crohn's colitis, fewer than 50% of patients treated will successfully achieve a long-term remission.},

No infectious etiology has been identified, and CRMO has been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases (including Wegener's granulomatosis and psoriasis). The relationship between CRMO and inflammatory bowel disease is poorly described. Through an internet bulletin board subscribed to by 500 pediatric gastroenterologists, we identified six inflammatory bowel disease patients (two with ulcerative colitis, four with Crohn's colitis) with confirmed CRMO. In all cases, onset of the bony lesions preceded the onset of bowel symptoms by as much as five years. Immunosuppressive therapy for the bowel disease generally resulted in improvement of the bone inflammation. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis should be considered in any inflammatory bowel disease patient with unexplained bone pain or areas of uptake on bone scan. CRMO may be a rare extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease; alternatively, certain individuals may be genetically predisposed to the development of both diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The mortality rate in severe ulcerative colitis (UC) is commonly attributed to major colonic complications or surgical procedures. Early recognition of the severity of the colitis, intensive medical treatment, and prompt surgery have all contributed to improving its outcome over the past 40 yr. Recently, we have observed some fatal cases of severe UC in which death was related to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). This complication, associated with a very high mortality rate, may occur in several acute critical diseases, both infectious and noninfectious, but has so far not been reported in UC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and outcome of MODS in severe UC. METHODS: The records of 180 consecutive patients admitted to the Gastrointestinal Unit, University of Rome for an acute severe attack of UC during the period 1976-1998 were retrospectively analyzed. Severity of UC was defined according to the criteria of Truelove and Witts. MODS was defined according to the original criteria of the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference 1992. All patients were on a standard intensive regimen consisting of total parenteral nutrition and hydrocortisone 100 mg q.i.d. Colectomy was performed according to the timing of the Oxford intensive regimen. RESULTS: Of these 180 severe UC patients, 11 (6.1%) experienced clinical and laboratory features of MODS. The lung was involved in five patients, the kidney in three, the liver in seven, the central nervous system in three, the hematological system in three, and the pancreas in one. MODS was preceded by toxic megacolon in five patients and by so-called "impending megacolon" in four, whereas in two patients no previous complications of UC were observed. MODS developed during the first attack of colitis in seven patients and during relapse in four. The overall mortality rate was 12/180 (6.6%). Of the 12 patients who died, eight (72.7%) had MODS. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that UC must be included among the causes of MODS. In our referral center for inflammatory bowel diseases, MODS was responsible for the majority of UC cases with a fatal outcome. The timely identification of signs of MODS should prompt admission to an intensive care unit and emergency surgery.},

   abstract = {An impairment of nutritional status up to real malnutrition can frequently be associated to gastrointestinal diseases. The diseases of the gastrointestinal tract can be divided into five groups: those hampering the nutrient physiological transit (especially neoplastic diseases); those affecting the intestinal mucosa (such as chronic inflammatory bowel disease); those determining intraluminal maldigestion; the hepato-biliary diseases and finally, the diseases of the pancreas. In order to correctly evaluate the nutritional status of an individual, besides the determination of the common biochemical parameters, body composition by direct and indirect techniques and energy metabolism by indirect calorimetry should be measured. Patients affected by Crohn's disease showed a lower fat mass content along with higher lipid oxidation compared to patients affected by ulcerative colitis. Patients with coeliac disease at diagnosis had a reduction in both fat and fat-free mass content along with an increased utilisation of carbohydrates as fuel substrate. There are many factors potentially leading to severe malnutrition in pancreatic diseases, especially in the acute form. Due to the primary role played by the liver in the metabolism of energy substrates, an impaired nutritional status might be commonly found in cirrhotic patients. In this connection, our group reported an increased energy expenditure and lipid oxidation, and an insulin-resistant state in compensated liver cirrhotic patients. These alterations seemed to precede and probably to lead to liver-disease-related malnutrition.},

AIM: To predict the failure of intensive intravenous treatment by combining clinical and laboratory parameters with endoscopy findings. METHODS: Retrospective study conducted in a tertiary care referral centre. Failure of intensive intravenous treatment was defined as colectomy before day 30, intravenous cyclosporin, or death. Predictive factors of outcome were assessed using univariate and multivariate prognostic analysis. RESULTS: Between January 1990 and May 1997, 85 consecutive patients were treated with intensive intravenous treatment for non-response to oral corticosteroids (n=59) and/or severe attack of ulcerative colitis (n=26). There were 41 successes and 44 failures (including 1 death, 13 cyclosporin and 30 colectomies before day 30). Multivariate prognostic analysis found that the presence of Truelove and Witts' criteria (P=0.018), an attack that had lasted more than 6 weeks (P=0.001), and severe endoscopic lesions (P=0.007) were associated with an increased risk of failure. Patients with severe endoscopic lesions and Truelove and Witts' criteria, or an attack of more than 6 weeks had a failure rate of 85-86%. CONCLUSION: Clinical, laboratory and endoscopic findings can predict the risk of failure of intensive intravenous treatment. A prospective study is required to confirm these results.},

Their association, however, has been little studied. METHOD: we retrospectively analyzed the results of liver function tests (transaminases, AST. ALT), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) in a consecutive series of 50 patients (29 men, 21 women, mean age 32 years, range 16-78 years) hospitalized for a severe attack of IBD between January 1992 and July 1997. Basal laboratory values in all patients were normal. Thirty-eight patients had ulcerative colitis (UC) and 12 had Crohn's disease (CD), which debuted in 28% of the patients. All patients were treated with methylprednisolone (MP) (0.75-1.0 mg/kg daily i.v., and received TPN. 42% (21/50) required additional treatment with CsA (5 mg/kg daily i.v.) at the beginning or during the first week of TPN and during 7-24 days, because on nonresponse to steroid treatment. Two study groups were defined according to treatment: Group I consisted of 29 patients given MP + TPN, and group II comprised 21 patients who received MP + TPN + CsA. The groups were otherwise similar in all other variables analyzed. Liver function tests were done weekly until the end of the study period. RESULTS: 62% of the patients (31/50) showed hepatobiliary dysfunction, defined previously as a 2-fold or greater elevation of two or more parameters. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of dysfunction (15/29 vs 16/21, n.s.). The parameters that showed the greatest alterations were GGT and ALT; the greatest elevation appeared during the third week of immunosuppressive treatment, and did not exceed 6-fold the normal value. The alterations disappeared once TPN and immunosuppressive treatment were discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: the hepatobiliary dysfunction in patients treated with both TPN and CsA was no more severe than associated with TPN alone.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1, is stimulated by interferon-gamma and regulates the expression of several genes implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, including interleukin-6, major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Interferon regulatory factor-1 also stimulates naive CD4+ T-cells to differentiate into T-helper-1 cells, the T-cell subset that appears to be upregulated in Crohn's disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression of IRF-1 in the nuclei of lamina propria mononuclear cells in situ in colonoscopic biopsy specimens from pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, in patients with ulcerative colitis, and in control patients with no histopathologic abnormalities. METHODS: Archival paraffin-embedded tissue sections were obtained from 25 pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, 6 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 12 control patients who had undergone colonoscopy. Tissue sections were stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-human antisera to IRF-1 and horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated, biotinylated, goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Slides were scored and scores compared among patient groups using analysis of variance. RESULTS: Patients with Crohn's disease had significantly higher IRF-1 scores (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.70-2.04) than patients with ulcerative colitis (95% CI, 0.92-1.23) or control subjects (95% CI, 1.11-1.52). CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of IRF-1 in lamina propria mononuclear cells from patients with Crohn's disease may be relevant to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Labeled leukocyte imaging is a helpful diagnostic tool in the detection of inflammation and sepsis. The technetium Tc 99m hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (99mTc HMPAO)-labeled leukocyte scan has been found to be more sensitive than the Indium-111 labeled leukocyte scan in detecting inflammatory bowel disease, with reported sensitivities of 95% to 100%. Experience with the 99mTc HMPAO-labeled leukocyte scan was examined and its clinical applications evaluated in the immediate treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken that included pediatric patients who underwent 99mTc HMPAO-labeled leukocyte scan at the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children. The disease activity of patients with inflammatory bowel disease was assessed. The leukocyte scan was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications, and images were obtained 30 minutes and 2 hours after administration of the radiopharmaceutical. RESULTS: During the period of July 1996 through November 1997, 41 scans were performed in 35 patients. Twenty-nine patients had histologically proven inflammatory bowel disease: 24 with Crohn's disease, 4 with ulcerative colitis, and 1 with indeterminate colitis. Active inflammatory bowel disease was suspected in 24 patients when the leukocyte scan was performed. Twenty of the 24 patients (83% sensitivity) had abnormal findings in leukocyte scans that prompted more aggressive management in 15 (75%). Six of the 15 who were receiving maximum medical therapy underwent surgical resection of severely affected bowel segments, and medical treatment was intensified in the other 9. The remaining 5 patients were receiving optimal medical therapy, instituted at their recent visit, and did not require further medication adjustments. Four of the 24 patients with active inflammatory bowel disease had normal leukocyte scans (17% false-negative rate), 3 of whom were receiving corticosteroid therapy at the time the scans were performed. All of the 11 patients in whom inflammatory bowel disease was in remission and 6 patients who did not have inflammatory bowel disease had normal findings in leukocyte scans (100% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: Although a tissue diagnosis is still recommended, obtained during upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations, and contrast radiography of the small bowel for the initial work-up of patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease, the 99mTc HMPAO-labeled leukocyte scan is a safe and useful diagnostic adjunct for subsequent evaluation of patients known to have inflammatory bowel disease. The results of 99mTc HMPAO-labeled leukocyte scans directly influenced treatment of 75% of the study patients with active inflammatory bowel disease, which included the decision to refer patients for surgical intervention.},

Ten patients (five male, five female; mean age = 48 +/- 12 y) with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis were investigated in a randomized cross-over design. They received either sulfasalazine (2 g/d) or omega-3 fatty acids (5.4 g/d) for 2 m.o. Disease activity was assessed by clinical and laboratory indicators, sigmoidoscopy, histology, and whole-body protein turnover (with 15N-glycine). Treatment with omega-3 fatty acids resulted in greater disease activity as detected by a significant increase in platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and total fecal nitrogen excretion. No major changes in protein synthesis and breakdown were observed during either treatment. In conclusion, treatment with sulfasalazine is superior to treatment with omega-3 fatty acids in patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis.},

More challenging is the search for clinically useful, noninvasive markers for Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis to accurately screen cases with nonspecific and indolent symptoms. Equally required are diagnostic markers that discriminate between these two disorders in cases with indeterminate colitis. Another dilemma for clinicians is that there are no simple measures to observe disease activity and predict relapses. This review describes the recent advances in diagnostic markers that afford the ability to screen for inflammatory bowel disease, discriminate between its types, and monitor disease activity. These include serological, fecal, and tissue markers; permeability tests; and diagnostic imaging using color Doppler ultrasonography.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The distinction between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is important, because treatment options and clinical course may vary. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows noninvasive transmural assessment of the intestine and may facilitate differentiation of ulcerative colitis from Crohn's disease. The objective of this prospective study was to determine whether MRI differentiates Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis in children as effectively as colonoscopy with mucosal biopsies. METHODS: Fifteen patients underwent colonoscopy with biopsies followed by abdominal MRI. The MRI diagnosis, determined by two radiologists independently completing a standardized form was compared with the gastroenterologic diagnosis. RESULTS: After colonoscopy and review of histology, Crohn's disease was diagnosed in nine patients, ulcerative colitis in five, and indeterminate colitis in one, who was excluded from study. Agreement of the MRI diagnosis with the gastroenterologic diagnosis was 4 of 4 (100%) for ulcerative colitis, 4 of 10 (40%) for Crohn's disease considering both radiologists, and 5 of 10 (50%) for Crohn's disease for each radiologist individually. Percentage of enhancement by MRI did not correlate with the severity of inflammation determined at endoscopy among the patients with Crohn's disease (r = -0.3, P = 0.366). There was agreement on severity of inflammation in three of four patients with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Current MRI interpretation of inflammatory bowel disease did not adequately recognize Crohn's disease in children. Therefore, colonoscopy with biopsy remains the most accurate tool for determining the type and severity of inflammatory bowel disease in children and adolescents.},

One reason is that ulcerative colitis, like many chronic diseases, is multifactorial. This article will describe and review the relevant literature on ulcerative colitis, including studies of (1) diet and intravenous therapy, (2) nutritional status and nutritional supplementation, and (3) bowel flora and immune function and their influences. Also, results of a retrospective chart review study that was done at a complementary medicine office will be presented. Finally, suggestions for future research will be discussed based on a nutritional model of ulcerative colitis. Taken together, it is hoped that these areas will clarify the current status of ulcerative colitis research and promote the types of investigations that are necessary to establish the validity of nutritional influences on ulcerative colitis as well as the mechanisms that are involved.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study cholesterol absorption and excretion in ileostomy subjects with different intakes of saturated fat and dietary fibre. DESIGN: Short-term experimental study, with four controlled diets in repeated measurements. SETTING: Out-patients at metabolic-ward kitchen. SUBJECTS: Nine healthy volunteers with conventional ileostomy after colectomy because of ulcerative colitis. INTERVENTIONS: Four diet periods, each of 3 days duration: high saturated fat and low dietary fibre (STAND); reduced saturated fat (RESAT); high saturated fat and high fibre (FATFIB); and reduced saturated fat and high fibre (RESATFIB). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Absorption of cholesterol, and ileal excretion of cholesterol, bile acids, fat and energy. Differences between diets evaluated with Friedman's two-way analysis of variance by rank sum with Bonferroni adjustment, and post hoc differences assessed by rank sum comparison. RESULTS: RESAT and RESATFIB reduced fractional cholesterol absorption by 7% and 10%; RESATFIB and FATFIB increased net cholesterol excretion by 46% and 54% respectively. Further, RESATFIB increased net sterol excretion by 18%, all compared to STAND (P<0.05 for all). All three intervention diets contained more phytosterols than STAND (P<0.05), and the phytosterol content was inversely correlated to fractional cholesterol absorption (r=-0.77, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Current nutrition recommendations to reduce saturated fat and increase dietary fibre affect sterol excretion additively. The effect on cholesterol absorption might be partly explained by the content of dietary plant sterols. SPONSORSHIP: Supported by grants from the Gothenburg Medical Society, grant numbers 94/086 and 99/082, and by the University of Gothenburg.},

   abstract = {The aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear. Local mediators such as arachidonic acid metabolites and peptide mediators (cytokines) appear to contribute to the disease process. The successful administration of neutralizing antibodies against TNF-alpha has confirmed a pathophysiological role for this cytokine in Crohn's disease. Established therapy of inflammatory bowel disease with 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds has been shown to reduce local leukotriene B4 formation by inhibiting lipoxygenases. This therapeutic mechanism formed one rationale for examining the effect of n-3 fatty acids, which also inhibit leukotriene B4 formation, on the course of these diseases. In the first study, published in 1989, we found no beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids in patients with Crohn's disease; however, there was clinical improvement, just falling short of significance, in patients with ulcerative colitis. Since then two uncontrolled and five controlled studies have further investigated the therapeutic effect of n-3 fatty acids in patients with ulcerative colitis. The size of the patient population in the controlled studies ranged from 10 to 96 patients in the largest study. Two of these studies showed a significant improvement in clinical activity and a steroid-sparing effect, respectively. Another study found only a trend towards improvement and one trial, which also included a treatment group receiving evening primrose oil, found no beneficial effect in the 16 patients receiving n-3 fatty acids. A large, 2 year trial of n-3 fatty acids in patients with ulcerative colitis off steroids, which was recently completed at the Universities of Munich and Mainz, showed a delay of the first episode of relapse, but no reduction in the cumulative relapse rate at 2 years. Controversial results have been published for Crohn's disease. A new enteric-coated formulation reportedly increased the proportion of patients in remission where as another trial using a conventional preparation found no significant effect.},

In general, the majority of the patients with ulcerative colitis and uncomplicated Crohn's disease can ingest a normal diet that is well balanced and without any restrictions. The intolerance to specific foods is rare in Crohn's disease and the application of exclusion diets in a routine manner is not indicated. When the nutritional status cannot be adequately maintained with normal ingestion, the use of artificial nutrition is indicated. Enteral nutrition is the first choice nutritional support system if the gastrointestinal tract is accessible and at least partially functional. In Crohn's disease enteral nutrition could have a specific anti-inflammatory effect ("primary treatment"), and it has been suggested that this could be effective to induce the clinical remission of the activity bouts of the disease. Some types of dietary fiber could be effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Initial studies suggest their usefulness in maintaining the remission of the disease.},

In this retrospective study we tried to determine whether colectomy involves a greater risk of postoperative cholecystitis in these patients than in other patients who undergo colectomy. METHODS: From 1990 to 1998 a total of 53 subtotal or total colectomies were carried out in our hospital. 35.8% of the operations were done for ulcerative colitis (group I), 58% for cancer, 1.8% for aganglionic megacolon, and 3.6% for volvular disorders (group II). RESULTS: In group I, 21% of the patients required reoperation because of postoperative acute cholecystitis. In group II there were no cases of acute cholecystitis. Neither parenteral nutrition nor diabetes were influential factors. 94.5% of the patients in group I had emergency surgery, while emergency surgery was necessary in only 38.2% of the patients in group II. CONCLUSIONS: Acute cholecystitis after colectomy for ulcerative colitis, especially when the latter arises in an emergency situation, is a common complication. Although the sample was small, the results show that in view of the mortality from cholecystitis, prophylactic cholecystectomy may be necessary.},

Ulcerative colitis is one of the most frequent causes of toxic colitis in the United States. Toxic megacolon complicating Clostridium difficile colitis is a rare occurrence with significant morbidity and mortality. CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old male presented with rectal bleeding and tenesmus. He had been treated for amebiasis with metronidazole, and had improved. Two weeks later, symptoms recurred, and he was referred to our hospital. A sigmoidoscopy and biopsies demonstrated mucosal ulcerative colitis. He underwent treatment with systemic prednisone, mesalamine, and hydrocortisone enemas with adequate response. He was asymptomatic for 2 months, but later presented with a tender abdomen and rectal bleeding. Plain abdominal and thorax films showed colonic distention and free intraperitoneal air. Emergency laparotomy was performed, and an inflamed and distended colon, with free inflammatory liquid in the peritoneum, was found. A total abdominal colectomy with temporary ileostomy and Hartmann's pouch was performed. The histopathology analysis demonstrated a Clostridium difficile pseudomembranous colitis. CONCLUSION: The presence of toxic megacolon due to Clostridium difficile in patients with ulcerative colitis is a rare complication that may be suspected in patients with initial relapse who are on antibiotics.},

Knowledge of the nutritional status in patients with recently diagnosed IBD is limited. The aim of this study was to establish a comprehensive picture of the nutritional status in recently diagnosed IBD patients. SUBJECTS: Sixty-nine IBD patients (23 Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 with ulcerative colitis (UC)) within 6 months of diagnosis and 69 age- and sex-matched population controls were included in the study. METHODS: The nutritional status was assessed by: (1) body composition (anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry); (2) dietary intake (dietary history); (3) biochemical indexes of nutrition; and (4) muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometer). RESULTS: Body weight and body mass index were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. The mean daily intake of carbohydrates was significantly higher in CD patients and the intakes of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls, respectively. Serum concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene, magnesium, selenium and zinc) were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. Serum vitamin B12 concentration was significantly lower in CD patients. Muscle strength did not significantly differ between IBD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the nutritional status of IBD patients was already affected negatively at time of diagnosis. It needs to be elucidated whether nutritional supplementation in recently diagnosed IBD patients may improve the clinical course of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dietary factors have been considered as a possible risk factor for ulcerative colitis (UC). However, available data are inconsistent. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the etiological role of dietary factors in the development of UC. METHODS: Recently diagnosed (<6 Months) UC patients (n = 43) and age- and gender-matched population controls (n = 43) were studied in a case-control design. The crosscheck dietary history method was used to assess dietary intake of 5 yr before the study. Adipose tissue fatty acid composition was used as a biomarker of long-term fat intake. Conditional logistic regression-derived odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used for statistical analysis. Dietary intake ORs were adjusted for energy intake. RESULTS: High intakes of monounsaturated fat (OR: 33.9 [95% CI 2.6-443.1]), polyunsaturated fat (OR: 5.1 [95% CI 1.0-26.7]), and vitamin B6 (OR: 6.9 [95% CI 1.6-30.7]) were associated with an increased risk to develop UC. No other significant associations were found with UC risk. CONCLUSIONS: High intakes of mono- and polyunsaturated fat and vitamin B6 may enhance the risk of developing UC. Whether this observation is a true risk factor in the development of UC or rather a reflection of a certain dietary lifestyle needs to be investigated.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess body hydration and the distribution of the body water compartments in defined populations of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with those of matched healthy controls. SUBJECTS: Fifty-two patients with IBD at time of diagnosis (20 patients with Crohn's disease (CD-new) and 32 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC-new)), 40 patients with long-standing CD (CD-long) and 2 matched healthy control groups (n = 52 and n = 40) were recruited for the study. METHODS: Total body water (TBW) and extracellular water (ECW) were measured by deuterium oxide and bromide dilution, respectively. Intracellular water (ICW) was calculated as TBW-ECW. In addition, hydration of fat-free mass (FFM) and the ECW:ICW ratio were calculated. FFM, body fat (BF) and % body fat (%BF) were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: In female IBD patients, the ECW:ICW ratio was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in controls (CD-new: 0.89+/-0.11 vs 0.79+/-0.08, P < 0.01; UC-new: 0.85+/-0.15 vs 0.77+/-0.10, P < 0.05; CD-long: 0.86+/-0.14 vs 0.80+/-0.10, P < 0.05). In these female patients, the ICW:FFM ratio was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than in controls. Fluid shifts were especially pronounced in female patients with recently diagnosed CD. In male patients with recently diagnosed UC and in those with long-standing CD, body weight, body mass index, BF and %BF were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than in controls. No differences in body hydration or body water distribution were observed between male patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: An altered body water distribution and body hydration was observed in female IBD patients, especially in female patients with recently diagnosed CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been shown to be beneficial in reducing disease activity in adult patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). However, there has been little published regarding PSC in children and no studies investigating the efficacy of UDCA as a treatment for PSC. METHODS: This retrospective study included 10 children who were found to have the diagnosis of PSC during the past 15 years at the Texas Children's Hospital and Herman Hospital, both in Houston, Texas. The male:female ratio was 8:2, the median age of onset was 12 years (range, 1-17 years), and eight patients had coexistent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; six ulcerative colitis, one Crohn's disease, one unspecified). At the time of diagnosis, five patients were asymptomatic, all of whom had IBD with elevated liver enzymes and three of whom had hepatomegaly. Nine patients were treated with UDCA. The one patient who did not receive UDCA was lost to follow-up soon after diagnosis. The mean dose of UDCA was 17 mg/kg with the doses ranging from 9 to 37 mg/kg. RESULTS: There were no side effects from the medication recorded for any of the patients. These patients showed a significant reduction in alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase at 1, 3, 6, 15, and 20 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that children with PSC treated with UDCA have significant improvements in liver biochemical indices. However, the long-term effect of UDCA on clinical outcome is unknown.},

   abstract = {Determination of plasma and tissue cytokine levels in inflammatory bowel disease have frequently resulted in conflicting data. In the present study we determined in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha liberated by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) after 48-hr culture with pokeweed mitogen (PWM). IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in the supernatant were detected by ELISA. Results show low basal levels of IL-1beta secretion by PBMC and LPMC, and a considerable increase after mitogen stimulation. Basal IL-6 production by PBMC was higher in UC patients than in controls [2029 pg/ml, CI95(-165 to 4223) vs 572 pg/ml (-383 to 1527) respectively, P = 0.05] and also after PWM activation [14,995 pg/ml (7759-22,230) vs 6598 pg/ml (3240-9956), respectively, P = 0.05]. In LPMC, no differences in IL-6 secretion were observed. TNF-alpha in activated PBMC of patients with UC was not significantly increased in relation to control (P = 0.09). No constitutive secretion of IFN-gamma was observed in mononuclear cells. IFN-gamma levels secreted by activated LPMC were lower in patients with UC than in controls [1571 pg/ml (-108 to 3251) vs 7953 pg/ml (3851-12,055), respectively, P = 0.03]. These results suggest that IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha participate as mediators in the inflammatory phenomena observed in UC. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the role of IFN-gamma in this condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A child- and adolescent-generated IBD quality-of-life index was designed to be descriptive (to be used to assess the overall impact of IBD on individual patients), and evaluative (to be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials). METHODS: Item-generation and item-reduction interviews with 82 patients with IBD aged 8 to 17 years (61 with Crohn's disease, 21 with ulcerative colitis; 36 girls, 45 boys) generated a list of ways in which their lives were affected by IBD. These issues were incorporated into an item-reduction questionnaire, which was administered to 117 patients (87 Crohn's disease, 30 ulcerative colitis). Patients indicated on a visual analog scale how important an item was to them and how often it bothered them. Mean and median importance-plus-frequency scores for each issue were calculated for the entire group and among patients in subgroups according to age and IBD type. RESULTS: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease affect the lives of children and adolescents differently. Bowel symptoms are more troubling and disabling to patients with ulcerative colitis, whereas systemic symptoms and body image concerns are greater for patients with Crohn's disease. The impact of Crohn's disease on ability to function in school and leisure activities is greater. Worries about future health problems and about the effects of IBD on the family are shared. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis trigger emotional responses of unfairness and frustration, but anger and embarrassment are more prevalent in ulcerative colitis. Disparities between age groups are fewer and less marked than those between types of IBD. CONCLUSION: In selection of items to be retained in a pediatric IBD quality-of-life measure, the variation in concerns with disease type must be considered. A single index to assess IBD-related quality of life must include items of major importance to one subgroup of patients, even if not important to all. Alternately, a core of common concerns could be supplemented by disease-specific modules, thereby increasing the content validity of the tool for all patients.},

   abstract = {Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities are responsible for the enzymatic conversion of L-arginine into NO and L-citrulline. Relatively low amounts of NO are produced in intestinal epithelial cells or are released from nerve endings. The effects of NO production are related to the maintenance of epithelial integrity and permeability. A pathological role of an increased NO production has been suggested to play a role in models of experimental colitis. In humans, NOS activity in colon mucosa from patients with ulcerative colitis is clearly increased when compared with the activity of the control group. In contrast, an increase of NOS activity in the colon mucosa from patients with Crohn's disease remains controversial. In the present work, we have measured NOS activity in colon biopsies originating from the control group (n = 16), from patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 23) and Crohn's disease (n = 17) using the radiochemical method of the conversion of L-[guanido-14C] arginine into radioactive L-citrulline. In the control group, NOS activity was mainly of the inducible type (88% of total NOS activity) since it was characterised by its insensibility to the absence of calcium in the assay medium. In colon biopsies originating from patients with ulcerative colitis, inducible NOS activity was increased 3 fold (p < 0.005) and in patients with Crohn's disease, inducible NOS activity was increased 5 fold (p < 0.005). Correlations between NOS activity in colon biopsies and the intensity parameters of the disease i.e. Truelove index, endoscopic score and histological parameters were evidenced in patients with ulcerative colitis. In contrast, in patients with Crohn's disease, the high inducible NOS activity was not correlated with any intensity parameters of the disease. From these data, we concluded that although inducible NOS activity was increased several fold in colon biopsies originating from patients with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, a correlation between this activity and the severity of bowel inflammation was not found in either cases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Degradation of the extracellular matrix and ulceration of the mucosa are major features of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). One of the most important enzymes in degrading the matrix and produced in excess by cytokine activated stromal cells, is stromelysin-1. The activity of stromelysin-1 is controlled by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1), its natural inhibitor. In model systems excess stromelysin-1 produces mucosal degradation. METHODS: Quantitative competitive RT-PCR was used to analyse stromelysin-1 and TIMP-1 transcripts; western blotting was used to measure the amount of stromelysin-1 and TIMP-1 protein in biopsy samples from children with IBD. RESULTS: In biopsies from patients with active Crohn's disease (n=24), ulcerative colitis (n=23), and controls (n=16), TIMP-1 transcripts and protein were abundant and unchanged. Stromelysin-1 transcripts and protein were markedly elevated in mucosal biopsies obtained from inflamed sites of patients with active IBD but were not elevated in adjacent endoscopically normal mucosa (n=10). Elevated levels of stromelysin-1 transcripts in active Crohn's disease (n=5) returned to normal levels following treatment with enteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Stromelysin-1 is markedly overexpressed at inflamed sites in patients with IBD whereas TIMP-1 remains unaltered. Excess stromelysin-1 is likely to be responsible for loss of mucosal integrity in IBD.},

A number of studies have examined the prevalence of abnormal bone mineral metabolism in children and adolescents. Studies, conducted over the past decade, indicate a greater likelihood of clinically significant problems in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. Corticosteroids have been proven to impair bone mineral status. It is increasingly clear that inflammation and other factors play a bigger role than malabsorbtion of minerals or vitamin D in most patients. As the use of the bisphonate class of drugs is limited in pediatric patients, there is a need to emphasize the role of diet and exercise in children and teenagers, particularly in those affected by inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {These studies were performed to test the benefit of resistant starch on ulcerative colitis via prebiotic and butyrate effects. Butyrate, propionate, and acetate are produced in the colon of mammals as a result of microbial fermentation of resistant starch and other dietary fibers. Butyrate plays an important role in the colonic mucosal growth and epithelial proliferation. A reduction in the colonic butyrate level induces chronic mucosal atrophy. Short-chain fatty acid enemas increase mucosal generation, crypt length, and DNA content of the colonocytes. They also ameliorate symptoms of ulcerative colitis in human patients and rats injected with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Butyrate, and also to a lesser degree propionate, are substrates for the aerobic energy metabolism, and trophic factors of the colonocytes. Adverse butyrate effects occur in normal and neoplastic colonic cells. In normal cells, butyrate induces proliferation at the crypt base, while inhibiting proliferation at the crypt surface. In neoplastic cells, butyrate inhibits DNA synthesis and arrests cell growth in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The improvement of the TNBS-induced colonic inflammation occurred earlier in the resistant starch (RS)-fed rats than in the RS-free group. This benefit coincided with activation of colonic epithelial cell proliferation and the subsequent restoration of apoptosis. The noncollagenous basement membrane protein laminin was regenerated initially in the RS-fed group, demonstrating what could be a considered lower damage to the intestinal barrier function. The calculation of intestinal short-chain fatty acid absorption confirmed this conclusion. The uptake of short-chain fatty acids in the colon is strongly inhibited in the RS-free group, but only slightly reduced in the animals fed with RS. Additionally, RS enhanced the growth of intestinal bacteria assumed to promote health. Further studies involving patients suffering from ulcerative colitis are necessary to determine the importance of RS in the therapy of a number of intestinal diseases and the maintenance of health.},

   abstract = {Initially, it was hoped that resistant starches (ie, starches that enter the colon) would have clear advantages in the reduction of colon cancer risk and possibly the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Recent studies have confirmed the ability of resistant starch to increase fecal bulk, to increase the molar ratio of butyrate in relation to other short-chain fatty acids, and to dilute fecal bile acids. However, reduction in fecal ammonia, phenols, and N-nitroso compounds have not been achieved. At this point the picture from the standpoint of colon cancer risk reduction is not clear. Nevertheless, there is a fraction of what has been termed resistant starch (RS1), which enters the colon and acts as slowly digested, or lente, carbohydrate. Foods in this class are low glycemic index and have been shown to reduce the risk of chronic disease. They have been associated with systemic physiologic effects such as reduced postprandial insulin levels and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Consumption of low glycemic index foods has been shown to be related to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes has in turn been related to a higher risk of colon cancer, especially colon cancer deaths. If carbohydrate has a protective role in colon cancer prevention, it may lie in the systemic effects of low glycemic index foods. The colonic advantages of different carbohydrates, therefore, remain to be documented. However, there is reason for optimism about the possible health advantages of so-called resistant starches that are slowly digested in the small intestine.},

   abstract = {Anecdotally, people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report that some foods make them feel better and some foods make them feel worse. This paper reports about the relationship between food habits and reactions to foods in people with IBD. A database was designed to incorporate the date of data collection, the IBD disease, food habits, the quantity consumed and a response rating of the subjects' reactions to each food. For each of 122 foods, subjects were asked simultaneously about these five categories. Thirty three subjects with Crohn's disease and 27 with ulcerative colitis completed the questionnaire in two seasons. The focus of the examination was directed to the upper and lower limit of reactions to foods. Foods that affect people negatively and foods that affect people positively were identified in relation to habits of consumption. Foods that affect people negatively were among those never consumed while foods that affect people positively were among the regularly consumed foods. Findings included an increased number of foods that caused problems for people with Crohn's disease when compared with people with ulcerative colitis. Problems with chocolate, dairy products, fats and artificial sweeteners were documented in both groups of IBD. A standard food list generated without the input of individuals with a chronic illness may be inadequate to collect data about their consumption since many of the foods on the list were reportedly never consumed and there may be other foods not on the list that are consumed by this chronically ill population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of 6-mercaptopurine combined with azathioprine in treating severe ulcerative colitis has been shown in several adult studies. Reported pediatric experiences are rare. The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and the potential efficacy of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis in a pediatric population. METHODS: The medical records of patients with active ulcerative colitis who were under observation at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and its satellite clinics from January 1984 through December 1997 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included who had received a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, who met no criteria for Crohn's colitis, and who had received treatment with 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine. They were then analyzed for the development of side effects, the indication to use 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine, and the ability to discontinue corticosteroid use in those patients taking 5-acetylsalicylic acid products who were corticosteroid-dependent or whose disease was refractory to treatment. Excluded from the corticosteroid analyses were patients who underwent surgery for their disease and patients treated with 5-acetylsalicylic acid only. Statistical analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and paired Student's t-test. RESULTS: In a review of 200 medical records of patients with active ulcerative colitis, 20 patients met the criteria. The patients' average age at the initiation of treatment with 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine was 13.8 years. Sixteen patients (80%) were corticosteroid dependent and 3 (15%) had ulcerative colitis refractory to corticosteroid treatment. One patient had severe colitis treated with 5-acetylsalicylic acid only. Discontinuation of corticosteroid was accomplished in 12 (75%) of 16 patients. The median time to discontinuation of corticosteroid after initiation of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine therapy was 8.4 months. Eight patients (67%), observed from 3 months to 65 months, have continued without corticosteroid therapy. Side effects included pancreatitis and shingles that resulted in discontinuation of 5-acetylsalicylic acid, leukopenia corrected by withholding 6-mercaptopurine, and self-resolved hepatitis. CONCLUSIONS: The data support the safety of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine use in the treatment of pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis; side effects were minimal and reversible. Eighteen (90%) of 20 patients tolerated the therapy well. The results also show that 12 (75%) of 16 pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis will benefit from the use of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine after initial discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. Although 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine may not prevent further relapses, medical management of these flares may be less intense and may not require long-term corticosteroid use. Prospective clinical trials in pediatric patients are necessary to delineate further the role of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine in pediatric ulcerative colitis.},

The level of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), which metabolizes 6-MP to 6-methylmercaptopurine, may reflect the risk of side effects. We sought to evaluate the relationship between the side effects of these medications and the TPMT level of pediatric patients with IBD. The medical records of our patients who were diagnosed with IBD and who received 6-MP or AZA were reviewed for measured TPMT levels. All red blood cell (RBC) TPMT levels were determined at the Mayo Medical Laboratories, Rochester, MN. The occurrence of leukopenia, elevated aminotransferases, and pancreatitis was evaluated. Twenty-two patients, mean age 13.7 years, received 6-MP or AZA and had TPMT levels measured. The TPMT levels ranged 10.7-27.5 U/mL RBC with a mean of 17.2 +/- 3.2 U/mL RBC. Two children had levels below the accepted norm of 13.8 U/mL RBC. One of these patients (50%) developed both elevation of aminotransferases and leukopenia. Of all, 20 children had normal levels, 3 (15.0%) exhibited side effects: hepatitis (n = 2) and leukopenia (n = 1). We conclude that side effects of 6-MP or AZA occur despite normal TPMT levels.},

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Muscle wasting and functional impairment follow major abdominal surgery. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing ileoanal J-pouch surgery were randomized to hGH (12 IU/day) or placebo treatment from 2 days before to 7 days after surgery. Measurements were performed 2 days before and 10, 30, and 90 days after surgery. RESULTS: The total muscle strength of four limb muscle groups was reduced by 7.6% in the hGH group and by 17.1% in the placebo group at postoperative day 10 compared with baseline values. There was also a significant difference between treatment groups in total muscle strength at day 30, and at the 90-day follow-up total muscle strength was equal to baseline values in the hGH group, but still significantly 5.9% below in the placebo group. The work capacity decreased by approximately 20% at day 10 after surgery, with no significant difference between treatment groups. Both groups were equally fatigued at day 10 after surgery, but at day 30 and 90 the hGH patients were less fatigued than the placebo patients. During the treatment period, patients receiving hGH had reduced loss of limb lean tissue mass, and 3 months after surgery the hGH patients had regained more lean tissue mass than placebo patients. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative hGH treatment of younger patients undergoing major abdominal surgery preserved limb lean tissue mass, increased postoperative muscular strength, and reduced long-term postoperative fatigue.},

However, BMD has never been studied in Asia where the demographic and socio-economic status are different from the West. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and mechanisms of osteopenia in newly diagnosed Korean patients with IBD. METHODS: We studied 14 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 25 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), all of whom had never been treated with corticosteroids. Bone mineral density was measured in the lumbar spine and the femoral neck by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Biochemical parameters including serum osteocalcin, parathyroid hormone, plasma inactive and active vitamin D, and urinary deoxypyridinoline were measured. RESULTS: The BMD Z score at the lumbar spine was lower both in CD and in UC patients, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. There was no significant difference in nutritional status or biochemical parameters of bone metabolism between patients with a normal BMD and those with a decreased BMD. CONCLUSIONS: Low BMD at the lumbar spine is common in newly diagnosed Korean patients with IBD, a result which is similar to Western studies. The mechanism for low bone mass remains undetermined; however, nutritional status and hormonal parameters of bone metabolism, and ethnic differences are not likely to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of this bone loss.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A prospective study of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Sweden was performed to investigate whether the incidence and morbidity have changed from 1984 through 1995. METHODS: Children 15 years of age or less with IBD were included--i.e., those with a definite diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and those classified as having indeterminate colitis (IC) and probable Crohn's disease (PCD). The study covered 56.5% of the pediatric population of Sweden. RESULTS: The diagnosis of IBD was made in 639 children, which corresponds to a mean annual incidence of 5.8 per 100,000. The incidence increased from 4.6 per 100,000 per year from 1984 through 1986 to 7.0 from 1993 through 1995. It reflected an increase in UC from 1.4 to 3.2 per 100,000 per year, which is a significant yearly percentage of increase (8%; confidence interval, 2-14%; P < 0.05). In contrast, no change occurred in the incidence of CD (1.2-1.3 per 100,000). The incidence of IC and PCD also remained fairly stable. The percentages of children who underwent surgery decreased from 17.3% in the first 6 years to 4.6% in the last 6 years (P < 0.001). Surgery was performed in 27.7% of CD and 5.3% of UC cases. The median age at diagnosis was 12.2 years for UC, 13.0 years for CD, 11.2 for IC, and 11.2 for PCD. At diagnosis, 48 children (7.5%) were 5 years of age or less, whereas most of the patients were 11 years of age or more (398 children, 62.3%). CONCLUSIONS: In Sweden, the incidence of UC has increased, whereas that of CD remains the same. A significant number of children were classified with IC and PCD. In most children, IBD was diagnosed when they were 11 years old or more, but some cases were detected even in those below 6 years of age. A decrease in the frequency of surgery occurred during the study.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide is a luminally acting, bacterially derived cell poison that has been implicated in ulcerative colitis. Sulfide generation in the colon is probably driven by dietary components such as sulfur-containing amino acids (SAAs) and inorganic sulfur (eg, sulfite). OBJECTIVE: We assessed the contribution of SAAs from meat to sulfide production by intestinal bacteria with use of both a model culture system in vitro and an in vivo human feeding study. DESIGN: Five healthy men were housed in a metabolic suite and fed a sequence of 5 diets for 10 d each. Meat intake ranged from 0 g/d with a vegetarian diet to 600 g/d with a high-meat diet. Fecal sulfide and urinary sulfate were measured in samples collected on days 9 and 10 of each diet period. Additionally, 5 or 10 g bovine serum albumin or casein/L was added to batch cultures inoculated with feces from 4 healthy volunteers. Concentrations of sulfide, ammonia, and Lowry-reactive substances were measured over 48 h. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SEM) fecal sulfide concentrations ranged from 0.22 +/- 0.02 mmol/kg with the 0-g/d diet to 3.38 +/- 0.31 mmol/kg with the 600-g/d diet and were significantly related to meat intake (P: < 0.001). Sulfide formation in fecal batch cultures supplemented with both bovine serum albumin and casein correlated with protein digestion, as measured by the disappearance of Lowry-reactive substances and the appearance of ammonia. CONCLUSION: Dietary protein from meat is an important substrate for sulfide generation by bacteria in the human large intestine.},

This review highlights the past year's advances concerning epidemiologic studies, new diagnostic considerations, and novel therapeutic approaches. Epidemiologic studies confirmed that Crohn's disease is being increasingly diagnosed in children, whereas the incidence of ulcerative colitis has remained stable. African-American children are as likely to have inflammatory bowel disease as other children. Serologic assays specific for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can assist clinicians in screening for inflammatory bowel disease, as well as discriminating between the two diseases. Studies have revealed that osteopenia and antioxidant vitamin deficiency are common and require screening in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Increasing experience with immunosuppressive drugs (6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine) point to their efficacy and generally good toxicity profile in pediatric patients.},

Cytokine secretion, which is important in the regulation of normal gastrointestinal immune responses, appears to be dysregulated in IBD. In Crohn's disease, there appears to be an excessive T(H)1 T-cell response to an antigenic stimulus, leading to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-12, IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). In ulcerative colitis, a T(H)2 T-cell response appears to be the pathological process responsible for the inflammatory disease. New and innovative therapeutic strategies targeting cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, are producing some promising results in animal and human studies. As more is learned about the complex cytokine interactions in IBD, more effective treatments will undoubtedly ensue.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ileal dysfunction, and resection or exclusion may affect intestinal bile acid resorption resulting in alterations in serum lipid concentration. In restorative proctocolectomy, the different procedures may involve the ileum in all three ways. AIM: The aim of the present study was to analyse possible changes of the blood lipid profile during the different steps of restorative proctocolectomy operative procedure. METHOD: There were nineteen elective patients on their ordinary diet and 19 emergency patients on total parenteral nutrition. The former group were primarily operated on with colectomy; ileoanal pouch and loop ileostomy while the later group had had an emergency colectomy and terminal ileostomy before the pouch operation. Thirty five of the patients had ulcerative colitis, 2 had familial colon polyposis and 1 familial cancer syndrome. Blood specimens were collected in the mornings with the patients in a fasting state. The emergency patients were on unchanged ordinary diet during the preoperative period. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride were determined by enzymatic methods. Lipoproteins, studied only in the elective patients, were analysed by a combination of ultracentrifugation and precipitation. Student's t-test with Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons was used for statistic calculations. RESULTS: Preoperatively, the emergency group had significantly lower serum cholesterol but not serum triglycerides values compared to the elective group. This finding is probably due to difference in the preoperative nutrition. The cholesterol levels among patients who received steroids in the two groups were compared and found to be significantly lower in the emergency group. Later, no significant differences concerning cholesterol and triglycerides were found between the groups. The cholesterol level was not significantly different in the elective group between patients who receive hydrocortisone and those who did not. During the period with loop ileostomy cholesterol was significantly lowered while the triglycerides were significantly increased compared to the preoperative values of the elective group. The decrease of serum cholesterol levels was correlated to the length of the excluded ileum. During the same period alpha-lipoprotein decreased significantly and reached values below the normal of the reference material. Beta-lipoproteins, which were subnormal already preoperatively, increased but not significantly. Pre-beta-lipoproteins were at the same level at all stations. At 12 months with functioning pouches all analysed values, with the exception of beta-lipoproteins. were within the normal limits set by the reference material. In the emergency group the patterns for triglycerides and cholesterol were similar but for the preoperatively depressed cholesterol values. After 12 months with functioning pouch the serum cholesterol and triglycerides were at the same level as for the elective patients. CONCLUSION: A serum lipid profile was studied in patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy. Serum cholesterol and alpha-lipoprotein decreased and triglycerides increased when the patients had a diverting loop ileostomy. At 12 months after it's closure and with a functioning pouch, the patients had the same profile as the elective patients preoperatively, and with exception of beta-lipoproteins within normal limits in spite of the loss of the colon and the construction of a pouch of the distal ileum.},

The lowering of serum cholesterol by plant sterols is believed to be the result of an inhibition of cholesterol absorption in the small bowel, although increased bile acid excretion has also been suggested. The difference in effect of saturated and unsaturated plant sterols on cholesterol absorption needs to be elucidated further. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to measure small-bowel cholesterol absorption and sterol excretion in addition to hepatic cholesterol synthesis after intake of soy sterol esters and beta-sitostanol ester corresponding to 1.5 g plant sterols/d. DESIGN: Seven ileostomy subjects were studied during a control period and 2 intervention periods when either soy sterol esters or beta-sitostanol ester was added to a basal diet. Ileostomy bags were collected every other hour and frozen immediately for analysis of nutrients and sterols. RESULTS: Cholesterol absorption was 56% (43-65%) in the control period and decreased to 38% (32-46%) in the soy sterol ester period (P = 0.00) and to 39% (30-48%) in the beta-sitostanol ester period (P = 0.00). CONCLUSION: Esterified soy sterols and beta-sitostanol inhibited cholesterol absorption equally, despite the different structures of the plant sterols.},

AIMS: To study generation of hydrogen sulphide by sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) and the effects of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in patients with ulcerative colitis in order to identify a role of this noxious agent in pathogenesis. PATIENTS: Fresh faeces were obtained from 37 patients with ulcerative colitis (23 with active disease) and 16 healthy controls. METHODS: SRB were enumerated from fresh faecal slurries and measurements made of sulphate reducing activity, and sulphate and hydrogen sulphide concentrations. The effect of 5-ASA on hydrogen sulphide production was studied in vitro. RESULTS: All controls and patients with active ulcerative colitis carried SRB and total viable counts were significantly related to the clinical severity grade. SRB were of two distinct types: rapidly growing strains (desulfovibrios) which showed high sulphate reduction rates, present in 30% of patients with ulcerative colitis and 44% of controls; and slow growing strains which had little activity. In vitro, 5-ASA inhibited sulphide production in a dose dependent manner; in patients with ulcerative colitis not on these drugs faecal sulphide was significantly higher than in controls (0.55 versus 0.25 mM, p=0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Counts and carriage rates of SRB in faeces of patients with ulcerative colitis are not significantly different from those in controls. SRB metabolism is not uniform between strains and alternative sources of hydrogen sulphide production exist in the colonic lumen which may be similarly inhibited by 5-ASA. The evidence for hydrogen sulphide as a metabolic toxin in ulcerative colitis remains circumstantial.},

Key pathogenetic events, such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression on intestinal epithelial cells and local production of cytokines in the gastrointestinal mucosa, are common features of many gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders. Drawing from clinical experience of the treatment of other disorders associated with gastrointestinal inflammation, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, a number of therapeutic alternatives may be relevant for the bone marrow transplant patient with significant graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD). Options to consider include therapeutics that alter inflammatory cell migration, anti-inflammatory cytokines, direct neutralization of proinflammatory cytokines, and cytokines that promote epithelial restitution in the gastrointestinal mucosa. In addition, a variety of nutritional and other novel treatments are available, which may improve epithelial function or which have anti-inflammatory actions. Prospective studies of combined nutrient and cytokine-modulating treatments for the bone marrow transplant patient are warranted.},

   abstract = {Hydrogen sulphide is produced in the human large intestine by the bacterial reduction of dietary inorganic sulphate and sulphite and by fermentation of sulphur amino acids. Sulphide may damage the colonic epithelium and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. The accurate measurement of sulphide in biological samples, particularly in gut contents is difficult due to the volatile nature of the compound, and the viscosity and turbidity of the samples. Here we describe a method for the determination of sulphide in gut contents and whole blood which overcomes these problems. Initially, samples are treated with zinc acetate to trap sulphide. A microdistillation pretreatment is then used, which releases sulphide from its stable, stored state, coupled to ion chromatography with electrochemical detection. The limit of detection of the method was determined as 2.5 micromol/l, which enabled sulphide levels in gut contents and whole blood samples obtained from humans to be accurately determined. A preliminary investigation in healthy human subjects showed blood sulphide ranged from 10 to 100 micromol/l. Whole blood sulphide did not change significantly when increasing amounts of protein from meat were fed. However, faecal sulphide did show a significant increase from 164 to 754 nmol/g in four subjects fed diets which contained 60 and 420 g meat.},

The importance of these colonic L-cells for postprandial GLP-1 was determined in healthy control subjects and in ileostomy patients with minimal small bowel resection (<5 cm). Subjects were fed a high complex carbohydrate test meal (15.3 g starch) followed by two carbohydrate-free, high fat test meals (25 g and 48.7 g fat respectively). Circulating levels of glucose, insulin, glucagon, glucose insulinotrophic peptide (GIP) and GLP-1 were measured over a 9-h postprandial period. For both subject groups the complex carbohydrate test meal failed to elicit a rise in either GIP or GLP-1. However, both hormones were elevated after the fat load although the GLP-1 concentration was significantly reduced in the ileostomist group when compared with controls (P=0.02). Associated with this reduction in circulating GLP-1 was an elevation in glucagon concentration (P=0.012) and a secondary rise in the plasma glucose concentration (P=0.006). These results suggest that the loss of colonic endocrine tissue is an important determinant in the postprandial GLP-1 concentration. Ileostomists should not be assumed to have normal enteroinsular function as the colon appears to have an important role in postprandial metabolism.},

METHODS: This study was a review of medical records of all women who required parenteral nutrition during pregnancy at our institution from 1990-1997. The frequency of maternal and perinatal complications was calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-six pregnancies required parenteral nutrition for the following indications: hyperemesis gravidarum (n = 16), cholecystitis/pancreatitis (n = 3), small bowel obstruction (n = 2), intracranial bleed (n = 2), ulcerative colitis (n = 1), and other (n = 2). The mean gestational age at initiation of therapy was 16.2 weeks and the mean duration of therapy was 30.6 days. Five pregnancies were terminated prior to fetal viability. Of the remaining pregnancies, obstetric complications occurred in 11, including two cases of idiopathic preterm labor resulting in preterm deliveries. Maternal complications resulting from the central venous catheters included four infections, two thromboses, one occlusion, one pneumothorax, and one catheter dislodgment. The complication rate for centrally inserted central catheters (50%) was significantly greater than the rate for peripherally inserted central catheters (9%). CONCLUSIONS: Successful outcomes can be achieved in obstetric patients requiring parenteral nutrition. In this group of patients, the frequency of maternal complications secondary to centrally inserted central venous catheters was greater than that reported in nonpregnant patients. Peripherally inserted central catheters may be preferable when parenteral nutrition is required during pregnancy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The breakdown of glycosaminoglycans is an important consequence of inflammation at mucosal surfaces, and inhibition of metalloprotease activity may be effective in treating chronic inflammation. AIM: To report an alternative approach, using the nutriceutical agent N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc), an amino-sugar directly incorporated into glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins, as a substrate for tissue repair mechanisms. METHODS: GlcNAc (total daily dose 3-6 g) was administered orally as adjunct therapy to 12 children with severe treatment-resistant inflammatory bowel disease (10 Crohn's disease, 2 ulcerative colitis). Seven of these children suffered from symptomatic strictures. In addition, similar doses were administered rectally as sole therapy in nine children with distal ulcerative colitis or proctitis resistant to steroids and antibiotics. Where pre- and post-treatment biopsies were available (nine cases), histochemical assessment of epithelial and matrix glycosaminoglycans and GlcNAc residues was made. FINDINGS: Eight of the children given oral GlcNAc showed clear improvement, while four required resection. Of the children with symptomatic Crohn's stricture, only 3 of 7 have required surgery over a mean follow-up of > 2.5 years, and endoscopic or radiological improvement was detected in the others. Rectal administration induced remission in two cases, clear improvement in three and no effect in two. In all cases biopsied there was evidence of histological improvement, and a significant increase in epithelial and lamina propria glycosaminoglycans and intracellular GlcNAc. CONCLUSIONS: GlcNAc shows promise as an inexpensive and nontoxic treatment in chronic inflammatory bowel disease, with a mode of action which is distinct from conventional treatments. It may have the potential to be helpful in stricturing disease. However, controlled trials and an assessment of enteric-release preparations are required to confirm its efficacy and establish indications for use.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of dysplasia and the mucosal adaptation patterns of pelvic pouches in children and adolescents who had undergone ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Between 1982 and 1996, 176 pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis underwent ilial pouch-anal anastomosis. Seventy-six patients were followed up after surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. Pouch biopsy specimens were reviewed for dysplasia and to determine mucosal adaptation patterns. Fifty-eight of the 76 patients had an average of three mucosal biopsies during a mean follow-up of 5 years. Demographic and surgical data were abstracted from archives of medical records. All previously obtained pouch biopsy specimens were re-evaluated by a single pathologist to ensure standardized interpretation. RESULTS: No dysplasia was identified in screening specimens of 76 children and adolescents including 5 patients who showed dysplasia in resected colon specimens. The pattern of mucosal adaptation was categorized using previously reported criteria. Type A was defined as normal mucosa or mild villous atrophy with no or mild inflammation. Type B mucosa showed transient atrophy with temporary moderate inflammation followed by normalization of architecture. Type C mucosa was defined as a pattern of persistent atrophy with severe inflammation. In the study cohort, the patterns of mucosal adaptation, type A (56.9%; n = 33), type B (32.8%; n = 19), and type C (10.3%; n = 6), were comparable with those reported in adults. The rate of pouch failure and diagnosis of Crohn's disease were similar in each group and were not related to the specific adaptation pattern. Most of the patients with type C mucosa had clinical symptoms of pouchitis requiring periodic antibiotic therapy. No dysplasia was identified in any biopsy specimen reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Similar morphologic changes can be seen in ileal pouches in pediatric and adult patients. There seemed to be no increased risk of dysplasia in children and young adults who had undergone ilial pouch-anal anastomosis surgery for ulcerative colitis during a 5 year follow-up. Because the long-term risk of development of dysplasia is unknown, an initial screening should be performed 5 years after the creation of a pelvic pouch in children or when the total disease duration exceeds 7 years. Once identified, patients with Type C mucosa should have annual screening for dysplasia until further data become available.},

Laminin, the major noncollagenous component of the basement membrane, plays a role in epithelial basal lamina formation and promotes differentiation of human enterocytes. We therefore investigated the distribution of laminin in ulcerative colitis affected colonic tissues. Tissue specimens from both affected and nonaffected colonic regions were obtained from ten patients with ulcerative colitis during colonoscopies or operations. Healthy tissue from five patients with colorectal cancer was used as control. After histological classification, the localization and distribution of the basement membrane associated extracellular matrix proteins were determined by immunohistochemistry. Paraffin-embedded sections were incubated with antibodies against laminin and type IV and V collagen. No positive immunoreactivity against laminin was found in most of the epithelial basement membranes surrounding the crypts in affected colonic tissues, without involvement of the subendothelial structures. In contrast, a type IV and V collagen accumulation occurred in all these tissue samples. The lack of laminin in combination with an overexpression of type IV and V collagen, as reported for the first time in this paper, leads to changes in basement membrane structure. These findings indicate that the three-dimensional network of the colonic epithelial basement membrane and its function are seriously disturbed in exacerbating ulcerative colitis. This provides new insights into the importance of cell-matrix interactions for physiological and pathological mechanisms in the etiology of ulcerative colitis.},

Twenty-two patients with severely and moderately active ulcerative colitis (8 severe and 14 moderate) and 12 patients with Crohn's colitis were analyzed retrospectively. Eleven of 22 patients with ulcerative colitis were treated with TPN and corticosteroids (TPN group). The remaining 11 patients were treated with corticosteroids alone and hospital meals (oral diet group). Both groups were matched regarding disease severity at pretreatment. The clinical characteristics, and the initial and total dosages of corticosteroids for 3 weeks were similar between the two groups. The authors compared the changes in the clinical, inflammatory, and nutritional parameters and short-term outcome between the TPN and the oral diet groups with ulcerative colitis. The same evaluations were also made for 12 patients with Crohn's colitis who received TPN (CD group). The TPN group did not show any significant improvement in the clinical parameter, inflammatory signs, or nutritional state compared with the oral diet group with ulcerative colitis. The remission rate after 3 weeks of therapy and a colectomy rate also showed no significant difference between the two groups. In contrast, TPN resulted in a disappearance of clinical symptoms and an improvement in both the inflammatory and nutritional parameters in the CD group. Only one of the 12 patients with Crohn's colitis underwent colectomy. TPN induced no additional benefit in corticosteroid therapy in an acute attack of ulcerative colitis. In contrast, TPN may have primary effects on Crohn's colitis.},

   abstract = {Most conventional forms of drug therapy suppress or modify the host immunoinflammatory response and neglect the other contributor to disease pathogenesis-the environmental microflora. Probiotics are live microbial food ingredients that alter the enteric microflora and have a beneficial effect on health. The rationale for using probiotics in IBD is mainly based on evidence from human studies and experimental animal models implicating intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The relationship between bacteria and intestinal inflammation is complex and does not appear to reflect a simple cause and effect. Similarly, the field of probiotics is complex and in need of rigorous research. Until the indigenous flora are better characterized and mechanisms of probiotic action defined, the promise of probiotics in IBD is unlikely to be fulfilled. Because of strain-specific variability and clinical and therapeutic heterogeneity within Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, it cannot be assumed that a given probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Although preliminary results of probiotic therapy in animal models and humans with ulcerative colitis and pouchitis have been encouraging, their efficacy in treatment or maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease remains to be clarified. However, the circumstantial evidence for some form of biotherapeutic modification of the enteric flora in Crohn's disease seems compelling. In the future, probiotics may offer a simple adjunct to conventional therapy with the emphasis on diet shifting from one of nutritional replenishment alone to a more functional role.},

   abstract = {Human beings evolved consuming a diet that contained about equal amounts of n-3 and n-6 essential fatty acids. Over the past 100-150 y there has been an enormous increase in the consumption of n-6 fatty acids due to the increased intake of vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseed, and soybeans. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids ranges from approximately 20-30:1 instead of the traditional range of 1-2:1. Studies indicate that a high intake of n-6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction and decreases in bleeding time. n-3 Fatty acids, however, have antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. These beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids have been shown in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and, in some patients with renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most of the studies were carried out with fish oils [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. However, alpha-linolenic acid, found in green leafy vegetables, flaxseed, rapeseed, and walnuts, desaturates and elongates in the human body to EPA and DHA and by itself may have beneficial effects in health and in the control of chronic diseases.},

Specifically, this involves interactions between the resident microbiota and dietary ingredients that support their activities. Currently, it is accepted that the gut microflora contains pathogenic, benign and beneficial components. Some microbially induced disease states such as acute gastroenteritis and pseudomembranous colitis have a defined aetiological agent(s). Speculation on the role of microbiota components in disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, bowel cancer, neonatal necrotising enterocolitis and ulcerative colitis are less well defined, but many studies are convincing. It is evident that the gut microflora composition can be altered through diet. Because of their perceived health-promoting status, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are the commonest targets. Probiotics involve the use of live micro-organisms in food; prebiotics are carbohydrates selectively metabolized by desirable moieties of the indigenous flora; synbiotics combine the two approaches. Dietary intervention of the human gut microbiota is feasible and has been proven as efficacious in volunteer trials. The health bonuses of such approaches offer the potential to manage many gut disorders prophylactically. However, it is imperative that the best methodologies available are applied to this area of nutritional sciences. This will undoubtedly involve a genomic application to the research and is already under way through molecular tracking of microbiota changes to diet in controlled human trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (TPCIAA) is the procedure of choice for patients with Ulcerative Colitis and Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. The frequency of presentation of both diseases is low in Mexico, therefore the experience with the surgical procedure is limited. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the operative morbidity and mortality and long-term functional results in a series of patients operated upon with the TPCIAA in a referral center in Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 44 consecutive patients operated upon from 1987 through 1997. The operation included resection of the anal transitional zone, handsewn anastomosis of a "J" pouch, and diverting ileostomy in all cases. Operative morbidity and mortality, and long-term functional results and complications were determined. RESULTS: Mean age was 33 +/- 15 years. There were 52% women and 48% men. Diagnoses were ulcerative colitis in 59% and familial polyposis in 36%. Global morbidity was 39%, and mortality 2%. With a mean follow-up of 24 months, mean number of bowel movements was 4, 10% of patients had diurnal spotting, 30% nocturnal spotting, and no patient had gross incontinence. Three patients presented pouchitis with adequate response to antibiotics. Two patients presented long-term pouch fistulas that did not require pouch excision. CONCLUSIONS: The TPCIAA is a feasible operation with acceptable rates of morbidity and mortality and satisfactory functional results.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eosinophils may be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this study was to verify whether concentrations of eosinophilic cationic protein in gut lavage fluid from children with inflammatory bowel disease correlate with clinical and laboratory indexes of disease activity. METHODS: Twenty-three children with Crohn's disease, 14 with ulcerative colitis, and 22 age-matched control subjects entered the study. Radioimmunoassay and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques were used to measure eosinophilic cationic protein, total immunoglobulin G and interleukin-1beta, respectively. RESULTS: Gut lavage eosinophilic cationic protein levels were significantly (p < 0.005) higher in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in control subjects. Intestinal eosinophilic cationic protein levels decreased in three of four children with Crohn's disease who were fed an elemental diet. There was a significant (p < 0.001) correlation between eosinophilic cationic protein concentrations and immunoglobulin G and interleukin-1beta levels in gut lavage fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated intestinal eosinophilic cationic protein levels in inflammatory bowel disease suggest that eosinophils are involved in the gastrointestinal inflammation in this disease. Intestinal eosinophilic cationic protein concentration is another marker with which to discriminate between active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Decreased synthesis of the predominant secretory human colonic mucin (MUC2) occurs during active ulcerative colitis. AIMS: To study possible alterations in mucin sulphation and mucin secretion, which could be the cause of decreased mucosal protection in ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Colonic biopsy specimens from patients with active ulcerative colitis, ulcerative colitis in remission, and controls were metabolically labelled with [35S]-amino acids or [35S]-sulphate, chase incubated and analysed by SDS-PAGE, followed by quantitation of mature [35S]-labelled MUC2. For quantitation of total MUC2, which includes non-radiolabelled and radiolabelled MUC2, dot blotting was performed, using a MUC2 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: Between patient groups, no significant differences were found in [35S]-sulphate content of secreted MUC2 or in the secreted percentage of either [35S]-amino acid labelled MUC2 or total MUC2. During active ulcerative colitis, secretion of [35S]-sulphate labelled MUC2 was significantly increased twofold, whereas [35S]-sulphate incorporation into MUC2 was significantly reduced to half. CONCLUSIONS: During active ulcerative colitis, less MUC2 is secreted, because MUC2 synthesis is decreased while the secreted percentage of MUC2 is unaltered. Furthermore, sulphate content of secreted MUC2 is unaltered by a specific compensatory mechanism, because sulphated MUC2 is preferentially secreted while sulphate incorporation into MUC2 is reduced.},

   abstract = {Although up to 20% of patients with Crohn's disease have their first flare during childhood or adolescence, there are no or only a few randomized, controlled studies. However, big differences and uncertainty may be observed between the diagnosis and therapy of pediatricians and gastroenterologists specialized for adults. In addition, special problems result from the enormous somatic and psychological evolution during adolescence. The diagnosis is done as in adult patients by enteroclysm and ileocolonoscopy (including multiple biopsies) whereas a deep sedoanalgesia or anesthesia should be performed routinely. Corticosteroids are the gold standard for therapy of Crohn's disease in the adolescence (especially in cases with high inflammatory activity), but also enteral nutrition over 4-12 weeks--or a combination of both. A recent randomized controlled study demonstrates the positive effect of 6-mercaptopurine in newly diagnosed patients with Crohn's disease in the adolescence. 5-aminosalicylates or the probably more effective azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine could be used for prevention of recurrence in Crohn's disease. The therapy of ulcerative colitis is performed as in adults including the very effective local rectal applications. An accompanying psychosomatic therapy is recommended especially in young patients with disturbed separation from the parents and inadequate coping. The indication for surgery is similar to adults. However, a specific indication for earlier surgery is given, if severe malabsorption and delay of growth takes place in spite of adequate therapy, because this delay of growth could be only caught up before puberty. A conservative therapeutic regimen is recommended in young patients with perianal Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Till about 3 decades ago, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was considered as non-existent in our country. However, since that time several reports of IBD, mainly ulcerative colitis have been published. More recently, Crohn's disease is also being reported from the country. This trend of UC appearing first in a population followed by CD also appears to be true in other developing nations. A substantial increase in the rates of CD over UC in the last few decades is reported from developed nations as well. Of the other epidemiological factors, an increased risk of CD and lower risk of UC in smokers is established in adults. However, it appears that smoking increases the risk of IBD in children. The etiology of IBD remains elusive. Within the triad of genetics, immunity and antigen responsible for the development of IBD, maximum advances have been made in the field of immune aberrations and this is being exploited to treat the disease. It is well established that IBD results from a disordered immune system in the gut, in response to an unidentified antigen in a predisposed individual. The immune response is enhanced and revolves around antigen-presenting cells, CD 4 T-lymphocytes and tumor necrosis factor alpha. CD results from an enhanced Th1 activity. The pathogenesis of UC is less clear but appears to be humoral. Advances in diagnostics include the availability of serology, ultrasound and nuclear scans, none of which have been tried in our setting where infectious diseases and tuberculosis is rampant. Growth failure and the importance of nutrition in IBD, especially CD, cannot be underemphasized. In many situations nutritional interventions have been used solely as a form of therapy for CD. Newer steroid molecules with minimal systemic effects are also being considered. Other treatment options highlighted are the use of immunosuppressive agents, biologic agents and role of surgery.},

   abstract = {Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially butyrate, play central metabolic roles in maintaining the mucosal barrier in the gut. A lack of SCFA, leading to endogenous starvation of enterocytes, may be the cause of ulcerative colitis and other inflammatory conditions. The main source of SCFA is dietary fibre, but they can also be derived from structured lipids, e. g. tributyrin. Once absorbed by non-ionic diffusion or carrier-mediated anion exchanges, SCFA are either used locally as fuel for the enterocytes or enter the portal bloodstream. Butyrate has been shown to increase wound healing and to reduce inflammation in the small intestine. In the colon, butyrate is the dominant energy source for epithelial cells and affects cellular proliferation and differentiation by yet unknown mechanisms. Recent data suggest that the luminal provision of butyrate may be an appropriate means to improve wound healing in intestinal surgery and to ameliorate symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

METHODS: Data were collected from 24 patients aged 4.5 to 23 years who had inflammatory bowel disease. Platelet count, antithrombin, fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment F1+2, soluble thrombomodulin, tissue plasminogen activator, D-dimer, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen were investigated. In addition the response to activated protein C, the factor V R506Q mutation, protein C, free protein S antigen, and lipoprotein (a) were analyzed. These data were compared with medical treatment, duration, and disease activity, estimated with the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index or the Clinical Colitis Activity Index. RESULTS: Forty-five percent of our patients showed an increase in fibrinogen, 29% in prothrombin fragment F1+2, and 20% in platelet count, plasminogen activator inhibitor- antigen, and soluble thrombomodulin. Thrombomodulin was higher in active disease than in inactive disease and in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. Fibrinogen was also higher with Crohn's disease and tended to be higher in active disease than in ulcerative colitis and inactive disease. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen was significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in those with ulcerative colitis and was higher in the patient group treated with steroids. CONCLUSION: As has been shown in adults, young patients with active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease were found to have abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis. The relevance as a thromboembolic risk factor is discussed.},

In fact several studies quoted by Cox (1995) found that the Majority of IBD patients, even the one's who considered themselves "well," experienced some impairment in quality of life. Early detection of IBD is essential in developing patient confidence and providing motivation for cooperation in treatment. Irvine (1997) conducted a study dealing with the quality of life issues with IBD and concluded that despite impairments, most patients with IBD overcame the obstacles imposed by their illness and managed to remain productive members of society. Similar management (with anti-inflammatory drugs) makes differentiating between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis during the early stages of the disease, unnecessary. Situations that require differentiation include: right sided pain or tenderness, steatorrhea, nutritional deficiencies, or a palpable mass (Macrae & Bhathal, 1997). Although IBD continues to be of unknown etiology, recent advances and further study in the areas of the immune system, genetics and environmental influences may provide helpful treatment options in the future. For now, the clinician/patient goal must be to maintain adequate nutrition, promote healing, treat complications, and maintain an optimal lifestyle.},
