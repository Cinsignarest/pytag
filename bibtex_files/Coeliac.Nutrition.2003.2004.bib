   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide health care providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data regarding celiac disease. PARTICIPANTS: A non-DHHS, non-advocate 13-member panel representing the fields of internal medicine, gastroenterology, medical genetics, pathology, endocrinology, nutrition, and a consumer representative. In addition, 19 experts in related fields presented data to the panel and to the conference audience. EVIDENCE: Presentations by experts; a systematic review of the medical literature provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; and an extensive bibliography of celiac disease research papers, prepared by the National Library of Medicine. Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience. CONFERENCE PROCESS: Answering pre-determined questions, the panel drafted its statement based on scientific evidence presented in open forum and on the published scientific literature. The draft statement was read in its entirety on the final day of the conference and circulated to the audience for comment. The panel then met in executive session to consider the comments received, and released a revised statement later that day at http://consensus.nih.gov. This statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the NIH or the Federal Government. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated intestinal disorder with protean manifestations. Celiac disease is common, affecting 0.5 to 1.0 percent of the general population of the United States, but is greatly underdiagnosed. There are now specific and sensitive serologic tests available to aid in diagnosis that need to be more widely applied. The treatment of celiac disease remains a lifelong gluten-free diet, which results in remission for most individuals. The classic presentation of diarrhea and malabsorption is less common, and atypical and silent presentations are increasing. Most individuals are being seen by primary care providers and a broad range of specialists. Therefore, heightened awareness of this disease is imperative. Education of physicians, registered dietitians, and other health providers is needed. The panel recommends the following: (1) Education of physicians, dietitians, nurses, and the public about celiac disease by a trans-National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiative, to be led by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), in association with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; (2) Standardization of serologic tests and pathologic criteria for the diagnosis of celiac disease; (3) Adoption of a standard definition of a gluten-free diet based on objective evidence such as that being developed by the American Dietetic Association; (4) Development of an adequate testing procedure for gluten in foods and definition of standards for gluten-free foods in the United States to lay the foundation for rational food labeling; (5) Formation of a federation of celiac disease societies, celiac disease interest groups, individuals with celiac disease and their families, physicians, dietitians, and other health care providers for the advancement of education, research, and advocacy for individuals with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a chronic inflammatory condition associated with small intestinal injury that results in the malabsorption of different nutrients. The damaging factor is gluten present in wheat, barley and rye. The diagnosis relies on the clinical picture of the patient, serological markers for coeliac disease, characteristic findings of small intestinal biopsy and, eventually, clinical improvement on a gluten-free diet. Our strategies for the diagnosis of coeliac disease have changed dramatically within the last 10 years. The advent of serological markers with high sensitivity and specificity is changing our understanding of the disease and its prevalence. Treatment includes a life-long gluten-free diet to prevent the recurrence of symptoms and other potential consequences. Most coeliac disease remains under-diagnosed; the utilization of more accurate serological tests and a greater awareness of its many presentations will aid its identification.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) autoantibodies are serologic markers for celiac disease (CD). The aim was to determine the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of different immunoglobulin isotypes against tTG. METHODS: Immunoglobulin A (IgA)-tTG, IgG-tTG, and IgG1-tTG were measured in radioligand binding assays in 67 children with untreated and 89 children with treated CD and compared with 48 biopsy controls. IgM-tTG was measured in children with untreated CD and in biopsy controls. IgA endomysial autoantibodies (EMA) were analyzed in all children using an immunofluorescence method. RESULTS: The sensitivity of IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG was 85.1% (57 of 67) and 83.6% (56 of 67), respectively, which both increased to 93.8% (45 of 48) in children diagnosed at age 2 years or older. Both had a specificity of 93.8% (45 of 48). IgA-EMA had a sensitivity of 80.6% (54 of 67) and a specificity of 91.7% (44 of 48). In treated CD, IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG were detected in 21.3% (19 of 89) and in 14.6% (13 of 89), respectively, despite negative EMA titers. IgG1-tTG was correlated to age (r = -0.47, P = 0.0005) and detected in 50.7% (34 of 67) with untreated CD compared with 11.2% (10 of 89) with treated CD and with 4.2% (2 of 48) of biopsy controls ( P < 0.0001, respectively). IgM-tTG was detected in 1.5% (1 of 67) with untreated CD and in none of biopsy controls. CONCLUSION: IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG analyzed in radioligand binding assays are equivalent to IgA-EMA as screening tests for CD during childhood, but an intestinal biopsy is still the method of choice to establish the diagnosis. Although IgG1-tTG was more common at young age of diagnosis, both IgG1-tTG and IgM-tTG had low specificity and sensitivity and may not be useful as screening tests for CD.},

She was admitted to our Hospital for pain to the left thigh hindering her from walking. The pain had appeared without trauma about 2 months before admission, and worsened progressively in spite of anti-inflammatory drugs. Clinical picture (localised tender mass without skin signs of inflammation in an afebrile patient) and laboratory data (erythrocyte sedimentation rate 113 mm in 1 hr, fibrinogen 635 mg/dl) suggested the diagnosis of diabetic muscle infarction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed this hypothesis showing a hyperintense area in T2-weighted sequences at adductor muscle group with enhancement after intravenous contrast. Symptoms subsided over the following 4 weeks after bed rest, analgesics, aspirin and a good glycaemic control. The 3-month follow-up MRI showed total recovery. At hospital admission, the patient presented a very poor glycaemic control (HbA1c 15.5%). After discharge, she started--in order to avoid the weight gain associated with intensive insulin therapy--a daily intense isometric training, undergoing frequent hypoglycaemic episodes. In a few months, in spite of repeated laser treatment, retinopathy progressed to the proliferative stage with bilateral vitreous haemorrhages and visual acuity decreased dramatically notwithstanding vitrectomy. This case confirms the association of diabetic muscle infarction with poorly controlled long-standing diabetes with microvascular complications, suggests the possible role of autoimmunity, and underlines the risk of repeated hypoglycaemic episodes and isometric exercise in the progression of pre-proliferative retinopathy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) may be associated with other immunologic disorders in adults and children. Previous studies linking CD and autoimmune thyroid disease in children have included very few patients with limited biochemical and immunologic screening tests. The aim of this multicenter study was to establish the prevalence of autoimmune thyroid involvement in a large series of pediatric patients with CD. METHODS: Five hundred seventy-three consecutive pediatric patients were enrolled from clinics in Torino, Bologna, Foggia, Rome (two clinics), Naples, and Bari. Three hundred forty-three patients with CD were studied, 230 girls and 113 boys (median age, 8.5 years). Two hundred fifty-six of the patients with CD (median age, 9 years) had been following a gluten-free diet for 3 months to 16 years; 87 patients were untreated (median age, 6.2 years). The diagnosis of CD was made using the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria. A control group of 230 subjects (median age, 8.3 years) was enrolled. Serum free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), antithyroperoxidase, antithyroglobulin, anti-TSH receptor antibodies, and thyroid echographic pattern were considered. RESULTS: Autoimmune thyroid disease was found in 90 of 343 (26.2%) patients with CD (62 on a gluten-free diet) and in 20 (10%) of the control subjects (P = 0.001). Fifty-four (15.7%) patients with CD and autoimmune markers had normal thyroid function (euthyroidism) as did 12 (6.0%) of the control subjects; hypothyroidism was observed in 28 (8.1%) patients with CD and in 7 (3.5%) of the control subjects. Hyperthyroidism was diagnosed in four patients with CD and in none of the control subjects with autoimmune markers. An abnormal echographic pattern was seen in 37 patients with CD (16.8%) and only in 1 (1.6%) of the control subjects (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of autoimmune thyroid disease found among patients with CD, even those on a gluten-free diet, may justify a thyroid status assessment at diagnosis and at follow-up evaluation of children with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a small intestinal inflammatory disorder characterized by malabsorption, nutrient deficiency, and a range of clinical manifestations. It is caused by an inappropriate immune response to dietary gluten and is treated with a gluten-free diet. Recent feeding studies have indicated oats to be safe for celiac disease patients, and oats are now often included in the celiac disease diet. This study aimed to investigate whether oat intolerance exists in celiac disease and to characterize the cells and processes underlying this intolerance. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We selected for study nine adults with celiac disease who had a history of oats exposure. Four of the patients had clinical symptoms on an oats-containing diet, and three of these four patients had intestinal inflammation typical of celiac disease at the time of oats exposure. We established oats-avenin-specific and -reactive intestinal T-cell lines from these three patients, as well as from two other patients who appeared to tolerate oats. The avenin-reactive T-cell lines recognized avenin peptides in the context of HLA-DQ2. These peptides have sequences rich in proline and glutamine residues closely resembling wheat gluten epitopes. Deamidation (glutamine-->glutamic acid conversion) by tissue transglutaminase was involved in the avenin epitope formation. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that some celiac disease patients have avenin-reactive mucosal T-cells that can cause mucosal inflammation. Oat intolerance may be a reason for villous atrophy and inflammation in patients with celiac disease who are eating oats but otherwise are adhering to a strict gluten-free diet. Clinical follow-up of celiac disease patients eating oats is advisable.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A gluten-free diet (GFD) rapidly corrects the bone mineral deficit of children with untreated celiac disease. The mechanisms underlying such changes are still poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: In a longitudinal study, we monitored changes in bone metabolism during consumption of a GFD. DESIGN: We studied 22 white patients with celiac disease (11 girls) aged 10.5 +/- 1.0 y at the time of diagnosis. We compared bone metabolism and bone mass values in these patients with those in 428 healthy white children aged 11.3 +/- 0.2 y. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (a bone formation index) and N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx; a bone resorption marker) were measured at the time of diagnosis and after 2, 6, and 12 mo of the GFD. Bone mineral content was measured at the lumbar spine and for the whole skeleton. RESULTS: The bone mineral content of patients was significantly lower than that of control subjects at the time of diagnosis but not after 1 y of the GFD. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentrations of patients were significantly lower than those of control subjects at the time of diagnosis (P = 0.0064) and increased gradually and significantly during the GFD (ANOVA F = 4.71; P = 0.024). Conversely, patients with untreated disease had significantly higher urinary concentrations of NTx than did healthy control subjects (P < 0.0001). Urinary concentrations of NTx were not significantly affected by treatment (P = 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of bone metabolism is altered in children with untreated celiac disease, and these alterations may be the cause of osteopathy. Remarkable changes occur after the initiation of a GFD, and they result in a more balanced equilibrium.},

   abstract = {Reduced bone mass and the increased risk of fracture in gastrointestinal diseases have a multifactorial pathogenesis. Undoubtedly, genetics play an important role, but other factors such as systemic inflammation, malnutrition, hypogonadism, glucocorticoid therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other lifestyle factors, such as smoking or being sedentary, may contribute to reduced bone mass. At a molecular level the proinflammatory cytokines that contribute to the intestinal immune response in IBD and probably also in coeliac disease are also known to enhance bone resorption. The discovery of the role of the receptor to activated NFkappaB (RANK) interaction with its ligand RANKL in orchestrating the balance between bone resorption and formation may link mucosal and systemic inflammation with bone remodelling, since RANK-RANKL are also involved in lymphopoiesis and T-cell apoptosis. Low circulating leptin in response to weight loss in any gastrointestinal disease may be an important factor in reducing bone mass. This report will summarize current concepts regarding gastrointestinal diseases (primarily IBD, coeliac disease and postgastrectomy states) and low bone mass and fracture.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently there has been increasing interest in the production of gluten-free (GF) foods and studies on minor cereals and pseudocereals without celiac activity in order to fulfill the specific needs of people affected by celiac disease. GF bread, pasta, biscuits are usually manufactured using different combinations of thickenings and particular food processing procedures that could affect starch digestibility. Carbohydrates, mainly starch from cereals, play an important part in a balanced diet, and dietary guidelines suggest a diet with low glycemic index foods, that is to say rich in slowly digested carbohydrates. AIM: The present study was aimed at evaluating: 1) the importance of some GF food characteristics in relation to their effects on in vitro starch accessibility to digestion, in comparison with traditional gluten products; 2) the in vivo metabolic responses to GF foods. METHODS: Firstly, starch digestibility of several products was evaluated in vitro. Then, an in vivo study was performed on a group of healthy volunteers. Postprandial glucose and insulin responses were evaluated after administration of three GF foods and traditional bread. Triglycerides and free fatty acids (FFA) were also evaluated. Attempts were also made to explore differences in metabolic responses to GF foods in healthy subjects with respect to celiac subjects. RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of digested starch of GF bread was slightly higher than that of the traditional counterpart. No significant difference was observed in AUCs of digested starch between GF pasta and the traditional pasta. The AUCs of digested starch of quinoa and the two samples of pasta were not statistically different. Significant differences were observed between GF bread and bread-like products. Statistic differences in glucose responses to GF pasta were observed between healthy and celiac subjects. In healthy subjects, the AUCs of glucose response after GF bread were higher than those after bread with gluten. No significant differences were observed between the AUCs of insulin responses to all products tested. Glycemic index (GI) for GF pasta was similar to GI for GF bread while GI for quinoa was slightly lower than that of GF pasta and bread. Two-way ANOVA revealed that quinoa induced lower FFA levels with respect to GF pasta. In addition, triglyceride concentrations were significantly reduced for quinoa with respect to GF bread and bread. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the different formulations and the food processing procedures used in the manufacturing of GF products may affect the rate of starch digestion both in vitro and in vivo. It may be worthwhile improving the formulation of these products. Furthermore, quinoa seems to represent a potential alternative to traditional foods, even if further and larger studies are required to demonstrate its hypoglycemic effects.},

The authors evaluated the presence and the distribution of villous atrophy in children with celiac disease to see whether this histologic pattern exists in children. METHODS: We studied 95 children at diagnosis (Group 1) and seven during gluten challenge (Group 2). We measured anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA) by immunofluorescence on monkey esophagus, antihuman-tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (anti-tTG Abs) by radioimmunoprecipitation, and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 heterodimers by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers. During upper intestinal endoscopy, at least five duodenal biopsy samples were obtained, one from the duodenal bulb and four from the distal duodenum. RESULTS: Thirteen of 95 (13.7%) patients in Group 1 and in 3 of 7 (42.9%) in Group 2 had patchy villous atrophy of the duodenum. In all 16 patients, villous atrophy of the bulb was present. In four children from Group 1, villous atrophy was observed only in the bulb samples. EMA, anti-tTG Abs, and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 heterodimers were present in all patients. Fourteen of 16 had symptomatic CD, and two were silent, detected during screening in subjects at risk for CD. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating that children with CD may have patchy villous atrophy of the duodenum. The bulb mucosa may be the only duodenal area involved, both at diagnosis and after gluten challenge. Therefore, multiple endoscopic biopsies should always be performed, not only in the distal duodenum, but also in the bulb.},

The prevalence for first-degree and more distant relatives has not been determined in families where there are two affected first-degree relatives. The aim of our investigation was to estimate the prevalence and relative risk for celiac disease in relatives of two siblings diagnosed with celiac disease. METHODS: We ascertained sib pairs with celiac disease, and then identified all living first-degree relatives and available second-degree relatives to minimize ascertainment bias. We measured IgA endomysial antibodies, a highly specific and sensitive assay for celiac disease, in all subjects without a confirmed biopsy diagnosis. For those individuals with positive serologic tests, IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody tests and human leukocyte antigen DQA1 and DQB1 genotyping were performed for additional confirmation. Individuals with positive biopsy and/or serology were considered affected. We calculated the relative risk of being affected with celiac disease using the lambda(R) statistic. RESULTS: The prevalence of celiac disease in relatives of affected sib pairs was as follows: 21.3% (13/61) of siblings (lambda(S) = 53); 14.7% (10/68) of offspring (lambda(O) = 37); 17.2% (28/163) of first-degree relatives; 19.5% (16/82) of second-degree relatives; and 17.8% (52/292) of all relatives (lambda(R) = 44.5). CONCLUSIONS: In these families, we identified a sibling risk approximately double that found in previous reports, as well as significant risk for more distant relatives, probably because of sharing of a common gene. In families where at least two siblings have been diagnosed with celiac disease, relatives are at high risk for celiac disease. Screening should be considered for all family members.},

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey, with case note review of 130 adult patients with coeliac disease (90 white Caucasian and 40 South Asians). RESULTS: 87 (66.9%) of the 130 questionnaires were returned; whites: 73.3%, South Asians: 52.5% (P = 0.02). White Caucasians' assessment of their own strictness to the gluten-free diet correlated with small bowel histological recovery (OR 10.00, 95% CI 3.2-33.06) and negative endomysial antibodies (OR 34.94, CI 6.58-185.40). This was not seen in the South Asian patients. Amongst the white coeliacs, factors correlating with compliance with a gluten-free diet were: Coeliac Society membership, understanding food labelling, obtaining sufficient gluten-free products, explanation by a physician, and regular dietetic follow-up. These factors were not identified amongst the South Asians, who were less likely to attend dietetic clinics, join the Coeliac Society and be satisfied with information provided by doctors and dieticians. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the South Asians, factors were identified which related to compliance with a gluten-free diet amongst white Caucasian coeliac patients. This study has shown that the treatment approach to ethnic minorities with coeliac disease must be improved.},

These diseases share a similar genetic background. In diabetic children and adults, the prevalence of (mostly asymptomatic) coeliac disease varies form 0.97 to 6.4%. Diabetes is usually diagnosed first. Screening in relatives may also be positive. Recurrent hypoglycaemia in diabetic subjects (indirectly) suggest the development of coeliac sprue. Thyroid disorders (thyroiditis and Graves' disease) are also usual in coeliac disease. A common etiopathogenic mechanism for the association CD/diabetes/thyroid disorders, with gluten as the driving antigen, was postulated. Thus, screening program for coeliac disease are recommended in individuals with type 1A diabetes and/or auto-immune thyroid conditions, as well as in their first-degree relatives.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy that develops in genetically susceptible individuals exposed to gliadin. Early diagnosis of CD may reduce the risk of complications, and several studies have related the duration of gluten exposure to the risk of other autoimmune diseases. It has been proposed that silent CD be diagnosed as soon as possible to avoid potential complications. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of CD among children less than 3 years and to provide treatment to those patients diagnosed with CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Parents of 1100 healthy children born between October 1998 and December 1999 were asked at the time of delivery to enroll their children in a program for the early diagnosis of CD. The parents of 830 children agreed to participate. Patients in the study were examined and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody was first measured at about 1.5 years of age. A second antibody titer was obtained at about 2.5 years of age. Patients with detectable autoantibodies underwent intestinal biopsy for confirmation of CD. RESULTS: Of the 830 children initially enrolled, 613 and 484 returned for the first and second visits, respectively. None had anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies at the first visit, but 9 had anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulins at the second visit. In 7 of these 9, intestinal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CD which suggests a minimum prevalence of CD of 1 per 118 healthy newborns. CONCLUSIONS: The authors observed a very high prevalence of CD, comparable to that observed in other European populations, which might even be higher if all of the children initially examined had returned for their second visit. If general screening for CD were accepted, the authors would recommend age 2-3 years as the best time for measuring tissue transglutaminase antibodies.},

METHODS: To assess the prevalence of autoimmune diseases in first-degree relatives of CD patients, the authors looked for autoimmune disorders in 225 first-degree relatives of 66 children with CD (group A) and in 232 first-degree relatives of 68 healthy children (group B). For both groups, serologic screening for CD was performed through antiendomysium (EMA) and tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGAA). EMA- and tTGAA-positive subjects were offered an intestinal biopsy. The age at onset of autoimmune diseases was also recorded in group A. RESULTS: The prevalence of autoimmune disorders was significantly (P = 0.028) higher in group A (11 of 225, 4.8%) than in group B (2 of 232, 0.86%). In relatives of CD patients, the prevalence increased with age (chi2 for trend, 43.5; P < 0.0001). Serologic screening for CD was only positive in group A (15 of 225 subjects). An intestinal biopsy was performed in 13 of these 15 relatives (2 refused biopsy). Eleven of 13 had flat mucosa, with subclinical or silent forms of CD. The prevalence of autoimmune diseases in the EMA- and tTGAA-positive relatives of CD patients was significantly higher (3 of 15, 20%; P = 0.028; odds ratio, 6.3; 95% CI, 1/0.21-1/0.11, 4.9-7.6) than in those who were EMA and tTGAA negative (8/210, 3.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The first-degree relatives of CD patients have an increased risk of autoimmune diseases, most likely connected with unrecognized subclinical or silent forms of CD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Celiac disease is a syndrome characterized by damage of the small intestinal mucosa caused by the gluten fraction of wheat proteins and similar alcohol-soluble proteins (prolamines) of barley and rye in genetically susceptible subjects. The presence of gluten in these subjects leads to a self- perpetuating mucosal damage, and the elimination of gluten results in full mucosal recovery. The clinical manifestations of celiac disease are protean in nature and vary markedly with the age of the patient, the duration and extent of disease, and the presence of extraintestinal pathologic changes. In addition to the classic gastrointestinal form, a variety of other clinical manifestations of the disease have been described, including atypical and asymptomatic forms. Although the typical form of celiac disease, characterized by failure to thrive, is still the most frequent presentation in the pediatric age group, severe growth delay is less commonly seen in developed countries. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent epidemiologic studies suggest that celiac disease-associated growth retardation is becoming a tangible health problem in developing countries, where the problem has been historically overlooked. Given the protean nature of the clinical presentation of celiac disease, the diagnosis is extremely challenging and relies on a sensitive and specific algorithm that allows the identification of different manifestations of the disease. Serologic tests developed in the past decade provide a noninvasive tool for screening individuals at risk for the disease as well as the general population. SUMMARY: The current gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease remains histologic confirmation of the intestinal damage in serologically positive individuals. The keystone treatment of celiac disease patients is a lifelong elimination diet in which food products containing gluten are avoided.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Untreated coeliac disease may induce malabsorption of many nutrients. It may also induce vitamin K deficiency, which causes prolongation of the prothrombin time. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and associations of prolonged prothrombin time in a series of coeliac adults. METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional analysis of data collected on 390 adults with untreated coeliac disease diagnosed from January 1997 to December 2000. Prolonged prothrombin time was defined as INR > or = 1.4. RESULTS: A prolonged prothrombin time was found in 72 coeliac patients (18.5%). Parenteral vitamin K therapy was required in 5.6% of patients. Patients with prolonged prothrombin time had significant lower values of haemoglobin, iron, proteins, cholesterol and serum aspartate transaminase, and significantly higher prevalence of diarrhoea, weight loss, abdominal pain and low bone mineral density in comparison with patients with normal prothrombin time. However, low bone density was present in 11.6% of patients with normal INR. A prolonged prothrombin time was only found in a few patients with subclinical coeliac disease (0.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Data indicate that the prevalence of prolonged prothrombin time is about 20% in a large series of adult untreated coeliac patients. A prolonged prothrombin time was significantly related to all the markers of severe malabsorption, including low mineral density. Our suggestion is that vitamin K related proteins may also play a role in determining or worsening calcium homeostasis disorders in coeliac disease. The very low prevalence of coagulation disorders in subclinical coeliac disease indicates that there is no need to screen for coeliac disease in patients with isolated coagulation disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The issue of whether or not liver function is compromised in the healthy elderly population remains unsolved. AIM: To investigate the putative age-related modifications of hepatic function using the 13C-methacetin breath test. Because endogenous CO2 production changes with age, motor activity and nutrition, a different form of processing the results was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine elderly subjects (mean age, 79.8 +/- 7.9 years; female/male ratio, 17/12) and 28 adult subjects (mean age, 40.6 +/- 12.3 years; female/male ratio, 13/15) underwent 13C-methacetin breath test and trans-abdominal echosonography with Doppler pulsed wave analysis of the coeliac axis and portal vein. RESULTS: Although the 13CO2 peak occurred within 15-30 min in both elderly and adult subjects, it was significantly decreased in the former (30.66% +/- 9.2% vs. 38.33% +/- 6.05%; P < 0.001), as was the cumulative excretion (33.07% +/- 7.06% vs. 39.81% +/- 5.68%; P < 0.001). When correcting for the effects of CO2 excretion by age, the age-related modification of the cumulative dose became more evident (elderly group 30.15% +/- 6.46% vs. adult group 37.97% +/- 5.92%; P < 0.0001). The elderly group also showed an increase in the intra-hepatic resistance index using Doppler pulsed wave analysis, which inversely correlated with the results of the breath test. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic function is not well preserved in healthy humans throughout life and may be due to an increase in vascular resistance.},

   abstract = {Immune defects, thyroid abnormalities, infections and coeliac disease are often associated with Down's syndrome (DS). However, the basis of the immune defects is still unclear in DS. In the present study, we show that peripheral CD4 T-cells were decreased in children with DS, while mean values of cytotoxic CD8 T-cells were comparable with those from healthy children. Circulating activated (CD3/HLA-DR positive) T-cells were increased and a large proportion of purified T-cells from DS were also positive for APO-I/FAS (CD95) antigen. To further explore the functional status of circulating activated T-cells, enriched CD3 lymphocytes were cultured for 3 h and were tested for positivity to annexin-V (ANX-V) and propidium iodide. T-cells with the early apoptotic phenotype were increased in cell cultures from DS children. Plasma levels of inteleukin-6 (IL-6) were higher in DS children than in healthy children. The incidence of coeliac disease was also increased in this group of children. Most DS children showed increased levels of circulating IgG or IgA specific for gliadin, and their plasma IL-6 levels correlated with those of antigliadin IgG. The number of CD4 circulating cells was very low in DS children with coeliac disease, was low in those with serum antigliadin antibodies and was normal in DS without antigliadin antibodies. An overload of dietary antigens and impaired nutrient absorption secondary to altered functioning of the gastrointestinal mucosa might interfere with normal immune responses by inducing programmed cell death in CD4 T-cells.},

The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of sex, the time course, the strain specificity, the distribution along the intestinal tract and the effect of diet for the changes in the activity of gut invertase, maltase and lactase found in BBdp rats, as compared with both Wistar-Furth (WF) and diabetes-resistant BioBreeding (BBc) rats. These hydrolases were measured, therefore, at day 10, 30, 45, 70, 95 and 120 in three intestinal segments of WF, BBc and BBdp rats fed, after weaning, either a protective hydrolysed casein diet, which decreases the incidence of diabetes in the BBdp rats, or one of two diabetogenic diets (National Toxicology Program; NTP or wheat-gluten-based; WG) [corrected]. Except for a somewhat lower lactase activity in the BBdp rats, no obvious difference in hydrolyase activity between the three strains of rats was observed at day 10. Between days 30 and 120, however, the activity of the hydrolases, especially that of invertase and lactase, was lower in the BBdp rats than in either the WF or BBc rats, at least when considering the animals fed either the NTP or WG diet. These findings support the view that BBdp rats exposed to a diabetogenic diet develop an enteropathy well before the onset of autoimmune insulitis, in a manner somehow comparable with the situation found in some type 1 diabetic patients, in whom coeliac disease may be diagnosed before diabetes onset.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease may manifest with a variety of symptoms which can result in delays in diagnosis. Celiac disease is associated with a number of other medical conditions. The last national survey of members of the Canadian Celiac Association (CCA) was in 1989. Our objective was to determine the feasibility of surveying over 5,000 members of the CCA, in addition to obtaining more health related information about celiac disease. METHODS: The Professional Advisory Board of the CCA in collaboration with the University of Ottawa developed a comprehensive questionnaire on celiac disease. The questionnaire was pre-tested and then a pilot survey was conducted on members of the Ottawa Chapter of the CCA using a Modified Dillmans' Total Design method for mail surveys. RESULTS: We had a 76% response to the first mailout of the questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 55.5 years and the mean age at diagnosis was 45 years. The majority of respondents presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue or weight loss. Prior to diagnosis, 30% of respondents consulted four or more family doctors. Thirty seven percent of individuals were told they had either osteoporosis or osteopenia. Regarding the impact of the gluten-free diet (GFD), 45% of individuals reported that they found following a GFD was very or moderately difficult. The quality of life of individuals with celiac disease was comparable to the mean quality of life of Canadians. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our results, we concluded that a nationwide survey is feasible and this is in progress. Important concerns included delays in the diagnosis of celiac disease and the awareness of associated medical conditions. Other issues include awareness of celiac disease by health professionals and the impact of the GFD on quality of life. These issues will be addressed further in the national survey.},

Our objective was to evaluate citrulline as a marker of severity and extent of villous atrophy in patients without intestinal resection. METHODS: Forty-two patients with celiac disease and 10 patients with non-celiac villous atrophy disease were studied by plasma postabsorptive citrulline and biological dosages, biopsies of proximal (duodenojejunal) small bowel and distal ileum (n = 25), or measurement of vitamin B(12) absorption (n = 4). Nine patients were reevaluated after following a gluten-free diet for 1 year. Controls were 51 healthy subjects and 10 severely malnourished patients with anorexia nervosa with no intestinal mucosal abnormalities. RESULTS: Plasma citrulline concentration was lower (P < 0.001) in patients with villous atrophy (24 +/- 13 micromol/L) than in healthy subjects (40 +/- 10 micromol/L) and patients with anorexia nervosa (39 +/- 9 micromol/L). Three thresholds were individualized: <10 micromol/L for patients with diffuse total villous atrophy (n = 10), 10-20 micromol/L for patients with proximal-only total villous atrophy (n = 12), and 20-30 micromol/L for patients with partial villous atrophy (n = 10). Plasma citrulline concentration was correlated to the severity and extent of villous atrophy (r = 0.81; P < 0.001) and to albuminemia (r = 0.47; P < 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that plasma citrulline concentration was the best biological variable to predict villous atrophy. Following a 1-year gluten-free diet, plasma citrulline concentration increased in histologically responsive (n = 6) but not in unresponsive (n = 3) patients. CONCLUSIONS: In patient villous atrophy diseases, plasma citrulline concentration may prove to be a simple and reliable marker of reduced enterocyte mass.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in children with diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM) is significantly higher than in the nondiabetic population. Most patients with DM and associated CD do not experience typical gastrointestinal symptoms of CD. There is no agreement on the necessity of screening and management of silent CD for patients with DM or on the time scale for screening. Only few data on follow-up evaluation of children with DM and CD-related antibodies are available. METHODS: One hundred fifty-seven patients with DM (mean age, 14.8 years; range, 4-21 years; male, 83) were screened with endomysial antibodies (EMA) between 1993 and 2001. A follow-up period of at least 3 years, with at least 2 EMA measurements, was possible. Group 1 comprised 37 patients whose first measurement was at the onset of DM. Group 2 comprised 120 patients whose first measurement was during the course of the disease. In patients with positive EMA, small bowel biopsy was performed. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO), thyroglobulin (TgA), glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), antiinsulin (IAA), and islet cell antibodies (IA2) were measured in all patients. RESULTS: EMA was positive in 16 patients, in 5 at onset of DM and in 11 during the course of DM (mean duration, 33.6 months; range, 11-105 months). Biopsy results showed normal mucosa in seven patients, increased intraepithelial lymphocyte counts in one, and flat mucosa in eight. There was no significant difference between EMA-positive and EMA-negative patients regarding height, weight, HbA1c level, frequency of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, TPO, TgA, GAD, IAA, or IA2. CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the high prevalence of CD in patients with DM. Although several patients already had positive EMA titers at the onset of DM, seroconversion may also occur during the course of the disease. Screening for CD with EMA or tissue transglutaminase should be included in the initial investigation of DM, but should also be repeated over time to detect late seroconversion.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy affecting 0.5% to 1% of children and is induced by dietary gluten in susceptible individuals carrying the human leukocyte antigen DQ2 or DQ8 heterodimer. If serological screening is positive or if a patient displays suggestive symptoms, an endoscopic biopsy of the distal duodenum is required to confirm the diagnosis. Symptoms of celiac disease are often mild or absent. Overt malabsorption occurs in only 2% to 10% of children. Individuals with a higher risk of developing celiac disease, including first-degree relatives of affected patients and children with type I diabetes, Turner syndrome, Williams syndrome or Down syndrome, should be offered screening for celiac disease along with a discussion of the implications. If serological testing is negative, a high index of suspicion should remain if malabsorption, iron deficiency or osteopenia is present. Also, immunoglobulin A deficiency should be excluded. At-risk individuals should undergo serial serological screening. Lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet is the only treatment. If left untreated, symptomatic children with celiac disease carry an increased risk of developing osteoporosis and have a greater lifetime risk of cancer. The long-term outcome of undiagnosed or untreated asymptomatic individuals is less clear.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of idiopathic chronic pancreatitis remains poorly understood despite the high expectations for ascribing the pancreatic damage in affected patients to genetic defects. Mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene, pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, and the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator gene do not account for the chronic pancreatitis noted in most patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis. Small duct chronic pancreatitis can be best diagnosed with a hormone stimulation test. Endoscopic ultrasonography can detect abnormalities in both the parenchyma and ducts of the pancreas. The true value of endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnosing small duct chronic pancreatitis remains to be fully defined and is under active investigation. It is not clear whether endoscopic ultrasonography is more sensitive for early structural changes in patients with small duct disease or is over diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic enzyme supplementation with non-enteric formulation along with acid suppression (H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors) is an effective therapy for pain in patients with small duct chronic pancreatitis. The role of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided celiac plexus block should be limited to treating those patients with chronic pancreatitis whose pain has not responded to other modalities. Total pancreatectomy followed by autologous islet cell autotransplantation appears to be potential therapeutic approach but for now should be considered experimental.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) have steatorrhea, in part because of bile acid malabsorption that causes decreased bile acid secretion into the duodenum and consequent fat maldigestion. In SBS patients with colon in continuity, luminal calcium forms calcium fatty acid soaps rather than precipitating as insoluble calcium oxalate. Soluble oxalate is hyperabsorbed by the colon leading to hyperoxaluria and an increased risk for renal calcium oxalate stones and deposits. The authors hypothesized that oral ingestion of conjugated bile acids would increase fat absorption and thereby decrease calcium fatty acid soap formation and oxalate hyperabsorption. METHODS: The effect of conjugated bile acid replacement therapy (9 g/d) on fecal fat excretion and urine oxalate excretion was measured in an appropriate patient, utilizing the metabolic balance technique. The effects of chronic bile acid replacement therapy on oxalate excretion and nutritional status also were measured in a 3-month outpatient study. RESULTS: Natural conjugated bile acid replacement therapy reduced fecal fat excretion from 119 to 79 g/d (Delta40 g/d), and urinary oxalate excretion from 87 to 64 mg/d (966 to 710 micromol/d; Delta23 mg/d). Cholylsarcosine, a synthetic conjugated bile acid, had similar but less powerful effects. During a 3-month outpatient trial of natural conjugated bile acids (9 g/d), urine oxalate decreased to normal levels (27 mg/d) in association with weight gain, decreased hunger, and decreased hyperphagia. CONCLUSION: Conjugated bile acid replacement therapy reduced fecal fat excretion, reduced urinary oxalate excretion, and improved nutritional status in a patient with SBS with colon in continuity, hyperoxaluria, and oxalate nephrolithiasis.},

It has been suggested that accurate information is most likely found on transparent sites and kitemarks are awarded on this basis. This paper examines whether the Internet is a useful resource for people with coeliac disease and whether transparency criteria can be used in identifying accurate sites. METHOD: An evaluation tool was developed using selected transparency criteria and clinical guidelines for accuracy. A total of 63 websites were evaluated. RESULTS: In the study, 66% of the websites scored less than 50% for accuracy. This was primarily because of incomplete information but 15.9% of sites contained inaccuracies. Over 50% of sites scored less than 50% for transparency. No correlation was found between sites that scored highly for accuracy and those that scored highly for transparency. CONCLUSION: There are useful information available for people with coeliac disease but transparency criteria alone cannot be used to identify accurate sites.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In pancreatic diseases, laparoscopic surgery is used to drain fluid collections in infected pancreatic necrosis, abscesses and pseudocysts, for cancer staging, to resect both benign and malignant tumors and for palliative procedures as well. In patients with intractable pain, percutaneous or surgical celiac plexus block can be performed, celiac ganglion alcoholization and torachoscopic splacnicectomy can be done. The laparoscopic approach for staging, allows us to identify very small peritoneal or hepatic metastasis, local invasion or deep hepatic metastasis. The lack of tactile sensation is a disadvantage in the laparoscopic procedures for both staging and resection; which can be compensated utilizing laparoscopic ultrasound. The laparoscopic pancreatic approach for resection is useful to treat neuroendocrine tumors, chronic pancreatitis and cystic neoplasm allowing preservation of the splenic vessels and the spleen. The insulinoma is a treatable laparoscopic tumor given its unique characteristics. The preoperative diagnosis is made by image studies like ultrasound, CAT scans, angiography studies, MRI, endoscopic ultrasound and calcium stimulation test. There are three surgical options: enucleation, distal pancreatectomy with or without preserving the spleen. The most important complication is the pancreatic fistula. CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic approach in pancreatic surgery is a feasible and safe one, although, its superiority over the classic open approach has not been demonstrated yet.},

   abstract = {The intestine constitutes the largest interface between a person and his or her environment, and an intact intestinal barrier is thus essential in maintaining health and preventing tissue injury and several diseases. The intestinal barrier has various immunological and non-immunological components. The epithelial barrier is one of the most important non-immunological components. Hyperpermeability of this barrier is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of several gastrointestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease and food allergy. Hence, assessing barrier integrity is of the utmost importance. One of the more quantitative gauges for this assessment is transepithelial permeability of various molecular probes, among which sugars are commonly used. Measures of intestinal permeability might also be useful as markers for assessment of prognosis and follow up in various gastrointestinal disorders. The present article is a review of the normal and abnormal functioning of the intestinal barrier, the diseases that can result from loss of barrier integrity, and some promising agents and strategies for restoring barrier normality and integrity.},

   abstract = {Celiac sprue may be defined as a model autoimmune disease with known trigger (gluten), a tight genetic linkage (with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8) and a specific humoral autoimmune response (autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase, tTG). Gliadin peptides are repeatedly presented to HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 positive cells and induce an immune response in small-intestinal mucosa. tTG is a specific endomysial autoantigen released during cellular stress and by deamidation of gliadin peptides as well as by binding with them facilitates their interaction with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 cells. CS is the consequence of an inappropriate by T-cells mediated immune reaction to gluten. The diagnosis is based on criteria of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition revised in 1990. The availability of sensitive and specific detection methods of serum antibodies to endomysium (AEA) and tTG (AtTGA) was followed by recognition of a broad spectrum of both the clinical presentation and histologic changes of intestinal mucosa in CS. The majority of patients have atypical clinical symptoms. The present prevalence of CS amounts to approximately 1:250. The following forms of CS are distinguished: classic (typical), latent, potential, subclinical, and silent. CS is frequently associated with other diseases and many of them are also of autoimmune origin. Serologic testing is indicated in subjects with atypical symptoms and autoimmune diseases. In cases with distinct suspicion biopsy should be always performed irrespective of the serologic tests. In refractory sprue the cryptic form of enteritis associated T-cell lymphoma should be excluded. Gluten-free diet is the cornerstone of CS therapy. The Alimentary Codex in individual countries admits different amounts of residual gluten in gluten-free products. In future years new basic knowledge as well as practical diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations may be expected.},

AIM: To determine this fact in Clinical Hospital, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil. METHODS: Celiac patients were studied over two different periods of time, from January 1978 to December 1987 (group 1 = G1) and from January 1988 to December 1997 (group 2 = G2). Time of disease, age at diagnosis and nutritional status and clinical forms were investigated. The typical form was considered to be present if the patient had at least two of the following signs/symptoms: diarrhea, abdominal distention, and weight loss, associated or not with others. RESULTS: Clinical forms (%) - G1: typical 57.14 and atypical 42.85. G2: typical 55.18 and atypical 44.82. Median age at diagnosis: 23 months (G1) and 21 months (G2). Interval between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis: 13 months (G1) and 11 months (G2). Gomez nutritional status G1: Eutrophy = 23.8, DI = 47.61, DII = 23.8 and DIII = 4.76. G2: Eutrophy = 20.68, DI = 48.27, DII = 27.58 and DIII = 3.44. Waterloo G1: Eutrophy = 23.8, Wasting = 14.28, Stunting = 28.57 and Chronic = 33.33. G2: Eutrophy = 20.68, Wasting = 13.79, Stunting = 34.48 and Chronic = 31.03. No statistically significant differences occurred between the groups for any of these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: No change in the forms of presentation or remaining clinical characteristics of celiac disease occurred in our service. This may be due to the population characteristics or to differences among health services, or to different periods of observation.},

   abstract = {AIM: Some recent studies showed that alteration of upper-gut motility in coeliac disease may be related to dysfunction of autonomic nervous system. The aim of our study was to investigate whether autonomic nervous system was altered in untreated and unselected coeliac disease patients. METHODS: We studied 8 untreated and consecutive coeliac disease patients (2 males and 6 females, age range 37+/-14.5 years). Histological evaluation of duodenal mucosa, anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA), antiendomysial antibodies (EMA) and anti-tTG antibodies and sorbitol H2 breath test were performed in all patients. Extrinsic autonomic neuropathy was assessed by the standardized measurement of cardiovascular reflexes (lying-to-standing, Valsalva manoeuvre, deep breathing, sustained handgrip). The results obtained were compared with a healthy, asymptomatic control group (6 males and 7 females, age range 42.3+/-13.5 years). RESULTS: Coeliac patients exhibited a lower increase of PAS as a response to isometric effort, a reduction of spectral power LF as a response to clinostatic position, but without statistical significance. Also they showed a lower tolerance to orthostatic position, associated with a latent disequilibrium of sympathetic-vagal balance, a relative prevalence of parasympathetic component of the autonomic function. However, these results were not statistically significant when compared with control group (P = n.s.). And they were unchanged after 6 and 12 mo of gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: This study failed to confirm a significant correlation between autonomic dysfunction and coeliac disease, yet we could not exclude a role of autonomic dysfunction in the genesis of systemic symptoms in some coeliacs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endomysium antibodies (EMA) do not detect minor dietary transgressions in patients with celiac disease. AIM: To compare the sensitivity and specificity of tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) and endomysium antibodies (EMA) in biopsy proven celiac patients at the time of diagnosis and during gluten free diet (GFD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty three subjects were studied: a) 30 healthy controls; b) 9 cases with cow's milk allergy; c) 24 celiac patients at time of diagnosis; d) 25 celiac patients adhering to the GFD; e) 65 celiac patients with poor/no adhesion to GFD. EMA and tTGA IgA were measured by immunofluorescence and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 97.4% for tTGA, respectively. All patients with cow's milk allergy were EMA (-) and 8 of 9 (88.9%) were tTGA (-). In celiac patients not adhering to the GFD, EMA and tTGA positivity were similar (80% and 81.5%, respectively); 95.4% of the subjects tested positive for at least one of them. All patients adhering to GFD were EMA (-) but tTGA were (+) in 28% of them. CONCLUSIONS: EMA and tTGA have similar sensitivity and specificity at the time of diagnosis of celiac disease. Positive tTGA in 28% of patients that adhered strictly to the GFD and whose EMA were negative suggest that tTGA may be helpful in detecting minor dietary transgressions and should be further evaluated.},

As many as 1:163 people are affected by it, but only a small percentage are aware of the condition, which begins either in infancy, with gastrointestinal symptoms, or in childhood and later years with non-Gl signs and symptoms, such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, anemia, stunted growth, and delayed puberty. A strong association with Type 1 diabetes and Down syndrome is also found, thus making screening mandatory for these subjects. Celiac disease is often entirely clinically silent, yet it must be detected in order to prevent long-term complications.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Screening for celiac disease (CD) in the apparently healthy members of 107 nuclear families with two affected siblings (sib pair) and estimating the risk of CD in siblings and parents. METHODS: One hundred seven families from Sweden and southern Norway with at least two affected children were investigated. Frozen sera from 187 of the 192 healthy parents and from 94 of 95 siblings without diagnosed CD were examined for total immunoglobulin A (IgA) and anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA). Individuals with positive antibody titers underwent small intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: Positive test for EMA was found in 6 of 94 (6.3%) siblings without previously diagnosed CD and in 8 of 189 (4.2%) parents. CD was confirmed by small intestinal biopsy in all siblings and seven parents. The estimated risk for CD in multiply affected families was 26.3% for siblings and 12.9% for parents. An unexpected male preponderance was found among the new CD cases (10 males, 3 females). CONCLUSION: The risk of CD in the members of nuclear families with two affected children is approximately three times higher than that when only one child is affected. The high male preponderance of new cases is unexpected and could not be explained fully by more silent disease in males as compared with females. Considering the high level of knowledge about CD in these families, the number of undiagnosed cases is surprisingly high. The authors suggest that serologic screening should be offered to all first-degree relatives of patients with CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Osteoporosis is the most common manifestation of untreated celiac disease (CD). Bone quantitative ultrasound (QUS) has recently emerged as a new modality for bone status assessment. We evaluated bone status in children with CD using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and quantitative ultrasound. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 41 children (13 girls, 28 boys) aged 11.2 +/- 3.6 years with CD. All children had been diagnosed with CD for at least 1 year (mean, 5.7 +/- 4.3 years). The results of lumbar spine bone mineral density assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and the measurements of the velocity of ultrasound wave (at distal radius and midshaft tibia sites), expressed as speed of sound in m/s, were compared between children adherent to gluten-free diet (GFD) and non-compliant children. RESULTS: Speed of sound z-scores at tibia were below -2 SD in 20 of 41 children (49%), whereas lumbar spine bone mineral density z-scores were below -2 SD in 4 of 41 (10%) children with CD (P = 0.0002). Only 19 of 41 children were strictly compliant to GFD. The prevalence of tibia speed of sound z-scores <-2 SD was significantly higher in non-compliant children (15 of 22, 68%) compared with children on GFD (5 of 19, 26%), (P = 0.01). Children non-compliant with GFD had significantly worse tibia speed of sound z-scores (-2.3 +/- 1.8, mean +/- SD) compared with children on GFD (-1.2 +/- 1.5, mean +/- SD) (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CD on a gluten-containing diet had higher prevalence of abnormal tibia bone SOS and lower z-scores compared with children on a GFD. These differences were not detected by spinal dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry or radius speed of sound. The value of quantitative ultrasound for screening and follow-up of children with CD should be further evaluated.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: At-risk groups commonly undergo screening for autoantibodies associated with celiac disease (CD). However, the clinical significance of a positive test remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to evaluate growth and clinical features of children who test positive for an autoantibody associated with CD. METHODS: A case-control study of Denver area healthy infants and young children with and without CD autoantibodies was conducted. A cohort of HLA-characterized children were followed prospectively since birth for the development of immunoglobulin A antitissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (TG). Clinical evaluation, questionnaire, blood draw, and small bowel biopsy were performed. Growth and nutrition and frequency of positive responses were measured. RESULTS: Compared with 100 age- and gender-matched TG-negative controls, 18 TG-positive children, 5.5 +/- 0.5 years of age, had a greater number of symptoms and lower z scores for weight-for-height and for body mass index. Responses that were independently associated with TG-positive status were irritability/lethargy, abdominal distention/gas, and difficulty with weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Screening-identified TG-positive children demonstrate mild alterations in growth and nutrition and report more symptoms than control subjects. Additional study is needed on the benefit and risk of identifying CD in at-risk groups.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The subject of gastrointestinal disorders in the elderly is timely and important because of the demographic reality that soon over 20% of our population will be older than 65 years of age, utilizing perhaps 50% of our total healthcare costs. The purpose of this review is to draw attention to some areas of clinical information that point in the direction of better clinical care for the elderly. Medicine is finally advancing from the era when most symptoms in older patients were ascribed to the aging process itself. Indeed, within gastroenterology there are few changes that occur inevitably as part of aging. RECENT FINDINGS: Progress has been made in several areas of gastrointestinal pathophysiology. These include: the pathophysiology of swallowing and evacuation disorders and the beginning of the application of techniques derived from physiological studies to improve function; recognizing the importance of reflux esophagitis and its complications and improving treatment; understanding the importance of disorders of malabsorption and their impact upon nutrition in the elderly; major issues in the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease in this age group; and approaches to the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. SUMMARY: As we pay more attention to these areas and encourage clinical research we expect to improve the treatment of older patients with these diseases and to reduce the burden of morbidity in this population.},

   abstract = {Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) ultimately develops in 7-10% of patients with long-standing coeliac disease. In patients without a prior diagnosis of coeliac disease this is a very rare disorder, and the diagnosis in such cases is often difficult and delayed due to the non-specific nature of the symptoms and a very low index of clinical suspicion. Standard anti-lymphoma therapies have minimal utility in patients with EATL, and their prognosis is poor. An added difficulty is the high risk of intestinal perforation especially with the commencement of treatment due to the multifocal nature of bowel disease and poor underlying nutrition and tissue integrity. To illustrate these problems and provide an example of how these issues may be addressed, we report the case of a patient with EATL who was completely asymptomatic from unsuspected underlying coeliac disease and presented initially with back pain followed by bowel obstruction. He was treated with gut rest with total parenteral nutrition before commencing an intensive chemotherapy regimen [hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone)] and is currently well in ongoing complete remission 34 months later.},

For some, such as celiac disease, both important genetic and environmental determinants have been identified as well as a specific treatment. For others, such as pernicious anemia and inflammatory bowel disease, animal models have provided important research advances. Two conditions, inflammatory bowel disease and sclerosing cholangitis, are strongly associated. Characteristic immunologic features of these diseases are critical for diagnosis. Although the majority of conditions are currently treated with nonselective anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, recent research has introduced novel biological agents, exemplified by the successful use of infliximab for Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of iron supplementation, in addition to gluten free diet (GFD), on hematological profile of children with Celiac Disease (CD). METHODS: Children diagnosed as CD as per modified ESPGAN criteria were prospectively evaluated for their hematological profile at the time of their enrolment and after consuming GFD for at least one year. The results were compared with age and sex matched controls. Evaluation of hematological profile included hemoglobin estimation, complete blood counts, peripheral blood smear examination, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and serum ferritin estimation. All the enrolled cases were given iron supplementation in addition to exclusion of gluten from their diet. Repeat intestinal biopsy was performed in all the cases after completing 1 year on GFD. RESULTS: Twenty one children (mean age 6.67 years, range 4-11 years) diagnosed as CD who completed at least one year of regular follow up on GFD (mean 1.5 years, range 1-2 years) were analysed for their hematological profile at the time of enrolment and after consuming GFD and iron supplementation. At the time of enrolment all the children had hemoglobin level <11 gm%, 78% had microcytic hypochromic anemia and 22% had dimorphic anemia, with lower mean MCV, MCH and serum ferritin levels, and a significantly higher mean TIBC as compared to controls (p<0.001). In the follow up evaluation of these cases on GFD, mean hemoglobin levels were comparable with controls but the cases continued to have lower mean MCV, MCH serum ferritin levels (p<0.05) and higher mean TIBC (p<0.05). Seven children had mild anemia. Serum ferritin levels showed a negative correlation with the grade of villous atrophy and lamina propria infiltrate. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is commonly associated with CD and iron deficiency state continues for a longer time even after excluding gluten from the diet and iron supplementation. Apart from offering them GFD rich in iron, early detection and treatment of IDA and prophylactic iron folic acid supplementation will go a long way to optimize their mental and psychomotor functions.},

In group 1, there was a positive correlation between SPL and duration of symptoms (p = 0.006, r = 0.768) and age of diagnosis (p < 0.001, r = 0.842). A positive correlation also existed in group 2 between SPL and degree of villous atrophy (p < 0.001, r = 0.71) and lamina propria infiltrate (p < 0.001, r = 0.568). Our results suggest that SPL has a significant correlation with activity of CD. Therefore serum prolactin estimation may provide an additional marker of disease activity in CD and may be a more viable option economically.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Osteopenia is a common complication in adults with celiac disease. The effect of a gluten-free diet on bone mineral density is a matter of controversy. The aim of this study was to investigate bone mineral density in children with celiac disease at diagnosis and in patients treated for 1 year. METHODS: Bone mineral density and bone mineral content were measured in 34 children with untreated celiac disease at diagnosis and in 28 patients on a gluten-free diet for 1 year. The results were compared with those of 64 gender- and age-matched healthy control subjects. Serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, 25 -hydroxy vitamin D, and intact parathormone levels were determined in treated and untreated patients. RESULTS: The mean values of bone mineral density and bone mineral content of untreated patients with celiac were significantly lower than the control group (P = 0.006 and P = 0.005, respectively) and treated patients (P = 0.015 and P = 0.011 respectively). Treated patients had mean bone mineral density and bone mineral content values not significantly different from those of healthy control subjects. Minor hypocalcemia was detected in 17.6% of the patients with new diagnoses and 3.6% of the treated patients. Of the untreated patients, 29.4% had high intact parathormone concentrations; in untreated patients, the total was 14.3%. Untreated patients had significantly lower serum calcium and significantly higher intact parathormone levels than did treated patients. The other bone metabolism parameters were similar in the two celiac groups. CONCLUSION: Children with celiac disease are at risk for reduced bone mineral density. A strict gluten-free diet improves bone mineralization, even in 1 year. Early diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease during childhood will protect the patient from osteoporosis.},

   abstract = {Effective treatment of malabsorption due to severe pancreatic exocrine insufficiency requires delivery of sufficient enzymatic activity into the duodenal lumen simultaneously with meal nutrients. To achieve this, modern therapeutic concepts recommend administration of 25,000 to 40,000 units of lipase per meal using pH-sensitive pancreatin microspheres. In case of treatment failure, dosage should be increased two to three times. If this still is not successful, compliance may be checked by measurement of fecal chymotrypsin, although this is not a standardized procedure. In the compliant patient, diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency needs to be reviewed, particularly cases of celiac disease, (concomitant) bacterial overgrowth, and blind loop syndrome, as well as giardiasis, which need to be excluded or otherwise be treated specifically. Finally, additional acid suppression with application of unprotected pancreatin and/or reduced fat intake may help to control malabsorption. Still, in most patients, lipid digestion cannot be completely normalized by current standard therapy. On the one hand, this leads to loss of energy that may only partly be compensated for by increased nutrient intake. On the other hand, increased nutrient exposition of distal intestinal sites may release excessive amounts of mostly inhibitory distal intestinal neurohumoral mediators, and thereby disturb gastrointestinal secretory and motor functions. Consequently, future developments are needed for optimizing treatment.},

Animal studies indicate that Paneth cell numbers, location and granule morphology are altered by infection and zinc status. We examined human tissue to determine whether Paneth cell numbers, distribution or granule morphology are altered in infective, inflammatory and nutritional disorders. Archival sections from infective disorders (giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, HIV, helminth infection) were compared with active inflammatory conditions (coeliac, Crohn's and graft-versus-host diseases) and histologically normal tissues. A subset of tissues was studied by electron microscopy and TUNEL staining for apoptosis. Human defensin-5 (HD5) peptide and mRNA was analysed by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sections from a tropical population cohort study were then analysed to determine the relationship of granule depletion to infection, nutritional status and plasma zinc concentration. In HIV-related cryptosporidiosis, but not other disorders, Paneth cells were reduced in number and markedly depleted of granules. Paneth cell granule depletion was associated with reduced HD5 immunoreactivity, but this was not due to apoptosis and there was no reduction in mRNA transcripts. In the tropical population studied, depletion of granules was associated with reduced body mass index, reduced plasma zinc levels and HIV infection. Paneth cell granules in human small intestine may be depleted in response to infective and nutritional stress. We postulate that this is one mechanism through which zinc status influences host susceptibility to intestinal infection.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Children with coeliac disease (CD) have an increased number of chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Whether genetically determined or a secondary phenomenon in CD, chromosome abnormalities may be involved in the predisposition to cancer in CD patients. The aim of the study was to follow a group of children with CD in whom the initial frequency of chromosome aberrations at diagnosis was known and to measure the same variable after a minimum of 2 years on a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes were determined in 17 patients with CD, before and after at least 24 months of a gluten free diet (mean, 33 months), and in 15 healthy children. The differences in the frequency of aberrations were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test. RESULTS: Twelve patients adhered to the diet and had a significantly lower frequency of chromosome aberrations than did 5 patients not following the diet (0.16% v 1.2%; P = 0.03), whereas at presentation there had been no difference (1.54% v 1.2%; P = 0.09). The frequency of aberrations at follow-up in patients who were diet adherent was significantly lower than at presentation (1.54% v 0.16%; P = 0.02) and remained unchanged in patients who were not diet adherent (1.2% v 1.2%; P = 1). After at least 24 months of a gluten-free diet, children with CD did not differ from healthy control subjects (0.16% v 0.27%; P = 0.54), whereas children not following the diet had an increased frequency of aberrations (1.2% v 0.27%; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with CD decreased significantly on a gluten-free diet. We conclude that genomic instability is a secondary phenomenon, possibly caused by chronic intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease is a gluten-induced small bowel enteropathy. Inflammation is known to be associated with enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production. An increase in urinary nitrate and nitrite (NOx) reflects increased NO production. The urinary NOx:creatinine ratio can be used as an indicator of the endogenous NO production. The aim of the study was to determine whether the urinary NOx:creatinine ratio of celiac disease patients increases during gluten challenge. METHODS: The authors studied 20 patients with unconfirmed celiac disease who had been following a gluten-free diet for at least 1 year. These patients underwent an 80-day gluten challenge. Urinary samples were obtained before and 10, 20, 40, and 80 days after starting the gluten challenge. The Griess reagent method was used for measuring urinary NOx. RESULTS: Gluten challenge confirmed the diagnosis of celiac disease in 15 of 20 patients. The NOx:creatinine ratios (mmol:mmol) of the biopsy-confirmed celiac disease patients were significantly higher than those of the unconfirmed celiac disease patients (0.67 vs. 0.17 on day 10; 0.78 vs. 0.15 on day 20; 0.85 vs. 0.25 on day 40; and 0.85 vs. 0.17 on day 80). CONCLUSIONS: Gluten challenge resulted in an increased urinary NOx:creatinine ratio in patients with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease. The NOx:creatinine ratio could be useful for the serial evaluation of disease activity.},

Seventy-six adult celiac patients were analyzed according to nutritional status and 18 children/adolescents to gluten-free diet adherence. As controls, 84 adults and 22 adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome were used The significant findings were observed as follow: adult celiac patients, irrespective of the nutritional status, were younger than controls, presented delayed menarche, secondary amenorrhea, a higher percentage of spontaneous abortions, anemia and hypoalbuminemia. No differences were observed regarding the number of pregnancies, age at menopause and duration of the reproductive period. After treatment, patients presented with normal pregnancies and one patient presented spontaneous abortion. The adolescents who were not adherent to gluten-free diet presented delayed menarche and secondary amenorrhea. In conclusion, gluten per se could explain the disturbances and malnutrition would worsen the disease in a consequent vicious cycle. Therefore, celiac disease should be included in the screening of reproductive disorders.},

We have followed a group of children with serial testing for TGAA. METHODS: Subjects were a group of at-risk children comprised of infants expressing HLA-DR3 on newborn screening, those with type 1A diabetes, or a first-degree relative of someone with type 1 diabetes. All children participating in the prospective study for development of CD underwent serial testing for TGAA. Data from clinical evaluation and small intestinal biopsy were compared to the TGAA levels followed over time. RESULTS: In 42 children, serial TGAA determinations while on a gluten-containing diet showed levels fluctuating 10-100-fold over 3-12 months. A TGAA index more than 0.5 had a positive predictive value (PPV) for histologic confirmation of CD of 96% (22/23). A TGAA index above the usual cutoff for positivity (0.05) had a PPV of only 76% (28/37). CONCLUSIONS: In children with TGAA seropositivity, the TGAA level varied over time and a higher titer predicted an abnormal biopsy characteristic of CD. A threshold for biopsy for diagnosis of CD could be set higher for screening-identified cases than for clinically identified cases to decrease the frequency of performing "normal" biopsies.},

A gluten-free diet is without wheat, rye and barley and related products. Oats tested free of contamination by other cereals has recently been allowed for adult coeliac patients, but concern still remains regarding its general safety. Gluten-free flour mixes contain more starch and less proteins, vitamins, minerals and fibre compared to regular flour. Recently some questions have been raised as to the nutritional quality of the gluten-free diet. Successful therapy with gluten-free diet requires motivation and dietary counselling, including knowledge of the nutritional value of foods, labelling of prepackaged foods and practical training in cooking. The local chapters of the Norwegian Coeliac Society are active partners, as are the clinical nutritionists that work in most major hospitals. The physician making the diagnosis has a duty to see to it that all coeliac patients get adequate dietary counselling and management.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine symptoms and signs in children with coeliac disease and determine whether the clinical picture at disease onset has changed as incidence of the disease has decreased in the last 10 years. This project was part of the ABIS study (All Babies in Southeast Sweden, born from October 1997 to October 1999). METHODS: Eight paediatric departments in Southeast Sweden recorded all children with coeliac disease and registered symptoms according to a standard form. Data were obtained from 79 children with biopsy-confirmed coeliac disease, 43 contemporary controls, and 65 historic controls. RESULTS: When compared with children with normal intestinal biopsies, children with coeliac disease more often had abdominal distension (odds ratio [OR] = 22.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] OR = 5.00-98.25), thin extremities (OR = 5.89; 95% CI OR = 2.09-16.55), irritability (OR = 6.50; 95% CI OR = 1.83-23.03), and tiredness (OR = 15.43; 95% CI OR = 2.00-119.16). When compared with coeliac children diagnosed at < or =2 years of age in Gothenburg between 1985 and 1989, when the incidence of coeliac disease was three times higher, ABIS patients aged < or =2 years at diagnosis had less often experienced diarrhoea (OR = 0.23; 95% CI OR = 0.12-0.65), suboptimal weight gain (OR = 0.02; 95% CI OR = 0.01-0.10), or suboptimal linear growth (OR = 0.14; 95% CI OR = 0.05-0.39). CONCLUSION: This study indicates that, in parallel to changes in incidence, clinical features of coeliac disease in young children have changed during the last 10 years.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder caused by intolerance to ingested gluten that develops in genetically susceptible individuals. The contribution of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes to the genetic risk to CD has been known for a long time; however, non-HLA genetic factors are likely to be required for the development of the disease. Several studies have associated the CD28/CTLA4 region on chromosome 2q33 with the disease in different populations. The CTLA4 gene encodes a receptor involved in the control of T-cell proliferation and mediates T-cell apoptosis. AIM To determine the contribution of two polymorphisms of the CTLA4 to the disease: the A/G dimorphism at position +49 in exon 1 and the (AT)(n) microsatellite in the 3' untranslated region. PATIENTS: Forty-one celiac families of Basque origin (43 patients with CD and 80 first-degree relatives). METHODS: Restriction enzyme digestion of polymerase chain reaction amplified genomic DNA for the A/G dimorphism and polymerase chain reaction followed by high-resolution electrophoresis for the (AT)(n) microsatellite. For disease association studies, the Affected Family Based Controls approach was used. RESULTS: The frequency of the A allele of 49 A/G polymorphism was 67.47% in the celiac allele group compared with 70.13% in the Affected Family Based Controls group. These differences were not significant. Analysis of the (AT)(n) polymorphism identified 17 different alleles, ranging from 262 to 312 bp in length, but no allele was significantly associated with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our results did not show any evidence of association of any of the CTLA4 gene polymorphisms with the disease. This may result from population-specific differences in genetics and environmental susceptibility to CD.},

These disorders exert their effects on bone through a number of mechanisms, including estrogen deficiency. Deficiencies of anabolic hormones may also be important, including insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), a nutritionally regulated bone trophic factor. In addition, low weight itself is a risk factor for bone loss and decreased bone formation. Reduced calcium and vitamin D availability, with resultant secondary hyperparathyroidism, is another important mechanism of bone loss in nutritional disorders. This review discusses nutritional causes of reduced bone mass in adults and how nutritional disorders exert deleterious effects on the skeleton.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atypical presentations of celiac disease appear to be at least as common as is the classic presentation of steatorrhea, diarrhea, and weight loss. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of a gluten-free diet on gastrointestinal symptoms in a cohort of US patients with celiac disease. DESIGN: A follow-up survey was conducted in 215 patients who were evaluated at the University of Iowa from 1990 through 1997 as having biopsy-confirmed celiac disease. The systematic survey asked detailed questions regarding gastrointestinal symptoms before and after the institution of a gluten-free diet in the patients, all of whom had been given the same dietary advice. RESULTS: The group consisted of 160 female and 55 male patients. Although diarrhea was the most frequent symptom in untreated celiac disease, steatorrhea occurred in only one-fifth of patients. Other complaints were common, and most responded to gluten exclusion. The benefit of gluten exclusion was equally apparent in men and women. Diarrhea responded in most patients, usually within days, and the mean time to resolution was 4 wk. Many patients had alternating diarrhea and constipation, both of which were responsive to the gluten-free diet. Most patients had abdominal pain and bloating, which resolved with the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease causes a wide range of gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinicians must have a high level of suspicion to detect the atypical forms of celiac disease. With a gluten-free diet, patients have substantial and rapid improvement of symptoms, including symptoms other than the typical ones of diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss.},

   abstract = {The aim of this review was to identify if exclusive breast-feeding reduced the risk of coeliac disease (CD) in children. Medline, Embase and CINAHL databases were searched for cohort studies and case control studies that compared exclusive breast-feeding rates with formula or mixed (breast and formula) of the same duration. Three case control studies met the review criteria and were included in the review. The results from these studies show that there is a reduced risk in the onset of CD in those children who were exclusively breast-fed compared to those who were not. However, the design of these studies did not allow a causal relationship to be established. The evidence from these studies suggests a delay in the onset of CD in breast-fed children, however it cannot be ruled out that breast-feeding continues to have a protective factor in adolescence and adulthood. The exact role of breast-feeding in CD prevention needs to be clarified: is it a protective factor against CD, or does it delay the appearance of clinical symptoms? Parents should continue to be encouraged and supported with breast-feeding, as it is the best form of infant nutrition and protective against short and long-term health outcomes.},

We postulate that Candida albicans is a trigger in the onset of coeliac disease. The virulence factor of C albicans-hyphal wall protein 1 (HWP1)-contains aminoacid sequences that are identical or highly homologous to known coeliac disease-related alpha-gliadin and gamma-gliadin T-cell epitopes. HWP1 is a transglutaminase substrate, and is used by C albicans to adhere to the intestinal epithelium. Furthermore, tissue transglutaminase and endomysium components could become covalently linked to the yeast. Subsequently, C albicans might function as an adjuvant that stimulates antibody formation against HWP1 and gluten, and formation of autoreactive antibodies against tissue transglutaminase and endomysium.},

Out of 65 enrolled cases of CD, 7 (10.8%) children did not follow a strict dietary compliance. Only 41 children with satisfactory dietary compliance on gluten free diet (GFD) who regularly attended the follow up for at least 6 months were evaluated for their nutritional and hematological status. Results were compared with age and sex matched controls. The mean age of diagnosis was 8.7 +/- 3.3 years. Diarrhea and failure to thrive were the most common presenting symptoms. At diagnosis, the nutritional and hematological indices were significantly lower in patients than in controls. Mean duration of follow up on GFD was 22 months (range 6-48 +/- 5.6 months). On follow up, height for age Z score was significantly lower, mean BMI was significantly higher, and weight for age Z score, weight for height Z score (%), mean triceps and biceps skin fold thickness, and mid arm circumference were comparable to controls. At diagnosis, 80% cases had microcytic hypochromic anemia and 20% had dimorphic anemia. On GFD for at least a period of more than 6 months, 19% had microcytic anemia and in 81% the hematological picture was normocytic normochromic. 60% cases had thrombocytosis at diagnosis in comparison to 2.3% after treatment. Institution of GFD leads to rapid improvement in clinical picture as well as most of the nutritional and hematological parameters.},

It is characterized by intestinal villi atrophy, increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes and extense inflammatory infiltrate in the intestinal lamina propria. The role of gluten as responsible for the intestinal damage seen in CS patients is clear, however, the physiopathological mechanisms involved are still unknown. Several factors and theories have been proposed: 1) Genetic predisposition, based on the association to mendelian factors as well to the presence of particular major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes in CS patients; 2) Immunological factors, that consider the derangements that occur in the immune response of CS patients, and 3) Gliadin partial deamination by the tissular transglutaminase (tTG). In an effort to explain all these complex mechanisms, recently, all these theories have been unified, yielding one complex physiopathogenic mechanism that we tray to explain in the present review.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a multifactorial disorder of the proximal small intestine associated with a permanent intolerance to gluten. The HLA-DQ(alpha1*0501, beta1*02) heterodimer is strongly associated with this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors studied a sample of 354 unrelated Caucasoid individuals: 118 patients with celiac disease and 236 control subjects. All patients and controls subjects were born in Gran Canaria (Canary Islands) at least two generations ago. The authors typed the HLA-DQA1 and DQB1 genes by DNA methods. The positive and negative predictive values of the test were studied. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 25.4 months, with a statistically significant proportion of females (64.4%, P < 0.002). For DQB1 gene, the susceptibility allele found was DQB1*02 (relative risk [RR] = 7.60, confidence interval [CI]: 5.35-10.78), whereas for the DQA1 gene, the susceptibility alleles found were DQA1*0501 (RR = 2.99, CI: 2.16-4.14) and DQA1*0201 (RR = 1.88, CI: 1.25-2.82). The presence of the DQ(alpha1*0501, beta1*02) heterodimer was strongly associated with the disease (92.4% in the patients group vs. 21.6% in control subjects). HLA-DQ8 heterodimer was absent in the authors' patients. DQB1*02 homozygous subjects presented a higher relative risk for celiac disease. There was no correlation of DQB1*02 dosage with age at onset below 12 years of age or with gender distribution. Sensitivity, specificity, and the positive and negative predictive values of the test were 92.4%, 78.4%, 68.1%, and 95.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the DQ2 (DQA1*0501/DQB1*02) heterodimer is strongly associated with celiac disease in the population studied by the authors. The value of this test derives from its ability to exclude disease when a negative result occurs.},

Necessary nutrients must be absorbed and commensal bacteria tolerated, and foreign proteins, antigens, and pathogens must be simultaneously excluded or destroyed. Immaturity or disruption of the mucosal immune defenses increases vulnerability to food allergy, intolerance, and infectious disease. Diseases resulting from ingested foreign proteins and organisms are increasing and cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is no specific treatment for food allergy other than avoidance. Vaccination for infectious disease is limited by the cost and logistics of distribution and administration, particularly in developing countries. Novel strategies are being explored to modulate the gut mucosal immune system by altering protein expression in food. Crops are being developed to remove deleterious allergens to prevent immunogenic exposure while preserving nutritional quality. Local food plants that express protein fragments of pathogens might provide an effective means to stimulate gut mucosal immunity while increasing vaccine accessibility.},

METHODS: Antibodies were measured using an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test in 80 patients with type 1 diabetes, subdivided according to the presence or absence in their serum of celiac disease-related antibodies. For comparison, 30 patients with celiac disease (nondiabetic), 13 patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, and 45 healthy volunteers were used. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of patients with diabetes yielded a positive result, with a mean value of 26.1 +/- 21.8 arbitrary units (AU). If the group was split into those with celiac disease-related antibodies and those lacking them, the percentages were 53% and 25%, respectively, with a mean value of 39.6 +/- 28.4 AU and 22.4 +/- 18.3 AU (P = 0.003), respectively. Seventy-three percent of celiac patients showed bovine serum albumin antibodies with a mean level of 38.8 +/- 27.7 AU, comparable to that of patients with diabetes with celiac antibodies, but higher than the group lacking them (P = 0.001). Although 46% of patients with autoimmune thyroiditis had positive results, the level detected (22.1 +/- 8.7 AU) was significantly lower than that recorded in patients with type 1 diabetes who had celiac disease antibodies (P = 0.04) and celiac patients (P = 0.04). Healthy volunteers showed no antibodies against bovine serum albumin. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that bovine serum albumin antibodies appears in patients with a compromised epithelial permeability, and they reflect a general defect in the process of immunologic tolerance associated with a predisposition to autoimmunity, rather than immunity specific to beta cells.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate magnesium status in CD without malabsorption symptoms in patients aged 5-18 years. In the study participated 41 coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for a mean 11 years with IgAEmA (-) and normal villi, 28 patients with untreated subclinical (atypical) CD with IgAEmA (+) and villous atrophy, and 8 healthy subjects as a control group. METHOD: Magnesium status was examined by an intravenous Mg loading test, determination of serum and erythrocyte Mg concentrations, and urinary excretion. Steatorrhea was assessed by fecal fat excretion. Magnesium, calcium, protein, and fat intake were evaluated by a food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: The frequency of magnesium deficiency as assessed by the magnesium loading test was: 19.6% in treated, 21.4% in untreated CD patients, and 25% in control group, similar in both sexes, sporadic in small towns (3.8%), frequent in large cities and rural villages (23.5% vs. 32.3%). Fat excretion was within normal limits. The following results were found, respectively: decreased serum magnesium concentration, 7.3% vs. 3.6% vs. 0%, decreased erythrocyte Mg concentration, 14.6% vs. 25% vs. 12.5%; decreased intake of magnesium, 29% vs. 32% vs. 0%. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of magnesium deficiency was similar in pediatric patients who were treated for CD or in patients with subclinical CD, and in control group; magnesium deficiency in patients participating in our study depended on an imbalanced diet.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To study the effect of gluten-free diet on growth and diabetic control of children with type 1 diabetes mellitus and coeliac disease. METHODS: Twenty one children (mean age 7.5 years, range 1.6-12.9) with type 1 diabetes, primarily initially identified on the basis of symptoms and consecutively diagnosed with coeliac disease by biopsy over a 10 year period, were matched by sex, age at onset, and duration of diabetes with two diabetic controls without coeliac disease. Weight, height, haemoglobin A1c, and insulin requirements were measured before and for 12 months after the diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease. Dietary awareness and adherence were assessed by structured questionnaire. RESULTS: A gluten-free diet resulted in a significant increase in weight-for-age z scores at 12 months after diagnosis (mean increase in z score 0.33) and in BMI (mean increase in z score 0.32). Increases in height did not achieve statistical significance. Controls showed no significant changes in weight, height, or BMI over the same period. Insulin dosage at diagnosis was less in coeliacs than in controls (mean difference 0.16 units/kg/day), but was similar to controls once a gluten-free diet had been established. Questionnaires were obtained in 20 patients. There appeared to be a relation between dietary awareness/adherence and growth parameters, but the small number of patients with "poor/fair" dietary adherence prevented meaningful analysis of this group. CONCLUSION: Identification and dietary treatment of coeliac disease in children with diabetes improved growth and influenced diabetic control. Evaluation of the outcome of treatment of coeliac disease in diabetics should include assessments of gluten intake.},

   abstract = {The role of vagal afferents and splanchnic fibers in nutrient-induced flavor conditioning and feeding suppression was determined. Male rats were fitted with intraduodenal (ID) catheters and given subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA), celiac-superior mesenteric ganglionectomy (CGX), combined (COM) treatments, or sham surgery. In separate conditioning trials, they were trained to drink (30 min/day) flavored saccharin solutions paired with concurrent ID infusions of 8% maltodextrin or water and 3.55% corn oil or water. Experiment 1 revealed that SDA and sham rats showed equal preferences for the nutrient-paired flavors over the water-paired flavors. In contrast, SDA rats, unlike sham rats, failed to suppress their intake of a palatable fluid when infused intraduodenally with maltodextrin or corn oil. Experiment 2 revealed that CGX, COM and sham rats all developed preferences for the maltodextrin-paired flavor, although CGX alone or COM attenuated the conditioned preference. CGX and COM treatments also attenuated or blocked the feeding inhibitory actions of ID nutrient infusions. These findings along with prior data indicate that gut vagal afferents and splanchnic nerves are not essential for flavor-nutrient preference conditioning, whereas both vagal afferents and splanchnic nerves are implicated in carbohydrate- and fat-induced satiation.},

METHODS: Thirty patients with asymptomatic CD (17 children, 13 adolescents), on a gluten-free diet, and 23 healthy subjects were studied. BMD of the lumbar spine (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) was performed on all patients and control subjects. In patients, food diaries for nine nonconsecutive days were obtained and analyzed. In patients, laboratory tests pertaining to calcium balance were obtained. RESULTS: The mean weight and height of the adolescents with CD were lower than those of control subjects (weight: 45.8 +/- 10.5 kg v 55.3 +/- 10.5 kg, P = 0.037; height: 153.0 +/- 11.0 cm v 167 +/- 12.0 cm, P = 0.007). The mean BMD in adolescents with CD was significantly lower than that of the control subjects (0.917 +/- 0.116 g/cm2 v 1.060 +/- 0.158 g/cm2, P = 0.015), whereas no significant difference was found between children with CD and control subjects (P = 0.595). A multiple-regression model shows that increases in BMD relative to height were lower in adolescents with CD than in control subjects. The proportion of adolescents who had started a gluten-free diet after 2 years of age was higher than that of children with CD (P < 0.001). High percentages of magnesium, calcium, and phosphorous deficiencies were present in CD patients' diets. The serum levels of ionized and total calcium and parathormone were normal. CONCLUSIONS: The BMD of adolescents with CD was lower than that of the control subjects, whereas no difference was found between the BMD of children with CD and that of control subjects.},

Our study aims were to evaluate the prevalence of undiagnosed CD in Arab infertile women and to explore the usefulness of using more than one serological marker in the diagnostic screening for CD in this population. METHODS: Women with unexplained infertility (n = 192) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 210) were prospectively enrolled. Serum was tested for human tissue transglutaminase antibodies (TTG), antiendomysial antibodies (EMA), and immunoglobulin A. Intestinal biopsy was offered to women with positive serology or immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency. RESULTS: CD was diagnosed in five infertile women (2.65%) and in one control (0.5%) (p = 0.11). Gastrointestinal complaints were present in 60% (three of five) of women with CD and 11.8% (22 of 187) of women without CD (p = 0.017). Anemia was reported in 80% of infertile women with CD and 4.8% of infertile women without CD (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Undiagnosed CD is prevalent in Arab infertile women as well as in Arab women in general. CD in Arab infertile women is frequently associated with gastrointestinal complaints and anemia. EMA testing is sufficient in suspected cases.},

CD patients have a cure for their disease, named the gluten-free diet, but this curative measure is very hard to adhere to. With the new insights into the pathogenesis of CD, clinicians enter an era where new treatment modalities for CD may turn into reality.},

We aimed to establish the prevalence of CD antibodies in a cohort of APS patients, and to examine whether CD may be responsible for some of the manifestations of APS. Fifty-seven patients (47 females, 10 males) with APS were studied for clinical manifestations and serological markers of the disease, as well as the presence of anti-endomysial antibodies using an ELISA assay (EMA-ELISA). Control subjects were 171 healthy individuals, age- and sex-matched (141 females). Eight patients with APS (14%, six females) were found to have EMA-ELISA antibodies, compared with 2/141 (1.1%) of controls (P = 0.0003). Antibodies against beta2-glycoprotein-I (beta2GPI) epitopes (GRTCPKPDDLP) were more prevalent in EMA-positive patients than in EMA-negative patients (P = 0.006). Vasculitic skin lesions were significantly more common in EMA-ELISA-positive compared with EMA-ELISA-negative patients(62.5 versus 16.3%, P = 0.01). Among the skin manifestations, superficial cutaneous necrosis (37.5 versus 2%, P = 0.007) was more prevalent in EMA-ELISA-positive than in EMA-ELISA-negative patients. EMA-ELISA antibodies are common in APS, and their presence is associated with high prevalence of antibodies recognizing certain beta2-glycoprotein epitopes, and with cutaneous manifestations of APS.},

   abstract = {Chronic pancreatitis should be considered in all patients with unexplained abdominal pain. Management of abdominal pain in these patients continues to pose a formidable challenge. The importance of small duct disease without radiographic abnormalities is now a well-established concept. It is meaningful to determine whether patients with chronic pancreatitis have small duct or large duct disease because this distinction has therapeutic implications. Diagnostic evaluation should begin with simple noninvasive and inexpensive tests like serum trypsinogen and fecal elastase, to be followed where appropriate by more complicated measures such as the secretin hormone stimulation test, especially in patients with suspected small duct disease. No universal causal treatment is available. Non-enteric-coated enzyme preparations are useful for treatment of pain, whereas enteric-coated enzyme preparations are preferred for steatorrhea. Octreotide is used increasingly for abdominal pain that is unresponsive to pancreatic enzyme therapy. When medical therapy for chronic pancreatitis pain has failed, endoscopic therapy, endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus block, and thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy, performed by experts, may be considered for a highly selected patient population. Surgical ductal decompression is appropriate in patients with considerable pancreatic ductal dilation. The role and efficacy of cholecystokinin-receptor antagonists, antioxidants, and antidepressant drugs remain to be defined.},

Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a milk cytokine affecting the proliferation and differentiation of mucosal epithelial cells, was studied as to its potential protective effect on the damage of intestinal mucosa by gliadin in a model system. METHODS: Enteropathy was induced by gliadin in inbred AVN strain rat pups delivered by cesarean section, breast-fed, or hand-fed a milk formula. All experimental groups were treated with interferon-gamma (1,000 U per animal, administered intraperitoneally) after birth. Gliadin (0.5 and 3 mg) was intragastrically administered to the pups on days 0 and 3, and a 30-mg challenge dose was given on day 20 (24 hours before the termination of the experiment). One group of artificially fed pups received EGF (100 ng/ml) continuously in the diet. RESULTS: Gliadin- and interferon-gamma-treated formula-fed rat pups showed villus atrophy, increase of inflammatory cells, including CD4+ T lymphocytes in the lamina propria, and damage to epithelial tight junctions and the enterocyte brush border. Morphometrically, the villus height was significantly less than in other groups. Recombinant EGF was markedly increased in the epithelial cells of injured jejunum. The intestinal mucosa of gliadin- and interferon-gamma-treated pups kept on a EGF-supplemented artificial diet resembled that of breast-fed pups. CONCLUSION: Pathologic changes in jejunal mucosa (villus atrophy and inflammation) resembling gliadin-induced atrophy appeared on administration of interferon-gamma and gliadin to rat pups fed an artificial milk diet immediately after birth. Addition of EGF to the diet protected the rats against pathologic mucosal changes.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the nutritional and symptomatic effects of including oats in the gluten-free diet, as well as the patients' subjective experiences. Twenty adult coeliac patients included large amounts of oats in their diet. Food intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, blood samples and body weight were examined and compared with examination at baseline. Diet compliance was checked monthly. The results are based on fifteen patients eating oats for 2 years plus three with only 6-months consumption. The median daily intake of oats was 93 (range 27-137) g/d, and the compliance was good. The mean intakes of Fe and dietary fibre increased (P<0.001) with the oat diet, as well as the intakes of thiamin and Zn (P<0.02). The bioavailability of Fe tended to decrease; this seems not to have influenced the Fe status. Temporary increased flatulence was experienced the first few weeks, as well as improved bowel function with oats in the diet. All patients who carried out the whole study period wanted to continue eating oats after the study, as they found that addition of oats in the gluten-free diet gave more variation, better taste and satiety. Oats improved the nutritional value of the gluten-free diet, had no negative effects on nutritional status and were appreciated by the subjects. Including oats can help coeliac patients following a strict gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether adult patients with coeliac disease in remission could include large amounts of oats in their daily gluten-free diet for an extended period of time without adverse effects. DESIGN, SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty adult coeliac patients in remission included large amounts of uncontaminated rolled oats in their daily diet for a prolonged period. The examinations, performed four times during the study period, included small bowel endoscopy with biopsies, blood samples (nutritional status, serological analysis), height and body weight, gastrointestinal symptoms and dietary records. Gastrointestinal symptoms and diet were also investigated through unannounced telephone interviews once a month during the study period. RESULTS: No adverse effects of a large intake of oats were seen in small bowel histology, serology nor in nutritional status in the 15 subjects who completed the whole study period. Two of the subjects dropped out because of gastrointestinal symptoms and three for non-medical reasons. The median intake of oats was 93 g/day and the compliance to the oat diet was found to be good. Examinations of the patients after drop-out did not show any deterioration in small bowel histology or nutritional status nor raised levels of antibodies. CONCLUSION: Results from this study indicate that adult patients with coeliac disease in remission can include large amounts of controlled wheat-free rolled oats for an extended period of time without adverse effects.},

Laboratory tests revealed iron deficiency anaemia and positive antigliadin antibodies in both of the patients. Slightly raised grey-white plaques were observed on oesophageal mucosa during endoscopical investigation of the patients. While intestinal mucosal samples confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease histologically, histopathological assessment of oesophageal lesions demonstrated glycogenic acanthosis. Since glycogenic acanthosis associated with celiac disease hasn't been reported in the literature previously to our knowledge, case reports of our patients were presented. CONCLUSION: We suggest that glycogenic acanthosis needs to be investigated as a possible new association of celiac disease in greater paediatric series.},

However, little is known in regards to the allergenicity of gliadin in atopic dermatitis. In this study, the allergenicity of gliadin was demonstrated using sera of wheat-allergic patients with atopic dermatitis. Since there are many repeated sequences in gliadin, peptides containing each motif were synthesized to evaluate their IgE-binding abilities. As a result, QQPFP and PQQPF were found to be epitopes (minimum structures for the IgE-binding). Gliadin might crosslink patient's IgE-antibodies via these epitopes and trigger subsequent allergic reactions.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) is a characteristic skin condition seen in the presence of a pancreatic glucagonoma. The presence of NME in the absence of a pancreatic tumor has been termed the pseudoglucagonoma syndrome. In such cases, NME is commonly associated with conditions, such as liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, malabsorption disorders (ie, celiac sprue), and other malignancies. There are many theories on the pathogenesis of NME, which include the direct action of glucagon in inducing skin necrolysis, hypoaminoacidemia-inducing epidermal protein deficiency and necrolysis, a nutritional or metabolic deficiency of zinc or essential fatty acids, liver disease, glucagon induction of inflammatory mediators, a substance secreted from pancreatic and other visceral tumors associated with NME, and generalized malabsorption. OBJECTIVE: To present a review of the literature on the clinical presentation, etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of NME. DESIGN: Review of the literature on NME occurring in patients both with and without a pancreatic glucagonoma. METHODS: We performed a PubMed review of the literature on the etiology and pathogenesis of NME to identify case reports and reviews published in both the internal medicine and dermatology literature. RESULTS: Our literature review encompassed 17 primary case reports and literature reviews published in the dermatologic and internal medicine literature on NME in patients both with and without a pancreatic glucagonoma. Although we found no clear consensus among the investigators of a universally accepted pathogenesis for NME, we did identify 4 main categories of etiologic/pathogenetic mechanisms for NME (glucagon excess, nutritional deficiencies, inflammatory mediators, and liver disease) that were discussed by many of the investigators and validated by both clinical and scientific evidence. CONCLUSION: The exact pathogenesis and treatment of NME remain ill-defined despite many case reports and studies on NME in the literature. The many systemic diseases and nutritional deficiencies that have been found to be associated with NME suggest a multifactorial model for the pathogenesis of the disease. The most comprehensive, postulated mechanism for NME involves a combination of zinc, amino acid, and fatty acid deficiencies (arising from a wide variety of causes, such as dietary insufficiency, malabsorption syndromes, liver disease, elevated glucagon levels, and disorders of metabolism) that contributes to increased inflammation in the epidermis in response to trauma and to the necrolysis observed in NME. The importance of gaining an understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of NME lies in the fact that there is no universally accepted mechanism of pathogenesis for NME, and that the only treatment reported to resolve the rash in these patients is to adequately identify and treat the underlying associated systemic condition or nutritional deficiency.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There has been an explosion in knowledge about celiac disease (CD) in the last decade based on the availability of serologic screening tests and the elucidation of some of the important disease susceptibility genes. What has been discovered is that CD is among the most common inherited diseases with a worldwide prevalence of almost 1% of the population. Also, there has been a tremendous expansion of the possible clinical presentations in patients with CD, many of them predominantly or even exclusively extraintestinal. Over the last year, both the North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and the NIH, through the mechanism of a consensus development conference held in May 2004, have published guidelines outlining the current state of knowledge and the areas where more research is needed. RECENT FINDINGS: This review will stress the most recent findings in CD in the areas of genetics, pathogenesis, epidemiology, screening and diagnosis, and natural history. It will stress the importance of HLA DQ2 and DQ8 as disease susceptibility genes, and the interaction of the environmental triggers (gliadins and glutenins) with these gene products to trigger the immunologic response in the gut that is responsible for the pattern of injury. Recent reports that stress the importance of screening high-risk groups (i.e. siblings of index cases and first degree relatives, patients with Type I diabetes, patients with Downs syndrome, patients with IgA deficiency) will be highlighted. The identification of the most sensitive and specific screening tests will be summarized with an explanation of special situations that affect the interpretation of these tests. Finally, the long-term morbidities associated with CD will be characterized supporting the case for early diagnosis and treatment. SUMMARY: The implications of these recent findings are of tremendous importance for both pediatricians and internists. Screening of high-risk groups, and of patients with the common symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, iron deficiency anemia, unexplained arthritis, and even chronic elevations of aminotransferases is becoming the accepted standard of practice. Much research remains to be done to further refine our understanding of CD, and to devise more effective strategies for treatment, compliance, and prevention of long-term complications.},

   abstract = {We present a patient with Fabry disease with remarkable diagnostic findings and gluten-sensitive enteropathy. An 11-year-old girl was admitted to hospital with weight loss, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, flank pain, acroparesthesia, and painful extremities. Her mother had end-stage renal failure secondary to Fabry disease. On physical examination, she had growth retardation. Ophthalmological examination showed characteristic whorl-like corneal opacities and Fabry disease was confirmed with low alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-gal A) activity. Her painful attacks were treated with carbamazepine, but vomiting and nausea continued. Laboratory studies revealed positive serum anti-endomysium and anti-gliadin antibodies. Small intestinal biopsy showed subtotal villous atrophy compatible with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Following treatment with a gluten-free diet, her gastrointestinal symptoms completely disappeared within a few weeks and then she had catch-up growth. In her long-term follow-up, proteinuria appeared and renal involvement was confirmed by characteristic renal biopsy findings. Following these clinicopathological findings, enzyme replacement therapy was started. In conclusion, although heterozygous females can be asymptomatic or are expected to have a mild course of the disease, a severe clinical course in our patient in the 2nd decade is of particular interest. In addition, Fabry disease occurring with gluten-sensitive enteropathy, a very rare co-existence, is emphasized.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy in genetically susceptible individuals. Anecdotal reports suggest that the nervous system might be affected in the disorder, but the severity and prevalence of such an involvement have not been systematically evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of files of CD patients diagnosed between 1980 and 1999 for neurological abnormalities. Diagnosis of CD was based on the modified criteria of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. RESULTS: Of 148 CD patients, 18 (12%) had 21 neurological disorders that could not be attributed to any other condition including muscle abnormality (3), epilepsy (3), psychiatric disease (4), peripheral neuropathy (3), cerebrovascular disease (1), myelopathy (1) and Down syndrome (2). Other disorders probably unrelated to CD were present in 8 patients. CONCLUSION: If this association is not coincidental, both the central and the peripheral nervous systems may be affected in CD by a spectrum of neurological disorders that are either the outcome of CD or share the same pathogenesis with the enteropathy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some patients with smoldering pancreatitis in the absence of necrosis, pseudocyst, and ductal disruption experience unremitting abdominal pain caused by persistent pancreatic inflammation. Experience with the use of pancreatic duct stents in this patient population was reviewed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data for 11 patients with smoldering pancreatitis who underwent ERCP with pancreatic duct stent placement were reviewed retrospectively. All patients had severe, daily pain that worsened with ingestion of food, had required narcotic analgesics for control of pain, had lost weight, and had persistently elevated serum levels of pancreatic enzymes as well as pancreatic inflammatory changes on CT (without necrosis or pseudocyst). Six patients were being treated with parenteral nutrition. OBSERVATIONS: The mean duration of symptoms from the onset of pancreatitis until pancreatic duct stent insertion was 74 days (range 14-151 days). Stents were placed for a mean of 7 weeks (range 2-19 weeks). Pancreatic stent placement provided permanent pain relief in 10 (91%) patients within a mean of 9 days (range 3-20 days); one patient had persistent symptoms requiring celiac plexus blockade after 5 months. Parenteral nutrition and treatment with narcotic agents were discontinued for 10 patients within a mean of 15 days (range 7-39 days) after pancreatic duct insertion. CONCLUSIONS: Smoldering pancreatitis may result from functional obstruction, possibly caused by edema or spasm, of the papillary orifice. Insertion of a stent into the pancreatic duct alleviates pain, enables early resumption of oral intake of food, and facilitates pancreatic duct drainage. It also may help to prevent complications arising from persistent pancreatic inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac patients are at high risk of developing insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a condition that has a long pre-diabetic period. During this lapse, anti-islet cell antibodies serve as markers for future disease. This may be related with the duration of the exposure to gluten. AIM: To test the hypothesis that long term adherence to a gluten free diet decreases the frequency of risk markers for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus during adolescence and early adulthood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 158 celiac patients were classified as: G1, (n=30 patients) studied at the time of diagnosis; G2 (n=97 patients) exposed to gluten as a result of non compliance with the gluten free diet and, G3 (n=31 patients) who had maintained a long term, strict gluten free diet. Isotype IgG anti-islet cell antibodies were detected by indirect immunofluorescence using monkey pancreas, results were reported in Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) units. RESULTS: Celiac patients exposed to a gluten containing diet had a significantly higher prevalence of anti-islet cell antibodies than those who had been exposed only briefly (p < 0.017). In addition, a significantly higher prevalence of anti-islet cell antibodies was observed in those patients whose exposure to gluten was longer than 5 years than in those whose exposure was shorter (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Celiac patients long exposed to gluten have a significantly higher prevalence of anti-islet cell antibodies than those exposed for a short period. This fact supports the hypothesis that the development of these antibodies is associated with the length of the exposure to gluten.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate the expression of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and activation and proliferation markers in duodenal biopsies from children with delayed-type food allergy (FA). METHODS: Seven children with untreated FA (uFA), seven children with treated FA (tFA) to cow milk and/or cereals, and five normal controls furnished duodenal biopsy specimens. Additionally, five pediatric patients with celiac disease were included, serving exclusively as positive controls for in situ hybridization. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-4 (IL-4), adhesion molecules, and activation markers were detected by immunohistochemistry, and expression of IFN-gamma and IL-4 messenger RNA was revealed by in situ hybridization. RESULTS: uFA patients had a higher density of IFN-gamma positive cells in the lamina propria than did tFA patients and controls (P = 0.053 and P = 0.018). Moreover, the uFA patients exhibited a higher proportion of crypt cells in mitosis than did tFA patients (P = 0.026), and stronger staining of HLA-DR in the crypts and increased density of gammadelta-T cell receptor-positive intraepithelial lymphocytes than did controls (P = 0.048 and P = 0.010). The densities of alpha(4)beta(7) positive cells in the lamina propria tended to be higher in controls than in uFA or tFA patients (P = 0.106, P = 0.073). Expression of IL-4 mRNA was significantly higher in celiac patients than in the other study groups (uFA P = 0.006, tFA P = 0.010; controls P = 0.029), and celiac patients showed higher expression of IFN-gamma mRNA than did tFA patients or controls (P = 0.017 and P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: As expected, Th1 dominance was present in the lamina propria of children with delayed-type FA. It may cause activation of epithelial cells and increase their turnover.},

   abstract = {Decreased bone mineral density is a frequent finding in gastrointestinal disease. Factors contributing to this are (1) malabsorption of vitamin D, calcium and possibly vitamin K and other nutrients; (2) treatment with glucocorticoids; (3) inflammatory cytokines in inflammatory bowel disease; and (4) hypogonadism induced by gastrointestinal disease. A low bone mineral density has been reported in (1) patients who have undergone gastrectomy (27-44% with Z-scores of < -1); (2) pernicious anaemia; (3) coeliac disease (8-22% with Z-scores of < -2); (4) Crohn's disease (mean 32-38% with Z-scores of < -1); and (5) ulcerative colitis (mean 23-25% with Z-scores of < -1). Reduced bone mineral density is thus prevalent in these individuals and is compounded by age related bone loss, leading to the development of severe bone disease in some patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Screening for celiac disease is based on the sequential evaluation of serologic tests and intestinal biopsy; an optimal screening protocol is still under investigation. The screening policy of one of the main healthcare providers in Israel (Maccabi) consists of measuring total immunoglobulin A and tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies and confirming positive results by endomysial antibodies. For IgA-deficient patients antigliadin IgG is measured. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the use of tTGA as a first-level screening test in patients suspected of having celiac disease METHODS: The results of tTGA and EMA tests over a 3 month period were obtained from the laboratory computer. Letters were sent to the referring physicians of patients with positive tests, requesting clinical information and small intestinal biopsy results. tTGA was performed using an anti-guinea pig tTG-IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. RESULTS: Overall, 2,505 tTGA tests were performed: 216 (8.6%) were tTGA-positive of which 162 (75%) were EMA-negative (group 1) and 54 (25%) EMA-positive (group 2.) Clinical information was obtained for 91 patients in group 1 and 32 in group 2. Small intestinal biopsy was performed in 33 (36%) and 27 patients (84%) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Celiac disease was diagnosed in 4 biopsies (12%) in group 1 and 23 (85%) in group 2 (P < 0.0001). The positive predictive value was 45% for tTGA and 85% for EMA. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic patients with positive tTGA and negative EMA have a low rate of celiac disease compared to those who are tTGA-positive and EMA-positive. Confirmation with EMA is advised when tTGA is performed as a first-level screening for suspected celiac disease.},

We studied the serum levels of carnitine and selenium in children with CD. METHODS: Serum levels of free carnitine and selenium were studied in 30 children (mean age 8.1 [4.4] years) with CD and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy children. All patients had type 3 duodenal lesions. The mean (SD) serum levels of free carnitine and selenium were lower among patients with CD (24.5 [7.7] micromol/mL and 52.1 (12.9) micromol/mL, respectively) than among healthy controls (29.4 [9.2] and 65.1 [17.2] micromol/mL; p < 0.05 each). Levels were similar in children with and without diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Serum carnitine and selenium levels are decreased in children with CD, probably due to malabsorption.},

   abstract = {Ferulic acid (FA) is one of the most abundant phenolic antioxidants in the human diet. Many studies have documented its beneficial properties. It is therefore essential to understand the absorption and metabolism of FA in detail. The purpose of this study was to confirm the hypothesis that FA is absorbed in rat stomach and metabolized mainly in the liver. We determined the recovery of FA and its metabolites (FA sulfate/glucuronides) in rat gastric contents, gastric mucosa, portal vein plasma, celiac arterial plasma, bile, and urine after 2.25 micromol FA was administered in 0.5 mL physiological saline and incubated for 25 min in situ in the stomach of rats. Within 25 min, 74 +/- 11% of the administered FA disappeared from the stomach; later, FA was recovered in both free and conjugated forms in plasma, bile, and urine. On the other hand, only free FA was detected in the gastric contents and mucosa; it was also detected in the portal vein plasma as 49 +/- 5% of the total FA (all forms of FA). However, the proportion of free FA in the celiac arterial plasma, bile, and urine decreased to 5-8%. These results indicate that FA can be quickly absorbed from the rat stomach, and then is likely metabolized mainly in the liver. Such novel information would be helpful in the use of FA as a nutrient supplement. For example, oral administration of FA in capsule form or in a form bonded with sugar esters may provide a more appropriate concentration of FA in the circulation, which may improve its proposed efficacy in preventing chronic disease.},

   abstract = {Although it generally does not improve performance, iron is often used by elite athletes. The physiologic changes induced by exercise can mimic iron deficiency and decrease hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations. Determination of serum transferrin receptor concentrations may identify true iron deficiency, which occurs particularly in young athletes. In contrast, increased iron stores in the body are a frequent finding in elite athletes who have used long-term iron supplementation. Elite runners have increased intestinal blood loss, but this usually can be compensated by enhanced absorption of dietary iron. The combination of exercise-induced hemolysis with enhanced intestinal blood loss in various endurance sports leads to severe abnormalities of routine tests, and extreme physical activity may be responsible for positive fecal occult blood determinations. Indiscriminate iron supplementation carries the risk of inducing hemochromatosis in individuals homozygous for the widespread C282Y allele of the HFE gene. This polymorphism is common and can be found in about 1% of individuals of Northern European descent; moreover, iron supplementation can modify the presentation of important underlying diseases such as celiac disease or colon carcinoma. In conclusion, iron supplements should be prescribed for athletes with iron-deficiency anemia and carefully monitored if given for prophylaxis; unless a therapeutic response occurs, investigations to establish the cause of iron deficiency should be initiated.},
