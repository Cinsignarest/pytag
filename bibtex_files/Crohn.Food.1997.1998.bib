   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although suggested, it has never been convincingly documented that food sensitivity is of pathogenetic importance in chronic inflammatory bowel disease. However, many patients may relate their gastrointestinal symptoms to specific food items ingested and may restrict their diet accordingly. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease who attended the outpatient clinic, Medical Dept., Roskilde County Hospital in Koge, Denmark, in the year 1993. The patients were asked whether they had problems with any particular food item and, if so, to describe the symptoms experienced from it. A control group of 70 healthy persons were included. RESULTS: Among 189 patients, 132 (70%) responded. One hundred and thirty had completed the questionnaire, 52 males and 78 females aged 13-89 years (median, 43 years). Fifty-three (41%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 69 (53%) ulcerative colitis (UC), and 8 (6%) unclassified colitis. Forty-one patients (31 CD, 10 UC) were-operated on; 51 (19 CD, 32 UC) had disease activity. Sixty-five per cent of the patients and 14% of the controls reported being intolerant to one or more food items (P < 0.0001). The intolerance covered a wide range of food products. The commonest symptoms among patients were diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and meteorism and among controls, regurgitation. Food intolerance was equally common in CD (66%) and UC (64%) and was not related to previous operation, disease activity or disease location. CONCLUSION: Most patients with chronic inflammatory bowel intolerance disease feel intolerant to different food items and may restrict their diet accordingly. The frequency and pattern of food intolerance did not differ between patients with CD and UC. The food intolerance was probably unspecific rather than of pathogenetic importance.},

The aim of the study was to examine the presence of eosinophil and mast cell mediators in human stool samples of patients with inflammatory bowel disorders. We measured eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil protein X (EPX), methylhistamine, and alpha 1-antitrypsin in fecal samples of 136 patients (62 Crohn's disease, 24 ulcerative colitis, 15 intestinal food allergy, 35 other gastrointestinal diseases) and 8 healthy controls. We found strongly elevated levels of ECP (median: 29, range: 0.4-1783 ng/g feces) and EPX (803, 10-33,225 ng/g) in all patients groups compared to controls (ECP: 1.5, 0.5-55 ng/g; EPX: 235, 12-746 ng/g). Similar results, albeit less pronounced, were obtained for methylhistamine and alpha 1-antitrypsin. Particularly high concentrations of ECP and EPX were found in patients with active mucosal inflammation. In conclusion, the study presents an easy and reliable method for the detection of fecal ECP, EPX, and methylhistamine and may provide a tool to gain insight into the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases and have potential as diagnostic test.},

   abstract = {The idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are chronic disorders that appear to arise from an aberrant interaction of environmental, genetic, and immunologic factors. The aim of this study was to examine the immune reactivity of a spontaneously colitic mouse strain, C3H/HeJBir, to epithelial, food, and enteric bacterial Ags. Serum Ab responses of colitic C3H/HeJBir and noncolitic parental C3H/HeJ mice were measured by enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting. No reactivity to epithelial or food Ags was detected. However, the sera from C3H/HeJBir mice had a reproducible banding pattern on Western blot to bacterial Ags, whereas sera from C3H/HeJ mice did not. Only a small, highly selected number of enteric bacterial Ags were recognized. There were major differences in the degree of recognition of different bacterial strains, marked by remarkably few Abs to Ags of the major anaerobes of the bacterial flora. The serum Abs detected on immunoblot were primarily IgG2a, suggesting a Th1 response. Comparison of sera reactivity to histopathologic severity showed an inverse relationship: one third of young C3H/HeJBir mice during the peak of colitis produced Abs to bacterial Ags, while later in life, when the colitis had resolved, 96% produced Abs. These data are consistent with an abnormal immune reactivity to enteric bacterial flora in C3H/HeJBir mice, a reactivity that is highly selective considering the abundant bacterial Ags present in the colon lumen. We postulate that this reactivity plays a role in the pathogenesis of colitis in these mice.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: SMA volume flow rates before and after a food challenge (200 ml of Ensure Plus) were recorded over 60 min in 11 controls, and 25 patients with proven Crohn's disease. Peak flow rates and the time interval to peak flow were recorded. Eleven patients with active disease were monitored longitudinally and their response following the introduction of systemic steroids was assessed. RESULTS: The time interval from food challenge to peak SMA flow rate was significantly lower in patients with untreated active disease (median 20 min, range 14.5-21.25) compared to inactive patients (median 33 mins, range 28.75-40.5, P = 0.0006). Longitudinal follow-up of active disease demonstrated prolongation of time to peak flow following clinical remission (P = 0.0024) CONCLUSIONS: This technique is useful in offering an immediate, noninvasive means of assessing disease activity. Further longitudinal follow up data is necessary to determine its utility in assessing response to treatment.},

As the infection progresses, excretion of M. paratuberculosis in feces and milk occurs, and the bacterium spreads through the blood to multiple internal organs. Consequently, raw products originating from cattle may harbor M. paratuberculosis. Thermal treatments, such as pasteurization, are commonly relied on to kill food-borne bacterial pathogens that can infect humans. The small number of studies conducted to determine the thermal resistance of M. paratuberculosis suggest that it is less susceptible to destruction by heat killing than are milkborne zoonotic bacterial pathogens such as Listeria spp. or Mycobacterium bovis. Published reports concerning the thermal resistance of M. paratuberculosis in milk are reviewed herein, and key issues concerning the efficacy of pasteurization for elimination of M. paratuberculosis from milk are summarized.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smoking, probably due to nicotine, has a bivalent effect on inflammatory bowel disease, ameliorating disease activity in ulcerative colitis and with a deleterious effect on Crohn's disease. The effect of nicotine patches in ulcerative colitis is controversial. AIM: To investigate the effect of chronic nicotine use in a rat model of colitis. METHODS: Colitis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by rectal administration of 30 mg trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) in 50% ethanol. Nicotine was dissolved in drinking water (2.5, 12.5, 25 and 250 microg/ml), with rats drinking ad libitum. Nicotine administration started 10 days prior to damage induction and had no effect on weight gain or daily food intake of rats. Rats were sacrificed 1 and 5 days after TNBS administration, their colons resected, rinsed, weighed, damage assessed macroscopically (mm2) and microscopically and tissue processed for myeloperoxidase (MPO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) generation and interleukin-1 (IL-1) serum levels. RESULTS: Nicotine, by itself, caused no damage to the colon. Nicotine had a dose-dependent bivalent effect on colitis, significantly reducing macroscopic damage from 983 +/- 10 mm2 on TNBS alone to 429 +/- 118 mm2 on TNBS plus 12.5 microg/ml of nicotine, and escalating to 1086 +/- 262 mm2 on 250 microg/ml of nicotine. Segmental weight declined significantly (from 2.4 +/- 0.2 to 1.65 +/- 0.20 g/10 cm), on 12.5 microg/ml nicotine, as did MPO activity (from 3.2 +/- 0.4 to 0.7 +/- 0.1 units/g). All these parameters returned to the levels of TNBS alone when the dose of nicotine was increased to 250 microg/ml. Nicotine had no effect on NOS activity, PGE2 generation and serum IL-1 levels, but increased LTB4 generation. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine has a dose-dependent bivalent effect on TNBS-induced colitis which is not due to reduction in IL-1 serum levels or PGE2 generation, and is not NOS-mediated.},

Subjects participated in breath tests before and after six months of a high polyunsaturated to saturated (P/S) fat ratio diet to measure their response to [1-13C] 10:0 and [1-13C] 16:0 ingested with a test meal. Whole body absorption-oxidation of C10:0 was not affected by the diet treatment. Before diet treatment, whole body absorption-oxidation of C16:0 in Crohn's patients was 80% of that observed for control subjects. After consuming a high polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio diet, subjects increased oxidation of C16:0 by 85% compared to before the diet treatment period. It is concluded that (1) absorption of labelled C16:0 from a test meal is reduced in Crohn's patients, and (2) consumption of a high polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio diet improves the utilization of dietary C16:0 by Crohn's patients.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the dietary practices of the pediatric inflammatory bowel disease population at the Children's Hospital of the Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation and the reported effectiveness of those diets. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire mailed to 153 pediatric patients was returned by 125 patients (76 Crohn's disease [CD] and 49 ulcerative colitis [UC] patients)--an 82% response rate. RESULTS: The median age of respondents was 13 years, and 62% were male. Ninety per cent and 71% of CD and UC patients, respectively, had changed their diets since diagnosis. Caloric supplements (eg, BOOST [Mead Johnson Nutritionals]), sole source nutrition, low fibre and lactose-free diets were used by more than 15% of CD patients, whereas lactose-free, nonspicy, low acid, additive-free, caloric supplement and low fibre diets were used by more than 15% of UC patients. A diet supplement was more commonly used in CD patients (P < 0.05) and an additive-free diet in UC patients. Corn and corn products, nuts, milk and bran were avoided by more than 20% of CD and UC patients; however, more CD than UC patients avoided corn and corn products. In addition, UC patients (more than 20%) also avoided tomato, other dairy (nonfluid milk-based products and foods containing milk products), chocolate, cheese, wheat, tomato sauces and fruit juice. A benefit was reported for 103 of 141 reported diets, with the most commonly alleviated symptoms being abdominal pain, diarrhea and flatulence. CONCLUSION: Many children with inflammatory bowel disease have altered their diets to manage their disease and have attributed symptomatic relief to these diets.},

Features initially suggested Guillain-Barre syndrome, but botulinum toxin was identified in serum and stool specimens from week 1 and type A toxin-producing Clostridium botulinum in stool specimens from weeks 3 to 19, confirming botulism due to intestinal colonization. In week 19, the inflamed small bowel was resected, and C. botulinum disappeared from the stool. In week 31, the patient was able to breath without assistance. Testing for an active immune response with neutralizing antibodies to C. botulinum at week 19 was positive; these antibodies remained at a protective level for >1 year. Intestinal colonization botulism, rare in adults, should be considered for patients with descending paralysis, especially those with a preceding alteration in small bowel function. An active immune response to botulinum toxin with production of protective antibodies has not been demonstrated previously in a patient with botulism and may have contributed to this patient's recovery.},

No specific dietary toxin or antigen has been identified to have an etiologic role in either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. A possible modulating effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on intestinal inflammation is being investigated. Most prevalent among the nutritional consequences of inflammatory bowel disease is weight loss, for which inadequate caloric intake is primarily responsible. Impairment of linear growth and associated delay in pubertal development commonly complicate childhood Crohn's disease. The two major etiologic factors are chronic undernutrition and direct effects of inflammatory mediators secreted from the inflamed gut. Recent studies have incriminated interleukin-6. Treatment of intestinal inflammation and provision of adequate nutrition are of paramount importance in preventing or remedying growth impairment.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neurologic disorder characterized by a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and mental confusion. WE is attributable to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Beriberi is the systemic counterpart of thiamine deficiency and often manifests in cardiovascular collapse. WE is usually associated with alcoholism and malnutrition. It has also been seen in people with gastrointestinal diseases with malabsorption. Patients who have received total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without proper replacement of thiamine have also developed WE. Since November 1996, there has been a shortage of multivitamin infusion (MVI). Many patients who were on chronic TPN with MVI ceased to receive the MVI and were converted to an oral form of the multivitamin. As a result, there have been several reports of children and adults on TPN who have developed WE as a result of thiamine deficiency. With this case report, we bring to attention the association of the MVI shortage and WE. Early diagnosis of WE is important, because if it is treated with thiamine in the acute stages, the neurologic and cardiovascular abnormalities can be reversed. CASE REPORT: We report a 20-year-old female patient with Crohn's disease who developed WE as a result of thiamine deficiency. She had Crohn's disease since age 9 years and was on chronic TPN. Two months before admission, MVI was discontinued in the TPN because of the shortage of its supply. An oral multivitamin tablet was substituted instead. She was admitted to the hospital for persistent vomiting. In the hospital, she continued to receive TPN without MVI, but continued taking an oral multivitamin preparation. Two weeks after admission, she developed signs of WE including diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, and memory disturbance. She also developed hypotension that was thought to be caused by beriberi. She was treated with 50 mg of intravenous thiamine. Within hours of the intravenous thiamine, her hypotension resolved. The day after the infusion, she no longer complained of diplopia, and her ophthalmoplegia had improved dramatically. Magnetic resonance imaging showed several areas of abnormally high signal on T2-weighted images in the brainstem, thalamus, and mamillary bodies. The topographic distribution of these changes was typical of WE. After 2 months, her mental status and neurologic status had recovered completely. CONCLUSION: WE and thiamine deficiency should be considered in all patients with malabsorption, malnutrition, and malignancies. WE from thiamine deficiency can occur as a result of cessation of MVI in the TPN infusion. Even if an oral multivitamin preparation is given instead of MVI, patients with malabsorption may not absorb thiamine adequately. Prompt diagnosis of WE is important because it is potentially fatal and readily treatable with thiamine supplementation. Early recognition of WE may be more difficult in children, because the classic triad of symptoms may not develop fully. Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in these cases to confirm the diagnosis of WE. Because the shortage of MVI is expected to be a long-term, there are likely to be more cases of WE in the pediatric population of TPN-dependent children. Because there is no shortage of intravenous thiamine, it should be administered with TPN even if MVI is not available.},

The causes of death of the cases were duodenal obstruction of impacted food stuff, ileocaecal obstruction caused by Crohn's disease, incarceration of inguinal hernia, intestinal obstruction caused by heterotopic pancreas and paralytic ileus. In three cases, the patient was in cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival at hospital, and in the remaining cases the patient died within 12 hours from the beginning of treatment; therefore, a correct clinical diagnosis was not made before the death in all cases. All the patients had from one to three days history of nausea and abdominal pain, major complications of intestinal obstruction. Among all cases, the duration from the onset to death was the shortest in the case of a patient complicated with schizophrenia. It is characteristic that the patients of all cases died suddenly and resuscitation was not successful. Regarding the laboratory data of a hospitalized patient, marked hemoconcentration and an increased level of BUN/Cr ratio and blood sugar were shown. The patient who died from duodenal obstruction caused by impacted food-stuff had suffered from depression for six years, and the patient who died from paralytic ileus had suffered from schizophrenia for about 23 years. In both cases, it is characteristic that the complaints of the patient were poorer than what would be expected. Furthermore, these patients had been taking medication of psychotic, anti-depressant and anti-parkinsonism drugs; therefore the combination of these drugs was thought to be reflected in the bowel movement.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Indication for and an evaluation of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease differ between Japan and western countries. PURPOSE: Japanese results are reported and differences are discussed. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with an elemental diet is first-line therapy for active Crohn's disease in Japan. The remission induction rate of elemental diet therapy is approximately 80 percent, which is superior to steroids. Furthermore, elemental diet therapy induces radiographic and endoscopic remission. On the other hand, meta-analysis from randomized, controlled trials showed steroids to be more effective than enteral nutrition in western countries. The differences are considered to be the result of such differences as therapeutic duration of enteral nutrition, the composition of enteral diets used, criteria for remission, the quality of life score of a long-term fast with a nasogastric tube, medical care, and health insurance system. The main mechanism of the therapeutic effect of elemental diet is speculated to be attributable to removal of food antigens and decreases of secretion and motility (bowel rest) by very low fat. To prevent relapse and rehospitalization, home enteral nutrition is now used widely in Japan. The therapeutic effect is observed in patients with ileal involvement, and more than 1,200 kcal/day is more effective than a lower amount. CONCLUSION: Most Japanese studies were open-labeled, uncontrolled trials. We should conduct randomized, controlled trials comparing enteral nutrition with steroids during the active stage of Crohn's disease and home enteral nutrition with drugs in maintaining remission and investigate the therapeutic effect, quality of life, and costs.},

Since CD is combined with immune complex formation, we examined in the present study whether anti-IgE autoantibodies in such complexes might hinder the determination of specific IgE. METHODS: In order to elucidate the role of food-specific IgE in CD, we tested sera from CD patients (n = 107), healthy controls (n = 65) and allergics subjects (n = 7) for their IgE binding to food antigens (yeast, corn, celeriac, wheat) by an immunodot assay. After determining levels of IgE/IgG anti-IgE immune complexes, we purified them from serum pools of patients with CD, allergic subjects and healthy controls by affinity absorption using a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody. These purified immune complexes were treated by low pH (pH = 4) in order to dissolve them and to increase the detectability of food-specific IgE by RAST and CAP assay. RESULTS: In CD sera no food-specific IgE could be detected, but levels of immune complexes of IgE and IgG anti-IgE autoantibodies were statistically significantly increased compared to healthy controls. pH treatment of purified IgE/IgG anti-IgE immune complexes resulted in a significant increase in specific IgE to yeast, corn, wheat and celeriac detected by RAST, however, only in the serum sample purified from allergic subjects. After pH treatment of CD immune complexes, specific IgE levels remained still very low. CONCLUSION: Thus, even if IgE seems to represent an autoantigen in CD, it is unlike to specifically participate in the pathophysiology of the putative food adverse reactions.},

   abstract = {During the past 20 years there has been growing interest in the importance of nutritional factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. There are so far no definite links between ulcerative colitis and diet, but links with Crohn's disease have been studied by both epidemiologists and clinicians. Epidemiological studies, although retrospective, have suggested that patients with Crohn's disease eat more sugar and sweets that control individuals; however, when dietary sugar is restricted, there is little clinical benefit. The clinical approach to nutrition in Crohn's disease has been by the use of elemental diets, which will produce symptomatic and objective remission in up to 90% of compliant patients. Those who return to normal eating soon relapse but, in some studies, have enjoyed prolonged remission on exclusion diets. The foods excluded have been not sugar, but predominantly cereals, dairy products and yeast. Attention has now switched to the possible harmful role of fat in Crohn's disease. The efficacy of elemental feeds appears to depend not on the presentation of nitrogen but on the amount of long chain triglyceride present. Increases in recent years in the frequency of Crohn's disease in Japan have been correlated with increased dietary fat intake, and a recent study suggested that W-3 fatty acids, which are metabolized by immunomodulatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, may have a beneficial role to play. The links between nutrition and Crohn's disease have now become strong and the role of fat may be the most exciting of all.},

This article reviews much of the research that has evaluated the role of diet in the causation, primary treatment, and adjunctive therapy of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Benefits have been demonstrated in the use of elemental diets or polymeric diets in CD in both acute flare up or maintenance of IBD. A careful team approach can overcome problems in implementing nutritional therapy. Nutrition also has a critical benefit in postoperative CD and perioperative UC. Numerous easily corrected, nutritional abnormalities are often overlooked in patients with IBD, which may have significant consequences. Nutritional therapy may have a central place in the hierarchy of treatment in IBD and further research is critical in this area to better define the benefits of nutrition in IBD.},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is a very common situation in patients inflammatory with intestinal disease (IID), which can be caused by a multitude of factors. It has been shown that nutritional support not only improves the nutritional condition of the patients, but in Crohn's disease it also has an effect on the activity of the disease, although this effect is smaller than that of steroids. Elemental diets are no more efficient than polymeric diets except under very special circumstances, but they are more expensive and patients tolerate them worse. A digestive pause is not recommended unless there is an absolute contraindication for the use of the digestive tract. Therefore, parenteral nutrition, which is more expensive and can cause serious complications, will be reserved for very specific indications. The use of fish oil supplements, either because it competes with arachidonic acid and prevents the initiation of the inflammatory cascade, or because it decreases the production of cytokines, has shown to be potentially useful in inflammatory intestinal disease, and this must be confirmed by further studies. Short chain fatty acids enemas have shown promising results in distal ulcerative colitis but the lack of homogeneity in the studies makes it necessary for these results to be consolidated in new studies. Nutritional support is especially interesting in children with inflammatory intestinal disease given that the growth retardation which is often seen in severe cases, can be controlled by adequate enteral or parenteral diets.},

Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) frequencies in peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures from 22 Crohn's disease patients and an equal number of healthy controls matched for sex and age were analyzed. The mean of SCE frequency in Crohn's disease patients was 11.64 +/- 0.42 (SEM) per cell, which was significantly higher than the value of 8.38 +/- 0.22 per cell in the matched controls (p < 0.0001). The Crohn's disease patients showed significantly increased high frequency cells (HFC) as compared to those among the matched controls. There was a significant correlation between HFC frequencies of the Crohn's disease patients and the severity of their disease as determined by the number of relapses per year and the degree of chronic activity after adjusting for the smoking status (r = 0.54, p = 0.011). In both smokers and non-smokers, the mean SCE and HFC frequencies of the patients were significantly higher than those of the controls. These results suggest that Crohn's disease is a condition with increased chromosome instability characterized by a high level of SCE frequencies which are associated with the inflammatory condition itself.},

However, in adolescents with growth failure and when corticosteroid therapy is contra-indicated or has failed, it may become the treatment of choice. Furthermore, dietary therapy allows circumvention of the adverse side-effects of repeated courses of steroids. A number of different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the effect of enteral feeds but none has reached universal acceptance. Prospective trials suggest that the exclusion of whole protein is not necessary. Comparison of feeds with differing composition suggests that a low fat content increases efficacy and various explanations have been offered. The reduction of colonic bacterial load may also be important. Because symptoms of Crohn's disease may be provoked by eating, there is a risk of falsely attributing symptoms to specific foodstuffs. However, in many individuals foods can be identified which affect disease activity, and their exclusion leads to prolongation of disease remission. Dietetic supervision during food testing is important to avoid detrimental effects on nutrient and micronutrient intake.},

Nutritional state, inflammatory reactions, disease activity and clinical remission rate were assessed two weeks and four weeks after treatment, and morphological findings were assessed before and after each nutritional therapy by radiographic and colonoscopic findings. Inflammatory reactions were more effectively controlled by TPN and ED than by PD, and early improvement achieved by TPN and ED was especially note-worthy. Clinical remission rate after treatment by TPN was highest in three types of nutritional approach, but no significant difference was seen at any point. In nutritional state, disease activity and morphological findings, comparable changes were effected without preference. These results suggest that nutritional therapy by total parenteral nutrition and elemental diet is superior to polymeric diet for treating active phase of Crohn's disease with marked inflammatory reactions.},

The first relates to the bioavailability of the starch itself. The second is the potential that indigestible starch may have for producing diarrheal symptoms, malabsorption, and changes in gastrointestinal flora. The third is the possibility that modified food starches might be implicated in gastrointestinal disease like Crohn's ileocolitis. The fourth is the toxicological effect of the chemicals used to modify the starch and their possible mutagenic and carcinogenic properties.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: During total parenteral nutrition, gallbladder motility is impaired, resulting in sludge and stone formation. Little is known about gallbladder motility during prolonged enteral nutrition. METHODS: We studied gallbladder motility during continuous enteral nutrition (CEN) in nine hospitalized patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. The patients received a polymeric diet (2000 kcal/24 h) by CEN through a nasogastric tube for a prolonged period. Gallbladder volumes were obtained daily by ultrasonography, starting from day 0 (before CEN) and on 7 consecutive days during CEN. At days 0, 1, 4, and 7, the gallbladder response to i.v. cholecystokinin (CCK-33; 0.5 Ivy Dog unit/kg/h) was studied. Plasma CCK levels were determined at regular intervals by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed on day 0 between patients and a group of nine healthy control subjects in fasting gallbladder volumes (19.4 +/- 2.3 and 19.6 +/- 2.4 cm3, respectively) and gallbladder contraction during CCK infusion (56 +/- 14% and 69 +/- 7%, respectively). During CEN, from day 1 to day 7, mean gallbladder volume remained significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared with fasting gallbladder volume, and mean plasma CCK levels remained significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared with fasting levels. Although gallbladder volume was significantly reduced during CEN, the gallbladder contractile response to CCK was not affected; at days 1, 4, and 7, gallbladder contraction was 36-57%. CONCLUSIONS: During CEN, 1) gallbladder volume is significantly reduced and plasma CCK levels are significantly increased, 2) these effects are sustained over time (7 days), and 3) the gallbladder remains responsive to exogenous CCK. These results indicate that gallbladder contractility and gallbladder responsiveness to CCK are preserved during prolonged CEN in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

Recent information has shown that many of these foodborne infections also have long-term sequelae with serious health effects and a significant economic impact. To increase the awareness of animal health professionals to these sequelae, the authors discuss two groups of sequelae which are strongly associated with preceding infection (reactive arthritides, including Reiter's syndrome, and the Guillain-Barre syndrome) as well as the possible association between Crohn's disease and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. The discussion includes a description of the disease syndromes along with epidemiological and economic information. More reliable epidemiologial and economic data on chronic sequelae to foodborne disease will be needed for future evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of mitigation strategies to reduce the occurrence of foodborne pathogens.},

   abstract = {Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the nutritional deficiencies seen in Crohn disease patients, including inadequate food intake, decreased assimilation and increased loss of nutrients, and increased energy expenditure. To assess the effect of steroid therapy on body composition, energy expenditure, and fuel selection in Crohn disease, we compared 12 patients (6 men and 6 women) with biopsy-proven ileal Crohn disease with 11 healthy volunteers (6 men and 5 women). Five patients [Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) = 98.4 +/- 3.78] took no medication and seven patients (CDAI = 283.9 +/- 22.5) were administered 29 +/- 18 mg prednisone/d. Body composition was evaluated by isotopic dilution and bioelectrical impedance analysis, and 24-h energy expenditure and basal metabolic rate were measured in a respiratory chamber. Fat-free mass was not significantly different among groups, whereas fat mass was lower in patients than in control subjects. Energy intake was higher in treated patients than in both untreated patients (P = 0.004) and control subjects (P = 0.005). Fecal losses were not significantly different between untreated patients and control subjects, but were higher (and proportional to the CDAI) in treated patients than in control subjects (P = 0.001). Metabolizable energy was not significantly different among groups, whereas energy balance was significantly higher in treated patients than in both control subjects (P = 0.0057) and untreated patients (P = 0.018). Nitrogen balance was mildly negative in treated patients compared with both control subjects and untreated patients, but not significantly so. In conclusion, prednisone treatment in Crohn disease patients stimulates food intake, promoting an overall positive energy balance despite large fecal nutrient losses.},

   abstract = {Gut-associated lymphoid tissue is the major inductive site of the mucosal immune system, which is functionally independent of the systemic immune system. Both the amount and type of dietary fat modulate intestinal immune function. Absorption of long-chain fatty acids stimulates lymphocyte flux and lymphocyte blastogenesis in intestinal lymphatics. Long-chain fatty acid absorption also significantly enhances migration of T lymphocytes to Peyer's patches, possibly due to up-regulation of adhesion molecules, such as alpha4-integrin and L-selectin. Lipoproteins are involved in stimulation of lymphocyte function by both receptor-dependent and independent mechanisms. However, unsaturated fatty acids at higher concentrations have a suppressive effect on cell-mediated immunity via eicosanoid release, receptor affinity changes or interactions with intracellular signal transduction. Fat absorption also influences various other cells in the intestinal mucosa: increased cytokine release from intestinal epithelial cells follows long-chain fatty acid absorption. In Crohn's disease, elemental diets and total parenteral nutrition often induce remission, possibly by reducing antigenic load on activated immune cells in the intestine and, thus, down-regulating hyperreactive CD4 cells. Dietary oleic acid supplements caused an immunological reversal effect in the intestinal immune system of animals fed an elemental diet. An excess of long-chain fatty acids in an elemental diet, therefore, may negate its beneficial effect on gut-associated lymphoid tissues in Crohn's disease. In contrast, supplemental dietary fish oil apparently tends to prevent relapse of Crohn's disease. Because dietary fat intake is closely associated with immunological function of the intestinal mucosa, careful manipulation of dietary fat can be important in management of this disease.},

   abstract = {Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk for developing colon cancer compared to the general population. The risk is related to the extension of the disease and its duration. This risk is the same for Crohn's colitis patients of equal extension and duration. By chemoprevention we mean the use of specific natural or synthetic chemical agents to reverse, suppress or prevent progression to invasive cancer. The chemopreventive agents for colon cancer are either of natural origin (vitamins, minerals, food constituents) or synthetic chemicals (difluoromethyl ornithine) and pharmaceutical agents (aspirin, oltipraz). Apart from folate, no other agent has so far been used in vivo for the prevention of colon cancer in long-standing inflammatory bowel disease. The use of folate was, however, not primarily intended to prevent cancer but to enhance folate absorption in ulcerative colitis. From retrospective studies, within the framework of cancer surveillance programmes, it became evident that folate supplementation may play a positive role as a chemopreventive agent against colorectal cancer in patients with long-standing, extensive ulcerative colitis. There is also evidence suggesting that folate supplementation may contribute to regulation of rectal cell proliferation in ulcerative colitis patients. There is a real need for multicentre, randomized, prospective clinical studies in order to evaluate the promising role of folate in preventing colorectal cancer in patients with long-standing inflammatory bowel disease.},

There appears to be no difference between elemental diet, oligopeptide diet and intact nutrients in effectiveness for active Crohn's disease. Although corticosteroid is also useful for treating active Crohn's disease, low dose of it is not effective for maintaining remission. Steroid has important role in combined therapy with elemental diet. New steroid, budesonide appears to be fascinate because of less adverse effects. Recently, instead of salazosulfapyridine, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) proved to be more effective not only for active disease but also for maintenance of remission including small intestinal type of Crohn's disease with reduced adverse effects. Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate and metronidazole are second choice treatment in patients whose disease relapse frequently. Although methotrexate appears to be effective for active Crohn's disease, the role of it has to be defined. Evidences support the use of 5-ASA and methotrexate for prophylaxis after surgery. It is important to chose and combine the therapies, thinking of the situation of each patient.},

M paratuberculosis is shed in the milk and may be able to survive pasteurisation. Therefore, people may be exposed to it by the consumption of pasteurised milk. The risk of such exposure has been analysed using a modelling approach and the model has been used to evaluate the effects of intervention measures at different points in the potential route of transmission. On the basis of data from the literature and expert opinion, an initial point estimate of the exposure level of about 0-5 cfu/litre pasteurised milk was derived, mainly due to milk from clinically affected animals. The model indicates the need for quantitative data on variations in the shedding rates of M paratuberculosis in faeces and milk, and the levels of faecal contamination of milk. Such data are essential for a proper analysis of potential exposure, and may result in a 100-fold increase in the estimated median level of exposure.},

   abstract = {Nutritional support currently accounts for about 1% of the total health care costs in the USA. Interestingly, most of the prospective randomized controlled trials to date have not been able to demonstrate that this therapeutic intervention alters morbidity or mortality. In fact, parenteral nutritional support may predispose the recipients to developing systemic infections. There have been a few areas in which nutritional support may be of benefit. Enteral supplements given to underweight women who suffer hip fractures reduce the hospital stay and, presumably, overall cost. Preoperative parenteral nutritional support may produce a small absolute reduction in post-operative morbidity, but its cost becomes prohibitive. Preoperative enteral nutritional support, especially if carried out in the home, may be of benefit (using the most optimistic interpretation of a small number of trials); if so, it is an economically defensible intervention. Particular nutrients or diets may have specific effects on certain disease processes. Indirect comparisons have suggested that elemental diets can be used to treat flares of Crohn's disease (perhaps because putative food antigens are removed). However, corticosteroid therapy is more efficacious. Furthermore, it is less expensive to employ 6-mercaptopurine as the next modality in steroid failures. Branched-chain amino acid infusions may have some effect on hepatic encephalopathy, but again, lactulose is less expensive. Nutritional support is one area of medicine in which there has been far more enthusiasm than the data justify. Disease-associated malnutrition probably is a secondary phenomenon, not an important cause of morbidity. The widespread use of this modality cannot be justified in a cost-constrained health care system.},

However, the expression of the disease in man is very heterogeneous, it varies with the age of the subject and is to a certain extent genetically determined. For example, food allergy is frequent in childhood and not common in adulthood. The intestinal mucosa in the child with cows milk allergy shows a 'flat' mucosa, which may be indistinguishable of that observed in gluten sensitive entero-pathy or coeliac disease. Subjects with other forms of food allergy may have a morphologically normal small intestinal mucosa, occasionally with increased IgE plasma cells and often only characterised by an increased intestinal permeability. An abnormal intestinal permeability is one of the hallmarks of an inflamed gut, however, subjects with a latent form of coeliac disease have an abnormal permeability only without overt signs of inflammation. Recently, it has become clear that what determines the characteristics of the intestinal inflammatory response is dependent on the cytokines involved during the response and this seems to be the same in the stomach, the small intestine and the colon. A so-called Th1 response, with an increased production of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, occurs in the stomach when infected by Helicobacter pylori, in the small intestine when the subject with coeliac disease consumes normal bread and during the active phases of Crohn's disease. A Th2 response is characteristic of the allergic subject and there is some evidence that it is the predominant response in subjects with ulcerative colitis. We still do not know the fine-tuning of the cytokine response but IL-12 appears to be a key cytokine in polarising the response to a Thl type. More recently it has become clear that the intestinal mucosa has a unique subset of CD4(+) T cells that secrete TGF-ss (Th3 cells) that provide help for IgA. These cells have downregulatory properties for Th1 cells and therefore play an important role in the active suppression of oral tolerance and IgE response.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records from 392 out-patients, 279 with Crohn's disease (160 female, 119 male) and 113 with ulcerative colitis (56 female, 57 male) were analyzed. RESULTS: Deficiencies were found in 85% of patients with Crohn's disease vs 68% with ulcerative colitis during the course of the disease, predominantly a deficiency of iron and of calcium. Less frequently deficiencies of zinc, protein, cyanocobalamin, and folic acid were found. Elevated liver enzymes were seen in 38% of patients with Crohn's disease vs 27% with ulcerative colitis. In order of frequency: gamma-glutamyl-transferase, ALAT, AP, ASAT, and bilirubin. Gallstones were present in 12% of patients with Crohn's disease and 4% with ulcerative colitis. 6% of patients with Crohn's disease and 4% with ulcerative colitis had kidney stones. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the high frequency of deficiencies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease it seems to be important to check frequently for extraintestinal complications.},

The exact cause of low bone mineral density in Crohn's disease patients has not been determined. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of low bone mineral density in premenopausal women with Crohn's disease and to determine the role diet plays in bone mineral density for this population. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (L2-L4), proximal femur, and forearm was measured in 51 female controls and 50 females with Crohn's disease using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar DPXPlus, Madison, WI). Dietary intake for all Crohn's disease participants was analyzed using both 3-d dietary records and a food frequency questionnaire. When compared to healthy controls, bone mineral density values of Crohn's disease participants were decreased for all sites, particularly the spine (1.169 +/- 0.114, p = 0.054), Ward's area (0.831 +/- 0.128, p = 0.052), and the femoral neck (0.927 +/- 0.100, p = 0.01). Factors associated with lower bone density in Crohn's participants were weight, corticosteroid usage, length and age of diagnosis, history and length of resection, and dietary intakes of magnesium, copper, magnesium, vitamin K, and zinc. The results of this study indicate for the first time that diet plays a role in the development of low bone density in premenopausal women with Crohn's disease.},

AIM: To investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in comparison with matched population and clinic controls. METHODS: Quantified dietary histories were obtained from 87 patients with recent IBD (54 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 33 Crohn's disease (CD)) and 144 controls. Odds ratios (OR) for IBD were derived for intake levels of various foods. RESULTS: A high sucrose consumption was associated with an increased risk for IBD (OR 2.85 (p = 0.03) against population controls and 5.3 (p = 0.00) against clinic controls). Lactose consumption showed no effect while fructose intake was negatively associated with risk for IBD (NS). Similar trends were noted in UC and CD. A high fat intake was associated with an increased risk for UC; this was particularly marked for animal fat (OR 4.09, p = 0.02) and cholesterol (OR 4.57, p = 0.02). A high intake of fluids (p = 0.04), magnesium (p = 0.04), vitamin C, and fruits (NS) was negatively associated with the risk for IBD, while a positive association was found for retinol (p = 0.01). Most of the findings were similar in UC and CD except for potassium and vegetable consumption which showed a negative association only with risk for CD. CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between pre-illness diet and subsequent development of UC and CD. The effect of dietary components may be primary or modulatory.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this Review was to locate, appraise and summarise evidence from scientific studies on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in order to answer specific research questions on the effectiveness of this technology. The following questions were asked. What patients have received HPN? What has been the experience of patients on HPN programmes? How have HPN programmes been organised, and what techniques and equipment have been used, and to what effect? What comparative information is available on effectiveness? What evidence exists for the cost-effectiveness of HPN? What questions about the provision of HPN could be answered with additional research, and what studies would be most suitable? DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive list of studies was provided by an extensive search of electronic databases (including MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Uncover, Cinahl, Caredata, Food Science and Technology Abstracts, NTIS, Pascal, Psychlit, and Economic Literature Index), relevant journals (including Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, Clinical Nutrition, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Nutrition, Clinical Gastroenterology, Nutrition Reviews, Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism, Nutrition and Cancer, Nutrition and Health, and Journal of Paediatric Nutrition and Metabolism), and scanning of reference lists, as well as other search strategies outlined in the protocol. STUDY SELECTION: Studies relevant to the questions were selected. The inclusion criteria were fairly broad because of the quality of the studies located. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction forms were used to collect data from studies included in the review. The data was checked by a second researcher to reduce error. DATA SYNTHESIS: Quantitative analysis was difficult owing to the type of studies located. The data is discussed in a qualitative manner. Where complication rates have been given, we have attempted to combine the results in a quantitative manner. RESULTS: The age and sex of patients on HPN varies according to the underlying disease but, on the whole, patients are young (see Tables 4a and 4b). There are trends showing an increased use of the technology at the extremes of the age range. There are marked differences between countries on the underlying diseases for which HPN is indicated. For example, many more patients with an underlying malignancy are treated in Italy and the USA than in the UK (40-67% versus 8%). Morbidity rates for the majority of patients are acceptable (see Table 8), the complications tend to be related to the central venous catheter. It is fairly clear that a minority of patients are susceptible to recurrent problems and that many patients have very few complications. The mortality rate for HPN patients (see Table 10) was good for those patients with benign underlying disease (for example, 5% of Crohn's HPN patients die per year), and there are very few reports of patients dying from complications of the technology. The survival of those with malignant disease and AIDS is poor, almost all having died from the underlying disease at one year; despite this, most programme growth worldwide is due to an increase in the numbers of patients with these diagnoses (see Table 5). Quality of life is reasonable for patients with benign disease (see Table 9); no studies were found that examined the quality of life of HPN patients with malignant disease. Economic analysis shows that the cost of HPN treatment is cheaper than the alternative of in-patient care (see Table 18). There is a paucity of comparative studies examining different aspects of the technology, and this accounted for the majority of gaps in the evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The use of HPN for benign intestinal failure is supported by evidence from the scientific studies located. There are, however, large gaps in the evidence, particularly relating to the use of HPN in malignant disease and AIDS. A programme of research is suggested at the end of this review.},

To evaluate published evidence on the use of dietary manipulation of sugars in the treatment of Crohn's disease. DESIGN: All publications from refereed journals which reported intakes of sugars and sugar-containing foods in the context of Crohn's disease onset or treatment were selected. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggesting a relationship between sugars and onset of Crohn's disease was inconsistent and subject to important methodological limitations. There was a clear lack of distinction between reporting of current, as opposed to, retrospective intakes. There appeared to be no clinical advantage to the use of reduced sugar diets in Crohn's disease treatment.},

   abstract = {1. An earlier study by our group revealed that the viscosity of faeces from patients with Crohn's disease is significantly lower than that of healthy subjects. This is due to low concentrations of a high-molecular-mass carbohydrate, probably of bacterial origin. The cause of this phenomenon might be the impaired barrier function of the gut mucosa. Low viscosity may allow close contact of intestinal contents (bacterial products and toxins) with the intestinal wall. This could play a role in the maintenance of the disease.2. The first aim of this study was to investigate the high-molecular-mass carbohydrate fraction, responsible for viscosity, in detail. We also tried (in a pilot study) to raise the intestinal viscosity of patients with Crohn's disease with the undegradable food additive hydroxypropylcellulose (E463), in an attempt to alleviate clinical symptoms.3. The high-molecular-mass fraction (>300 kDa) responsible for faecal viscosity was sensitive to lysozyme and contained high levels of muramic acid. It was concluded that this material consisted mainly of peptidoglycan polysaccharides and was consequently of bacterial origin. The muramic acid in material from patients with Crohn's disease was 7.5 (1.5-13.9)%, which was less than in healthy subjects [11.4 (8.5-24.1)%; P=0.0004]. Furthermore, viscosity in material from patients with Crohn's disease was found to be half [14.9 (1.0-33.6) cP] of that found in healthy subjects [35.0 (2.7-90.7) cP; P=0.004].4.A daily dose of 1 g of hydroxypropylcellulose caused an increase in faecal viscosity in patients with Crohn's disease (from 1.4 to 2.3 cP) and in healthy subjects (from 4.9 to 7.5 cP). Faecal consistency improved in patients with Crohn's disease (from watery and loose to formed) and the defecation frequency decreased from 3-4 to about 2 times a day. No changes in defecation patterns were found in healthy subjects.5. These data indicate that the high-molecular-mass fraction that is responsible for faecal viscosity is peptidoglycan. Furthermore, a daily dose of a hydroxypropylcellulose solution to increase the viscosity of the intestinal contents of patients with Crohn's disease might be beneficial. This approach merits further study.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) since the Second World War coincides with profound changes of the dietary pattern. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible pathogenic role of some characteristic 'modern life' dietary factors in IBD. DESIGN: Case-control, studying risk factors in recently diagnosed cases, 290 with Crohn's disease and 398 with ulcerative colitis, compared with 616 population controls. Smoking, age, gender and education were taken into account by using logistic regression analysis. SETTING: Hospital cases and population controls. INTERVENTIONS: Questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression-derived odds ratios. RESULTS: A positive association with cola drinks [OR: 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-3.1)], chewing gum [OR: 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1-2.1)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95% CI: 1.8-3.5)] and a negative association with citrus fruit consumption [OR: 0.5 (95% CI 0.3-0.7)] and the development of Crohn's disease were found. Consumption of cola drinks [OR: 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.3)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95% CI 1.8-3.5)] were positively associated with developing ulcerative colitis. There was a negative association between the intake of citrus fruits [OR: 0.5 (95% CI 0.4-0.8)] and 'having a stuffed pet' for a period longer than 5 years [OR: 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.9)] and developing the disorder. No association with the frequency of tooth brushing and developing IBD was found. CONCLUSION: All the nutritional items mentioned may be true risk factors or they just might be the expression of a modern life-style also involving other risk factors for the development of IBD which at the present are still unknown.},

This measurement is more comprehensive as it measures the release of serum tryptase from both the tissue mastocytes (MCTC) as well as the mucosal mastocytes (MCM). Technically the measurements are comparable with those made by the method of radio-immunology (RIA), are absolutely reproducible and surprisingly at 100%. It has also been possible to evaluate the two techniques of FEIA and RIA on negative and positive pools. This new FEIA technique for serum tryptase is applicable: to anaphylactic and/or anaphylactoid accidents at the time of induction of anesthesia, in general conditions such as haemorrhagic recto colitis (RCH), Crohn's disease, and mastocytosis. Finally these measurements can be used during nasal and bronchial provocation tests, as the measurements may be made on nasal and bronchial lavage liquids. The sensitivity and the very good reproducibility of this new technique of FEIA for tryptase is of very great interest and avoids use of radio-active isotopes.},

Four patients ages 40-65 y (mean: 53.75 +/- 10.59), three with mesenteric thrombosis, and one with Crohn's disease were studied. The average length of the remaining small bowel in these patients was 54.5 +/- 6.4 cm; the ileocecal valve was preserved in 3 cases. A progressive step diet was used for intestinal adaptation. Administration of pectin was started at the beginning of the special oral diet (step 1), followed by medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs) and complex, nonfermentable sugars (step 2); coconut oil (47% MCTs) and simple sugars (step 3); and long-chain triacylglycerols and lactose (step 4). TPN was interrupted at step 3 or 4 when the energy content of the diet reached 150% of the patient's resting energy expenditure, if serum albumin and weight were stable or increasing, and if the frequency, amount, and consistency of stools remained unchanged. Nutritional follow-up showed that patients responded well to this approach; also, patients returned to their previous professional activities. Thus, enteral formulas were not essential for gastrointestinal adaptation. Home TPN should not be indicated on the basis of strict criteria, but rather when a patient fails to adapt to a progressive, special oral diet.},

Nutritional therapy could be an interesting alternative, but corticosteroids are meant to be significantly superior according to efficacy. Published studies, identified by references, MEDLINE and meta-analysis, were evaluated for efficacy of nutritional therapy in acute Crohn's disease. In 18 evaluable of 38 identified publications, 571 patients were treated with nutritional therapy: 295 received elemental diet, 214 oligopeptide diet and 62 polymeric diet. Remission rates were 60%, 55% and 66% respectively. However, only intention-to-treat-analysis was performed in all the studies. When correcting for patients who really were treated with nutritional therapy, remission rates were substantially better: 73%, 70% and 67% respectively, thus comparable with that of corticosteroids. Positive predictors for successful treatment were stenosing disease and low ESR. Remission seems to last as long as after corticosteroid treatment, when a reinduction diet is performed. Negative aspects of nutritional therapy are poor tolerance and higher costs. Perspectives for the future aim on broadening of indications, improving acceptance (by adjuvant instead of exclusive nutrition, or new flavors) and efficacy by modification of compounds (such as glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids or trace elements) or combination with other therapeutic agents (e.g., mesalamine).},

Glutamine is an energy source for many cell types including colonocytes. PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess the potential clinical effects on colitis of changing the dietary quantity of glutamine. METHODS: Colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of 30 mg of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid with 50 percent ethanol vehicle in Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were randomly allocated into three dietary groups: Group 1, a commercial elemental diet-based diet without glutamine; Group 2, a commercial elemental diet (glutamine: 12 percent of amino acid content); Group 3, elemental diet with 24 percent glutamine. Diets were started one week before colitis induction and continued until sacrifice. Rats were killed at one, three, and five weeks after colitis induction, and colons were excised. Damage evaluation was based on the percentage of rats with ulcer, macroscopic damage score, average ulcer area, and microscopic damage score. RESULTS: Group 2 rats weighed more than Group 1 rats at three weeks because of their higher dietary intake. At one week after colitis induction, all groups had comparable damage. At three weeks, the macroscopic damage score was higher in Group 3 than in Groups 1 and 2. At five weeks, rats in Group 3 had significantly more severe damage than those in Groups 1 and 2 in terms of all four indexes. CONCLUSION: We conclude that excess glutamine has a deleterious effect on ulcers in trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis.},

   abstract = {A recurrent theme in the schema of pathogenetic mechanisms attributed to colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the interaction between genes and environment. Dietary and other environmental factors, and lower intestinal flora and their chemical interactions occur in the pathogenesis of both. Events at the mucosal surface may be influenced by factors in the luminal environment and by contributions of the host. In addition, both forms of IBD--Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)--have distinctive associated host events. Even within CD and UC, different clinical patterns and prognoses may have different specific host mechanisms. Some of the current putative pathogenetic processes in CRC and IBD are reviewed. Particular attention is given to hypotheses relating to the role of dietetic substances, mainly fibre and dairy products, and how they may affect disease formation. It is argued that within the context of hypotheses proposed for possible beneficial effects of these two dietetic factors, CRC and IBD may be considered together. Further support is lent to arguments that similar and additional hypothetical features ascribed to beneficial effects of fibre may be attributed to disaccharides, lactose and its derivatives, lactulose and lactitol.},

   abstract = {The beneficial effect of elemental diet (ED) in the treatment of Crohn's disease is reported, although the exact mechanism for this remains to be elucidated. In this study the effects of ED on intestinal inflammation were investigated in a rat model of granulomatous enteritis. Intestinal inflammation was induced by a single intramural injection of peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-PS) from group A streptococci into rat ileal Peyer's patches. A single injection of PG-PS in combination with fibrinogen, which retains PG-PS at the injection site, induced severe granulomatous inflammation associated with mucosal ulceration. Immunohistochemical study and immunocytochemical analysis of the cell suspension from Peyer's patches showed accumulation of macrophages and an increase in interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R)-positive T cells after PG-PS treatment. Chemiluminescence (ChL) activity and nitrite and nitrate (NOx) levels in the mesenteric venous blood as well as Ca(2+)-independent (inducible) nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in Peyer's patches were increased by PG-PS treatment. In rats fed with ED, both macroscopic and histologic damage scores were significantly decreased as compared with those in rats fed with the control diet. ED inhibited the increase in the numbers of macrophages and IL-2R-positive T cells in Peyer's patches. Increased ChL activity, NOx levels, and Ca(2+)-independent NOS activity were also reduced significantly by feeding with ED. These data suggest that ED reduces progression of PG-PS-induced chronic intestinal inflammation by modulating activation of T cells, production of nitric oxide, and generation of oxygen free radicals.},

   abstract = {It is currently held that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves a complex interaction of host responses, some immunologic and genetically determined, and external influences including microbial and dietary factors. Nutritional surveys and studies testing stepwise exclusion dietary compounds have suggested that dietary factors might be linked to the occurrence of IBD. Food allergy was suggested early as a possible trigger for the inflammatory response; however, no firm evidence has been gathered over the years to substantiate this possibility. The possibility that patients with Crohn's disease may have an unusual premorbid pattern of dietary intake has also been examined since the early seventies. Several groups of investigators report a high intake of refined sugars (i.e. sucrose), recycled cooking oil, a more frequent consumption of fast foods in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis respectively. However, a critical comparison of incidence and prevalence studies published from 1976 until 1994 clearly showed no pre-existing nutritional abnormality that has been identified consistently in patients who develop inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elemental diet is considered an effective primary treatment for active Crohn's disease, but it is usually given by a feeding tube. METHODS: Twenty-two patients (12 males, median age 30 years, range 18-60) with moderately active Crohn's disease were enrolled in a randomized study in which the efficacy of an elemental diet administered orally was compared to high-dose corticosteroids in achieving clinical and laboratory remission. Ten patients were treated by oral elemental diet (Peptamen, Clintec, USA) and 10 received corticosteroids. Both treatment regimens lasted 2 weeks. The two groups did not differ with respect to age, sex, body weight, location of disease, treatment or disease activity prior to the study. In all patients studied, simple Crohn's disease activity index, nutritional status (expressed as body mass index), percentage of ideal body weight, fat mass, fat free mass, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, interleukin-6, intestinal permeability (expressed as permeability index), prealbumin, retinol binding protein and multiskin test were evaluated before and after treatment. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of treatment, there were significant improvements in simple Crohn's disease activity index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, permeability index, body mass index, prealbumin, retinol binding protein and multiskin test in the elemental diet group. There were significant improvements in simple Crohn's disease activity index and fat free mass in the corticosteroid group. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in the short term, an oral elemental diet is at least as effective as steroids in inducing remission of mild-moderately active Crohn's disease, but it may be more effective in improving the nutritional status of these patients, probably through a more rapid restoration of normal intestinal permeability.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the effects of olestra, a zero-calorie fat substitute that is neither digested nor absorbed, on the well-being and disease state of persons with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (n = 43) or Crohn's disease (n = 46) in remission, with a history of disease of 2 years or longer, were enrolled in this prospective study from nine private practices, three university-based medical centers, and one Veterans Administration medical center in the United States. Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive olestra and 45 to receive triglycerides in chips or cookies daily for 4 weeks. At Week 4, patients were classified as in remission, worsened, or relapsed according to an investigator's global assessment based on sigmoidoscopy (for ulcerative colitis) or the Crohn's disease activity index, laboratory findings, and clinical course. RESULTS: At Week 4, the olestra and triglyceride groups did not differ significantly with respect to the percentages of patients who relapsed (P = 0.494; difference = 2.4%; upper 95% CL = 8.8%) or with respect to the percentages of patients who experienced any worsening of their symptoms (P = 0.630; difference = 0.2%; upper 95% CL = 13.3%). Of evaluable patients, 90% (37 of 41) given olestra remained in remission with no worsening, compared with 90% (38 of 42) given triglycerides. Gastrointestinal symptoms were comparable between the treatment groups, and there were no treatment-related laboratory abnormalities. Six patients were excluded from analysis for reasons unrelated to treatment. CONCLUSION: Olestra did not affect the activity of quiescent mild to moderate IBD.},
