   abstract = {Despite much debate over a presumptively somatic vs psychological etiology of nonatopic food and chemical sensitivities, little systematic research has addressed the issues. The present study investigated self-reported illness from several common foods (wheat, dairy, eggs) and chemicals (pesticide, car exhaust, paint, perfume, new carpet), symptom patterns, and psychological profiles of a sample of young adult college students (n = 490, age 19.4 +/- 2.4, 52% female/48% male). Subjects were divided into 4 groups on the basis of sample medians for frequency of illness from the foods (FI) and chemicals (CI); high FI with high CI (FI/CI), high FI alone, high CI alone, and NOILL (low FI and CI). FI was associated with more defensiveness (denial of negativity) while CI was linked with more shyness (avoidance of novelty). Women outnumbered men in all groups (FI/CI: 61%; FI: 80% CI: 55%) except the NOILL (40% women). Nevertheless, the FI/CI, FI, and/or CI groups still had significantly higher total symptom scores as well as more indigestion, headache, and memory trouble than did the NOILL group, even after depression, anxiety, shyness, defensiveness, and gender were covaried. The illness groups reported significantly more limitation of foods that mobilize endogenous opioids or generate exogenous opioids (sweets, fats, bread) as well as more illness from opiate drugs, small amounts of beverage alcohol, and late meals. Nasal symptoms from pollens or animals were more common in the FI/CI (42%) and CI (42%) than in FI (26%) or NOILL (28%) groups. Premenstrual tension syndrome and irritable bowel were also more common in the FI/CI group. The findings indicate that young adults outside the clinical setting who are relatively higher in FI and/or CI have distinctive symptom and psychological patterns. Covariate analyses suggest that important symptoms in FI and CI individuals such as indigestion, headache, and memory problems may occur in addition to rather than as simply part of emotional distress. The data are consistent with a previously hypothesized role of olfactory-limbic and hypothalamic pathways and with a time-dependent sensitization model for illness from foods and chemicals.},

   abstract = {This study reviews 71 patients who presented between 1968 and 1988 with recurrent, self-limited episodes of nausea and vomiting separated by symptom-free intervals and were diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). The length and symptomatology of episodes tended to be stereotyped and characteristic for each patient over time. The disorder may persist from months to decades. There is a coincident relationship between CVS, migraine, and irritable bowel syndrome. The differential diagnosis includes many diseases which may mimic CVS. Management involves a responsive, collaborative doctor-patient relationship, sensitivity to stresses caused by the illness and to feelings and attitudes that may predispose to attacks, use of antiemetic agents to abort or shorten attacks, treatment of complications, and use of prophylactic agents in patients whose episodes are of sufficient frequency and severity to warrant their trial.},

   abstract = {The prevalence of lactose maldigestion is lowest in Scandinavia and Northwest Europe (3-8%) and close to 100% in most of Southeast Asia. In Europe the frequency increases in the southern and eastern directions, reaching 70% in southern Italy and Turkey. There is also a high prevalence of lactose maldigestion in the people of Africa with the exception of cattle-raising nomads. Lactose maldigestion causes uncharacteristic abdominal symptoms such as bloating, borborygmus, colic, flatulence, and diarrhea. The degree of discomfort depends on the amount of lactose consumed, but also on an individual sensitivity to lactose. The symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and lactose maldigestion are similar. Consequently, most investigations indicate an increased frequency of lactose maldigestion in patients suffering from IBS. Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children corresponds to IBS in adults. Lactose maldigestion is a frequent cause of RAP in regions with a high prevalence of lactose maldigestion in early childhood. Diffuse small-intestinal damage in celiac disease or kwashiorkor leads to a proportional decrease of all disaccharidase activities, with the most pronounced being decrease of lactase. The consumption of milk may then cause abdominal discomfort and increased diarrhea. Several investigations have indicated an increased frequency of lactose maldigestion in patients with osteoporosis. A connection between lactose maldigestion and decreased absorption of calcium has not been proven, however. The increased tendency toward osteoporosis is more likely caused by a lower calcium intake because of milk intolerance. Milk and dairy products with reduced lactose content are better tolerated by patients with lactose maldigestion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {An isolated bowel segment (IBS) is a viable mesenteric segment of intestine. This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of mesenteric vascular and neural supply on intestinal absorption. Ten rats were used for leucine absorption and another 10 for glucose absorption experiments. L-leucine, 12 ml of 15.0 mM/L, or 3.0 mM/L of D-glucose solution were recirculated through the IBS (n = 5) and rat jejunum that underwent sham operation (n = 5) at 2.56 ml/min for 90 min. Absorption was expressed as millimoles of leucine or glucose per gram of mucosal protein. The Student's t test was used for statistical analysis; a p < or = 0.05 was considered significant. The net absorption of L-leucine was 36.20 +/- 3.31 mM/g of mucosal protein in the IBS and 15.52 +/- 1.48 mM/g of mucosal protein in the control group (p < 0.001). The net absorption of D-glucose was 3.82 +/- 0.26 mM/g of mucosal protein in the experimental group and 4.34 +/- 0.31 mM/g of mucosal protein in the control group (p = 0.02). This study concludes that absorption of leucine and glucose in the IBS is preserved after mesenteric division.},

   abstract = {The effect of granisetron, a specific 5-hydroxytryptamine 3-receptor antagonist, on the anorectal responses to rectal distension and a 1000-calorie meal was assessed in 12 patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Each patient was studied on three occasions, receiving intravenously either 40 mcg/kg granisetron, 160 mcg/kg granisetron or normal saline. Granisetron caused a dose-dependent reduction in rectal sensitivity, manifested by an increase in the threshold volumes at which the sensations of gas, desire to defecate, urgency and discomfort were perceived. This reached significance for all sensations at the higher dose level (P < 0.01). No significant changes in anal pressures, rectal compliance or distension-induced motor activity occurred following drug administration. A dose-dependent reduction in post-prandial motility was observed following intravenous granisetron and this was highly significant at 160 mcg/kg (P = 0.005). These results suggest that the 5 hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonists may have a therapeutic role in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.},

Patients received polycarbophil tablets at a dosage of 6 g/day (twelve 0.5-g tablets) or matching placebo tablets. At study end, among patients expressing a preference, 15 of 21 (71%) chose polycarbophil over placebo for relief of the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Statistically significant differences favouring polycarbophil were found among the following patient subgroups: 15 (79%) of 19 with constipation: all six with alternating diarrhoea and constipation; 13 (87%) of 15 with bloating: and 11 (92%) of 12 with two or more symptoms. Polycarbophil was rated better than placebo in monthly global responses to therapy. Patient diary entries showed statistically significant improvement for ease of passage with polycarbophil. Polycarbophil was rated better than placebo for relief of nausea, pain, and bloating. The data suggest that calcium polycarbophil can benefit irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation or alternating diarrhoea and constipation and may be particularly useful in patients with bloating as a major complaint.},

   abstract = {Disturbances of small bowel motor function are increasingly recognized in clinical practice, either in the setting of an underlying disease that may affect the neuro-hormonal control of gut motility, such as diabetes or scleroderma, or as part of unexplained intestinal dysfunctions such as the irritable bowel syndrome or chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. In the absence of endoscopic or radiological mucosal disease, it is often clinically helpful to define the motor function of the small bowel to understand the origin of the patient's symptoms. The hydrogen breath test after a lactulose oral load is currently used to measure mouth to caecum transit time. However, the reproducibility of this test is poor, and the range of normal values is wide. Scintigraphic determination of small intestinal transit time overcomes some of the limitations of the hydrogen breath test. This is however a time consuming procedure--up to 10 hrs when the time for acquisition, processing and analysis is included--and the costs prohibit widespread application of the technique. It is further restricted by the exposure to ionising radiation, particularly if repeated evaluations are necessary, for example in drugs trials. Manometry records mechanical activity of the bowel and detects quantitative and qualitative changes of small intestinal motility. As with scintigraphy, high costs and radiation exposure limit its usefulness. The major clinical application of the technique is in the diagnosis of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.},
