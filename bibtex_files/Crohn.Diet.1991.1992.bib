During the 1st month patients continued their usual diet (base-line period), but during the next 2 months dietary yeast was excluded except that during 1 month patients took baker's yeast capsules while for the other month they took placebo capsules. The patients' mean Pettit Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) while taking baker's yeast (mean, 107.9; SE, 6.1) was significantly greater than during yeast exclusion (mean, 102.1; SE, 5.7; p less than 0.05). The mean of each patient's maximum CDAI during yeast exclusion (mean, 107.1; SE, 5.7) was significantly lower than those during the base-line (mean, 115.2; SE, 6.1; p less than 0.05) and baker's yeast inclusion periods (mean, 113.9; SE, 6.7; p less than 0.05). Patients with elevated yeast antibodies tended to develop a higher CDAI while receiving baker's yeast (13 of 15). These results suggest that dietary yeast may affect the activity of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {The growth spurt of adolescence, during which body weight nearly doubles and height increases by 16%, demands an increased delivery of nutrients by the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic disorders of digestion and absorption at this age, therefore have a potentially profound effect upon growth, skeletal maturation and sexual development. Moreover, the emotional climate of adolescence, which requires affiliation with peer groups, and a distancing from authority figures such as doctors and parents, is often associated with a deterioration in drug and dietary compliance and with erratic clinic attendance. Nutritional problems in adolescent patients with Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis and coeliac disease are the most common. About one third of adolescents with Crohn's disease experience growth failure and delayed sexual development, probably as a consequence of long-term undernutrition. There is a strong argument for the care of these patients being in the hands of paediatric gastroenterologists. Enteral nutrition, often administered overnight, is successful in inducing catch-up growth, and reducing steroid dosage, although resection of diseased gut is often followed by good growth, and surgery should not be overlooked. Cystic fibrosis in adolescence is commonly complicated by protein-energy malnutrition. Pathogenesis includes anorexia, maldigestion and an increase in resting energy expenditure. Malnutrition has been treated by a number of enteral regimens. In general, there is no place for repeated, short-term interventions of less than 6 months. Long-term studies have all shown good nutritional repletion and growth, but results with respect to improved respiratory function are conflicting. More prospective control trials are needed before the precise indications for enteral nutrition in cystic fibrosis can be accurately defined. Once started it is difficult to stop, although preoperative treatment of patients awaiting heart-lung transplantation seems entirely appropriate. The major problem in the management of coeliac disease in adolescence is dietary compliance. Even those patients who claim to have good dietary compliance often have jejunal biopsy evidence of gluten ingestion and tend to be underweight. This is particularly worrying, as after 5 years adherence to a gluten free diet, the increased risk of gastrointestinal malignancy appears to return to normal.},

   abstract = {Growth failure is frequently associated with Crohn's disease. However, it does not seem to be fully accounted for by overt endocrinological abnormalities or nutrient deficiencies. It may be related to an abnormal utilization of available substrates, particularly proteins, due to an imbalance in protein metabolism kinetics. Its primary mechanism may be an increase in protein breakdown rates over synthesis, specifically related to the associated inflammatory syndrome, and progressively leading to a protein debt. Reduction in food intake would only exaggerate this trend by further reducing the synthesis to breakdown ratio, whereas nutrient supplementation merely compensates for the deficit by promoting protein synthesis.},

Sequential balance studies were performed to assess stool and urinary output, stool fat, and urinary electrolytes initially during intravenous rehydration and subsequently during administration of the necessary fluids and nutrients exclusively by oral supplementation. The additional effects of high-fat and low-fat diet, loperamide hydrochloride, and octreotide acetate were evaluated. When the patient sipped a hypo-osmolar oral rehydration solution while she was awake during the day and received a high dose of loperamide and a 40-g fat, disaccharide-free diet, salt and water homeostasis was maintained. The addition of octreotide did not substantially enhance fluid balance; rather, it increased fecal fat and fluid losses from the small bowel. Thus, hypo-osmolar polymeric glucose solutions maintain fluid homeostasis in patients with the short-gut syndrome. In such patients, simple balance studies are useful for assessing the absorptive capacity of the residual intestine, for developing an optimal individualized treatment, and for eliminating the need for costly, long-term home parenteral nutrition.},

Two groups were comparable for age, sex, religion, place of birth, number of years spent in Britain and vegetarian status. There were no significant differences in actual oils used between healthy controls and patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease (chi 2 = 0.142 and 1.803 respectively, p greater than 0.50). However patients with Crohn's disease were found to recycle their cooking oil significantly more often than age and sex-matched colitics (p less than 0.05) and particularly age and sex-matched controls (p less than 0.01). A similar study needs to be conducted in India where the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease is low. If this difference is confirmed a programme of health education in cooking habits could lower the incidence of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease encompasses both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, two conditions so alike clinically that they are frequently indistinguishable from one another. Inflammatory bowel disease occurs at a rate of approximately five per 100,000 people. It tends to cluster in families and is seen four to five times more often in Jewish Caucasians than in other Caucasians. The etiology is unknown. Increasing attention is being paid to autoimmune factors, genetic factors and food allergies, and the notion that inflammatory bowel disease has its roots in a psychological disorder continues to pale for want of empirically sound evidence. Disease pattern is one of remission and exacerbation. The aim of therapy is to maintain an optimal lifestyle in remission through an individually tailored protocol of medications. Sulfasalazine remains the medication of choice; corticosteroids have short-term utility in exacerbation; and immunosuppressants, though controversial, are thought to have some steroid-sparing benefits during acute flare-ups. Indications for surgery vary, depending on whether or not a clear differential diagnosis has been made between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. There is no cure for inflammatory bowel disease except for total colectomy in clearly diagnosed ulcerative colitis. Current research endeavors seek a cause or causes for inflammatory bowel disease, but the literature does not solidly support any one possibility above other rival etiologies.},

   abstract = {Intrinsic factor is produced by the gastric parietal cell. Its secretion is stimulated via all pathways known to stimulate gastric acid secretion: histamine, gastrin, and acetylcholine. There is, however, a different mode of secretion for both substances: atropine, vagotomy, and H2 receptor antagonists inhibit both intrinsic factor and acid secretion, but secretin and the hydrogen-potassium ATPase antagonist omeprazole have no effect on intrinsic factor while substantially reducing acid secretion. Cobalamin in food is bound to animal protein. Cobalamin deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake is rarely seen in extreme vegetarians (vegans). In the stomach cobalamin is liberated from its protein binding by peptic digestion and bound to R-proteins. Hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria, whether medically induced or not, may impair cobalamin uptake. The cobalamin-R-protein complex is split by pancreatic enzymes in the duodenum, where cobalamin is bound to intrinsic factor. Pancreatic insufficiency may lead to cobalamin deficiency. Lack of intrinsic factor is the commonest cause of cobalamin deficiency; very rarely, aberrant forms of intrinsic factor are produced, but the clinical syndrome is similar. Gram-negative anaerobe bacteria bind the cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex, and bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine diminishes cobalamin resorption. Parasitic infections with fish tape-worm and Giardia lamblia are also associated with cobalamin malabsorption. The cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex binds to the ileal receptors in the terminal ileum. Cobalamin absorption may be impaired after resection or by diseases affecting more than 50 cm of the terminal ileum, such as Crohn's disease, coeliac disease, tuberculosis, lymphoma or radiation. There is clearly a wide diversity in the aetiology of cobalamin deficiency, which requires a versatile diagnostic approach.},

Twenty-seven patients with established Crohn's disease who attained clinical remission after four weeks of enteral feeding were followed prospectively for up to 36 months. Twenty of these were willing to be tested for specific food intolerance using a pre-defined dietary elimination protocol; the others continued on a normal unrestricted diet. Eighteen patients (67%) have since relapsed; 89% of the relapse occurred within the first 6 months. Of the 15 patients with colonic involvement, 12 (80%) relapsed by 6 months. In contrast only 3 of 11 with isolated small bowel disease experienced early relapse. Of the 14 patients who completed the process of dietary testing, 5 could not identify any trigger foods; the remaining 9 were maintained on exclusion diets, 3 of whom relapsed early. Of the 11 taking a normal diet, 9 relapsed. Disease duration, previous intestinal resection or prior steroid therapy did not affect the relapse rate. Eight patients (31%) obtained a long-term remission, mean 23 months (range 12-36 months), without any medication. Long-lasting remissions can be obtained in about one-third of patients with Crohn's disease following treatment with a defined formula diet. Colonic involvement is associated with a high early relapse rate.},

Plasma zinc remained stable when volunteers fasted all day, but self-selected meals and 600 kCal of dextrose or fat emulsion caused significantly reduced plasma zinc concentrations [mean (SD) 12.1 (1.4), 12.3 (0.6) and 12.2 (0.7) mumol/L at 1400 h, respectively, compared with a fasting level of 13.9 (1.6) mumol/L at 0800 h, P less than 0.05].

These data show that both enteral and i.v. feeding cause a decline in plasma zinc and that glucose alone is not responsible for this post-prandial fall since ingestion of isocaloric amounts of glucose or fat have a similar effect.},

   abstract = {Malnutrition is a frequent occurrence in patients with acute inflammatory bowel disease. Total nutritional support provided either parentally (TPN) or enterally (TEN) has been advocated not only as an adjunct for improving nutrition but also as primary therapy. For patients with acute Crohn's disease, short-term rates of remission after TEN are equivalent to TPN. Coupled with certain advantages when compared with TPN, including simpler administration, fewer side effects, and preservation of the intestinal mucosal barrier, TEN may therefore be the preferred route for nutrient delivery. Controlled trials indicate equivalent or superior efficacy when enteral polymeric diets are compared with elemental diets for inducing remission in acute Crohn's disease. Moreover, when provided as an elemental diet, TEN is as effective as corticosteroids for achieving remission in acute Crohn's disease, but corticosteroids appear to be more effective than polymeric diets. Although the provision of nutritional support rather than bowel rest is the major factor contributing to symptomatic improvement, the optimal nutrient composition and the precise mechanisms whereby nutritional support achieves clinical remission remain to be clarified. In contrast to Crohn's disease, nutritional support is not effective for achieving remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. Thus, enteral nutritional support is an effective therapy for the short-term management of acute Crohn's disease. Whether long-term remission is equivalent to treatment with drugs or surgery requires prospective evaluation. Future avenues of investigation also include defining the optimal nutrient composition and the underlying mechanisms that achieve maximal nutritional repletion, promote mucosal cell renewal, and potentially directly retard production of inflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {The incorporation of the fatty acids in fish and olive oil into the colonic mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease was examined during 12 weeks' dietary supplementation with the oils, and the influence on colonic mucosal prostaglandin and thromboxane generation was measured. With a dietary supplement of 18 g fish oil daily, concentrations of the major polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, were significantly raised in mucosal lipids. The first time these were measured, after three weeks' supplementation, the mean increases in eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid were seven fold and 1.5 fold respectively, and these increases were maintained during the 12 week study. Arachidonic acid values fell throughout the study and this reduction was significant at 12 weeks. Mucosal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane B2, and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha synthesis were suppressed, and this reached significance (p less than 0.05) at three and 12 weeks for PGE2 and at 12 weeks for thromboxane B2. The predominant fatty acid in olive oil is oleic acid. Supplementation with 18 g/day resulted in a significant increase in oleic acid in colonic mucosa at 12 weeks (p less than 0.05) and a fall in stearic acid and docosahexaenoic acid; there was no significant change in eicosanoid synthesis. It is concluded that colonic lipids and prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis can be readily altered by dietary supplementation with fish oil. The extent of incorporation of the fatty acids present in oils is dependent upon the individual fatty acid.},

In case of early recurrence of inflammation during dose reduction or chronic steroid-dependent disease activity a combination of glucocorticoids with Azathioprine will be successful in about 75% of patients. In addition a combination of glucocorticoids with tube feeding (elemental or polymeric diet) will lead to remission of inflammatory activity in about 60 to 70% of these patients.

   abstract = {Surgical treatment for Crohn's disease of the small bowel or ileocecal region consists of resection. Surgery is not for cure but rather to relieve symptoms. In this respect resectional surgery has proved to be superior to present day medical management. The main arguments against resectional surgery are that it causes a fair amount of operative morbidity and mortality. However, these hazards can be reduced by recommending surgery at an earlier stage of the disease before the onset of complications. Furthermore it should be followed by a high incidence of recurrence of the disease, amounting to about 50% by 10 years. However, recurrences can be excised with no increased likelihood of further recurrence, and by a combination of resection and reresection as required, most patients can be afforded prolonged periods of symptomatic relief; limited resections are recommended with removal of macroscopically diseased bowel. And last that intestinal absorption is grossly impaired, especially after major or repeated resections of the small bowel. However, ileal resection causes a characteristic malabsorption pattern, qualitatively and quantitatively related to the extent of resection. The consequences such as diarrhea and possible hematological and nutritional disturbances and a predisposition to the formation of biliary and urinary calculi can be successfully prevented and/or managed by medical support and dietary restrictions. Even a loss of up to 50% of the entire small intestine is often compatible with a reasonably good state of general health, particularly if most of the colon has been preserved. Fortunately, such extensive intestinal losses are rare, even after 2 or 3 resections.},

However, celiac disease is primarily a small intestinal mucosal disorder, and so we have examined the possibility that secreted, mucosal IgA anti-gliadin antibody might provide a more relevant measure of gluten sensitivity than that obtained from serum tests. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody and serum, salivary, and small intestinal aspirate IgA anti-gliadin antibody were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum IgA and IgG anti-gliadin antibody were markedly increased in untreated celiacs (N = 31) as compared to normals (N = 20) or disease controls (N = 39) (P less than 0.0001). Levels were lower in treated (N = 30) than untreated celiacs (P less than 0.001). In intestinal aspirates both untreated and treated patients had similar levels of IgA anti-gliadin antibody (P = 0.48), but both were significantly higher than in controls (P less than 0.01). Salivary IgA anti-gliadin antibody, by contrast, was not increased in celiac patients as compared to controls. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody was the most sensitive (84%) and specific (95%) test for detecting untreated celiac disease. It was also the most useful in patient follow-up where it provides an early objective indicator of adherence to a gluten-free diet. Mucosal IgA responses to gliadin in celiac disease appear to be compartmentalized, with different portions of the gastrointestinal tract functioning as separate immunological organs. Our results also demonstrate that serum and secretory IgA production are under independent control.},

This is the reason why the authors assessed in 98 patients with Crohn's disease the bone mineralization, using the method of clavicular bone index (NIBA). Then treatment was started: a high protein diet, calcium forte, Ossin (sodium fluoride), vitamin D forte, anabolics and regular physical exercise. Check-up examinations after one year revealed that the index was restored in the majority of patients (60.84%) to normal. The above treatment is thus effective. It must be, however, regular and of a long-term character, in some patients it must extend over many years. We had, however, also patients who although subjected to an extensive resection of the gut and treated for prolonged periods with corticoids, had permanently an index between 100 and 120% without treatment.},

Deviation of gut contents away from the inflamed area, bowel rest, or the use of liquid diets appears to benefit Crohn's disease. The relative effects of complete bowel rest, or an elemental, hydrolysed, or polymeric liquid diet have not yet been established. Measures to alter the lumenal bacterial flora, including antibiotics, require further study. The use of corticosteroid drugs can be improved by the use of poorly absorbed or rapidly metabolized compounds. Amino-salicylates are effective in ulcerative colitis but require further study in Crohn's disease. Immunosuppressive drugs are valuable not only for a steroid sparing effect but also for control of chronic inflammation. New treatments designed to reduce inflammation are promising but will need to have high potency and an effect at the earliest stages of inflammation before a large number of different inflammatory mediators are released.},

The twins were made up of five pairs concordant and nine pairs discordant for Crohn's disease, and two pairs concordant and 10 pairs discordant for ulcerative colitis. Two patients with Crohn's disease had a slight increase in disease activity, the others were in clinical remission. Two striking observations were made: first, individuals with ulcerative colitis were indistinguishable from healthy twins, and controls except for the response to gliadin. Both healthy and diseased twins had higher IgA levels to gliadin than controls. Second, twins who had developed Crohn's disease displayed higher antibody titres towards yeast cell wall mannan in particular, but also to whole yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) of all antibody types (IgA, IgG, and IgM). In contrast, the response to gliadin, ovalbumin, and betalactoglobulin did not differ from healthy twins and was even lower than in the controls. The results argue against an increased systemic antigen presentation caused by an impaired mucosal barrier in the inflammatory bowel disease. Rather, they suggest that yeast cell wall material--that is, mannan, or some antigen rich in mannose and cross reacting with mannan, may play an aetiological role in Crohn's disease, but not in ulcerative colitis. The increases in IgA and IgM, as well as IgG suggest that local and systemic immune systems are selectively activated by antigen(s) present in the cell wall of baker's yeast.},

To evaluate these issues, we studied 27 patients in a randomized prospective trial. Ten patients received only prednisone (group I), nine received only a defined formula diet (Vital HN [high nitrogen]) (group II), and eight received a combination of prednisone and Vital HN (group III). At the time of entry into the study, the groups were similar with respect to age, sex, Crohn's Disease Activity Index, previous and current treatments, anatomic site of disease, and nutritional status. After 1 month of treatment, we noted seven successes (70%) and three failures in group I (prednisone only), three successes (33%) and six failures in group II (Vital HN only), and six successes (75%) and two failures in group III (combination therapy). Four patients randomized to receive only Vital HN were unable or unwilling to tolerate the defined formula diet. Of the five patients who were able to take the defined formula diet for 1 month, however, three (60%) were successfully treated. The patients who received prednisone (groups I and III) responded better than did the patients who received only the defined formula diet. These results may be attributable to the use of a nonelemental diet or the treatment of patients who were not experiencing an initial attack of Crohn's disease or who had previously received corticosteroids. The expensive and often poorly tolerated defined formula diets should not be considered as a substitute for standard therapy with corticosteroids in Crohn's disease.},

Patients with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index greater than 200) were randomized to receive either enteral nutrition with a liquid oligopeptide diet (n = 55) or a combination of 6-methylprednisolone, 48 mg daily, subsequently tapered, and sulfasalazine, 3 g daily (n = 52). The two groups were not different with respect to age, sex, body weight, location of disease, or treatment before the study. The severity of disease was similar at the beginning of the study in both groups [Crohn's Disease Activity Index (mean +/- SEM), 323 +/- 12 vs. 316 +/- 11]. Remission was defined as a decrease of the initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index by 40% or at least 100 points. Twenty-nine patients in the diet group and 41 patients in the drug group reached remission within 6 weeks of therapy (chi 2 test, P less than 0.01). The median elapsed time to remission was 30.7 days in the diet group compared with 8.2 days in the drug group (Mantel Cox, P less than 0.01). To determine whether one of these treatments was more beneficial for a subgroup of patients, the effectiveness of both treatments was analyzed separately in patients with very severe disease (initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index greater than 300) and less severe disease (initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index less than 300), and in patients with different disease location. However, no influence of initial disease activity or disease location on the effect of either treatment could be shown. These data show that enteral nutrition is less effective than a combination of 6-methylprednisolone and sulfasalazine in treating active Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Intestinal permeability is increased in several disorders such as Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis. Since aging leads to alteration of many biological functions, the effect of aging on intestinal permeability was studied by measuring the intestinal permeability in aging rats gavaged with different size permeability probes--mannitol, polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400, and inulin. In rats fed with control diet, there was a significant increase in intestinal permeability to medium size probes PEG 400 (14.8 +/- 0.4 and 21.0 +/- 1.1% at 3 and 28 months respectively, p less than .01) and mannitol (3.41 +/- 0.4 and 5.3 +/- 0.5% at 3 and 28 months, respectively, p less than .01). Intestinal permeability of the large macromolecule inulin did not change (0.42 +/- 0.03 and 0.38 +/- 0.02% at 3 and 28 months, respectively) with aging. There was no correlation between weight of the rats and their intestinal permeability. Because dietary caloric restriction has been found to prolong the life span, retard deterioration of several biological functions, and affect intestinal absorptive functions, we examined the effect of lifelong calorie restriction on intestinal permeability changes. Lifelong calorie-restricted diet did not affect age-related change in intestinal permeability. We conclude that intestinal permeability of medium size probes increases with aging and that lifelong caloric restriction does not prevent this change. We speculate that age-associated deterioration in intestinal barrier functions could permit increased systemic absorption of lumenal antigens and could perhaps contribute to the genesis of antigen-related age-associated diseases.},

An aetiologic agent has not yet been defined and the diagnosis is based, therefore, on the sum of clinical, paraclinical, radiologic, endoscopic and histopathologic features. In recent years pathogenetic studies have focused on immune mechanisms, transmissible infectious agents, the potential role of the normal intestinal flora, dietary factors, enzymatic alterations and genetic features, in addition to vascular, neuromotor, allergic and psychologic factors. The prevalence of IBD is increased in first-degree relatives of patients and there is a high rate of disease concordance among monozygotic twins. Thus abnormal genes may encode for one or several immunoregulatory factors, while bacterial wall products seem to activate colonic inflammatory cells in a non-specific way, leading to increased production of cytokines, complement-derived peptides, eicosanoids, platelet activating factor, biogenic amines, kinins, chemotactic oligopeptides, and neuropeptides. The named soluble inflammatory mediators, in addition to free oxygen radicals, are considered responsible for the secondary amplification of the inflammatory process. The corner stones in medical therapy of IBD are still corticosteroids and sulphasalazine (SAZ).

This is in part due to reduced terminal ileal bile salt absorption and consequent increased cholesterol saturation in bile. The aim of this study was to evaluate gallbladder contractility, a second important factor in the pathogenesis of gallstones, in Crohn's disease. 2. Thirty patients with Crohn's disease and no known biliary tract disease and nine healthy control subjects were studied. After an overnight fast, gallbladder volume was determined by real-time ultrasonography before and 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min after ingestion of a standard liquid fatty meal. 3. Compared with healthy control subjects, patients with Crohn's disease had similar fasting gallbladder volumes (control, 18.7 +/- 2.3 ml; Crohn's disease, 18.2 +/- 2.3 ml). Percentage emptying was significantly impaired at 30, 40 and 50 min in patients with Crohn's disease compared with control subjects. Patients with Crohn's disease limited to the small bowel had gallbladder contractility that was comparable with that of control subjects, whereas in those with large-bowel disease, minimum residual gallbladder volume was significantly smaller than in control subjects. Patients with both large- and small-bowel Crohn's disease demonstrated the most marked abnormalities, with gallbladder volumes significantly larger than those of control subjects at 30, 40 and 50 min. Likewise, patients with Crohn's disease who had undergone previous bowel resection had impaired emptying at 30, 40 and 50 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {The clinical appearance of Crohn's disease (CD) is especially marked by nutritional deficits and insufficiencies. For a long time the goal of nutritional care was reduced to the readjustment of the nutritional status. The development and clinical use of controlled parenteral nutrition (TPN) and enteral nutritive solutions (EN) did not only emphasize this therapeutical issue, but furthermore showed positive effects on the conservative as well as on the surgical treatment concepts. Therefore today artificial nutritional support is a firm part of therapy in acute, active phases or in the contact of surgical management of CD. This is especially valid in children, where complications in general and growth failure in particular can be reduced. EN is the preferred feeding method in most of the cases, due to a lower complication rate and reduced cost when compared to TPN. The question regarding the importance of nutritional support as primary therapy has also been investigated. The results differ extensively, but point towards the conclusion that patients with solitary small bowel disease do profit from this therapeutical concept. Nevertheless it is unclear, how TPN or EN interfere in the pathophysiology or -biochemistry in this process. A question about reduction e.g. of allergic components of daily diet did stimulate new theories regarding the hypothesis of a possible causal relationship between diet and the pathogenesis of CD. Investigations on dietary habits and daily dietary therapy did not reveal an overall accepted dietary guideline. Nevertheless it seems obvious that dietary counselling has a positive effect on the disease process. It does appear, that today in the acute, active phase as well as in the long term management of Crohn's disease nutritional-care is an important therapeutical method.},

   abstract = {Regarding the unknown pathogenesis of Crohn's disease repeatedly the importance of diet has been accentuated. Epidemiological, biochemical and animal experimental results have focused on a possible relationship between the consumption of chemically processed, partial hydrogenated fats and the development of regional enteritis. In this context an experimental animal model in pigs was designed to analyze, whether transmission electron microscopic alterations of ileal mucosa could be induced by forage of chemically processed fats. By creation of a retroperistaltic ileal segment the contact time between chyme and intestinal mucosa was prolonged. Our underlying question was to what extent disorders of the intestinal barrier function could be compared to Crohn's disease. Present study concentrates on the epithelial-cell-layer. It was shown that in comparison to the control animals the lamina epithelialis mucosae of all animals after fat-feeding was characterized by: sublethal lesion of the enterocytes/crypt-epithelial cells (shortening and alteration of the microvilli, degeneration of mitochondria, formation of autophagocytic vacuoles); goblet cell hyperplasia and increased production of mucus; focal appearance of intraepithelial lymphocytes as well as presence of polymorphonuclear granulocytes in the epithelium; widening of the intercellular-space locally up to total loss of the functional structure of the epithelial-cell-layer. In total the picture can be evaluated as an inflammatory process of the ileal mucosa. It can be concluded, that chemically processed fats as used in the described experimental conditions could induce this process. The feature of mucosal damage shows obvious similarities to ultrastructural findings in Crohn's disease if compared.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease plays an important role in children's pathology. There is an increase in its incidence last decades. The etiology of Crohn's disease isn't yet known. The aim of therapy is to induce remission of the symptoms and disease's activity. Drug treatment as well as surgical procedures according to the side-effects and short-lasting effect have not shown to be satisfactory so far. Very important feature of Crohn's disease is growth retardation as well as puberty delay what is even emphasized by corticosteroid therapy which these children are quite long on. Recent research has shown that an elemental diet is as effective as corticosteroid therapy in inducing remission. Its positive effect on growth has been especially emphasized. It is not still certain how the elemental diet acts. It is supposed that its useful effects are achieved by its complete absorption without the need for extra digestion, by bowel rest, hypoallergenicity, changing in intestinal microflora, by caloric intake and reducing protein exudation by a direct influence on the mucosa of the small intestine. Because of all previously mentioned the elemental diet is recommended as a treatment of choice, especially for the nonstenositing features of Crohn's disease of the small intestine.},

After 4 wk of dietary treatment, 10 patients were in remission and off all medication. Seven continued to be well without treatment for a minimum of 6 months, and four for at least 1 yr. No patient who subsequently relapsed had further steroid-refractory symptoms. Of the six patients failing to respond to elemental diet, four with steroid-refractory disease required early resective surgery for symptom relief, and two continued with steroid therapy, one in much reduced dosage. Elemental diet can bring about a sustained remission in many patients with Crohn's disease dependent on or refractory to corticosteroids, and reduce the need for surgical intervention.},

We obtained retrospective information about food intake 5 years previously by a postal questionnaire for 152 cases with Crohn's disease, 145 cases with ulcerative colitis, and 305 controls. The relative risk of Crohn's disease was increased for subjects who had a high (55 gm or more per day) intake of sucrose (relative risk = 2.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.4-5.0) and was decreased for subjects who had a high (15 gm or more per day) intake of fiber (relative risk = 0.5, 95% confidence interval = 0.3-0.9). The most striking finding was an increased relative risk of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis associated with consumption of fast foods: the relative risk associated with consumption of fast foods at least two times a week was estimated at 3.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.3-9.3) for Crohn's disease and 3.9 (95% confidence interval = 1.4-10.6) for ulcerative colitis. Although coffee seemed to provide a protective effect for both diseases, there are reasons to consider this finding an artifact.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease involves a great risk of malnutrition. Malabsorption, bacterial contamination, frequent abdominal surgery, meal-related pain, protein loss through the damaged mucosa contribute to creating nutritional problems. Malnutrition can worsen the outcome, both in medical and surgical patients, and deteriorate an often already altered immune response. Weight loss, low levels of blood protein, electrolytes, micronutrients and vitamins are usually related to the extension of the mucosal damage. Nutritional assessment can be difficult due to oedema and bleeding, who interfere with both clinical and laboratory evaluation. The exact amount of nitrogen, lipids, minerals stool loss can be useful. It is widely accepted the use of nutritional support in Crohn's disease, but many Authors do not agree concerning the route (enteral or parenteral) and the kind of nutrient to be used. Still controversial is the role of nutrition: just support or real therapy? Most recent hypothesis concerning the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease indicate food and/or bacterial antigens as involved in determining the pathology. The "bowel rest", considered for many years as a fasting period necessarily supported by parenteral nutrition, can also be obtained by the temporarily reduction or stop in presenting those antigens to the bowel mucosa. This new concept can be achieved not only by parenteral nutrition, but with an enteral elemental diet as well. The elemental diet contains all nutrients in the simplest way and thus succeeds in lowering or eliminating the antigenic power. The reported results seem to indicate an equivalence of enteral and parenteral nutrition; anyway enteral is advisable when feasible, being more physiological and less expensive and involving a lower risk of serious complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Three patients, two women and one man (32, 70, and 45 years old, respectively) had vertebral crush fractures. Bone mineral density measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at spine and femoral level was more than 2 SD below normal values in 23% of the patients, all of them having received steroid therapy. Eighteen patients (29%) had never received steroid therapy; their bone mineral density was not different than those who had. Univariate analysis showed a positive correlation between bone mineral density and body weight or oral calcium intakes, and a negative correlation with steroid daily dose. After ileoanal anastomosis, bone mineral density was not different from other groups and showed a positive correlation with time elapsed since coloproctectomy. We concluded that bone mineral density is low in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and exposes them to the risk of bone fracture. Bone mineral density after ileoanal anastomosis may increase with time after surgery.},

Previous studies have shown malnutrition to be the most likely cause of the decrease in height and weight velocities in these children. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an intermittent defined formula diet on growth and disease activity in children with Crohn's disease and growth failure. Six Tanner stage I-II patients, mean age 13.6 years with height less than the 5th percentile or height velocity less than the 3rd percentile were enrolled in a 1-year prospective study. An isotonic, hydrolyzed whey, medium-chain triglyceride formula was given by nocturnal nasogastric infusion at a caloric equivalent of 50th percentile for age, as the exclusive nutrient source 1 out of 4 months during a 1-year period. A 2-week exclusion diet and a 2-week low-residue diet followed the defined formula diet before resuming the regular diet for 2 months. Patients served as their individual control based on observations of at least 1 year before the study. Height and weight velocity significantly increased. Prednisone intake significantly decreased, and significant improvement was seen in disease activity, albumin, and somatomedin C. The results indicate that an intermittent defined formula diet can improve growth failure and significantly decrease disease activity in children with Crohn's disease.},

The initial energy intake (EI) of 10 MJ/day was increased to 21 MJ/day by three stepwise increments ( approximately 4MJ) in the glucose content of the feed. REE increased from 4.2 to 6.8 kJ/min, and body weight from 53 to 76kg. REE rose by a progressively greater amount with each increment in energy intake (DeltaREE DeltaEl = 0.12 to 0.26 ). The RQ increased progressively to a value up to 1.19 and persisted above 1.0 even 9h after the feed was stopped. The results suggest that the increase in REE a) was due to a combination of increasing lean body mass and increasing diet-induced thermogenesis, b) dissipated only a small proportion of the total energy infused, and c) was associated with net lipid synthesis from carbohydrate whilst on and off the feed. The results are discussed in relation to the energy equivalent of ATP and the circulating concentrations of insulin and the flux of substrates across forearm tissue.},

Twenty-four hour energy expenditure and its components, i.e. 'basal metabolic rate', activity energy expenditure and diet-induced thermogenesis were measured, using continuous whole-body indirect calorimetry, in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition while in remission from Crohn's disease (weight 51.9 +/- 9.9 kg, body mass index 19.2 +/- 2.0 kg/m2). 2. Total parenteral nutrition was infused continuously over 24 h in four subjects and cyclically, between 22.00 and 10.00 hours, in eight subjects. Twenty-four hour energy expenditure (6.83 +/- 1.10 MJ/24 h) was lower than total energy intake (10.09 +/- 1.63 MJ/24 h), resulting in a positive energy balance (3.26 +/- 1.42 MJ) in all subjects. Repeated measurements of resting energy expenditure in the continuously fed subjects (5.82 +/- 1.11 MJ/24 h) did not change significantly at different times of day (coefficient of variation 2.2-6.6%). In contrast, in cyclically fed subjects, resting energy expenditure was 24.2 +/- 9.0% higher towards the end of the 12 h feeding period than the 'basal metabolic rate', which was measured just before the start of the feeding period. 3. Diet-induced thermogenesis, calculated as the increment in resting energy expenditure above 'basal metabolic rate' over the 24 h period (adjusted for the reduction in energy expenditure during sleep), was found to be 0.60 +/- 0.29 MJ or 6.1 +/- 3.1% of the energy intake. 4. The energy cost of activity (activity energy expenditure) in the continuously fed patients, calculated as the difference between 24 h energy expenditure and the integrated 24 h measurements of resting energy expenditure, was 0.88 +/- 0.53 MJ, i.e. 12.9 +/- 5.9% of the 24 h energy expenditure. 5. The non-protein non-glycerol respiratory quotient exceeded 1.0 for varying periods of time (0.5-17 h) in 11 subjects, indicating net lipogenesis from carbohydrate. 6. The results demonstrate favourable rates of deposition, during intravenous feeding, of both energy and nitrogen over a 24 h period in patients recovering from an episode of Crohn's disease. The efficacy of these commonly used total parenteral nutrition regimens in these patients is related to three features that are absent in normal healthy individuals, namely a low basal metabolic rate, a low activity-related energy expenditure and prolonged periods of lipogenesis from carbohydrate.},

   abstract = {A controlled trial was performed to compare enteral feeding with either an amino acid based feed or a whole protein feed as sole treatment for active Crohn's disease. Twenty four patients were studied (nine with ileal, 11 with ileocolonic, and four with colonic disease). Both feeds proved effective; nine of 13 patients randomised to receive the amino acid based feed were in clinical remission within three weeks as defined by a simple activity index compared with eight of 11 treated with the whole protein feed. Patients in clinical remission were then crossed over onto the other feed. None of the six patients who were changed to the whole protein feed relapsed over the subsequent three week period compared with three of seven patients who were changed to the amino acid based feed. In responders the median serum C reactive protein concentration fell from 21 mg/l (range 9-82) on entry to 6 mg/l (range 3-19) at six weeks. Seven patients relapsed within eight months of starting solid food (mean 3.7 months), while nine were still in remission (follow up period 3-9 months, median six months). Detailed studies of staged reintroduction of food and permitted food additives were carried out over a four year period in a patient with extensive stricturing small bowel Crohn's disease who had been brought into remission by open treatment with enteral feeding. Carrageenan, other permitted emulsifiers, bread, meat, potatoes, oranges, refined sugar, dairy produce, flour, and rice were all reintroduced without any objective ill effect, but green vegetables provoked a clinical and biochemical relapse within one week of introduction. Remission was rapidly achieved by switching back to the enteral feed but reintroduction of the low residue diet that had been previously tolerated produced a brisk relapse. Clinical and biochemical remission was again achieved by a return to the enteral feed but relapse again occurred with reintroduction of the low residue diet. These studies confirm the therapeutic effect of enteral feeding in Crohn's disease. This effect does not seem to be due to avoidance of whole protein, but the very low residue of chemically defined enteral feeds may be important, particularly in patients with intestinal strictures.},

In long-term treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine may be employed to reduce the corticosteroid requirement. There ist no known generally applicable diet for the treatment or prophylaxis of these conditions.},

   abstract = {To determine whether an elemental diet or a polymeric defined formula diet would be more effective for treating active Crohn's disease, we conducted a prospective randomised clinical trial in 30 patients with active Crohn's disease unresponsive to steroids and/or complicated by malnutrition. They received a four to six week enteral nutrition course with either an elemental diet or a polymeric diet. Clinical remission occurred in 10 of the 15 patients on elemental diet compared with 11 of the 15 patients assigned to polymeric diet. Both groups showed similar improvements in nutritional status, biological inflammation, alpha 1 antitrypsin clearance, and colonoscopic lesions (diminished in 17 out of 24 patients). Most patients relapsed during the year after discharge. We conclude that enteral nutrition, whatever the diet, is an efficient primary therapy for active Crohn's disease but does not influence the long term outcome.},

There was evidence that some patients suffering from Crohn's Disease, together with some having coeliac disease and ulcerative colitis, did have varying amounts of aflatoxins in their serum and urine. The presence of aflatoxins may have been due to exposure to food containing these toxins or inability of the patient to excrete aflatoxins on account of some gastro-intestinal derangement.

Lactose restriction, low-fat diets and low-residue diets may be of value in specifically indicated clinical situations. A fibre-rich, unrefined carbohydrate diet has not been shown to alter the course of the disease, and the value of 'exclusion diets' remains to be confirmed in controlled, prospective studies. Nutritional insufficiency of varying degrees is common in Crohn's disease and can be corrected by the efficient use of enteral diets (usually with polymeric preparations) or intravenous nutritional support. Growth retardation in adolescents with Crohn's disease can usually be improved by enteral nutrition. Nutritional support of various kinds may be of value in the management of local complications of Crohn's disease; sub-acute obstruction, anal, perianal and rectal lesions, fistulas and ileostomy complications, and the management of bile acid-induced diarrhoea. The use of nutrition as 'primary therapy; in Crohn's disease is considered. Theoretical reasons why nutritional support and bowel rest may possibly induce remission of the disease are discussed. The evidence to date suggests that intravenous nutrition and bowel rest may not be effective in inducing a primary remission of the disease, and the possible value of elemental diets and polymeric diets in this respect are assessed. Further prospective controlled studies of elemental diets as primary therapy in Crohn's disease are required.},

   abstract = {To investigate whether Crohn's disease has two different clinical forms, a relatively aggressive perforating type and a more indolent nonperforating type, we compared the concentrations of lipocortin and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the inflamed mucosa of 12 patients with strictly controlled Crohn's disease with those found in histologically normal mucosa of control subjects. The inflamed mucosa obtained from eight patients with nonperforating Crohn's disease did not react with antilipocortin antibody on immune blot analysis. In contrast, the inflamed mucosa from four patients with perforating Crohn's disease, as well as that obtained from histologically normal controls, contained lipocortins. In addition, higher concentrations of intramucosal ileal and colonic PGE2 were found in patients with nonperforating Crohn's disease (902 +/- 454 pg/wet weight [WW] mg and 1,268 +/- 567 pg/WW mg, respectively) compared with normal controls (90.2 +/- 43.1 pg/WW mg and 173 +/- 76.5 pg/WW mg, respectively) (p less than 0.01). The difference in intramucosal ileal and colonic PGE2 levels between patients with perforating Crohn's disease (109.6 +/- 16.7 pg/WW mg and 252 +/- 34.4 pg/WW mg, respectively) and normal controls was not significant. These findings indicate that there may be two distinct patterns of Crohn's disease that differ in the amount of lipocortin present in the intestinal mucosa.},

The average weight and the size of the new-born after manifestation did not differ from those before the beginning of the disease. Low birth weight were observed after the medication of prednisolone and a manifestation of the ulcerous colitis during the gravidity. The ability for conception is not restricted when this disease is existing. An infertility rate being above the norm of the total population is to be found in Crohn's disease. There is no correlation to the localisation of the changes. It can be consented to a pregnancy in lacking Crohn's disease or in a mild activity of this disease. When there are moderately severe and severe attacks before the realization of the wish of having a child a dietetic, medicamentous or surgical therapy is to be recommended. The treatment with low-dosed azulfidine and corticosteroid has no influence on the development of the child. A prophylactic therapy is indicated in ulcerative colitis, an interruption is rarely to be proved. In an acute attack during the pregnancy, when the accurate diagnosis is imperative the fully effective dose in therapy is to be aspired to.},

Accurate evaluation of the patient's nutritional status and appropriate nutritional support, whether enteral or parenteral, constitute integral parts of the management of the growing child with IBD. Over the past two decades, a number of studies have supported the potential use of nutritional therapy to induce remission and to control disease activity in symptomatic Crohn's disease. More recently, preliminary studies on the use of dietary supplements of marine-oil-derived omega-3 fatty acids have also indicated a beneficial effect in IBD patients. In parallel with these clinical trials, scientific research has recently focused on the concept that specific dietary alterations can modulate the immune response. Components of the diet that may have particular relevance to mucosal immunity and the pathogenesis of IBD include polyunsaturated fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acids such as glutamine and arginine. Future research in the interactions between specific nutrients and the immune system will likely increase our understanding of the causes of IBD, as well as enhance the development of novel nutritional therapies for IBD patients.},

   abstract = {It is clear that the nutritional state of patients with inflammatory bowel disease is often impaired and can be improved by the provision of nutritional support. Improvement in nutritional status can be achieved as effectively with enteral as with parenteral nutrition. Nutritional support appears to have no primary therapeutic effect in patients with ulcerative colitis. With regard to nutritional support in Crohn's disease, parenteral nutrition should be restricted to use as supportive rather than primary therapy. Available information now seems to suggest that most of the benefits of parenteral nutrition in Crohn's disease are related to an improvement in nutritional state rather than as primary therapy, and its use should be restricted to the treatment of specific complications of Crohn's disease, such as intestinal obstruction related to stricture formation or short bowel syndrome following repeated resection. Although some doubt exists over the efficacy of oligopeptide-containing elemental and polymeric enteral diets, the present evidence indicates that chemically defined free amino acid-containing elemental diets have primary therapeutic efficacy in the management of acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. As such, these diets are worthy of therapeutic trial in patients with severe Crohn's disease involving the distal colon and rectum, particularly in those patients who are malnourished and who prove to be resistant to treatment with a combination of topical corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid-containing compounds. Clinicians should be aware, though, that the beneficial effects are likely to be restricted to the short term, with high relapse rates by 1 year, this being particularly so in patients with distal Crohn's proctocolitis (Teahon et al, 1988). Volatile fatty acid enemas clearly have potential in the management of patients with severe steroid-resistant proctitis. Finally, one of the most important observations made in recent years is the one concerning the large losses of nitrogen that will occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with corticosteroids in the absence of adequate protein intake (O'Keefe et al, 1989). Hopefully the days of treating patients with severe inflammatory bowel disease with high dose corticosteroids and a peripheral dextrose or dextrose-saline drip have passed into history.},

Thirty-four patients with active Crohn's disease completed a 4-week treatment course with an elemental diet. Active disease was characterized by increased intestinal permeability [24-hour urine excretion of orally administered 51Cr-EDTA, 6.4% +/- 0.6% (mean +/- SE); normal, less than 3.0%] and by high fecal excretion of 111In-labeled leukocytes (14.2% +/- 1.1%; normal, less than 1.0%). Twenty-seven (80%) went into clinical remission, usually within a week of starting treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, there was a significant decrease in both the urine excretion of 51Cr-EDTA (to 3.4% +/- 0.5%; P less than 0.01) and the fecal excretion of 111In (to 5.7% +/- 1.0%; P less than 0.001), indicating that such treatment is not just symptomatic. A framework for the mechanism by which elemental diet works, centering around the importance of the integrity of the intestinal barrier function, is proposed, and also appears to provide a logical explanation for some relapses of the disease.},

This model is dependent on an "in vivo culture" of normal intestinal contents. In the present experimental study we examined the effect of a polymeric and a hydrolyzed formula diet on the formation of ulcerating lesions using our rat model. Two groups of rats (twenty in each group) were fed either one of these formula diets eight weeks prior to the experimental procedure and this diet was continued until sacrifice eight weeks later. Twenty control rats also underwent the experimental procedure but were fed standard rat pellets for the same time periods. At sacrifice 60% of the control rats had developed ileal ulcers. None of the rats fed the formula diets developed macroscopic ileal inflammation or ulceration. The effectiveness of formula diets in inducing remission in Crohn's disease in humans may be linked to alterations in the intestinal microflora. We hypothesize that the formula diets in this experiment exerted a protective effect against ileal ulceration by altering the ileal microflora. Preliminary studies support this hypothesis but need to be expanded.},
