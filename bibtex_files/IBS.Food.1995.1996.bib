As there has been no effective treatment up to now, sufferers turn to various doctors and try all sorts of medicines over extended periods that last for years. Thus irritable bowel syndrome has become a serious socio-economic problem that affects the family and the workplace. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 40 consecutive irritable bowel syndrome patients (mean age: 31.4 +/- 1.8, range 17-52 year; females). Pinaverium bromide (50 mg) or placebo was taken orally t.i.d with food. RESULTS: Pinaverium bromide diminished pain duration from several hours to a few minutes (P Text:nav2]Conclusions. Pinaverium bromide is safe, and produce a significant benefit in the quality of the patients life, hence may be a valuable drug for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome patients.},

   abstract = {In recent years, many health claims have been made about dietary and supplemental fiber. However, some reports (eg, those regarding oat bran) have been controversial. A review of scientifically rigorous studies shows that fiber has some preventive or therapeutic benefits in irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulosis, colorectal cancer, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. However, it appears to have no direct benefit in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, gallstones, or obesity. The United States has one of the lowest per capita intakes of fiber in the world. Therefore, increasing daily fiber intake either through diet or with supplements is recommended for most Americans. Consumer interest groups should lobby for more fiber-enriched foods. The challenge for education and healthcare professionals alike is to remold the nation's interest in and understanding of dietary fiber.},

   abstract = {Despite the progress made in understanding the mechanisms of allergic disease, the pathophysiology and clinical significance of intestinal allergic reactions is largely unclear. The intestinal mucosa is pre-destined for allergic reactions against food proteins and other antigens, and a number of studies indicate that allergic reactions occur in the GI tract. However, only a few epidemiological data are available, and the mechanisms are poorly understood. Intestinal allergic reactions may be different to classical IgE-mediated reactions because patients with intestinal allergy often have negative skin tests and low levels of serum IgE. There is increasing evidence that, as with the findings in the skin and lung, mast cells and eosinophils play a central role in mediating intestinal allergic reactions. Furthermore, both types of cell are found to be activated in a number of other GI inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease and eosinophilic gastroenteritis. However, the relationship between these pathologies and intestinal allergy is largely unclear. A major clinical problem is the lack of appropriate means for confirming the diagnosis of intestinal allergy. However, new test systems have been developed--such as the measurement of eosinophil mediators in stool samples or endoscopic provocation tests performed locally at the intestinal mucosa, which may improve the possibility of identifying afflicted patients on an objective basis. Since symptoms of intestinal allergic reactions are variable and non-specific, the diagnosis requires the use of multiple tests and the exclusion of other pathologies such as infectious disease or non-immunological intolerance reactions. The preferred therapeutic option is avoidance of the allergens of relevance; however, this approach can be realized only in some patients, whereas others require additional treatment, for example, with oral cromoglycate or corticosteroids. Although we do not yet know to what extent intestinal allergic reactions may be an aetiological factor in GI diseases, such reactions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unclear intestinal inflammation and irritable bowel syndrome.},

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of adverse reactions to food in patients with gastrointestinal disease. A total of 375 adult patients of a gastroenterologic outpatient clinic were examined by history, skin tests, measurements of laboratory parameters, and intestinal provocation with food allergens by colonoscopy. Some 32% complained of adverse reactions to food as a cause of their abdominal symptoms. In 14.4%, the diagnosis of intestinal food allergy could be suspected according to several criteria such as elevated total IgE, specific IgE against food antigens, eosinophilia, responsiveness to cromoglycate, and clinical signs of atopic disease. In 3.2%, the diagnosis could be confirmed by endoscopic allergen provocation and/or elimination diet and rechallenge. In conclusion, the data suggest that allergic reactions to food antigens may be a causative factor in a subgroup of patients with inflammatory and functional gastrointestinal disease.},

Patients were divided according to clinical symptoms and age: Toddler's diarrhoea (TD) under 3 years of age and recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) over 3 years of age characteristics in children with TD and RAP were compared with those found in 114 subjects suffering from various gastrointestinal diseases (GIC) and in 192 normal children. This analysis allowed a complete profile of children with IBS in Italy to be obtained. The TD group, and to a lesser extent the RAP group, differ from the GIC and healthy controls (HC) on the basis of telephone calls to the doctor, physician visits, inappropriate dietary restrictions, multiple medications and multiple non-GI complaints. For children under 3, a history of food intolerance and the presence of mucus and undigested food in the feces are the variables that discriminate patients with IBS from those with GIC; for children over 3, colics in the first 3 months of life, a history of food intolerance, loose feces with abdominal pain, pain relieved by evacuation and undigested vegetables in the feces most discriminate the two groups. Finally, we tried to compute a diagnostic score to discriminate IBS children from GIC: this proved to be sensitive to IBS but not specific enough to be of clinical utility.},

Sixty patients with uncomplicated DU confirmed at endoscopy were treated with sucralfate one gram before three major meals and 1 g at bedtime for two months. Endoscopy was repeated at the end of the trial. There were four drop-outs. Complete, partial and no healing occurred in 45 (80.36)%, 3 (5.36%) and 8 (14.28%) subjects. Ulcer healing rate was higher in those without gross bulbar deformity (41/46) than in those with gross deformity (4/10), (Odd's ratio 12.3, 95% ci 1.98 to 78.44). Other variables were not found to be associated with ulcer healing.},

For all eligible subjects, a detailed questionnaire concerning characteristics of abdominal pain and defecatory pattern was completed at presentation. In addition, a battery of screening tests was performed and additional evaluation was done at the discretion of their physician. In all, 227 subjects fulfilled the entrance criteria, but 56 were subsequently excluded because of diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease (nine cases), lactose malabsorption (46 cases), or celiac disease (one case). Of the remaining 171 patients, 117 had IBS symptoms. In the IBS subjects, lower abdominal discomfort (p < 0.001), cramping pain (p < 0.0009), and increased flatus (p < 0.0003) were more common, whereas dyspeptic symptoms such as epigastric discomfort (p < 0.003), pain radiating to the chest (p < 0.009), and regurgitation (p < 0.02) were more common in the non-IBS subjects. Our study not only confirms the clinical heterogeneity of children with recurrent abdominal pain but also concomitantly demonstrates that most children with this disorder have symptoms that fulfill the standardized criteria for IBS in adults. The identification of subgroups of children with recurrent abdominal pain can provide a framework for the diagnosis of functional bowel disease as well as establish the need for invasive and expensive tests.},

Contrary to expectation, 100 (43.5%) reported symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of IBS. The one-year period prevalence of the syndrome was 30% overall, with prevalence figures of 24% for males and 48% for females (P < 0.01). There was no difference in the type of diet (mainly high-fiber diets) consumed by subjects with and without IBS. About two thirds of the subjects with IBS had sought medical advice during the study period; the consultation behavior was influenced by factors such as the presence of other symptoms. This is the first detailed evidence in a random sample of an African population showing symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of IBS to be very common. It casts doubt on the assumption generated by other workers that IBS is rare among native Africans.},

Over a three month period, tests failed to identify the cause of his pain. It was first labeled gastroenteritis and then irritable bowel syndrome. By the third month, his pain was mostly in the right upper quadrant. This area was sore when touched and worse after ingestion of fatty foods. A test detected elevated transaminases. It appeared that he had acalculous cholecystitis, which is one of several hepatobiliary complications of HIV. In HIV-infected individuals, acalculous cholecystitis is often an infectious disease of the biliary tract. Patients present with right upper quadrant and/or epigastric pain that is worse after fatty meals. Eventually, sonographs can detect a thickening of the gall bladder wall and dilation of the hepatic ducts, but early in the disease it is unlikely that the test result will be abnormal. The condition is often caused by CMV and cryptosporidium, but other pathogens may also cause acalculous cholecystitis. Perforation of the gall bladder and development of potentially irreversible abnormalities which complicate infection may result if the condition is left untreated. Although frequently connected with infectious diseases, cholecystitis may also occur in patients with high CD4 counts and no other HIV-related conditions.

Most often, patients do not have an actual increase in gastrointestinal gas volume, but rather their complaints derive from a misunderstanding of normal physiology, a misinterpretation of symptoms (colic), or an increase in intestinal sensitivity (irritable bowel syndrome). Symptoms from actual increases in intestinal gas volume are seen most frequently in children who swallow excessive amounts of air, have a dysmotility syndrome, or consume foods containing poorly absorbed carbohydrates. Although many therapies are used in the treatment of gas-related symptoms, under close scrutiny, the commonly recommended agents (e.g. simethicone) do not have proven efficacy. An understanding of the physiology of gas production and disposal is of practical use to pediatricians in determining the appropriate method of intervention for patients with these complaints.},

Neuropeptides may have an important role in initiating and regulating the intestinal motility. Motilin has been proposed to initiate the peristaltic reflex in the small intestine and cholecystokinin the gastrocolic reflex. METHODS: In 18 patients with IBS and 11 healthy control subjects plasma motilin and cholecystokinin (CCK) concentrations were measured after intraluminal stimulation of water and a fat-rich meal. RESULTS: The IBS patients had reduced motilin secretion after both water intake and the fat meal. In contrast, the fat meal elicited an exaggerated and prolonged CCK release in the IBS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Disturbed motilin and CCK release may partly be responsible for the intestinal dysmotility in the IBS patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a significant number of patients affected by the irritable bowel syndrome, an adverse reaction to food is proposed to be a causative factor. A diet that eliminates the offending foods is the obvious treatment for such adverse reactions. Compliance with a dietetic regimen is often poor and sometimes not completely free from risks. METHODS: Since the diarrheic type of irritable bowel syndrome seems mainly affected by food intolerance, and previous observations suggested that oral cromolyn sodium is effective in such patients, a multicenter therapeutic trial in the diarrheic type of irritable bowel syndrome was carried out in 346 of 409 patients with this disease, to evaluate the effects of oral cromolyn sodium and compare its efficacy with that of an elimination diet. RESULTS: Symptoms related to the irritable bowel syndrome improved in 60% of patients treated with elimination diet and in 67% of those treated with oral cromolyn sodium (1500 mg/day) for 1 month. Moreover, in both groups clinical results were significantly better in the patients positive to the skin prick test than in the negative ones. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the high prevalence of adverse reactions to foods in diarrheic irritable bowel syndrome and the usefulness of cromolyn sodium treatment in these patients.},

   abstract = {Patients who met International Congress of Gastroenterology criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and had breath hydrogen lactose testing were interviewed to determine whether detection of lactose maldigestion (LM) had an impact on their symptoms. Of 199 patients initially evaluated, 161 (81%) were contacted and asked to rate their symptoms. At baseline, 47 (29%) of the IBS group had LM. Before testing, 23 (49%) were aware that ingestion of lactose-containing food was associated with their gastrointestinal symptoms. Lactose-maldigesting IBS subjects (IBSLM, n = 47) and those who had IBS and no LM (n = 114) were similar in terms of age, sex, and ethnic background. Interviews performed 41 +/- 1.1 (SEM) months after baseline evaluation revealed no significant differences in abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, bloating/distension, mucus, and relief with defecation among those with IBS or LMIBS. Overall symptoms resolved, improved, did not change, or worsened in a manner not statistically different between IBS and IBSLM groups. IBSLM subjects (a) felt that identifying LM helped them gain awareness of food-symptom relationships (78.7%), (b) experienced some improvement in symptoms (83%), (c) were avoiding lactose foods (87.2%), or (d) used lactase enzyme supplements (38.3%). Identifying LM did not significantly affect rated variables.},
