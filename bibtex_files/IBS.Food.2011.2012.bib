   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fermented milk (FM) containing Bifidobacterium lactis CNCM I-2494 and yogurt strains improves irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in constipated IBS patients. In rats, stressful events exacerbate IBS symptoms and result in the alteration of gut sensitivity and permeability via epithelial cell cytoskeleton contraction. In a stress model, we aimed at evaluating the effect of B. lactis CNCM I-2494 as a pure strain or contained in an FM product on visceral sensitivity and the impact of this FM on intestinal barrier integrity. METHODS: Visceral sensitivity was analyzed in rats subjected to partial restraint stress (PRS). Rats received during 15 days the B. lactis as a pure strain (10(6) to 10(10) CFU mL(-1)), B. lactis in an FM product (10(8) CFU g(-1), diluted or not), or a control product. Gut paracellular permeability, colonic occluding and Jam-A proteins, and blood endotoxin levels were determined in rats receiving B. lactis in an FM product submitted or not to a PRS. KEY RESULTS: The FM product showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity. A similar antihyperalgesic effect was observed at 10(10) CFU mL(-1) of pure B. lactis administration. The FM product prevented the increase in intestinal permeability induced by PRS and restored occludin and JAM-A expressions to control levels. The FM product abolished the increase concentration of blood endotoxin induced by PRS. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: This study illustrates that a probiotic food containing B. lactis CNCM I-2494 strain reduces visceral hypersensitivity associated with acute stress by normalizing intestinal epithelial barrier via a synergistic interplay with the different probiotic strains and/or metabolites contained in this product.},

Various probiotics have been shown to suppress bacterial growth, modulate the immune system and improve intestinal barrier function. However, despite several studies with promising results, most trials are small and many have substantial methodological limitations.

The study involved 30 patients with functional bowel disease (Rome criteria III, 2006), with irritable bowel syndrome with predominance of constipatio--16 people with functional constipation--14 people. The criteria of efficacy were: the dynamics of clinical symptoms, bacteriological examination of feces before and after treatment, intestinal transit time of Activated Charcoa- "carbolen" test the definition of short-chain fatty acids (SFA) in the feces by gas-liquid chromatography before and after treatment. The results of the study. In Normoflorin therapy there comes normalization of intestinal motor activity; positive changes in colon ecosystem, consisting of changes of methabolic activity of colonic microflora and its generic composition, normalization of anaerobic-aerobic relations, restoration of intracavitary redox potential of the luminal environment; eliminating the symptoms of intestinal dyspepsia (rumbling, flatulence). Bio-complexes Normofloriny are characterized by good tolerability and safety. The positive effect of "aftereffect" of drugs persists for at least 2 weeks. These data allow us to recommend the use of bio-complexes Normofloriny in treatment of functional bowel disease. These data allow to recommend the use of bio-complexes Normofloriny in treatment of functional bowel disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate therapeutic potential of the immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based elimination diet among migraine patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). BACKGROUND: Food elimination has been suggested as an effective and inexpensive therapeutic strategy in patients with migraine and concomitant IBS in the past studies. METHODS: A total of 21 patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 38.0 [11.2] years; 85.7% females) diagnosed with migraine and IBS were included in this double-blind, randomized, controlled, cross-over clinical trial composed of baseline (usual diet), first diet (elimination or provocation diets), and second diet (interchange of elimination or provocations diets) phases and 4 visits. RESULTS: IgG antibody tests against 270 food allergens revealed mean (standard deviation) reaction count to be 23.1 (14.1). Compared with baseline levels, elimination diet per se was associated with significant reductions in attack count (4.8 [2.1] vs 2.7 [2.0]; P < .001), maximum attack duration (2.6 [0.6] vs. 1.4 [1.1] days; P < .001), mean attack duration (1.8 [0.5] vs. 1.1 [0.8] days; P < .01), maximum attack severity (visual analog scale 8.5 [1.4] vs. visual analog scale 6.6 [3.3]; P < .001), and number of attacks with acute medication (4.0 [1.5] vs. 1.9 [1.8]; P < .001). There was a significant reduction in pain-bloating severity (1.8 [1.3] vs. 3.2 [0.8]; P < .05), pain-bloating within the last 10 days (3.2 [2.8] vs. 5.5 [3.1]; P < .05), and improvement obtained in quality of life (3.6 [1.4] vs. 2.9 [1.0]; P < .05) by the elimination diet as compared with provocation diet. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that food elimination based on IgG antibodies in migraine patients who suffer from concomitant IBS may effectively reduce symptoms from both disorders with possible positive impact on the quality of life of the patients as well as potential savings to the health-care system.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Similar to other bacterial or protozoan infections, human cryptosporidiosis may trigger postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms, a condition in which enhanced visceral perception of pain during intestinal distension plays a pivotal role. In an immunocompetent suckling rat model which mimicks features of postinfectious IBS, Cryptosporidium parvum infection induces long-lasting jejunal hypersensitivity to distension in association with intestinal activated mast cell accumulation. The aim of the present study was to explore in this model whether octreotide, a somatostatin agonist analog, could prevent the development of jejunal hypersensitivity and intestinal mast cell/nerve fiber accumulation. METHODS: Five-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were infected with C. parvum and treated 10 days later with octreotide (50 g kg(-1) day(-1), i.p.) for 7 days. KEY RESULTS: Compared with untreated infected rats, octreotide treatment of infected rats resulted in increased weight gain [day 23 postinfection (PI)], decreased food intake (day 16 PI), and a reduction in jejunal villus alterations (day 14 PI), CD3(+) IEL (day 37 PI) and mast cell (days 37 and 50 PI) accumulations, nerve fiber densities (day 50 PI), and hypersensitivity to distension (day 120 PI). In uninfected rats, the effects of octreotide treatment were limited to higher weight gain (days 16 and 23 PI) and decreased food intake (day 23 PI) compared with uninfected-untreated rats. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Data confirms the relevance of the present rat model to postinfectious IBS studies and prompt further investigation of somatostatin-dependent regulatory interactions in cryptosporidiosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dinitrofluorobenzene/dinitrosulfonic acid (DNFB/DNS) model was originally described as an experimental model of intestinal inflammation resembling human ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to the absence of acceptable UC experimental models for pharmacological preclinical assays, here we examine the immune response induced in this model. METHODS: Balb/c mice were sensitized by skin application of DNFB on day 1, followed by an intrarectal challenge with DNS on day 5. We further expanded this model by administering a second DNS challenge on day 15. The features of colonic inflammation and immune response were evaluated. RESULTS: The changes observed in colonic tissue corresponded, in comparison to the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model, to a mild mucosal effect in the colon, which spontaneously resolved in less than 5 days. Furthermore, the second hapten challenge did not exacerbate the inflammatory response. In contrast to other studies, we did not observe any clear involvement of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or other Th1 cytokines during the initial inflammatory response; however, we found that a more Th2-humoral response appeared to mediate the first contact with the hapten. An increased humoral response was detected during the second challenge, although an increased Th1/Th17-cytokine expression profile was also simultaneously observed. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results, although the DNFB/DNS model can display some features found in human UC, it should be considered as a model for the study of the intestinal hypersensitivity seen, for example, during food allergy or irritable bowel syndrome but not intestinal inflammation per se.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The human gastrointestinal lumen is inhabited by a wide variety of microbiota. Our understanding of the intestinal microbiota and its full consequences on gastrointestinal health is still evolving. However, it is well accepted that altered colonic flora drives the pathogenesis of many disorders and diseases as seen in antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile infection. Recent works published in the area of probiotics are reviewed here. RECENT FINDINGS: Alterations in colonic microbiota, or dysbiosis, are now implicated in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel diseases. Probiotics and prebiotics are evolving treatment options that are targeted at restoring nonpathogenic digestive flora. There has been great interest in the role of these therapies in treatment of many diseases including childhood diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. SUMMARY: Trials of probiotics have been shown to be helpful in some of these, not in others, and more work is needed in others. We review recent work done in these areas.},

   abstract = {There is increasingly convincing evidence supporting the participation of the gut microenvironment in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Studies particularly suggest an interplay between luminal factors (eg, foods and bacteria residing in the intestine), the epithelial barrier, and the mucosal immune system. Decreased expression and structural rearrangement of tight junction proteins in the small bowel and colon leading to increased intestinal permeability have been observed, particularly in postinfectious IBS and in IBS with diarrhea. These abnormalities are thought to contribute to the outflow of antigens through the leaky epithelium, causing overstimulation of the mucosal immune system. Accordingly, subsets of patients with IBS show higher numbers and an increased activation of mucosal immunocytes, particularly mast cells. Immune factors, released by these cells, including proteases, histamine, and prostanoids, participate in the perpetuation of the permeability dysfunction and contribute to the activation of abnormal neural responses involved in abdominal pain perception and changes in bowel habits. All these mechanisms represent new targets for therapeutic approaches in IBS. Probiotics are an attractive therapeutic option in IBS given their recognized safety and by virtue of positive biological effects they can exert on the host. Of importance for the IBS pathophysiology is that preclinical studies have shown that selective probiotic strains exhibit potentially useful properties including anti-inflammatory effects, improvement of mucosal barrier homeostasis, beneficial effects on intestinal microbiota, and a reduction of visceral hypersensitivity. The effect of probiotics on IBS is positive in most randomized, controlled studies, although the gain over the placebo is small. Identifying tailored probiotic approaches for subgroups of IBS patients represents a challenge for the future.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether maternal probiotic intervention influences the alterations in the brain-immune-gut axis induced by neonatal maternal separation (MS) and/or restraint stress in adulthood (AS) in Wistar rats. DESIGN: Dams had free access to drinking water supplemented with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis BB-12(R) (3 x 10(9) CFU/mL) and Propionibacterium jensenii 702 (8.0 x 10(8) CFU/mL) from 10 days before conception until postnatal day (PND) 22 (weaning day), or to control ad lib water. Offspring were subjected to MS from PND 2 to 14 or left undisturbed. From PND 83 to 85, animals underwent 30 min/day AS, or were left undisturbed as controls. On PND 24 and 86, blood samples were collected for corticosterone, ACTH and IgA measurement. Colonic contents were analysed for the composition of microflora and luminal IgA levels. RESULTS: Exposure to MS significantly increased ACTH levels and neonatal fecal counts of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, E. coli, enterococci and clostridia, but reduced plasma IgA levels compared with non-MS animals. Animals exposed to AS exhibited significantly increased ACTH and corticosterone levels, decreased aerobic bacteria and bifidobacteria, and increased Bacteroides and E. coli counts compared to non-AS animals. MS coupled with AS induced significantly decreased anaerobes and clostridia compared with the non-stress adult controls. Maternal probiotic intervention significantly increased neonatal corticosterone levels which persisted until at least week 12 in females only, and also resulted in elevated adult ACTH levels and altered neonatal microflora comparable to that of MS. However, it improved plasma IgA responses, increased enterococci and clostridia in MS adults, increased luminal IgA levels, and restored anaerobes, bifidobacteria and E. coli to normal in adults. CONCLUSION: Maternal probiotic intervention induced activation of neonatal stress pathways and an imbalance in gut microflora. Importantly however, it improved the immune environment of stressed animals and protected, in part, against stress-induced disturbances in adult gut microflora.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the impact of dietary supplementation with a Bifidobacterium breve strain together with linoleic acid & alpha-linolenic acid, for 7 weeks, on colonic sensitivity and fatty acid metabolism in rats. Maternally separated and non-maternally separated Sprague Dawley rats (n = 15) were orally gavaged with either B. breve DPC6330 (10(9) microorganisms/day) alone or in combination with 0.5% (w/w) linoleic acid & 0.5% (w/w) alpha-linolenic acid, daily for 7 weeks and compared with trehalose and bovine serum albumin. Tissue fatty acid composition was assessed by gas-liquid chromatography and visceral hypersensitivity was assessed by colorectal distension. Significant differences in the fatty acid profiles of the non-separated controls and maternally separated controls were observed for alpha-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid in the liver, oleic acid and eicosenoic acid (c11) in adipose tissue, and for palmitoleic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in serum (p<0.05). Administration of B. breve DPC6330 to MS rats significantly increased palmitoleic acid, arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in the liver, eicosenoic acid (c11) in adipose tissue and palmitoleic acid in the prefrontal cortex (p<0.05), whereas feeding B. breve DPC6330 to non separated rats significantly increased eicosapentaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid in serum (p<0.05) compared with the NS un-supplemented controls. Administration of B. breve DPC6330 in combination with linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid to maternally separated rats significantly increased docosapentaenoic acid in the serum (p<0.01) and alpha-linolenic acid in adipose tissue (p<0.001), whereas feeding B. breve DPC6330 with fatty acid supplementation to non-separated rats significantly increased liver and serum docosapentaenoic acid (p<0.05), and alpha-linolenic acid in adipose tissue (p<0.001). B. breve DPC6330 influenced host fatty acid metabolism. Administration of B. breve DPC6330 to maternally separated rats significantly modified the palmitoleic acid, arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid contents in tissues.

   abstract = {Food intolerance in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is increasingly being recognized, with patients convinced that diet plays a role in symptom induction. Evidence is building to implicate fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) in the onset of abdominal pain, bloating, wind and altered bowel habit through their fermentation and osmotic effects. Hypersensitivity to normal levels of luminal distension is known to occur in patients with IBS, with consideration of food chemical intolerance likely to answer many questions about this physiological process. This paper summarizes the evidence and application of the most common approaches to managing food intolerance in IBS: the low-FODMAP diet, the elimination diet for food chemical sensitivity and others including possible noncoeliac gluten intolerance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: : The aim of this study was to survey interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) patients with a Web-based questionnaire to determine which consumables (foods, drinks, supplements/spices, and general food categories) truly exacerbate IC/BPS symptoms. METHODS: : The Interstitial Cystitis Association posted a Web link on its Web site offering its members participation in the Web-based questionnaire from April 2009 to February 2010. Members were asked questions on the effect of 344 different foods, drinks, supplements, condiments/spices, and general food categories on urinary frequency, urgency, and/or pelvic pain symptoms. Members were asked to score symptoms related to consumables on a symptom Likert scale of 0 to 5. Questions on ethnicity, education, symptom duration, seasonal allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, and specific diets were included. RESULTS: : There were 598 complete responses to the questionnaire, and 95.8% of the participants answered that certain foods and beverages affected their IC/BPS symptoms. Most items had no effect on symptoms. Items that made symptoms worse were citrus fruits, tomatoes, coffee, tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, spicy foods, artificial sweeteners, and vitamin C. Only calcium glycerophosphate (Prelief; AK Pharma, Inc, Pleasantville, NJ) and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) had a trend toward improvement in symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: : Interstitial cystitis diets do not have to be overly restrictive. It is recommended that patients with IC/BPS avoid citrus fruits, tomatoes, coffee, tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, spicy foods, artificial sweeteners, and vitamin C. The use of calcium glycerophosphate and/or sodium bicarbonate before consumption of these trigger consumables may also help reduce sensitivity.},

   abstract = {Fibromyalgia syndrome is mainly characterized by pain, fatigue, and sleep disruption. The etiology of fibromyalgia is still unclear: if central sensitization is considered to be the main mechanism involved, then many other factors, genetic, immunological, and hormonal, may play an important role. The diagnosis is typically clinical (there are no laboratory abnormalities) and the physician must concentrate on pain and on its features. Additional symptoms (e.g., Raynaud's phenomenon, irritable bowel disease, and heat and cold intolerance) can be associated with this condition. A careful differential diagnosis is mandatory: fibromyalgia is not a diagnosis of exclusion. Since 1990, diagnosis has been principally based on the two major diagnostic criteria defined by the ACR. Recently, new criteria have been proposed. The main goals of the treatment are to alleviate pain, increase restorative sleep, and improve physical function. A multidisciplinary approach is optimal. While most nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids have limited benefit, an important role is played by antidepressants and neuromodulating antiepileptics: currently duloxetine (NNT for a 30% pain reduction 7.2), milnacipran (NNT 19), and pregabalin (NNT 8.6) are the only drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of fibromyalgia. In addition, nonpharmacological treatments should be associated with drug therapy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients with perceived food hypersensitivity typically present with multiple health complaints. We aimed to assess the severity of their intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, 84 patients referred to our outpatient clinic for investigation of perceived food hypersensitivity were enrolled consecutively. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was diagnosed according to the Rome III criteria. Severity and impact of bowel symptoms, fatigue and musculoskeletal pain were evaluated by using the following questionnaires: The IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS), the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), the FibroFatigue Scale (FFS), and visual analogue scales (VAS) for scoring of musculoskeletal pain. RESULTS: All but one patient were diagnosed with IBS, 58% with severe symptoms. Extra-intestinal symptoms suggestive of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia were demonstrated in 85% and 71%, respectively. Neither IgE-mediated food allergy nor organic pathology could explain the patients' symptoms. Nevertheless, malabsorption of fat was demonstrated in 10 of 38 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived food hypersensitivity may be associated with severe, debilitating illness. The comorbid triad of IBS, chronic fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain is striking and may point to a common underlying cause.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its complications are thought to be infrequent in India; there are no data from India on the prevalence of and risk factors for GERD. The Indian Society of Gastroenterology formed a task force aiming to study: (a) the frequency and profile of GERD in India, (b) factors including diet associated with GERD. METHODS: In this prospective, multi-center (12 centers) study, data were obtained using a questionnaire from 3224 subjects regarding the frequency, severity and duration of heartburn, regurgitation and other symptoms of GERD. Data were also obtained regarding their dietary habits, addictions, and lifestyle, and whether any of these were related or had been altered because of symptoms. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-five (7.6%) of 3224 subjects had heartburn and/or regurgitation at least once a week. On univariate analysis, older age (OR 1.012; 95% CI 1.003-1.021), consumption of non-vegetarian and fried foods, aerated drinks, tea/coffee were associated with GERD. Frequency of smoking was similar among subjects with or without GERD. Body mass index (BMI) was similar in subjects with and without GERD. On multivariate analysis, consumption of non-vegetarian food was independently associated with GERD symptoms. Overlap with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome was not uncommon; 21% reported difficulty in passage of stool and 9% had mucus in stools. About 25% of patients had consulted a doctor previously for their gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSION: 7.6% of Indian subjects have significant GERD symptoms. Consumption of non-vegetarian foods was an independent predictor of GERD. BMI was comparable among subjects with or without GERD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder often diagnosed and managed by primary care physicians (PCPs). Despite the high prevalence of IBS, symptom severity is often underappreciated and inadequately managed. The goal of this review is to discern IBS treatment gaps and identify opportunities for improving its management in the primary care setting, as well as describe the most current clinical experience with alosetron, a targeted treatment for severe diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) in women. SCOPE: PubMed was searched for English language articles using combinations of the following key words: 'irritable bowel syndrome,' 'diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome,' 'diagnosis,' 'guidelines,' 'general practice,' 'primary care,' 'quality of life,' 'burden,' 'prevalence,' 'patient satisfaction,' 'patient survey,' 'severe,' 'severity,' and 'alosetron.' FINDINGS: Establishing the diagnosis of IBS in primary care represents a clinical challenge for many healthcare professionals. While many patients seek care for IBS symptoms in the primary care setting, evidence shows that PCPs are often unaware of established diagnostic criteria for IBS. Establishing the severity of IBS is also problematic, given the lack of consensus guidelines defining severe IBS, which in turn complicates treatment decisions. Severe IBS is often inferred after inadequate response to conventional agents; the level of disease impact on quality of life and patient functioning also defines severity. The selective 5-HT(3) antagonist alosetron has been shown to provide improvement across multiple symptom domains, and the incidence of adverse events continues to be low since the implementation of the Prescribing Program for Lotronex. Alosetron is the only agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of severe IBS-D in women. CONCLUSION: PCPs often are required to evaluate and treat suspected IBS. The diagnosis and management of IBS in the primary care setting could be optimized through the use of published diagnostic criteria, adequate assessment of symptom severity, and a thorough knowledge of the therapeutic agents that have provided evidence of effectiveness. In the subset of women who suffer from IBS-D, targeted serotonergic therapy with alosetron has been shown to provide symptom relief across multiple domains, including improvement of the patient's quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food and diet are central issues that concern patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Few studies have thoroughly analyzed dietary intake in IBS. Our aims were to determine the nutrient intake in IBS patients in comparison to the general population, assess nutritional differences between IBS subgroups based on the predominant bowel habit or symptom severity, as well as to evaluate if their nutrient intake meet nutrition recommendations. METHODS: We included 187 IBS patients (mean 40.2 years; 139 women). They completed a 4-days food registration record, which was compared with an age-, and gender-matched control group (n = 374; 278 women) from a nation-wide dietary survey and with Nordic Nutrient Recommendations. KEY RESULTS: Daily nutrient intake in IBS patients was similar to the general population and met national nutrients recommendations. Irritable bowel syndrome patients had similar energy distribution from macronutrients compared to the control group, but the protein percentage tended to be higher. Irritable bowel syndrome patients also had significantly higher daily intake of vitamin E, folate, iron, vitamin C, and dietary fibers, as well as lower intake of vitamin A, riboflavin, calcium, and potassium. There was no association between nutrient intake and IBS subtypes or symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Although many IBS patients state that they avoid food items, this does not seem to influence their intake of nutrients to any large extent. The observed minor differences in nutrient intake indicate a tendency toward higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of meat and dairy products in IBS patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colonic response to food (CRF) is abnormal in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare CRF in patients who complain of abnormal defecation pattern according to the presence or absence of abdominal pain. METHODS: One hundred forty-nine patients and 50 controls were studied: 96 IBS patients (46 IBS-C, 13 IBS-D, 15 IBS-M, and 22 IBS-U not included), 43 patients with functional constipation (group C) and ten with functional diarrhea (group D). Clinical evaluation and visual analog scales about four items (constipation, diarrhea, abdominal bloating and abdominal pain) were filled by all subjects. Colonic transit time (CTT) was measured in fasting conditions and after eating a standard 1,000-cal test meal. CRF was quantified by calculating the variation in number of markers between the two films. RESULTS: The frequency of meal-related symptoms did not vary among the different groups of patients but was significantly higher than in controls. Compared to IBS-C patients, constipated patients of the group C had longer total and segmental colonic transit time, and compared to IBS-D patients, diarrheic patients of the group D had shorter oro-anal and segmental colonic transit time except in the recto-sigmoid area. CRF was different in patients and controls, and differed between IBS and non IBS patients with similar transit abnormalities. Stool output was greater in patients of the group D than in patients of the IBS-D group. CONCLUSION: The different subgroups of IBS patients have different CRF patterns, distinct from subjects with constipation and diarrhea, but without abdominal pain.},

   abstract = {Guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) is a transmembrane receptor activated by bacterial heat-stable enterotoxins and by the endogenous hormones guanylin and uroguanylin. GC-C plays key roles in the regulation of intestinal fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. This is highlighted by several recently identified human mutations in GUCY2C, the gene encoding GC-C, which leads to the respective gain or loss of function of GC-C, resulting in profound effects on gastrointestinal function. However, a wealth of recent studies indicates GC-C signalling extends to a multitude of diverse additional functions. Recent pre-clinical and clinical studies demonstrate a novel first-in-class GC-C activating peptide, Linaclotide, provides effective relief from constipation and abdominal pain in patients with chronic constipation and constipation-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Accumulating evidence also suggests GC-C plays protective roles in mucosal barrier function, tissue injury and inflammation, whilst GC-C signalling is a key regulator of intestinal cell proliferation and apoptosis. Finally, recently identified extra-intestinal GC-C signalling pathways make novel contributions to the regulation of food intake and symptoms associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Consequently, these findings provide GC-C expression and its associated mutations as potential diagnostic markers for disease. They also provide current and future therapeutic potential for GC-C signalling within and outside the gastrointestinal tract.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will be discussed.},

The Life Sciences Research Organization, Inc. (LSRO) held a workshop, Prebiotics and the Health Benefits of Fiber: Future Research and Goals, in February 2011 to assess the current state of the science and the international regulatory environment for prebiotics, identify research gaps, and create a strategy for future research. A developing body of evidence supports a role for prebiotics in reducing the risk and severity of GI infection and inflammation, including diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis as well as bowel function disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics also increase the bioavailability and uptake of minerals and data suggest that they reduce the risk of obesity by promoting satiety and weight loss. Additional research is needed to define the relationship between the consumption of different prebiotics and improvement of human health. New information derived from the characterization of the composition and function of different prebiotics as well as the interactions among and between gut microbiota and the human host would improve our understanding of the effects of prebiotics on health and disease and could assist in surmounting regulatory issues related to prebiotic use.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pain contains both sensory and affective dimensions. Using a rodent visceral pain assay that combines the colorectal distension (CRD) model with the conditioned place avoidance (CPA) paradigms, we measured a learned behavior that directly reflects the affective component of visceral pain, and showed that perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) activation is critical for memory processing involved in long-term visceral affective state and prediction of aversive stimuli by contextual cue. Progress has been made and suggested that activation of vagal afferents plays a role in the behavioral control nociception and memory storage processes.In human patients, electrical vagus nerve stimulation enhanced retention of verbal learning performance. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK), which is a gastrointestinal hormone released during feeding, has been shown to enhance memory retention. Mice access to food immediately after training session enhanced memory retention. It has been well demonstrated that CCK acting on vagal afferent fibers mediates various physiological functions. We hypothesize that CCK activation of vagal afferent enhances visceral pain-related affective memory. RESULTS: In the presented study, infusion of CCK-8 at physiological concentration combining with conditional training significantly increased the CRD-induced CPA scores, and enhanced the pain affective memory retention. In contrast, CCK had no effect on CPA induced by non-nociceptive aversive stimulus (U69,593). The physiological implications were further strengthened by the similar effects observed in the rats with duodenal infusion of 5% peptone, which has been shown to induce increases in plasma CCK levels. CCK-8 receptor antagonist CR-1409 or perivagal application of capsaicin abolished the effect of CCK on aversive visceral pain memory, which was consistent with the notion that vagal afferent modulates affective aspects of visceral pain. CCK does not change the nociceptive response (visceral pain sensitivity) and anterior cingulate cortex neuronal responses to CRD. CONCLUSION: CCK activating vagal afferent C fibers enhances memory consolidation and retention involved in long-term visceral negative affective state. Thus, in a number of gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, nutrient content may contribute to painful visceral perception by enhancing visceral aversive memory via acts on vagal afferent pathway.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to test in a double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled study the effects of a commercially available multi-strain symbiotic mixture on symptoms, colonic transit and quality of life in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients who meet Rome III criteria. BACKGROUND: There is only one other double-blinded RCT on a single-strain symbiotic mixture in IBS. METHODS: This is a double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled study of a symbiotic mixture (Probinul, 5 g bid) over 4 weeks after 2 weeks of run-in. The primary endpoints were global satisfactory relief of abdominal flatulence and bloating. Responders were patients who reported at least 50 % of the weeks of treatment with global satisfactory relief. The secondary endpoints were change in abdominal bloating, flatulence, pain and urgency by a 100-mm visual analog scale, stool frequency and bowel functions on validated adjectival scales (Bristol Scale and sense of incomplete evacuation). Pre- and post-treatment colonic transit time (Metcalf) and quality of life (SF-36) were assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-four IBS patients (symbiotic n = 32, 64 % females, mean age 38.7 +/- 12.6 years) were studied. This symbiotic mixture reduced flatulence over a 4-week period of treatment (repeated-measures analysis of covariance, p < 0.05). Proportions of responders were not significantly different between groups. At the end of the treatment, a longer rectosigmoid transit time and a significant improvement in most SF-36 scores were observed in the symbiotic group. CONCLUSIONS: This symbiotic mixture has shown a beneficial effect in decreasing the severity of flatulence in IBS patients, a lack of adverse events and a good side-effect profile; however, it failed to achieve an improvement in global satisfactory relief of abdominal flatulence and bloating. Further studies are warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms suffer from food hypersensitivity (FH); their symptoms improve when they are placed on elimination diets. No assays identify patients with FH with satisfactory levels of sensitivity. We determined the frequency of FH among patients with symptoms of IBS and the ability of fecal assays for tryptase, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), or calprotectin to diagnose FH. METHODS: The study included 160 patients with IBS, 40 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases, and 50 healthy individuals (controls). At the start of the study, patients completed a symptom severity questionnaire, fecal samples were assayed, and levels of specific immunoglobulin E were measured. Patients were observed for 4 weeks, placed on an elimination diet (without cow's milk and derivatives, wheat, egg, tomato, and chocolate) for 4 weeks, and kept a diet diary. Those who reported improvements after the elimination diet period were then diagnosed with FH, based on the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral food challenge (with cow's milk proteins and then with wheat proteins). RESULTS: Forty of the patients with IBS (25%) were found to have FH. Levels of fecal ECP and tryptase were significantly higher among patients with IBS and FH than those without FH. The ECP assay was the most accurate assay for diagnosis of FH, showing 65% sensitivity and 91% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-five percent of patients with IBS have FH. These patients had increased levels of fecal ECP and tryptase, indicating that they might cause inflammation in patients with IBS. Fecal assays for ECP could be used to identify FH in patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (WS) is considered a new clinical entity. An increasing percentage of the general population avoids gluten ingestion. However, the real existence of this condition is debated and specific markers are lacking. Our aim was thus to demonstrate the existence of WS and define its clinical, serologic, and histological markers. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical charts of all subjects with an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like presentation who had been diagnosed with WS using a double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) challenge in the years 2001-2011. One hundred celiac disease (CD) patients and fifty IBS patients served as controls. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-six patients with WS, as diagnosed by DBPC challenge, were included. Two groups showing distinct clinical characteristics were identified: WS alone (group 1) and WS associated with multiple food hypersensitivity (group 2). As a whole group, the WS patients showed a higher frequency of anemia, weight loss, self-reported wheat intolerance, coexistent atopy, and food allergy in infancy than the IBS controls. There was also a higher frequency of positive serum assays for IgG/IgA anti-gliadin and cytometric basophil activation in "in vitro" assay. The main histology characteristic of WS patients was eosinophil infiltration of the duodenal and colon mucosa. Patients with WS alone were characterized by clinical features very similar to those found in CD patients. Patients with multiple food sensitivity were characterized by clinical features similar to those found in allergic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the existence of non-celiac WS as a distinct clinical condition. We also suggest the existence of two distinct populations of subjects with WS: one with characteristics more similar to CD and the other with characteristics pointing to food allergy.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Most studies on probiotics utilise single strains, sometimes incorporated into yoghurts. There are fewer studies on efficacy of mixtures of probiotic strains. This review examines the evidence that (a) probiotic mixtures are beneficial for a range of health-related outcomes and (b) mixtures are more or less effective than their component strains administered separately. RESULTS: Mixtures of probiotics had beneficial effects on the end points including irritable bowel syndrome and gut function, diarrhoea, atopic disease, immune function and respiratory tract infections, gut microbiota modulation, inflammatory bowel disease and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. However, only 16 studies compared the effect of a mixture with that of its component strains separately, although in 12 cases (75%), the mixture was more effective. CONCLUSION: Probiotic mixtures appear to be effective against a wide range of end points. Based on a limited number of studies, multi-strain probiotics appear to show greater efficacy than single strains, including strains that are components of the mixtures themselves. However, whether this is due to synergistic interactions between strains or a consequence of the higher probiotic dose used in some studies is at present unclear.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study and compare the therapeutic effects of electroacupuncture and probiotics combine Deanxit in treating diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). METHODS: Totally 64 D-IBS patients accompanied with anxiety and/or depression were randomly assigned to the Western medicine group (Group A) and the electroacupuncture (EA) group (Group B), 30 patients in Group A and 34 patients in Group B. Patients in Group A took Bacillus licheniformis and Deanxit, while those in Group B received EA. Four weeks consisted of one therapeutic course. Three-month follow-up was carried out. The scoring for the digestive tract symptoms, HAMA score, and HAMD score were evaluated before and after treatment. The recurrence in the 3-month follow-up was also observed. RESULTS: The total effect rate was 86.67% in Group A and 88.24% in Group B with no statistical difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was statistical difference in the scoring for the digestive tract symptoms, HAMA score, and HAMD score (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). There was no statistical difference in the improvement of defecation frequency score, HAMA score, HAMD score between the two groups after treatment (P > 0.05). Better effects on improving abdominal pain score and abdominal distention score was obtained in Group B (P < 0.01), while better effects on improving the stool form score and mucus score were obtained in Group A (P < 0.01). There was no statistical difference in the recurrence rate between the two groups within the two-month follow-up (P > 0.05). The recurrence rate within the 3-month follow-up was obviously lower in Group B than in Group A (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EA and Western medicine (probiotics combined Deanxit) could effectively treat D-IBS patients accompanied with anxiety and/or depression. Both of them had different superiorities in improving symptoms. But EA had better long-term therapeutic effects.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Linaclotide is a minimally absorbed peptide guanylate cyclase-C agonist. The objective of this trial was to determine the efficacy and safety of linaclotide treatment in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) over 26 weeks. METHODS: This phase 3, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial randomized IBS-C patients to placebo or 290 mug of oral linaclotide once daily for a 26-week treatment period. The primary and the secondary efficacy assessments were evaluated over the first 12 weeks of treatment. Primary end points included the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) end point for IBS-C (responder: a patient who reported (i) improvement of >/= 30 % from baseline in average daily worst abdominal pain score and (ii) increase of >/= 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) from baseline, both in the same week for >/= 6 / 12 weeks) and three other primary end points, based on improvements in abdominal pain and CSBMs for 9/12 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored. RESULTS: In all, 804 patients (mean age = 44 years, female = 90 % , white = 78 % ) were evaluated; 33.7 % of linaclotide-treated patients were FDA end point responders, vs. 13.9 % of placebo-treated patients ( P < 0.0001) (number needed to treat = 5.1, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 3.9, 7.1). The pain responder criterion of the FDA end point was met by 48.9 % of linaclotide-treated patients vs. 34.5 % of placebo-treated patients (number needed to treat = 7.0, 95 % CI: 4.7, 13.1), and the CSBM responder criterion was met by 47.6 % of linaclotide-treated patients, vs. 22.6 % of placebo patients (number needed to treat = 4.0, 95 % CI: 3.2, 5.4). Remaining primary end points ( P < 0.0001) and all secondary end points ( P < 0.001), including abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, and bowel symptoms (SBM and CSBM rates, Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) score, and straining), were also statistically significantly improved with linaclotide vs. placebo. Statistically significant differences from placebo were observed for responder and continuous end points over 26 weeks of treatment. AE incidence was similar between treatment groups, except for diarrhea, which caused discontinuation in 4.5 % of linaclotide patients vs. 0.2 % of placebo patients. CONCLUSIONS: Linaclotide 290 mug once daily significantly improved abdominal and bowel symptoms associated with IBS-C over 26 weeks of treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent papers highlight the role of the diet in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but very few population-based studies have evaluated this. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of IBS in the general urban population and to evaluate the type of diet associated with IBS symptoms. METHODS: A randomized sample of subjects (n=300) from a general urban population in Romania selected from family doctors' patient lists was invited for interview in the doctor's office. Selected subjects were evaluated for the diagnosis of IBS using Rome III criteria and for their eating habits and diet using a food frequency questionnaire. Socio-demographic factors and general medical history were also included in the interview together with standard weight measurements. Results from logistic regression were presented as odd ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. RESULTS: From the selected sample, 193 subjects (80 males, 113 women, mean age 50.8 +/- 16.2) agreed to participate (rate 64.3%). Prevalence of IBS was 19.1 % (19.4% for females and 18.7 % for males). IBS was associated with older age (1.05, 1.02-1.08, p <0.001) and past history of digestive diseases (5.0, 2.0-12.7, p<0.01). IBS subjects eat significantly more frequently canned food (23.74, 3.17-177.7, p<0.01), processed meat (4.7, 1.6-14.1, p<0.01), pulses (legumes) (4.0, 1.3-16.3, p<0.01), whole cereals (8.7, 2.0-37.8, p<0.01), confectionary (5.7, 1.8-23.2, p<0.01), fruit compotes (canned or not) (7.4, 2.5-23.1, p<0.001) and herb teas (4.0, 1.3-16.3, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study updates prevalence data and reveals a possible association between diet and irritable bowel syndrome.},

AIMS: This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of Saccharomyces boulardii on quality of life (QOL) and symptoms in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS or mixed-type IBS. METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with IBS were randomized either to receive S. boulardii at 2x10 live cells as a daily dose (n=34), or placebo (n=33) for 4 weeks. IBS-QOL was assessed at the beginning and end of the treatment phase. IBS-related symptoms, bowel movement frequency, and stool consistency were recorded on a daily basis and assessed each week. RESULTS: The overall improvement in IBS-QOL was higher in S. boulardii group than placebo (15.4% vs 7.0%; P<0.05). All eight domains of IBS-QOL were significantly improved in S. boulardii group; however, placebo group only showed improvements in dysphoria and health worry. Composite scores for IBS symptoms were significantly reduced in both groups to a similar extent. Bowel frequency and stool consistency did not change in either group. CONCLUSIONS: S. boulardii improved IBS-QOL better than placebo but was not superior for individual symptoms in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS or mixed-type IBS.},

In this review, evidence on the effectiveness of psyllium supplementation for diagnosed IBS symptoms was evaluated and summarized. A systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science was conducted. Included were full-length, peer-reviewed, English-language articles in which psyllium ingestion was tested for its effect on IBS symptoms. Quality of these articles also was assessed. Twelve met the criteria for complete data abstraction. Seventy-five percent of the studies examined were of weak quality. Study designs and methods were heterogeneous. Patient-perceived global symptoms improved significantly in six of the nine studies measuring a global symptom outcome. In one study, significant improvements occurred in reported abdominal pain; in three, improvement did not occur. Quality of life and flatulence did not improve significantly in any studies in which these outcomes were examined. The results of this systematic review indicate limited and conflicting evidence to support the recommendation of psyllium supplementation for symptomatic IBS treatment.},

Some patients consume probiotic products in attempts to manipulate the intestinal microbiota for health benefit. It is important for gastroenterologists to improve their understanding of the mechanisms of probiotics and the evidence that support their use in practice. Clinical trials have assessed the therapeutic effects of probiotic agents for several disorders, including antibiotic- or Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and the inflammatory bowel diseases. Although probiotic research is a rapidly evolving field, there are sufficient data to justify a trial of probiotics for treatment or prevention of some of these conditions. However, the capacity of probiotics to modify disease symptoms is likely to be modest and varies among probiotic strains-not all probiotics are right for all diseases. The current review provides condition-specific rationale for using probiotic therapy and literature-based recommendations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a poorly understood, yet highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID). The withdrawal, due to adverse events, of a number of pharmacological agents that were approved for the treatment of IBS has left a therapeutic vacuum for patients suffering from the disorder. AIM: To review, summarise and critically evaluate current knowledge of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) used to treat IBS. METHODS: We assessed a comprehensive range of relevant literature from Pubmed, Medline and online sources based on our definition of LAB which included both typical and atypical species, covering Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, Enterococci, Streptococci and Bacilli. RESULTS: Of the 42 trials evaluated examining the efficacy of LAB in IBS, 34 reported beneficial effects in at least one of the endpoints or symptoms examined, albeit with tremendous variation in both the magnitude of effect and the choice of outcome under consideration. However, numerous concerns have been expressed over deficits of trial design and execution relating to strain selection, optimum dosage, mode of action, safety and long-term tolerability in a disorder that can persist throughout the lifetime of affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Progress in the field will require an improved understanding of how the microbiota impacts on health and disease, adequately powered long-term multicentre trials and the embracing of bench to bedside approaches. Recent incremental advances suggest these areas are being addressed and that the future holds much promise for the use of lactic acid bacteria in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, typically chronic and sometimes disabling gastrointestinal condition of uncertain aetiology. Recently, a variety of links to gastrointestinal infections have been described including the onset of IBS following exposure to enteric pathogens and an apparent predisposition to gastrointestinal infection. The prevalence of Clostridium difficile in a population of IBS outpatients (n = 87) in the absence of established risk factors for the acquisition of C. difficile infection was examined. Overall, 5.7 % of patients (n = 5) carried culturable C. difficile and 4.6 % (n = 4) of isolates were toxigenic, belonging to toxinotype group 0, compared with 1.1 % (n = 1) for the healthy control group (n = 88). These isolates were members of toxigenic PCR ribotype groups 005 and 050 (IBS group) and 062 (control group) and were identified further as three individual strains by PFGE. Although no significant difference was observed between IBS patients and healthy volunteers, these findings support the concept that a subpopulation of IBS patients may be susceptible to gastrointestinal infection.},

   abstract = {The research reported herein was designed to assess whether the bacterium, Dietzia subspecies C79793-74, used as a probiotic, could prevent development of parameters indicative of bovine paratuberculosis after potential in utero, birthing and neonatal (colostrum) exposure to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Such exposure avenues are especially relevant for dairy farms practicing good management procedures since calves on these farms could be infected via dams that have yet to be identified as MAP-positive. Indeed, of 18 calves in the present study that became paratuberculosis parameter-positive, five had dams that were negative for all parameters pre-calving. Parameters used herein to define paratuberculosis status were serum ELISA, serum agar gel immunodiffusion, cultureable fecal MAP, histopathology at necropsy and clinical disease. Thirty-four newborn calves, whose dams were paratuberculosis-positive, were assigned to four different treatment groups. Ten were treated daily for 60 days with viable Dietzia added to their antibiotic-free milk feedings; none became positive for any parameter with age. In contrast, seven of eight calves that were not treated became positive for one or more paratuberculosis-associated parameter. Sixteen calves were treated with viable Dietzia for the first two days of life; eight were then not treated further, whereas the other eight were treated an additional 58 days with Dietzia added to tetracycline-fortified milk (Dietzia is sensitive to tetracycline). In these two groups, positivity developed in five of eight and six of eight, respectively. These results indicated that (a) a daily, 60-day treatment with viable Dietzia effectively prevented development of parameters indicative of paratuberculosis and (b) this treatment, in combination with good management practices, has the potential to eradicate MAP from animals/herds, which should curtail the spread of MAP. Such results should significantly reduce human exposure to MAP, which in turn, could have relevance for the controversial role of MAP in Crohn's disease, type-1 diabetes mellitus, sarcoidosis, Blau syndrome, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and multiple sclerosis.},

   abstract = {A naturally occurring gastrointestinal disease, primarily of ruminants (Johne disease), is a chronic debilitating disease that is caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). MAP infection occurs primarily in utero and in newborns. Outside our Dietzia probiotic treatment, there are no preventive/curative therapies for bovine paratuberculosis. Interestingly, MAP is at the center of controversy as to its role in (cause of) Crohn disease (CD) and more recently, its role in diabetes, ulcerative colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); the latter two, like CD, are considered to be a result of chronic intestinal inflammation. Treatments, both conventional and biologic agents, which induce and maintain remission are directed at curtailing processes that are an intricate part of inflammation. Most possess side effects of varying severity, lose therapeutic value, and more importantly, none routinely result in prevention and/or cures. Based on (a) similarities of Johne disease and Crohn disease, (b) a report that Dietzia inhibited growth of MAP under specific culture conditions, and (c) findings that Dietzia when used as a probiotic, (i) was therapeutic for adult bovine paratuberculosis, and (ii) prevented development of disease in MAP-infected calves, the goal of the present investigations was to design protocols that have applicability for IBD patients. Dietzia was found safe for cattle of all ages and for normal and immunodeficient mice. The results strongly warrant clinical evaluation as a probiotic, in combination with/without dexamethasone.},

Conventional therapy and more recently biologic agents, all with varying degrees of drawbacks, have resulted in improved control of these diseases. However, as the incidence and prevalence continue to rise, needs for prevention, permanent remission and cures remain unmet, plus there still remain needs for improved control of symptoms, such as pain and diarrhea.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Manipulation of dietary fibre intake represents a longstanding treatment for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), particularly for those with constipation. Linseeds are often recommended by both clinicians and dietitians as a source of dietary fibre to alleviate symptoms. Recent guidance on the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) advises that linseeds may reduce wind and bloating, although there is limited clinical evidence to support this recommendation. The present pilot study aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of: (i) whole linseeds versus ground linseeds; (ii) whole linseeds versus no linseeds; and (iii) ground linseeds versus no linseeds in the management of IBS symptoms. METHODS: In an open randomised controlled trial, subjects with IBS (n = 40) were allocated to one of three intervention groups: two tablespoons of whole linseeds per day (n = 14), two tablespoons of ground linseeds per day (n = 13) and no linseeds as controls (n = 13). Symptom severity (primary outcome) and bowel habit were assessed before and after a 4-week intervention and statistical differences between the groups were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects completed the present study. Between-group analysis comparing the improvement in symptom severity did not reach statistical significance for whole linseeds (n = 11) versus ground linseeds (n = 11; P = 0.62), whole linseeds versus controls (n = 9; P = 0.12) and ground linseeds versus controls (P = 0.10). There were no significant changes in stool frequency or stool consistency for any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Linseeds may be useful in relief of IBS symptoms. Further research is needed to detect clear differences between the effects of whole and ground linseeds.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Probiotics are increasingly advocated in the management of various gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the current attitudes and prescribing practices of surgeons and gastroenterologists for probiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: A questionnaire was designed to look at the frequency of probiotic prescribing, types of probiotics used, indications for and duration of treatment and clinicians' experiences with probiotic use. A total of 220 questionnaires were mailed to consultant gastroenterologists and surgeons practicing in the UK. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 80.5%, of which 69.5% of respondents said they recommended or prescribed probiotic food supplements to their patients, including 53.4% of surgeons and 80.8% of gastroenterologists (P = 0.00013). The most popular probiotic supplements among surgeons were probiotic-containing yoghurt and drinks (79.5% and 71.8%, respectively), whereas VSL#3 was more popular with gastroenterologists (83.3%). The most popular indications were irritable bowel syndrome (70.7% of prescribers) and pouchitis (67.5% of prescribers). Many respondents prescribed long-term probiotics. Most consultants had been prescribing probiotics for a period of 1 to 5 years. CONCLUSION: Probiotics are popular among gastroenterologists and surgeons in the UK for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Further evidence to support their routine use, by way of large, well-designed randomized controlled trials, is necessary.},

RECENT FINDINGS: In the past number of years, the composition of the microorganisms present in our small intestines has been the subject of greater scrutiny than ever before. These investigations have been possible as a consequence of the development and utilization of new molecular tools which have revolutionized the field of microbial ecology and have focused predominantly on the small intestinal microbiota associated with pediatric celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome and pouchitis. The impact of invasive procedures, such as small bowel transplant, ileostomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis, on the ileal microbiota has also been investigated. SUMMARY: The ever greater appreciation of the link between the small intestinal microbiota and the health status of the host has the potential to lead to the development of new strategies to alter this microbiota in a targeted way to prevent or treat specific disorders.},

   abstract = {The ability of gut microbiota to communicate with the brain and thus modulate behavior is emerging as an exciting concept in health and disease. The enteric microbiota interacts with the host to form essential relationships that govern homeostasis. Despite the unique enteric bacterial fingerprint of each individual, there appears to be a certain balance that confers health benefits. It is, therefore, reasonable to note that a decrease in the desirable gastrointestinal bacteria will lead to deterioration in gastrointestinal, neuroendocrine or immune relationships and ultimately disease. Therefore, studies focusing on the impact of enteric microbiota on the host and in particular on the central nervous system are essential to our understanding of the influence of this system. Recent studies published in this Journal demonstrate that germ-free mice display alterations in stress-responsivity, central neurochemistry and behavior indicative of a reduction in anxiety in comparison to conventional mice. Such data offer the enticing proposition that specific modulation of the enteric microbiota may be a useful strategy for stress-related disorders and for modulating the co-morbid aspects of gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that predominantly affects women and accounts for up to 40% of the gastroenterology unit outpatient visits. The pathophysiology is complex and multifactorial. In the present review we will focus on the role of intestinal dysbiosis in its pathogenesis and treatment. Post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) can put light on the mechanisms underlying IBS. Modified commensal gut flora may lead to mucosal inflammation. Several changes such as an increase in mucosal cellularity (enterochromaffin cells, lamina propria T lymphocytes and mast cells), modified pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine balance and disordered neurotransmission have been observed. The normal microbiota is an essential factor in health. A modification of the flora, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is thought to play a pathogenic role in IBS. Changes in the composition of the luminal and mucosal colonic flora have been linked to IBS. It is not clear however, whether these changes are a cause or a consequence of the syndrome. The comprehension of the interaction between the dysbiotic microbiota and the host will probably lead to the development of focused therapies. Based on these assumptions, treatments modulating the microbiota have been investigated. On the one hand several probiotics have shown a reduction in IBS symptoms by an immunomodulatory and analgesic effects. On the other hand antibiotic treatment has proven efficacy in treating IBS with or without associated SIBO. Due to its complex pathophysiology, treating IBS nowadays implies multiple approaches, one of which may be modulation of the intestinal flora.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by visceral hypersensitivity and altered bowel function. There are increasing evidences suggested that VSL#3 probiotics therapy has been recognized as an effective method to relieve IBS-induced symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of VSL#3 probiotics on visceral hypersensitivity (VH), nitric oxide (NO), fecal character, colonic epithelium permeability, and tight junction protein expression. IBS model was induced by intracolonic instillation of 4% acetic acid and restraint stress in rats. After subsidence of inflammation on the seventh experimental day, the rats were subjected to rectal distension, and then the abdominal withdrawal reflex and the number of fecal output were measured, respectively. Also, colonic permeability to Evans blue was measured in vivo, and tight junction protein expression was studied by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting method. Rats had been pretreated with VSL#3 or aminoguanidine (NOS inhibitor) or VSL#3+ aminoguanidine before measurements. The rats at placebo group showed hypersensitive response to rectal distension (P < 0.05) and defecated more stools than control rats (P < 0.05), whereas VSL#3 treatment significantly attenuated VH and effectively reduced defecation. Aminoguanidine reduced the protective effects of VSL#3 on VH. A pronounced increase in epithelial permeability and decreased expression of tight junction proteins (occludin, ZO-1) in placebo group were prevented by VSL#3, but not aminoguanidine. VSL#3 treatment reduce the hypersensitivity, defecation, colonic permeability and increase the expression of tight junction proteins (occludin, ZO-1). As the part of this effect was lowered by NOS inhibitor, NO might play a role in the protective effect of VSL#3 to some extent.},

   abstract = {AIM: To assess the effects and safety of Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus LCR35 complete freeze-dried culture (LCR35) in patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: A randomized, double-blind pilot study was performed in 50 patients complaining of IBS symptoms complying with Rome III criteria. Patients were allocated to receive either LCR35 (n = 25) at a minimum daily dose of 6 x 10(8) colony forming units or placebo (n = 25) for 4 wk. At inclusion, after treatment and 2 wk later, patients completed the IBS severity scale. Change from baseline in the IBS severity score at the end of treatment was the primary efficacy criterion. Changes were compared between groups in the whole population and in IBS subtypes (IBS with predominance of constipation, IBS with predominance of diarrhoea, mixed IBS, unsubtyped IBS). The presence of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus in stools was investigated at inclusion and at the end of treatment. The gastrointestinal quality of life questionnaire and the hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scale were also completed. RESULTS: Both groups were balanced for baseline characteristics. In 85% of patients, stool analyses showed that lactobacillus casei rhamnosus able to survive in the digestive tract. In the whole population, improvements in the IBS severity score did not differ significantly between treatments with a 25% decrease after 4-wk treatment, and a 15% decrease from baseline 2 wk later in both groups. In IBS subgroups, statistical analysis could not be performed due to small sample size, but a clinical response in favour of LCR35 was observed in IBS patients with predominance of diarrhoea: no change in the symptom severity score was seen with the placebo after 4 wk treatment, whereas a clinically relevant decrease occurred with LCR35 (-37% vs -3%). Furthermore, in spite of an increase in symptom intensity, the IBS severity score was maintained below the baseline value 2 wk later with LCR35 (-19% from baseline), whilst a slight 5% increase from baseline was observed with placebo. In the IBS subgroup with predominance of diarrhoea only, a clinically relevant decrease in abdominal pain severity score (-36%) was observed with LCR35, whereas no change occurred with placebo. In mixed IBS patients, the 20% and 30% decreases in the IBS severity score observed after treatment with LCR35 and placebo, respectively, were maintained 2 wk later in both groups. A clinical response slightly in favour of placebo was observed at the end of the treatment period in IBS patients with predominance of constipation (-41% vs -20%) and unsubtyped IBS patients (-47% vs -17%), with the same value maintained 2 wk later. In both groups, no clinically relevant changes were observed either for the gastrointestinal quality of life index or HAD score. Thus, these results suggest that sub-grouping of IBS patients may be important for optimizing treatment responses by the physician. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that LCR35 could have some efficacy in IBS patients complaining of diarrhoea. These preliminary results need to be confirmed in larger studies.},

   abstract = {Whilst facing a worldwide fast increase of food and environmental allergies, the medical community is also confronted with another inhomogeneous group of environment-associated disabling conditions, including multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, electric hypersensitivity, amalgam disease and others. These share the features of poly-symptomatic multi-organ cutaneous and systemic manifestations, with postulated inherited/acquired impaired metabolism of chemical/physical/nutritional xenobiotics, triggering adverse reactions at exposure levels far below toxicologically-relevant values, often in the absence of clear-cut allergologic and/or immunologic involvement. Due to the lack of proven pathogenic mechanisms generating measurable disease biomarkers, these environmental hypersensitivities are generally ignored by sanitary and social systems, as psychogenic or "medically unexplained symptoms". The uncontrolled application of diagnostic and treatment protocols not corresponding to acceptable levels of validation, safety, and clinical efficacy, to a steadily increasing number of patients demanding assistance, occurs in many countries in the absence of evidence-based guidelines. Here we revise available information supporting the organic nature of these clinical conditions. Following intense research on gene polymorphisms of phase I/II detoxification enzyme genes, so far statistically inconclusive, epigenetic and metabolic factors are under investigation, in particular free radical/antioxidant homeostasis disturbances. The finding of relevant alterations of catalase, glutathione-transferase and peroxidase detoxifying activities significantly correlating with clinical manifestations of MCS, has recently registered some progress towards the identification of reliable biomarkers of disease onset, progression, and treatment outcomes.},

   abstract = {Human biology can only be fully assessed by combining an analysis of both the host and its surrounding environment. As a part of the environment, the human gastrointestinal tract hosts more than 100 trillion bacteria making up the gut microbiota. The human host provides a nutrient-rich environment while the microbiota provides indispensable functions that humans cannot exert themselves. Shifts in the bacterial makeup of the human gut microbiota have been associated with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome and obesity. However, since most bacteria inhabiting our gut are not cultivable to date, until recently little was known about their individual functions. Metagenomics, i.e. the analysis of the collective genomes present in a defined ecosystem, gives insight into these specific functions. The first extensive catalogue of the intestinal metagenome outnumbers the size of the human genome by a factor of 150. Recently, 3 distinct 'types' of gut composition within the human population have been highlighted. These so-called 'enterotypes' are characterized by the dominant genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella and Ruminococcus) and their co-occurring phylogenetic groups. In accordance with the previously described impact of nutritional behavior (diet, probiotics and prebiotics) on specific bacterial populations, an association has been observed between long-term dietary habits and enterotypes. This recent discovery, i.e. that belonging to one or the other enterotype might be modulated by the diet opens up new perspectives in the fields of IBD, nutrition and therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common functional condition and a frequent cause of consultation in gastroenterology. With a multifactorial pathophysiology IBS is characterized by abdominal pain, distension and altered bowel habits. Loperamide, antispasmodics and antidepressants are symptomatic relievers of this disorder. Recently probiotics were incorporated to therapy, and could improve the symptomatology. METHODS: multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial that included IBS patients, diagnosed with Rome III criteria. The patients were given pinaverium bromure and placebo or pinaverium bromure and probiotics for 3 weeks. The intensity of symptoms and the effect of therapy were evaluated with the Francis Score, before and after the treatment. Statistics were done with SPSS 12.0 (C.I 95%). RESULTS: 51 patients were evaluated, with an average age of 43 years old, mostly mestizo, 75% (38) married and 55% (28) female. There were statistical differences in four variables: abdominal pain, intensity of pain, days of pain and total score at the end of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics used as supplement are effective in improving symptomatology of IBS.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is evidence suggesting that intestinal microbiota plays a role in the development of irritable bowel syndrome. Its activity can be indirectly assessed using the lactulose breath test. Antibiotics like rifaximin or probiotics can be used as therapeutic options for patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of a sequential treatment with rifaximin and probiotics in these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated patients with diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome according to Rome III criteria. Included patients had to fill in a questionnaire in order to assess their symptoms severity. A lactulose breath test was also performed in each case and a curve with the results of hydrogen concentration and time was elaborated. Then, the area under the curve was calculated After initial evaluation, patients received a seven-day treatment with rifaximin, followed by a ten-day course of probiotics. Thirty days after completion of treatment a new lactulose breath test along with a questionnaire were performed. RESULTS: We included 15 patients and 93% experienced a significant improvement of their symptoms as well as a significant reduction of the lactulose breath test values. CONCLUSION: Sequential treatment with rifaximin/probiotics seems to be effective for symptom and fermentative profile improvement in irritable bowel syndrome patients.},

   abstract = {There is now an expanding volume of evidence to support the view that commensal organisms within the gut play a role in early programming and later responsivity of the stress system. The gut is inhabited by 10(1)(3)-10(1)(4) micro-organisms, which is ten times the number of cells in the human body and contains 150 times as many genes as our genome. It has long been recognised that gut pathogens such as Escherichia coli, if they enter the gut can activate the HPA. However, animals raised in a germ-free environment show exaggerated HPA responses to psychological stress, which normalises with monocolonisation by certain bacterial species including Bifidobacterium infantis. Moreover, increased evidence suggests that animals treated with probiotics have a blunted HPA response. Stress induces increased permeability of the gut allowing bacteria and bacterial antigens to cross the epithelial barrier and activate a mucosal immune response, which in turn alters the composition of the microbiome and leads to enhanced HPA drive. Increasing data from patients with irritable bowel syndrome and major depression indicate that in these syndromes alteration of the HPA may be induced by increased gut permeability. In the case of irritable bowel syndrome the increased permeability can respond to probiotic therapy. Detailed prospective studies in patients with mood disorders examining the gut microbiota, immune parameters and HPA activity are required to throw further light on this emerging area. It is however clear that the gut microbiota must be taken into account when considering the factors regulating the HPA.},

   abstract = {Inflammation is a hot topic in medical research, because it plays a key role in inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of arthritis, diabetes, heart diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, allergies, asthma, even cancer and many others. Over the past few decades, it was realized that the process of inflammation is virtually the same in different disorders, and a better understanding of inflammation may lead to better treatments for numerous diseases. Inflammation is the activation of the immune system in response to infection, irritation, or injury, with an influx of white blood cells, redness, heat, swelling, pain, and dysfunction of the organs involved. Although the pathophysiological basis of these conditions is not yet fully understood, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have often been implicated in their pathogenesis. In fact, in inflammatory diseases the antioxidant defense system is compromised, as evidenced by increased markers of oxidative stress, and decreased levels of protective antioxidant enzymes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An enriched diet containing antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene and phenolic substances, has been suggested to improve symptoms by reducing disease-related oxidative stress. In this respect, the marine world represents a largely untapped reserve of bioactive ingredients, and considerable potential exists for exploitation of these bioactives as functional food ingredients. Substances such as n-3 oils, carotenoids, vitamins, minerals and peptides provide a myriad of health benefits, including reduction of cardiovascular diseases, anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. New marine bioactives are recently gaining attention, since they could be helpful in combating chronic inflammatory degenerative conditions. The aim of this review is to examine the published studies concerning the potential pharmacological properties and application of many marine bioactives against inflammatory diseases.},

   abstract = {Autism is a heterogeneous group of life-long neurologic problems that begin in childhood. Success in efforts to understand and treat autism has been mostly elusive. The role of autoimmunity in autism has gained recognition both for associated systemic autoimmune disease and the presence of brain autoantibodies in autistic children and their family members. There is an acknowledged genetic susceptibility to autism--most notably allotypes of complement C4. C4 defects are associated with several autoimmune diseases and also confer susceptibility to mycobacterial infections. Mycobacterium avium ss. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes an enteric inflammatory disease in ruminant animals (Johne's disease) and is the putative cause of the very similar Crohn's disease in humans. Humans are widely exposed to MAP in food and water. MAP has been also linked to ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, sarcoidosis, Blau syndrome, autoimmune (Type 1) diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and multiple sclerosis. Environmental agents are thought to trigger autism in the genetically at risk. Molecular mimicry is the proposed mechanism by which MAP is thought to trigger autoantibodies. Autoantibodies to brain myelin basic protein (MBP) is a common feature of autism. This article considers the subset of autoimmunity-related autism patients and postulates that MAP, through molecular mimicry to its heat shock protein HSP65, triggers autism by stimulating antibodies that cross react with myelin basic protein (MBP).},

METHODS: In this double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-designed study, subjects were randomized to daily receive either one capsule of L. plantarum 299v (DSM 9843) or placebo for 4 wk. Frequency and intensity of abdominal pain, bloating and feeling of incomplete rectal emptying were assessed weekly on a visual analogue scale while stool frequency was calculated. RESULTS: Two hundred and fourteen IBS patients were recruited. After 4 wk, both pain severity (0.68 + 0.53 vs 0.92 + 0.57, P < 0.05) and daily frequency (1.01 + 0.77 vs 1.71 + 0.93, P < 0.05) were lower with L. plantarum 299v (DSM 9843) than with placebo. Similar results were obtained for bloating. At week 4, 78.1 % of the patients scored the L. plantarum 299v (DSM 9843) symptomatic effect as excellent or good vs only 8.1 % for placebo (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: A 4-wk treatment with L. plantarum 299v (DSM 9843) provided effective symptom relief, particularly of abdominal pain and bloating, in IBS patients fulfilling the Rome III criteria.},

However, they have not been tested for use in functional gastric disease. We therefore investigated if strains previously shown to protect from response to colorectal distension (CRD) in rats also modulate response to gastric distension (GD). Healthy, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with viable, heat-killed, gamma-irradiated Lactobacillus reuteri or viable Lactobacillus plantarum wild type (WT), L. plantarum Dlt mutant, conditioned medium or medium control (9 d), and subjected to GD under anesthesia using an i.g. Teflon catheter. Effects were measured by heart rate (HR) changes during noxious distension (60 mm Hg) compared to baseline HR values. We also investigated the localization of viable, green fluorescent protein-transfected bacteria in the stomach mucosa. Viable L. reuteri decreased the bradycardia induced by noxious GD compared to placebo controls (P < 0.001). Heat-killed or gamma-irradiated L. reuteri and conditioned medium did not have a protective effect in GD. Viable L. plantarum WT and Dlt mutant, previously shown to be effective antinociceptive agents in CRD, showed no protective effect in GD. All viable bacteria were associated with the pars glandularis of the rat stomach. Thus, we conclude that the antinociceptive mechanisms of action of probiotic bacteria differ between the stomach and the colon. Symptom alleviation cannot be attributed to the localization of the bacteria in the stomach. Information derived from effects of CRD cannot be extrapolated to effects in the stomach, which are likely to be strain and organ specific.},

   abstract = {Most patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) believe that diet plays a significant role in inducing IBS symptoms and desire to know what foods to avoid. It has been found that the intake of calories, carbohydrates, proteins and fat by IBS patients does not differ from that of the background population. IBS patients were found to avoid certain food items that are rich in fermentable oligo-, di- and monosacharides and polyols (FODMAPs), but they did have a high consumption of many other FODMAP-rich food items. The diet of IBS patients was found to consist of a low calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamin B2 and vitamin A content. There is no consistent evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy, nor is there documented evidence that food intolerance plays a role in IBS symptoms. Abnormalities in gut hormones have been reported in IBS patients. As gut hormones control and regulate gastrointestinal motility and sensation, this may explain the abnormal gastrointestinal motility and visceral hypersensitivity reported in these patients. Guidance concerning food management which includes individually based restrictions of FODMAP-rich food items and individual evaluation of the effects of protein-, fat- and carbohydrate-rich/poor diets may reduce IBS symptoms.},

   abstract = {The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is among the most common disorders in gastroenterological practice with a prevalence of approx. 12 % in Germany, and it is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, altered stool frequency and consistency, and meteorism and bloating. There is currently no agreement between those seeing patients with IBS (general practitioner, gastroenterologist, psychosomatics) on the criteria for clinical diagnosis. Metaanalyses of treatment studies in IBS have shown that probiotics have a high clinical efficacy in IBS, especially since development of novel pharmaceutical compounds have not reached the market or have been withdrawn. In addition to the actual status of probiotic efficacy in IBS studies conducted worldwide, we present 3 German clinical studies with probiotic E.COLI preparations that have proven their efficacy in IBS in adults and in children.},

Although patients with IBS self-report food allergies more often than the general population, the evidence suggests that true food allergies are relatively uncommon. Less clearly defined food intolerances may be an important contributor to symptoms in IBS patients.

   abstract = {The gut flora carries out important functions for human health, although most of them are still unknown, and an alteration of any of them, due to a condition of dysbiosis, can lead to relevant pathological implications. Commensal bacteria in the gut are essential for the preservation of the integrity of the mucosal barrier function and an alteration in the anatomic functional integrity of this barrier has been implicated in the pathophysiologic process of different diseases. The gut microflora plays a role in modulating the intestinal immune system; in fact, it is essential for the maturation of gut-associated lymphatic tissue, the secretion of IgA and the production of antimicrobial peptides. The enteric flora represents a potent bioreactor which controls several metabolic functions, even if most of them are still unknown. The main metabolic functions are represented by the fermentation of indigestible food substances into simple sugars, absorbable nutrients, and short-chain fatty acids. Furthermore, the gut microbiota exerts important trophic and developmental functions on the intestinal mucosa. This overview focuses briefly on the physiological role of the gut microbiota in maintaining a healthy state and the potential role played by disturbances of both the function and composition of the gut microbiota in determining important pathological conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and cancer.},

She was taking Arthrotec (a combination of diclofenac and misoprostol - for pain and inflammation), Fosamax Plus D (alendronate with vitamin D3 - recently prescribed because of low bone density), and Catapres (clonidine - for menopausal symptoms). Against the advice of her rheumatologist, she had recently discontinued taking Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine), methotrexate, and prednisone due to significant side effects. Lab tests to identify underlying imbalances and to direct treatment were ordered. Treatment included dietary, nutritional, hormonal, and mind/body support. After one year of therapy, the patient experienced improvement with all of her presenting conditions and symptoms, which enabled her to discontinue several medications. She became versed in identifying and avoiding the environmental triggers of her disease, including foods (dairy, wheat, eggs, and soy), molds, and emotional stress. Antinuclear antibodies were normalized. She experienced a 7.5-percent improvement in left trochanteric bone density - comparable to bisphosphonate therapy. Mild improvements were also noted in the spine and bilateral femoral neck.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) varies depending on the criteria used to diagnose it, but it ranges from about 5% to 20%. IBS is associated with abnormal gastrointestinal motor function and enhanced visceral perception, as well as psychosocial and genetic factors. People with IBS often have other bodily and psychiatric symptoms, and have an increased likelihood of having unnecessary surgery compared with people without IBS. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with IBS? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 27 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: 5HT(3) receptor antagonists (alosetron and ramosetron), 5HT(4) receptor agonists (tegaserod), antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]), antispasmodics (including peppermint oil), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), hypnotherapy, loperamide, and soluble and insoluble fibre supplementation.},

   abstract = {Enterococci belong to the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and they are of importance in foods due to their involvement in food spoilage and fermentations, as well as their utilisation as probiotics in humans and slaughter animals. However, they are also important nosocomial pathogens that cause bacteraemia, endocarditis and other infections. Some strains are resistant to many antibiotics and possess virulence factors such as adhesins, invasins, pili and haemolysin. The role of enterococci in disease has raised questions on their safety for use in foods or as probiotics. Studies on the incidence of virulence traits among enterococcal strains isolated from food showed that some can harbour virulence traits, but it is also thought that virulence is not the result of the presence of specific virulence determinants alone, but is rather a more intricate process. Specific genetic lineages of hospital-adapted strains have emerged, such as E. faecium clonal complex (CC) 17 and E. faecalis CC2, CC9, CC28 and CC40, which are high risk enterococcal clonal complexes. These are characterised by the presence of antibiotic resistance determinants and/or virulence factors, often located on pathogenicity islands or plasmids. Mobile genetic elements thus are considered to play a major role in the establishment of problematic lineages. Although enterococci occur in high numbers in certain types of fermented cheeses and sausages, they are not deliberately added as starter cultures. Some E. faecium and E. faecalis strains are used as probiotics and are ingested in high numbers, generally in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. Such probiotics are administered to treat diarrhoea, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea or irritable bowel syndrome, to lower cholesterol levels or to improve host immunity. In animals, enterococcal probiotics are mainly used to treat or prevent diarrhoea, for immune stimulation or to improve growth. From a food microbiological point of view, the safety of the bacteria used as probiotics must be assured, and data on the major strains in use so far indicate that they are safe. The advantage of use of probiotics in slaughter animals, from a food microbiological point of view, lies in the reduction of zoonotic pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract of animals which prevents the transmission of these pathogens via food. The use of enterococcal probiotics should, in view of the development of problematic lineages and the potential for gene transfer in the gastrointestinal tract of both humans and animals, be carefully monitored, and the advantages of using these and new strains should be considered in a well contemplated risk/benefit analysis.},

Nearly 90% of patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) report sensitivities to a wide variety of dietary comestibles. Current questionnaire-based literature suggests that citrus fruits, tomatoes, vitamin C, artificial sweeteners, coffee, tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, and spicy foods tend to exacerbate symptoms, while calcium glycerophosphate and sodium bicarbonate tend to improve symptoms. At present we recommend employing a controlled method to determine dietary sensitivities, such as an elimination diet, in order to identify sensitivities while at the same time maintain optimal nutritional intake. We review current literature with regard to diet's effect upon IC/BPS and common comorbidities (irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, neuropathic pain, vulvodynia, and headache) with a focus upon questionnaire-based investigations. We discuss the pathologic mechanisms that may link diet and IC/BPS related-pain, concentrating upon specific comestibles such as acidic foods, foods high in potassium, caffeine, and alcohol. Up to 90% of patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) report sensitivities to a wide variety of comestibles. Pathological mechanisms suggested to be responsible for the relationship between dietary intake and symptom exacerbation include peripheral and/or central neural upregulation, bladder epithelial dysfunction, and organ 'cross-talk', amongst others. Current questionnaire-based data suggests that citrus fruits, tomatoes, vitamin C, artificial sweeteners, coffee, tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, and spicy foods tend to exacerbate symptoms, while calcium glycerophosphate and sodium bicarbonate tend to improve symptoms. Specific comestible sensitivities varied between patients and may have been influenced by comorbid conditions. This suggests that a controlled method to determine dietary sensitivities, such as an elimination diet, may play an important role in patient management.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequent and invalidating functional bowel disorder with entangled mechanisms. Its therapeutic approach is therefore complex. Classical therapies, prescribed alone or in combination in light of the predominant symptom, consist of antispasmodics, fibers, laxatives, antidiarrheals, and psychotropic agents. Other emerging pharmacological therapies, such as prokinetics, prosecretory or serotoninergic agents, bile acid modulators and antibiotics have been recently studied in clinical trials. Dietary measures can include reduction of short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates (FODMAPs) and gluten restriction. Assessment of food allergy can be proposed in a subgroup of IBS patients. Complementary and alternative medicine therapies, that are generally low cost and safe, appear to be appreciated by patients. Probiotics have demonstrated action on the gut microbiote modulation, and may be helpful in a subset of patients. Peppermint oil has an established visceral analgesic effect. Hypnotherapy represents an original, global and effective approach. Finally, education, reassurance and listening to the patient, leading to a solid therapeutic relationship, represents an essential backdrop of remedy or diet effectiveness.},

The human gut harbours a huge microbial ecosystem, which is equipped to perform a variety of functions such as digestion of food, metabolism of drugs, detoxification of toxic compounds, production of essential vitamins, prevention of attachment of pathogenic bacteria to the gut wall, and maintenance of homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract. A subset of patients with IBS may have a quantitative increase in bacteria in the small bowel (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth). Qualitative changes in gut microbiota have also been associated with IBS. Targeting the gut microbiota using probiotics and antibiotics has emerged as a potentially effective approach to the treatment of this, hitherto enigmatic, functional bowel disorder. The gut microbiota in health, quantitative and qualitative microbiota changes, and therapeutic manipulations targeting the microbiota in patients with IBS are reviewed in this paper.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Food-related symptoms are commonly described by patients with functional bowel disorders, but dietary change as an evidence-based therapy has not been part of routine management strategies. This reviews aims to discuss strategies commonly applied. METHOD: Published literature was reviewed. RESULTS: Traditional approaches involve elimination diets followed by placebo-controlled reintroduction of specific foods, which is tedious at best and not applied in routine practice. Pathogenically-based approaches include determining what food components are inducing food hypersensitivity responses using specific biomarkers, but this is probably applicable to a small proportion of patients only and has met with only limited success. Food bioactive chemicals, such as salicylates, have been targeted, but there is a paucity of quality evidence for or against this approach. In contrast, targeting poorly absorbed dietary components that might induce luminal distension via osmotic effects and rapid fermentation (FODMAPs) has been successful and the efficacy of the dietitian-delivered low FODMAP diet is now supported by high quality evidence. Improvement of all symptoms of FBD in three out of four patients has been achieved. The diet may potentially improve stool frequency in patients with an ileal pouch or a high output ileostomy, or functional symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. FODMAPs in enteral formulas may also be responsible for diarrhoea induced by enteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Dietary restriction of FODMAPs is an effective therapy in the majority of patients with functional bowel symptoms and, provided dietitians are trained in the technique, should be first line therapy.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are live microbial organisms that are present in foods or dietary supplements and that confer health benefits to the host when ingested in sufficient quantities. Probiotics can be bacterial (e.g. Bifidobacteria spp. and Lactobacillus spp.) or yeasts (e.g. Saccharomyces boulardii). The administration of probiotics is often believed to be by and large beneficial for individuals with inflammatory or infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. These positive effects are generally attributed to the ability of probiotics to regulate intestinal permeability, normalize host intestinal flora, improve gut immune barrier function, and equilibrate the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Of note, however, these claims are not always substantiated by findings from properly conducted clinical trials. Of particular importance, even when results from randomized controlled trials support the beneficial effects of a particular probiotic for a specific indication, the benefits achieved by the probiotic are generally not translatable to other probiotic formulations. This review discusses the gastrointestinal indications for probiotic use and describes the level of evidence that supports the use of specific probiotics for these indications. Several indications are addressed, including enteric infections, gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, necrotizing enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {There is an undeniable link between gastrointestinal disorders and malnutrition. Chronic diarrhoea is one of the most common gastrointestinal conditions that can impact a patient's nutritional status. The nutritional consequences will depend on the cause of the diarrhoea as well as the location and extent of gastrointestinal involvement. In general, malabsorption plays a central role in the interaction between malnutrition and chronic diarrhoea. Malabsorption can result in both nutritional deficits and diarrhoea. With severe malnutrition, chronic diarrhoea can persist due to impaired immune function and poor mucosal recovery. Food intolerance and an inappropriate diet in the setting of malabsorption may also contribute to chronic diarrhoea. Patients may attribute their gastrointestinal symptoms to specific dietary intake, which can lead to self-imposed indiscriminate dietary restrictions. Therefore, disease-specific treatment in conjunction with appropriate nutritional counselling and intervention is recommended in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in patients with chronic diarrhoea. Specialized nutritional support through enteral or parenteral administration may be required to treat severe caloric and micronutrient deficiencies. In this review, we aim to summarize the mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment of the nutritional consequences of chronic diarrhoea.},

   abstract = {This article describes changes in the basic digestive functions (motility, secretion, intraluminal digestion, absorption) that occur during aging. Elderly individuals frequently have oropharyngeal muscle dysmotility and altered swallowing of food. Reductions in esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressures are also more common in the aged and may cause gastroesophageal reflux. Gastric motility and emptying and small bowel motility are generally normal in elderly subjects, although delayed motility and gastric emptying have been reported in some cases. The propulsive motility of the colon is also decreased, and this alteration is associated with neurological and endocrine-paracrine changes in the colonic wall. Decreased gastric secretions (acid, pepsin) and impairment of the mucous-bicarbonate barrier are frequently described in the elderly and may lead to gastric ulcer. Exocrine pancreatic secretion is often decreased, as is the bile salt content of bile. These changes represent the underlying mechanisms of symptomatic gastrointestinal dysfunctions in the elderly, such as dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, primary dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, primary constipation, maldigestion, and reduced absorption of nutrients. Therapeutic management of these conditions is also described. The authors also review the gastrointestinal diseases that are more common in the elderly, such as atrophic gastritis, gastric ulcer, colon diverticulosis, malignant tumors, gallstones, chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, Hepato Cellular Carcinoma (HCC), and chronic pancreatitis.},

   abstract = {The effects of antidepressants on the gastrointestinal tract may contribute to their potential efficacy in functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome; buspirone, a prototype 5-HT1A agonist, enhances gastric accommodation and reduces postprandial symptoms in response to a challenge meal. Paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, accelerates small bowel but not colonic transit, and this property may not be relevant to improve gut function in functional gastrointestinal disorders. Venlafaxine, a prototype serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, enhances gastric accommodation, increases colonic compliance and reduces sensations to distension; however, it is associated with adverse effects that reduce its applicability in treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Tricyclic antidepressants reduce sensations in response to food, including nausea, and delay gastric emptying, especially in females. Buspirone appears efficacious in functional dyspepsia; amitriptyline was not efficacious in a large trial of children with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Clinical trials of antidepressants for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome are generally small. The recommendations of efficacy and number needed to treat from meta-analyses are suspect, and more prospective trials are needed in patients without diagnosed psychiatric diseases. Antidepressants appear to be more effective in the treatment of patients with anxiety or depression, but larger prospective trials assessing both clinical and pharmacodynamic effects on gut sensorimotor function are needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that an imbalance of the intestinal microbiota and a dysfunctional intestinal barrier might trigger irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). As probiotics have been reported to restore the intestinal microbiota and the gut barrier, the therapeutic potential of probiotics within IBS became of strong interest. AIM: To assess the efficacy of Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75 in IBS. METHODS: A total of 122 patients were randomised to receive either placebo (N=62) or MIMBb75 (N=60) once a day for 4 weeks. The severity of IBS symptoms was recorded daily on a 7-point Likert scale. RESULTS: MIMBb75 significantly reduced the global assessment of IBS symptoms by -0.88 points (95% CI: -1.07; -0.69) when compared with only -0.16 (95% CI: -0.32; 0.00) points in the placebo group (P<0.0001). MIMBb75 also significantly improved the IBS symptoms pain/discomfort, distension/bloating, urgency and digestive disorder. The evaluation of the SF12 sum scores showed a significant gain in quality of life within the bifidobacteria group. Furthermore, adequate relief was reported by 47% of the patients in the bifidobacteria and only by 11% of the patients in the placebo group (P<0.0001). Overall responder rates were 57% in the bifidobacteria group but only 21% in the placebo group (P=0.0001). MIMBb75 was well tolerated and adverse events were not different from placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75 effectively alleviates global IBS and improves IBS symptoms simultaneously with an improvement of quality of life. Considering the high efficacy of MIMBb75 in IBS along with the good side-effect profile, MIMBb75 is a promising candidate for IBS therapy.},

METHODS: Specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against 14 common food antigens in the serum were measured in 77 patients with D-IBS and 26 healthy controls. Food-specific IgG antibodies were identified in 39 (50.65%) patients with D-IBS patients compared with four (15.38%) controls. For 12 weeks following the serological testing, 35 patients with D-IBS and food intolerance consumed diets that excluded the identified food. Changes in the main symptoms of D-IBS were evaluated before treatment and regularly during treatment in these patients. RESULTS: After 4 weeks' dietary therapy, most symptoms of D-IBS had improved. By 12 weeks, all symptom scores had decreased significantly compared with the baseline scores. CONCLUSIONS: The 12-week specific-food exclusion diets resulted in significant improvements in abdominal pain (bloating level and frequency), diarrhoea frequency, abdominal distension, stool shape, general feelings of distress and total symptom score compared with baseline in patients with D-IBS.},

   abstract = {Although much has been published about curcumin, which is obtained from turmeric, comparatively little is known about turmeric itself. Turmeric, a golden spice obtained from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa, has been used to give color and taste to food preparations since ancient times. Traditionally, this spice has been used in Ayurveda and folk medicine for the treatment of such ailments as gynecological problems, gastric problems, hepatic disorders, infectious diseases, and blood disorders. Modern science has provided the scientific basis for the use of turmeric against such disorders. Various chemical constituents have been isolated from this spice, including polyphenols, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenoids, sterols, and alkaloids. Curcumin, which constitutes 2-5% of turmeric, is perhaps the most-studied component. Although some of the activities of turmeric can be mimicked by curcumin, other activities are curcumin-independent. Cell-based studies have demonstrated the potential of turmeric as an antimicrobial, insecticidal, larvicidal, antimutagenic, radioprotector, and anticancer agent. Numerous animal studies have shown the potential of this spice against proinflammatory diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, depression, diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis. At the molecular level, this spice has been shown to modulate numerous cell-signaling pathways. In clinical trials, turmeric has shown efficacy against numerous human ailments including lupus nephritis, cancer, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, acne, and fibrosis. Thus, a spice originally common in the kitchen is now exhibiting activities in the clinic. In this review, we discuss the chemical constituents of turmeric, its biological activities, its molecular targets, and its potential in the clinic.},

   abstract = {There is growing evidence that many aspects of our lifestyle and the environment we now live in contribute to the development of disease. The luminal digestive tract is a clear target of the influence of dietary components, alcohol, microbial organisms, and other ingested materials. External factors including obesity, lack of physical exercise, and tobacco consumption also impact diseases of the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A growing understanding of the microbiome which forms an integral part of the human organism indicates that this is another important external force that impacts human health and disease. The luminal GI tract conditions that arise, at least in part, from these external factors range from malignancies (squamous cell esophageal cancer, Barrett's esophagus and associated esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer), idiopathic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases, and post-infectious syndromes including post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome, post-infectious dyspepsia and other functional GI disorders. Of particular interest, given their increase in prevalence in much of the world, are immune-mediated conditions in which food antigens are the driving force behind disease development. These entities include celiac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and food allergies. Celiac disease is a prime example of a condition mediated by dietary factors whose pathogenesis has only recently been determined, providing opportunities for developing treatment options beyond the gluten-free diet. While a genetic basis for this disease clearly exists, it is believed that environmental factors such as an increase in gluten in the human diet account for its rising prevalence, now roughly 1% of genetically susceptible populations in all continents. Proposed therapeutic strategies span from preventing disease by modulating the time of gluten introduction in infants, to reducing exposure to gluten by developing strains of wheat with lower levels of gluten, degrading ingested gluten peptides within the intestinal lumen via endopeptidases or modulating uptake of these peptides across intestinal tight junctions. Other novel treatments in development focus on interfering with the immune events that lead to disease once gluten accesses the lamina propria including altering the immune milieu from a Th1-predominant response via hookworm infection, inhibiting tissue transglutaminase, and blocking antigen presentation and/or T-cell responses to gluten peptides. While new treatment options for celiac disease reflect the complex interaction of diet, genetic factors and the host immune response, the implications for treatment of many conditions of the large and small intestine that arise from environmental and lifestyle are as basic as ensuring adequate nutrition, regular exercise and cessation of tobacco use. Much more needs to be learned about the microbiome, dietary and other factors and their interaction with the human host in order to develop potential new treatment strategies for diseases that result from the environment and lifestyle.},

   abstract = {Gastric emptying is the first step in the metabolic endocrine cascade that takes place after food intake. The incretin hormones originating in the gut, particularly GLP-1, exert multiple antihyperglycaemic actions such as enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppression of glucagon secretion, slowing of gastric emptying with an ensuing decrease in food intake and weight loss. From extensive studies in experimental animals and humans we have found that GLP-1 also exerts a motility-inhibiting and antispasmodic effect in the gut that was verified in healthy volunteers and patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In order to further investigate the effect of GLP-1 in humans, we used the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV resistant GLP-1 analogue ROSE-010, thereby extending its biological activity. A randomized, double-blinded, prospective clinical trial was carried out in order to investigate the effect of two doses of ROSE-010 in 166 patients suffering from pain attacks of IBS. We found that injections of ROSE-010 were twice as effective as placebo in terms of total pain relief response in those affected by pain attacks due to IBS. Our results show that basal physiological research studies can be translated into clinical use. The current pharmaceutical incentive with incretin mimetics, such as GLP-1 analogues and exenatide, is an interesting development that apart from its obvious use in diabetes type 2, may also be useful in terms of gut motility-regulating effects with effects on appetite, food intake and motility disorders that may provide an opportunity to bring about new improvements in medical care.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Symptoms of functional dyspepsia (FD) are highly prevalent in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the effects of therapeutic agents for IBS on the pathophysiology of FD are unclear. In this study, therefore, we examined the effects of ramosetron, a serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, on corticotropin releasing factor (CRF)- and soybean oil-induced delays in gastric emptying of rats, in comparison with anti-diarrheal agent and spasmolytics. The involvement of 5-HT and the 5-HT(3) receptor in delayed gastric emptying was also evaluated. METHODS: Corticotropin releasing factor was administered intravenously to rats 10min before oral administration of 0.05% phenol red solution, and the amount remaining in the stomach was measured after 30min. Soybean oil was administered orally with glass beads, and the number of residual beads in the stomach was counted 1h later. RESULTS: Both CRF and soybean oil inhibited gastric emptying dose-dependently. Ramosetron and itopride, a gastro-prokinetic agent, significantly reduced both CRF- and soybean oil-induced delays in gastric emptying, while an anti-diarrheal agent and spasmolytics aggravated them. Pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine for 2days to reduced the synthesis of endogenous 5-HT diminished the effects of both CRF and soybean oil on gastric emptying. A 5-HT(3) receptor agonist m-chlorophenylbiguanide suppressed gastric emptying of both phenol red and glass beads, and those effects were reversed by ramosetron. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CRF and soybean oil suppress gastric emptying in rats by activating 5-HT(3) receptors, and that by antagonizing these receptors, ramosetron may ameliorate symptoms of FD in clinical settings.},

   abstract = {European bison, the largest mammal in Europe, after being exterminated in the wild and then restored during the 20th century is still listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species) as a species vulnerable to extinction. However, the increasing number of European bison, through creation of new and expansion of existing populations strongly increases the risk of human-bison conflict in the near future. We analyzed the depredation of farm crops by bison and the factors influencing the level of damage in the vicinity of two forest areas inhabited by bison in northeastern Poland. Between 2000 and 2010, the total cost of compensation was <euro> 196,200. The level of damage and amount of compensation was increasing from year to year in both forests and correlated with the number of bison. The majority of damage (57 % of cases) was recorded in winter (December-March). Snow depth and temperature did not influence the frequency of damage. The incidences of damage increased with decreasing distance from the woodland patches, therefore, 69 % of cases in Bialowieza Forest, and 80 % in Knyszyn Forest were recorded closer than 0.5 km from nearest woodland patch. The majority of the crops damaged by bison were cereals (61 %) but also hay (20 %) and rape (13 %). When compared to the availability of crops, bison strongly selected rape and rye in both regions. This study is the first addressing the increasing problem of human-bison conflict in re-introduced populations and analyzing long-term data on crop depredation. Such situations probably occur in the majority of growing and expanding bison populations, however, it has not yet to be monitored and is rather neglected in post-Soviet countries.},

   abstract = {GOALS: This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of probiotics on adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) through clinical parameters and H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics. BACKGROUND: As systematic effect of probiotics on inflammatory bowel disease through metabonomics approach has been extensively studied to date, metabonomic characterization of the probiotics effect on IBS is also needed for better understanding the effect with respect to host metabolic mechanism. STUDY: Seventy-four IBS patients meeting Rome criteria were randomized to receive probiotics and placebo through a parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study. Probiotic fermented milk and placebo were administered 3 times daily for 8 weeks. Improvements of IBS were assessed according to Rome III questionnaires and H NMR metabolic profiling of serum and fecal samples from all participants was used to characterize a significant change in serum and fecal metabolome before and after probiotics. RESULTS: Fecal counts of the Lactobacilli, but not Bifidobacteria species, which included in the probiotic milk, were increased significantly in feces of IBS patients receiving treatment (P=0.014). NMR data set coupled with multivariate statistical analysis identified intrinsically elevated serum levels of glucose (P=0.0265) and tyrosine (P=0.0016) in IBS patients. These levels normalized to those of healthy individuals in the probiotic administration group, but not the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This metabonomic study suggests that in a subset of IBS patients there exists a potential dysregulation in energy homeostasis (serum glucose) and liver function (serum tyrosine) that may be improved through probiotics supplementation. Moreover, global metabolic profiling highlights the potential of metabonomic approach for assessing bowel diseases or symptoms with respect to host metabolic perturbation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms are quite common among the general population, but different survey methods show different epidemiology, and the effect of psychosocial and behavioral factors on the symptoms have been studied mainly by the subgroup The aims of this studies are; 1: to clarify the difference of the survey methods on the epidemiology of FGID symptoms, 2: correlation with psycho-behavioral background in symptomatic subjects. METHODS: Questionnaires focused on GI symptoms and psycho-behavioral background were generated. Questionnaires were sent via e-mail and postal mail to the members of the registered panel. RESULTS: A total of 2125 and 11,020 responses were recovered from electronic survey and postal survey. Significant difference in the prevalence of GI symptoms, 47% in electronic survey and 25% in postal survey, were observed. Despite the difference in the prevalence, the proportions of symptom subtypes and the patterns of the overlaps were similar in the two methods. In the analysis of the effect of psycho-behavioral factors, this study showed that those who have higher level of psycho-behavioral problem had higher prevalence of GERD, FD and IBS symptoms. Those who have impairment in the wellness sensation such as good eating, good bowel movement and good sleep showed higher prevalence of each symptom. Those who prefer unhealthier food have higher prevalence of GI symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that psycho-behavioral conditions may affect the development of functional GI symptoms regardless of the subtypes of GI symptoms, and may explain the high proportion of overlap in the subtypes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A lack of reliable treatments for abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders prompts interest in new therapies. AIM: To evaluate systematically the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for treating abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders in children. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, trial registries and proceedings of major meetings were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating LGG supplementation in children with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders based on the Rome II or Rome III criteria. Risk of bias was assessed for generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding and follow-up. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, LGG supplementation was associated with a significantly higher rate of treatment responders (defined as no pain or a decrease in pain intensity) in the overall population with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (three RCTs, n = 290; risk ratio, RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08-1.59, number needed to treat, NNT 7, 95% CI 4-22) and in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subgroup (three RCTs, n = 167; RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.27-2.27, NNT 4, 95% CI 3-8). However, no difference was found in the rate of treatment responders between children with functional abdominal pain or functional dyspepsia who received placebo or LGG. The intensity of pain was significantly reduced in the overall study population and in the IBS subgroup. The frequency of pain was significantly reduced in the IBS subgroup only. CONCLUSION: The use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG moderately increases treatment success in children with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders, particularly among children with IBS.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal (GI) tract disorder with significant disability and a considerable financial burden to health service due to the consumption of resources including investigations, physician time, and cost of treatment. Despite availability of multiple treatment options, there is still poor functional recovery. AREAS COVERED: Probiotics has been investigated as a promising treatment for IBS, and have demonstrated beneficial effects in some patients. There are many clinical trials investigating the therapeutic benefits of probiotics in IBS but most of them are heterogenic in terms of dose or species used and clinical endpoints. However, recent major meta-analyses revealed benefits of probiotics in patients with IBS. Inhibition of binding of pathogenic bacteria to intestinal epithelial cells, enhancing barrier function of intestinal epithelial, acidification of the colon, suppression of the growth of pathogens, modulation of immunity, inhibition of visceral hypersensitivity, alteration in mucosal response to stress, and improvement of bowel dysmotility are among mechanisms that probiotics may act. Most commonly used probiotics come from the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus but other species are in trial. EXPERT OPINION: Although further studies are still needed, current evidences are almost enough to convince experts that probiotics are efficient in the treatment of IBS.},

   abstract = {Making dietary changes such as increasing fiber intake is recommended for the management of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Few studies have explored the efficacy of education on compliance with recommendations such as increasing fiber, vegetable, and fruit intake in adults with irritable bowel syndrome. This study examined the effect of a multicomponent self-management intervention that included strategies to enhance fiber, vegetable, and fruit intake. Participants with medically diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome were randomized to usual care or individualized comprehensive self-management, delivered either in-person or by telephone. Since previously published analyses show the two delivery modes to be equally effective, the two intervention groups were combined. Of the 188 individuals randomized, 173 participants (113 in the self-management group and 60 in the usual care group; 23 men, 150 women) provided data on at least one of the three follow-up occasions (3, 6, and 12 months postrandomization). Fiber, vegetable, and fruit intakes were measured using the Food Frequency Questionnaire. Participants in the intervention group demonstrated increases (p < .05) in fiber and fruit intake and a trend in vegetable intake at 6 and 12 months postintervention. Improvement in dietary fiber intake following a self-management intervention for IBS continues to 1 year.},

Probiotic organisms may produce beneficial effects in these patients by reducing visceral hypersensitivity. AIM: To investigate the effects of the probiotic organism, Bifidobacterium infantis 35624, on post-inflammatory visceral hypersensitivity in rats. METHODS: Colitis was induced using intracolonic administration of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; control rats received saline (day 0). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels and colonic damage scores were determined. From days 15-29, rats (n = 10/group) rats were orally dosed with 2 ml of B. infantis >/= 10(8) colony-forming units/ml or vehicle (MRS broth). A second series of rats (n = 10/group) was dosed in the same manner from days 15-59. The level of colonic stimulation during colorectal distension (CRD) was determined by recording a visceromotor response (VMR) to CRD at 30 mmHg pre- and post-treatment. Post-treatment samples of colonic tissue were weighed, graded for morphologic damage, and assayed for MPO levels. RESULTS: All rats were hypersensitive at day 15. On day 30, hypersensitivity to colorectal distension remained in the vehicle group, but was significantly reduced in the B. infantis group (mean VMR/10 min: vehicle = 15.4 +/- 1.0 vs. B. infantis = 7.6 +/- 1.0, p < 0.001). A similar, significant effect was observed at day 60. On both day 30 and day 60, tissue weight, colonic damage scores, and MPO levels resembled those of control animals. CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 normalized sensitivity to colorectal distension in a rat model of post-inflammatory colonic hypersensitivity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aims were: firstly, to review the definition and diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C, a subtype of IBS); secondly, to critically assess current therapies for IBS-C with a focus on effectiveness for abdominal pain; and thirdly, to review clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of linaclotide, a therapy recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with IBS-C and chronic idiopathic constipation and the European Medicines Agency for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe IBS-C in adults, and in development for treatment of IBS-C worldwide. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed to summarize IBS-C and current treatments. MEDLINE and gastrointestinal society congress proceedings were searched to identify data from linaclotide clinical studies in adults with IBS-C published between January 2010 and August 2012. RESULTS: IBS-C patients have chronic, relapsing symptoms. Rome III diagnostic criteria define the presence of chronic abdominal pain that improves with defecation and has onset associated with changes in stool frequency or form as a key element of IBS-C and other IBS subtypes. IBS-C patients generally are not completely satisfied with existing therapies. A therapy that treats bowel and abdominal symptoms effectively and can be taken safely on a chronic basis is a current unmet need for IBS-C patients. The guanylate cyclase-C agonist linaclotide has been shown to reduce visceral hypersensitivity in preclinical studies and to improve abdominal pain and constipation symptoms in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of IBS-C patients. CONCLUSIONS: IBS-C is a functional gastrointestinal disorder with chronic, relapsing abdominal and constipation symptoms. By virtue of its effects in relieving abdominal pain by reducing visceral hypersensitivity and improving constipation symptoms by increasing intestinal secretion and accelerating transit, linaclotide may be uniquely positioned for a role in the management of IBS-C patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is prevalent in general population. This study investigates the prevalence of IBS in medical college students in Korea as well as the influence of dietary habits and nutritional intake on IBS. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study of 319 students (239 males and 80 females, age 22.3 +/- 2.5 years) from the 6 grade levels of the Medical College in Korea. All students filled out a self-reported questionnaire for ROME III criteria. They also completed a questionnaire to validate dietary habits and food frequency in Korean. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of IBS was 29.2% without correlation to age, body mass index and grade level in Medical School. However, the prevalence was significantly higher in females than males (33/80 vs 60/239, P = 0.007). There were no significant differences between the IBS-group and the non-IBS group in aspect of nutrition. Not only the diet habits, but also the daily nutritional intake, and even the breakdown into the 12 micronutrients, yielded no significant differences between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-nine percent of the medical college students have IBS with a greater prevalence in females. The dietary habits and nutritional intake of the students might not be associated with IBS.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common health issue that is characterized by abdominal pain, abnormal bowel movements, and altered visceral perception. The complexity and variability in symptoms pose serious challenges in treating IBS. Current therapy for IBS is primarily focused on reducing the abdominal pain, thereby improving the quality of life to a significant extent. Although the use of fiber rich diet is widely recommended in treating IBS, some studies have questioned its use. Intra-colonic butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, is primarily produced by the fermentation of dietary fibers in the colon. In the existing literature there are conflicting reports about the function of butyrate. In rats it is known to induce visceral hypersensitivity without altered pathology, whereas in humans it has been reported to reduce visceral pain. Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for this contrasting effect of butyrate is important before recommending fiber rich diet to IBS patients.},

The question arises whether exposure to these drugs is associated with the development of IBS symptoms. Aim of this study was therefore to assess the use of PPIs and NSAIDs in patients with IBS versus controls. METHODS: Cases of IBS from the last 5 years were reviewed. All patients having had at least one prescription for a particular drug (PPIs, NSAIDs, SSRIs, diuretics, ACE inhibitors) in the 6 months prior to the time of initial symptom onset were considered exposed. The control group consisted of individuals randomly selected from the general population. RESULTS: 287 cases of IBS were retrieved for analysis together with 287 age and sex-matched controls. Exposure to PPIs and NSAIDs was significantly higher in IBS patients, whereas no association between ACE inhibitor use and IBS was found. PPIs were not significantly associated when excluding patients with gastrointestinal reflux disease or functional dyspepsia. Exposure to SSRIs was also positively associated with IBS, but only when patients with psychiatric comorbidity were included in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Medications that may alter intestinal homeostasis such as NSAIDs and PPIs were more frequently used in IBS patients compared to controls. This association might be relevant for everyday clinical practice, but it is remains to be elucidated whether this association is of etiological nature.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder, characterized by recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort in combination with disturbed bowel habits in the absence of identifiable organic cause. Visceral hypersensitivity has emerged as a key hypothesis in explaining the painful symptoms in IBS and has been proposed as a "biological hallmark" for the condition. Current techniques of assessing visceral perception include the computerized barostat using rectal distensions, registering responses induced by sensory stimuli including the flexor reflex and cerebral evoked potentials, as well as brain imaging modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. These methods have provided further insight into alterations in pain processing in IBS, although the most optimal method and condition remain to be established. In an attempt to give an overview of these methods, a literature search in the electronic databases PubMed and MEDLINE was executed using the search terms "assessment of visceral pain/visceral nociception/visceral hypersensitivity" and "irritable bowel syndrome." Both original articles and review articles were considered for data extraction. This review aims to discuss currently used modalities in assessing visceral perception, along with advantages and limitations, and aims also to define future directions for methodological aspects in visceral pain research. Although novel paradigms such as brain imaging and neurophysiological recordings have been introduced in the study of visceral pain, confirmative studies are warranted to establish their robustness and clinical relevance. Therefore, subjective verbal reporting following rectal distension currently remains the best-validated technique in assessing visceral perception in IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder characterized by abdominal pain related to defecation with a change in bowel habit. Patients with IBS often exhibit increased visceral sensitivity, which can be tested clinically by rectal balloon distension procedures. This paper aims to give an overview of mechanisms involved in visceral hypersensitivity in IBS by reviewing recent literature. DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT: A literature search in the electronic databases Pubmed and MEDLINE was executed using the search terms 'visceral pain' or 'visceral nociception' or 'visceral hypersensitivity' and 'irritable bowel syndrome.' Both original articles and review articles were considered for data extraction. RESULTS: Recent advances in molecular neurophysiology provide knowledge to better understand the underlying mechanism in pain generation in the human gut, in particular, in IBS patients. Sensitization of peripheral nociceptive afferents, more specifically high-threshold afferents, has been proposed as one of the principle mechanism in the development of visceral hypersensitivity. On the other hand, central mechanisms also play an important role. In terms of clinical testing of visceral perception, considerable discrepancies remain, however, across different centres. CONCLUSION: Alterations in the modulatory balance of pro- and antinociceptive central processing of noxious peripheral input may serve as in integrative hypothesis for explaining visceral hypersensitivity in IBS. Nevertheless, it remains troublesome to estimate the contribution of central and peripheral factors in visceral hypersensitivity, posing a challenge in determining effective therapeutic entities.},

The aim of this population-based study was to determine the prevalence of IBS and describe the associated factors including demographic, life style and health-seeking behaviors in Shiraz city, southern Iran. METHODS: From April to September 2004, 1978 subjects aged > 35 years old completed a validated and reliable questionnaire on IBS. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of IBS was 10.9%, higher in females, in 35-44 years old age group and among subjects eating fast food (14.1%) but was lower in those taking more fruits and vegetables (10.5%). The occurrence of anxiety, nightmare and restlessness was also significantly higher in subjects with IBS. It had an association with psychological distress and recurrent headaches but not with drinking tea/coffee, smoking or physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: In our area, IBS was correlated with gender, age, psychological distress, recurrent headaches and consumption of fast foods that necessitate health planning programs by health policy makers.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is still controversial. AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic mixture on IBS symptoms and the composition of fecal microbiota in patients with diarrhea-dominant IBS (D-IBS). METHODS: Fifty patients with D-IBS were randomized into placebo or probiotic mixture (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus 1.0x10 CFU) groups. Treatment was taken daily for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was adequate relief (AR) of overall IBS symptoms, which was assessed weekly for 10 weeks. A responder was defined as a patient who experienced AR for at least half of the 10-week study period. Secondary outcomes included the effects on individual symptoms, stool parameters, and IBS quality of life. The fecal flora compositions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). RESULTS: The proportion of AR was consistently higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group throughout the 10-week period (P<0.05). The proportion of responders was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 12%, P=0.01). Stool consistency improved significantly in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group. Percent changes in individual symptom scores were similar in the 2 groups, but IBS quality of life improvement tended to be higher in the probiotics group. Comparison of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fecal flora showed that the concordance rate between bacterial compositions before and after treatment was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (69.5% vs. 56.5%, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic mixture was effective in providing AR of overall IBS symptoms and improvement of stool consistency in D-IBS patients, although it had no significant effect on individual symptoms. The therapeutic effect of probiotics is associated with the stabilization of intestinal microbiota.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and change of bowel habits without organic disease. Many patients seek alternative IBS treatments because of the limitations of conventional treatments. Gwakhyangjeonggisan (GJS), a herbal formula, has long been used for alleviating diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) in traditional medicine. Duolac7S, which comprises 7 bacterial species as probiotics, has been frequently used for D-IBS. Although GJS and Duolac7S have been administered simultaneously in many D-IBS patients, no study has investigated the effects of GJS and Duolac7S combination therapy on D-IBS. METHODS/DESIGN: The current trial is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 4-arm study. After a 2-week run-in period, 60 patients with D-IBS will be randomly assigned to one of the 4 combination groups consisting of GJS (water extract granules, 3 g/pack, 3 times a day) with Duolac7S (powder form, 1 capsule, 2 times a day) or their placebos and followed up for 2 weeks. The assigned treatments will last for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes are adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort and the proportion of responders (on a weekly basis). The secondary outcomes are visual analog scale for IBS symptoms (on a daily basis), quality of life (at 0, 8, and 10 weeks), intestinal permeability, and composition of intestinal microbiota (at 0 and 8 weeks). DISCUSSION: The present study is designed to examine the safety and efficacy of GJS and Duolac7S combination therapy on D-IBS. Our study provides the clinical evidence of a new therapeutic strategy for D-IBS.},

   abstract = {Circadian and seasonal rhythms are a fundamental feature of all living organisms and their organelles. Biological rhythms are responsible for daily food intake; the period of hunger and satiety is controlled by the central pacemaker, which resides in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, and communicates with tissues via bidirectional neuronal and humoral pathways. The molecular basis for circadian timing in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) involves interlocking transcriptional/translational feedback loops which culminate in the rhythmic expression and activity of a set of clock genes and related hormones. Interestingly, it has been found that clocks in the GIT are responsible for the periodic activity (PA) of its various segments and transit along the GIT; they are localized in special interstitial cells, with unstable membrane potentials located between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers. The rhythm of slow waves is controlled in various segments of the GIT: in the stomach (about 3 cycles per min), in the duodenum (12 cycle per min), in the jejunum and ileum (from 7 to 10 cycles per min), and in the colon (12 cycles per min). The migrating motor complex (MMC) starts in the stomach and moves along the gut causing peristaltic contractions when the electrical activity spikes are superimposed on the slow waves. GIT hormones, such as motilin and ghrelin, are involved in the generation of MMCs, while others (gastrin, ghrelin, cholecystokinin, serotonin) are involved in the generation of spikes upon the slow waves, resulting in peristaltic or segmental contractions in the small (duodenum, jejunum ileum) and large bowel (colon). Additionally, melatonin, produced by neuro-endocrine cells of the GIT mucosa, plays an important role in the internal biological clock, related to food intake (hunger and satiety) and the myoelectric rhythm (produced primarily by the pineal gland during the dark period of the light-dark cycle). This appears to be an endocrine encoding of the environmental light-dark cycle, conveying photic information which is used by organisms for both circadian and seasonal organization. Motor and secretory activity, as well as the rhythm of cell proliferation in the GIT and liver, are subject to many circadian rhythms, mediated by autonomic cells and some enterohormones (gastrin, ghrelin and somatostatin). Disruption of circadian physiology, due to sleep disturbance or shift work, may result in various gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or peptic ulcer disease. In addition, circadian disruption accelerates aging, and promotes tumorigenesis in the liver and GIT. Identification of the molecular basis and role of melatonin in the regulation of circadian rhythm allows researchers and clinicians to approach gastrointestinal diseases from a chronobiological perspective. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the administration of melatonin improves symptoms in patients with IBS and GERD. Moreover, our own studies indicate that melatonin significantly protects gastrointestinal mucosa, and has strong protective effects on the liver in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Recently, it has been postulated that disruption of circadian regulation may lead to obesity by shifting food intake schedules. Future research should focus on the role of clock genes in the pathophysiology of the GIT and liver.},

   abstract = {Stress, which is defined as an acute threat to homeostasis, shows both short- and long-term effects on the functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Exposure to stress results in alterations of the brain-gut interactions ("brain-gut axis") ultimately leading to the development of a broad array of gastrointestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal diseases, food antigen-related adverse responses, peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The major effects of stress on gut physiology include: 1) alterations in gastrointestinal motility; 2) increase in visceral perception; 3) changes in gastrointestinal secretion; 4) increase in intestinal permeability; 5) negative effects on regenerative capacity of gastrointestinal mucosa and mucosal blood flow; and 6) negative effects on intestinal microbiota. Mast cells (MC) are important effectors of brain-gut axis that translate the stress signals into the release of a wide range of neurotransmitters and proinflammatory cytokines, which may profoundly affect the gastrointestinal physiology. IBS represents the most important gastrointestinal disorder in humans, and is characterized by chronic or recurrent pain associated with altered bowel motility. The diagnostic testing for IBS patients include routine blood tests, stool tests, celiac disease serology, abdominal sonography, breath testing to rule out carbohydrate (lactose, fructose, etc.) intolerance and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Colonoscopy is recommended if alarming symptoms are present or to obtain colonic biopsies especially in patients with diarrhoea predominant IBS. The management of IBS is based on a multifactorial approach and includes pharmacotherapy targeted against the predominant symptom, behavioural and psychological treatment, dietary alterations, education, reassurance and effective patient-physician relationship. When evaluating for the stress-induced condition in the upper GI tract, the diagnostic testing includes mainly blood tests and gastroscopy to rule out GERD and peptic ulcer disease. The therapy for these conditions is mainly based on the inhibition of gastric acid by proton pump inhibitors and eradication of Helicobacter pylori-infection. Additionally, melatonin an important mediator of brain gut axis has been shown to exhibit important protective effects against stress-induced lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. Finally, probiotics may profoundly affect the brain-gut interactions ("microbiome-gut-brain axis") and attenuate the development of stress-induced disorders in both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Further studies on the brain-gut axis are needed to open new therapeutic avenues in the future.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To study the therapeutic effects of probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and identify subgroups benefiting most. BACKGROUND: Some trials investigating therapeutic effects in irritable bowel syndrome have shown benefits in IBS subgroups only. Probiotic treatment seems to be promising. METHODS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (120; Rome II) were recruited to a prospective double-blind study and randomized to either EcN (n = 60) or placebo (n = 60) given for 12 weeks. Objectives were to describe efficacy and safety of EcN in different groups of irritable bowel syndrome. Outcome was assessed by 'Integrative Medicine Patient Satisfaction Scale'. RESULTS: Altogether, the responder rate was higher in the EcN than in the placebo group. However, only after 10 and 11 weeks, the differences were significant (Delta 20.0% points [95% CI 2.6; 37.4], p = 0.01 and Delta 18.3% points [95% CI 1.0; 35.7], p = 0.02, respectively). The best response was observed in the subgroup of patients with gastroenteritis or antibiotics prior to irritable bowel syndrome onset (Delta 45.7% points, p = 0.029). No significant differences were observed in any other subgroup. Both treatment groups showed similar adverse events and tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic EcN shows effects in irritable bowel syndrome, especially in patients with altered enteric microflora, e.g. after gastroenterocolitis or administration of antibiotics.},

   abstract = {Traditional symptom-based therapies of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are directed at the relief of individual IBS symptoms, but they are often of limited efficacy in addressing the entire symptom complex. Combinations of drugs to target bothersome symptoms are suggested as the first-line pharmacologic treatment. Increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms of IBS has resulted in the development of several new therapeutic approaches. Thirteen consensus statements for the treatment of IBS were developed using the modified Delphi approach. Exclusion diets have modest efficacy in improving symptoms in some IBS patients. Symptom-based therapies with dietary fiber, bulking agents, laxatives, antispasmodics and laxatives are effective in the improvement of some individual symptoms, e.g. dietary fiber and bulking agents for constipation, laxatives for constipation, antispasmodics for abdominal pain and discomfort, antidiarrheals for diarrhea. 5HT3 receptor antagonists and 5HT((4)) receptor agonists are effective in the relief of global IBS symptoms and individual symptoms such as abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habits. A short term course of nonabsorbable antibiotics may improve global IBS symptoms, particularly in patients with diarrhea- predominant IBS. Some probiotics appear to have the potential benefit in improving global IBS symptoms. Selective C-2 chloride channel activator is more effective than placebo at relieving global IBS symptoms in patients with constipation-predominant IBS. Both tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are equally effective in relieving global IBS symptoms, and have some benefits in treating abdominal pain. Certain types of psychologic therapy may be effective in improving global symptoms in some IBS patients. Further studies are strongly needed to develop better treatment strategies for Korean patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {Fructose exists in food naturally or as a sweetening additive. It has been thought that fructose malabsorption may cause the gastrointestinal symptoms seen in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. However, fructose malabsorption is still poorly understood, and clinicians are still uncertain of its role. This review attempts to clarify the relation between fructose malabsorption and symptoms in normal individuals and patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The main problem lies in the diagnosis. First, there is no definite cut off value for the breath tests. Second, we are unsure of the normal absorptive capacity of fructose in normal individuals. Normal individuals will have a degree of fructose malabsorption with or without symptoms depending on the dose of fructose used. From earlier studies, 25 g of fructose seems to be the cut-off dose to investigate fructose malabsorption, with a positive breath test at this dose suggesting abnormally low capacity to absorb fructose. This low level may be difficult to exclude from the daily diet, resulting in symptoms of fructose malabsorption.},

   abstract = {Chronic constipation is a highly prevalent, heterogeneous disorder that significantly affects patients' lives. Nearly 15% of the U.S. population meets diagnostic criteria for chronic constipation (1). Chronic constipation reduces patients' quality of life and imposes a significant economic burden to the healthcare system (2, 3). A number of therapeutic options are currently available to treat symptoms of chronic constipation, although they are not universally successful (4, 5). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is another common functional gastrointestinal disorder, with a prevalence rate estimated at up to 12% in the U.S. (6). Similar to chronic constipation, IBS imposes a significant impact on both the healthcare system and the individual patient (7-12). Currently, only one medication (lubiprostone) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of IBS with constipation (IBS-C), and is approved only for women (13). Although effective in many patients, it is not universally effective for the treatment of constipation symptoms in all patients with IBS-C. Other treatment options are therefore needed for those patients with chronic constipation and IBS-C who fail currently available therapies. This article will present information on the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of linaclotide, a new agent designed to treat symptoms of both chronic constipation and IBS-C. Preclinical data, clinical studies and safety data will also be reviewed.},

   abstract = {Concern exists that increasing fructose consumption, particularly in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, is resulting in increasing rates of fructose intolerance and aggravation of clinical symptoms in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome. Most clinical trials designed to test this hypothesis have used pure fructose, a form not commonly found in the food supply, often in quantities and concentrations that exceed typical fructose intake levels. In addition, the amount of fructose provided in tests for malabsorption, which is thought to be a key cause of intolerance, often exceeds the normal physiological absorption capacity for this sugar. To help health professionals accurately identify and treat this condition, this article reviews clinical data related to understanding fructose malabsorption and intolerance (i.e., malabsorption that manifests with symptoms) relative to usual fructose and other carbohydrate intake. Because simultaneous consumption of glucose attenuates fructose malabsorption, information on the fructose and glucose content of foods, beverages, and ingredients representing a variety of food categories is provided.},

Up to four samples per individual were collected over 2 years giving a total of 124 samples. Multivariate discriminant analysis, based on NMR data from all three groups, was able to predict UC and C group membership with good sensitivity and specificity; classification of IBS samples was less successful and could not be used for diagnosis. Trends were detected toward increased taurine and cadaverine levels in UC with increased bile acid and decreased branched chain fatty acids in IBS relative to controls; changes in short chain fatty acids and amino acids were not significant. Previous PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of the same fecal material had shown alterations of the gut microbiota when comparing UC and IBS groups with controls. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that DGGE profiles from the same individual were stable over time, but NMR spectra were more variable; canonical correlation analysis of NMR and DGGE data partly separated the three groups and revealed a correlation between the gut microbiota profile and metabolite composition.},

   abstract = {Perceived food hypersensitivity is a prevalent, but poorly understood condition. In this review article, we summarize narratively recent literature including results of our 10 years' interdisciplinary research program dealing with such patients. The patients (more than 400) included in our studies were all adults referred to a university hospital because of gastrointestinal complaints self-attributed to food hypersensitivity. Despite extensive examinations, food allergy was seldom diagnosed. The majority of the patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome. In addition, most suffered from several extra-intestinal health complaints and had considerably impaired quality of life. However, psychological factors could explain only approximately 10% of the variance in the patients' symptom severity and 90% of the variance thus remained unexplained. Intolerance to low-digestible carbohydrates was a common problem and abdominal symptoms were replicated by carbohydrate ingestion. A considerable number of patients showed evidence of immune activation by analyses of B-cell activating factor, dendritic cells and "IgE-armed" mast cells. Multiple factors such as immune activation, disturbed intestinal fermentation, enteric dysmotility, post-infectious changes and "local" allergy in the gut as well as psychological disturbances may play a role in the pathophysiology of perceived food hypersensitivity. Hence, our results support the view that management of these patients should be interdisciplinary.},

Although dietary intake has been the focus of previous research, attention to specific nutrients has been rare. We hypothesized that there is an association between the severity of IBS symptoms and the intake of specific food groups and specific nutrients. In this cross-sectional study, 17 human subjects with IBS, as defined according to the Rome II criteria, were recruited. IBS symptoms were recorded on diary cards every evening for 7 days, and an IBS sum score was calculated (range, 0-15). Intake of food was assessed from a food diary kept by the subjects in the same period. Associations between IBS sum score and dietary intake were explored. The daily IBS sum score was 6.43 (range, 3.86- 9.09). Intake of vitamin B(6) was the only component of the diet that was significantly associated with the IBS sum score. The median daily intake of vitamin B(6) was 0.9 mg/day (range, 0.6-1.5), the recommended daily intake for men and women is 1.6 mg/day or more and 1.2 mg/day or more, respectively. A high symptom score was associated with low vitamin B(6) intake (adjusted R(2) = 0.583; beta = -4.431; 95% confidence interval, -6.386 to -2.476; P = 0.0002). A significant inverse association between intake of vitamin B(6) and severity of IBS symptoms might have clinical implications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often relate symptoms to the intake of certain foods. This study assesses differences in diet in subjects with and without IBS. METHODS: The cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted in Norway in 2001. Out of 11078 invited subjects, 4621 completed a survey about abdominal complaints and intake of common food items. IBS and IBS subgroups were classified according to Rome II criteria. RESULTS: IBS was diagnosed in 388 subjects (8.4%) and, of these, 26.5% had constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS), 44.8% alternating IBS (A-IBS), and 28.6% diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS). Low intake of dairy products (portions/day) (Odds Ratio 0.85 [CI 0.78 to 0.93], p = 0.001) and high intake of water (100 ml/day) (1.08 [1.02 to 1.15], p = 0.002), tea (1.05 [1.01 to 1.10], p = 0.019) and carbonated beverages (1.07 [1.01 to 1.14], p = 0.023) were associated with IBS. A lower intake of dairy products and a higher intake of alcohol and carbonated beverages were associated with D-IBS and a higher intake of water and tea was associated with A-IBS. In subjects with IBS the severity of symptoms was associated with a higher intake of vegetables and potatoes in subjects with C-IBS, with a higher intake of vegetables in subjects with A-IBS, and with a higher intake of fruits and berries, carbonated beverages and alcohol in subjects with D-IBS. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the diet differed in subjects with and without IBS and between IBS subgroups and was associated with the severity of symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) often relate their symptoms to the intake of food and modify their diet. IgE-mediated food allergy is uncommon in IBS, but the role of IgG-mediated food hypersensitivity remains inconclusive. The primary aim of this study was to compare food- and yeast-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies in subjects with and without IBS. METHODS: This was a case control study in the general population for which subjects completed questionnaires about abdominal complaints and their intake of common food items. Blood samples were collected, and food- and yeast-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies were measured. Antibodies were measured in mg/L. RESULTS: We included 269 subjects with IBS and 277 control subjects. After correction for subject characteristics and diet, there were no significant differences with regard to food- and yeast-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies between subjects with IBS and controls. Lower values of IgG antibodies against egg (OR 0.99 (0.98 to 1.00), p = 0.002) and beef (OR 0.75 (0.60 to 0.94), p = 0.012) and higher values of IgG antibodies against chicken (OR 1.14 (1.03 to 1.27), p = 0.009) were associated with more severe symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that IgG-and IgG4-mediated food and yeast hypersensitivity in IBS is unlikely. IgG antibodies against food and yeast may reflect the diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent functional disorder with poor understanding on its pathogenesis and pathology. China has huge amount of population and have a lot of literatures on IBS in Chinese publications. The aim of this article was to review the reported investigations on IBS in China and discuss the difference between China and other country. METHODS: Literatures pertaining IBS epidemiology, pathogenesis and pathophysiology, which published in the high level journals in china and SCI journals after 1998 were reviewed. RESULT: In the general health population, 5-6% meets the Rome II IBS criteria. Intestinal infection, food intolerance, genetic factor and psychological disturbance were responsible for the pathogenesis of IBS. In IBS patients, the impaired reaction to rectal distension, abnormal gastrointestinal motility, impaired autonomic nerve function, weakened colon epithelium connection, altered cerebral nuclei activation were the main pathophysiological findings. CONCLUSION: Comparing to the findings from other area, literatures from China provided more evidences on epidemiological data of IBS in China, post-infection IBS, visceral hypertension and gastrointestinal motility abnormalities in IBS. This detailed literature review may help the understanding and promoting the future studies on IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of acupuncture of "Zusanli" (ST 36) and "Taichong" (LR 3) on gastrointestinal hormone levels in diarrhea type irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) rats so as to provide experimental evidence for acupuncture treatment of IBS-D. METHODS: Forty-eight Wistar rats were randomly divided into control, model, acupuncture and medication groups, with 12 rats in each group. IBS-D model was established by chronic mild restraining stress combined with isolated raising and intragastric administration of Folium Sennae (10 mL/kg). For rats of the acupuncture group, bilateral "Zusanli" (ST 36) and "Taichong" (LR 3) were punctured and stimulated for 30 min, once daily for 14 days. The rats of the medication group were treated by gavage of Pinaverin bromide, once daily for 14 days, and those of the control and model groups were given with equal volume of saline. Somatostatin (SS), substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in the rats' plasma and ileum tissues were detected by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the body weight and food intake quantity were reduced significantly, while the diarrhea index was increased significantly in the model group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). In comparison with the model group, the body weight and food intake volume in both acupuncture and medication groups were increased remarkably after the treatment (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) whereas the diarrhea index in the latter two groups was reduced obviously (P < 0.01). Compared with the control group, plasma VIP level was increased significantly in the model group (P < 0.01), while those in both acupuncture and medication groups were decreased remarkably compared with the model group (P < 0.05). No significant changes of plasma SP and SS levels were found after modeling and after both acupuncture and medication treatments. In comparison with the control group, ileum SP, VIP and SS levels in the model group were up-regulated significantly (P < 0.01), while those in both acupuncture and medication groups were down-regulated considerably compared with the model group (P < 0.01). No significant differences were found between acupuncture and medication groups in the levels of ileum SP, VIP and SS (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture of ST 36 and LR 3 can effectively down-regulate ileum SP, VIP and SS levels in IBS-D rats, which may contribute to its effect in relieving IBS-D.},

An increasing number of studies have suggested how probiotics may alleviate IBS symptoms and several mechanisms of action have been proposed. In the present study we characterized the intestinal microbiota of 19 subjects suffering from diagnosed IBS using a fully validated High Taxonomic Fingerprint Microbiota Array (HTF-Microbi.Array). We demonstrated that the IBS microbiota is different from that of healthy individuals due to an unbalance in a number of commensal species, with an increase in relative abundance of lactobacilli, B. cereus and B. clausii, bifidobacteria, Clostridium cluster IX and E. rectale, and a decrease in abundance of Bacteroides/Prevotella group and Veillonella genus. Additionally, we demonstrated that some bacterial groups of the human intestinal microbiota, recently defined as pathobionts, are increased in concentration in the IBS microbiota. Furthermore, we aimed at investigating if the daily administration of a novel probiotic yogurt containing B. animalis subsp lactis Bb12 and K. marxianus B0399, recently demonstrated to have beneficial effects in the management of IBS symptoms, could impact on the biostructure of IBS microbiota, modulating its composition to counteract putative dysbiosis found in IBS subjects. Notably, we demonstrated that the beneficial effects associated to the probiotic preparation are not related to significant modifications in the composition of the human intestinal microbiota.},

These disorders present major challenges to healthcare providers, as few effective medical therapies are currently available. Recently, there has been increasing interest in dietary therapies for IBS, particularly a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). Since ingestion of FODMAPs increases the delivery of readily fermentable substrates and water to the distal small intestine and colon-which results in luminal distention and gas-the reduction of FODMAPs in a patient's diet may improve functional gastrointestinal symptoms. This paper will review the pathophysiology of IBS and the role of FODMAPs for the treatment of this condition.},

In a recently published draft guidance for IBS from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), urgency was not considered an appropriate primary endpoint. The FDA's position is that it is not clear how patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) "define or describe urgency". The aims of this study were to evaluate the association of urgency with stool frequency and consistency in patients with D-IBS and to describe results from patient interviews on their understanding of the term urgency. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of clinical trial data in patients with D-IBS was conducted. Analyses focused on the relationship of urgency to stool frequency and consistency. Interviews were conducted with patients with D-IBS to test their understanding of the term urgency. RESULTS: On the days that patients reported urgency, as compared to the days that patients did not report urgency, they had more frequent bowel movements (3.9 versus 1.8) and looser stools (Bristol Stool Score: 5.4 versus 4.2). The differences for both parameters, evaluated on the days with or without urgency, were statistically significant. In patient interviews, patients with D-IBS had a clear understanding of the concept and terminology of urgency and considered it one of their two most bothersome symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Urgency should be considered a suitable co-primary endpoint in D-IBS studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increased intestinal permeability of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients has been recently associated with a decreased level of glutamine synthetase. Neonatal maternal deprivation (NMD) is considered as an IBS-like model. The aim of our study was to investigate whether early nutritional intervention with glutamine may attenuate the deleterious impact of early life stress on gut barrier function in NMD. METHODS: 124 rat pups were separated from their dam 3 h daily during postnatal days 2-14, or left undisturbed (NS). Separated rats received by gavage either with alanyl-glutamine (GLN), an isonitrogenous amino acid mix (AA, control) or an equal amount of drinking water (H(2)O). Production of cytokines was measured by multiplex, expression of COX-2, PPARgamma, tight junction proteins and TLR4 by western blot. Intestinal permeability was studied by Lactulose/Mannitol test. RESULTS: Treatment of pups with GLN or AA abolished the decrease in body weight observed in NMD. Treatment with GLN decreased in the colon (i) TLR4 expression at D20, (ii) IL-2 and -10 productions at D60 (iii) protein expression of occludin at D20 compared to AA. GLN also decreased colon expression of COX2 and PPARgamma at D60 compared to NS. Colon production of IFNgamma is significantly reduced by GLN compared to H(2)O. No significant change in intestinal permeability was observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that an early nutritional intervention with alanyl-glutamine specifically abolished the up-regulation of TLR4 expression in NMD. Glutamine may be evaluated as a potential treatment for IBS patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are chronic conditions affecting millions of individuals in the United States. The symptoms are well-documented and can be debilitating. How these chronic gastrointestinal (GI) conditions impact the daily lives of those afflicted is not well documented, especially from a patient's perspective. METHODS: Here we describe data from a series of 22 focus groups held at three different academic medical centers with individuals suffering from chronic GI conditions. All focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed. Two research team members independently analyzed transcripts from each focus group following an agreed upon coding scheme. RESULTS: One-hundred-thirty-six individuals participated in our study, all with a chronic GI related condition. They candidly discussed three broad themes that characterize their daily lives: identification of disease and personal identity, medications and therapeutics, and daily adaptations. These all tie to our participants trying to deal with symptoms on a daily basis. We find that a recurrent topic underlying these themes is the dichotomy of experiencing uncertainty and striving for control. CONCLUSIONS: Study participants' open dialogue and exchange of experiences living with a chronic GI condition provide insight into how these conditions shape day-to-day activities. Our findings provide fertile ground for discussions about how clinicians might best facilitate, acknowledge, and elicit patients' stories in routine care to better address their experience of illness.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic debilitating functional gastrointestinal disorder. Diet and lifestyle changes are important management strategies. The aim of these guidelines is to systematically review key aspects of the dietary management of IBS, with the aim of providing evidence-based guidelines for use by registered dietitians. METHODS: Questions relating to diet and IBS symptom management were developed by a guideline development group. These included the role of milk and lactose, nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP), fermentable carbohydrates in abdominal bloating, probiotics and empirical or elimination diets. A comprehensive literature search was conducted and relevant studies from January 1985 to November 2009 were identified using the electronic database search engines: Cinahl, Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science. Evidence statements, recommendations, good practice points and research recommendations were developed. RESULTS: Thirty studies were critically appraised. A dietetic care pathway was produced following a logical sequence of treatment and formed the basis of these guidelines. Three lines of dietary management were identified. first line: Clinical and dietary assessment, healthy eating and lifestyle management with some general advice on lactose and NSP. Second line: Advanced dietary interventions to improve symptoms based on NSP, fermentable carbohydrates and probiotics. Third line: Elimination and empirical diets. Research recommendations were also identified relating to the need for adequately powered and well designed randomised controlled trials. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide evidence-based details of how to achieve the successful dietary management of IBS.},

   abstract = {There have been substantial advances in the pharmacotherapy of fibromyalgia (FM), which have occurred in parallel with advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of FM in the past several years. Consortia of researchers have established a core set of symptom domains, which constitute the condition of FM, including pain, fatigue, sleep and mood disturbance and cognitive dysfunction, which significantly impact a patient's overall well-being and ability to function. Outcome measures, which assess these domains, both singly and in composite format, are showing increasing reliability to discriminate between the treatment and placebo arms in clinical trials of emerging therapies, which are targeting the pathophysiologic mechanisms of FM. Several different medications, including the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, duloxetine and milnacipran, and the alpha(2)delta modulator, pregabalin, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of FM, based on their clinically meaningful and durable effect on pain in monotherapy trials. They also have been shown to beneficially effect patient global impression of change, function and variably other key symptom domains, such as fatigue, sleep disturbance and cognition. Other medicines, although they have not gone through the formal approval process, have also shown efficacy in multiple domains of FM. Although combination trials have generally not yet been performed, the combined use of medicines with complementary mechanisms of action is rational, and, when done with appropriate caution, will likely be shown to be safe and well tolerated. Adjunctive therapy with medicines targeted at specific symptom domains, such as sleep, as well as treatments aimed at common co-morbid conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, or disease states, such as rheumatoid arthritis, should be considered for the purpose of reducing the patient's overall symptom burden. Current therapies neither completely treat FM symptoms nor benefit all patients; thus, further research on new therapies with different mechanisms and side-effect profiles is needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have access to a growing number of probiotic products marketed to improve digestive health. It is unclear how patients make decisions about probiotics and what role they expect their gastroenterologists to play as they consider using probiotics. Understanding patients' knowledge, attitudes and expectations of probiotics may help gastroenterologists engage patients in collaborative discussions about probiotics. STUDY: Focus groups were conducted with patients with IBD and IBS at the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and Johns Hopkins University. Inductive analytic methods were used to identify common themes and draw interpretations from focus group narratives. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six patients participated in 22 focus groups between March and August 2009. Patients viewed probiotics as an appealing alternative to pharmaceutical drugs and understood probiotics as a more "natural," low-risk therapeutic option. Many patients were hesitant to use them without consulting their gastroenterologists. Patients would weigh the risks and benefits of probiotics, their disease severity and satisfaction with current treatments when considering probiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: Patients are interested in probiotics but have many unanswered questions about their use. Our findings suggest that patients with IBD and IBS will look to gastroenterologists and other clinicians as trustworthy advisors regarding the utility of probiotics as an alternative or supplement to pharmaceutical drugs. Gastroenterologists and other clinicians who care for patients with these diseases should be prepared to discuss the potential benefits and risks of probiotics and assist patients in making informed decisions about their use.},

METHODS: A total of 130 patients were randomly allocated to consume, twice daily for 8 wk, either the composite yogurt or the control product. The composite yogurt contained acacia dietary fiber and high-dose B. lactis together with two classic yogurt starter cultures. Patients were evaluated using the visual analog scale via a structured questionnaire administered at baseline and after treatment. RESULTS: Improvements in bowel habit satisfaction and overall IBS symptoms from baseline were significantly higher in the test group than in the control group (27.16 vs 15.51, P = 0.010, 64.2 +/- 17.0 vs 50.4 +/- 20.5, P < 0.001; respectively). In constipation-predominant IBS, improvement in overall IBS symptoms was significantly higher in the test group than in the control group (72.4 +/- 18.4 vs 50.0 +/- 21.8, P < 0.001). In patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS, improvement in bowel habit satisfaction from baseline was significantly higher in the test group than in the control group (32.90 vs 7.81, P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that composite yogurt enriched with acacia fiber and B. lactis has greater therapeutic effects in patients with IBS than standard yogurt.},

   abstract = {Unexpected, urgent, sometimes painful bowel movements after eating are common complaints among adults. Without a clear etiology, if pain is present and resolves with the movements, this is usually labeled "irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea" based solely on symptoms. If this symptom-based approach is applied exclusively, it may lead physicians not to consider treatable conditions: celiac disease, or maldigestion due to bile acid malabsorption, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, or an a-glucosidase (sucrase, glucoamylase, maltase, or isomaltase) deficiency. These conditions can be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea (or functional diarrhea, if pain is not present). Limited testing is currently available to confirm these conditions (antibody screens for celiac disease; fecal fat as a surrogate marker for pancreatic function). Therefore, empirical treatment with alpha amylase, pancreatic enzymes, or a bile acid-binding agent may simultaneously treat these patients and serve as a surrogate diagnostic test. This review will summarize the current evidence for bile acid malabsorption, and deficiencies of pancreatic enzymes or a-glucosidases as potential causes for postprandial diarrhea, and provide an algorithm for treatment options.},

DESIGN: An intention to treat, double blind, randomised, crossover trial comparing PEZ to placebo for reduction of postprandial IBS-D. Patients had to recognise at least two different triggering foods, be willing to consume six baseline 'trigger meals' and again blinded with PEZ and placebo. Patients then chose which drug they preferred for another 25 meals. SETTING: Outpatient internal medicine practice clinic. PATIENTS: 255 patients were screened; 83 met the criteria, including 5 years of symptoms, recognised 'food triggers', no other identifiable cause for the symptoms, either a normal colonoscopy or barium enema while symptomatic and able to discontinue all anticholinergic medications. 69 patients were enrolled, 20 withdrew before randomisation, leaving 49 patients: 14 men, 35 women, mean age 52 years (SD 15.3). Over 60% had experienced symptoms for 11-30 years and 16% for more than 40 years. INTERVENTIONS: After completing six baseline meals, patients were randomised in blocks of four to receive either identical PEZ or a placebo for another six meals, and after a washout period of time received the alternative drug. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary analysis was number of patients who chose PEZ over placebo for the extended use. RESULTS: Overall, 30/49 (61%) would have chosen PEZ (p=0.078), with first drug preference for PEZ at 0.002. Among the PEZ subgroup, PEZ use compared with placebo, demonstrated improvement in all symptoms (p</=0.001) for cramping, bloating, borborygami, urge to defecate, global pain and decrease stooling with increase in stool firmness. CONCLUSIONS: PEZ was found in a small group of patients to reduce postprandial IBS-D symptoms and deserves further evaluation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often associated with psychological distress, is characterized by increased gut permeability and visceral sensitivity. In animals, stress increases intestinal paracellular permeability (IPP), visceral sensitivity and colonic proteolytic activity. Estradiol reduces IPP and affects visceral sensitivity in non-stressed ovariectomized rats, but whether estrogens affect stress-induced hyperpermeability and hypersensitivity in cyclic females remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate (i) the effects of a phytoestrogen-rich soy germ fermented ingredient (SG) on visceral hypersensitivity, hyperpermeability and other symptoms in stressed intact female rats, (ii) the mechanisms of action involved on the basis of both estrogenic and protease inhibitor activities of SG. METHODS: Female rats received orally for 15-d either SG, 17beta-estradiol benzoate (EB), or vehicles, with or without the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI182.780 before stress. Visceral sensitivity, IPP, faecal proteolytic activity, plasma corticosterone, rat mast cell protease II immunostaining, and occludin expression were assessed. RESULTS: Stress increased IPP (concomitantly to a drop in occludin expression), visceral sensitivity, faecal proteolytic activity and plasma corticosterone. Similarly to EB, SG prevented the stress-induced hyperpermeability, and hypersensitivity, without changes in plasma corticosterone. SG inhibited the increase in faecal proteolytic activity, enhanced occludin expression, and reduced the colonic mast cell density. All SG effects, except decrease on faecal proteolytic activity, were blocked by ICI182.780. CONCLUSION: A 2-wk oral treatment with SG prevented the stress-induced hyperpermeability and visceral hypersensitivity in cyclic rats through ER activation, and blocked the increase in colonic proteolytic activity, suggesting that SG can be promising in IBS management.},

We evaluated the effects of Lactobacillus brevis KB290 (KB290), which has been demonstrated to be effective at improving bowel movements and the composition of intestinal microflora, on IBS symptoms. METHODS: We performed a placebo control double-blind cross matched trial. Thirty-five males and females (aged 6 years and above) who had been diagnosed with IBS according to the Rome III criteria were divided into 2 groups, and after a 4-week pre-trial observation period, they were administered test capsules containing KB290 or placebo for 4 weeks (consumption period I). Then, the capsule administration was suspended for 4 weeks in both groups (washout period), before the opposite capsules were administered for a further 4 weeks (consumption period II). Fecal samples were collected on the first day of the pre-consumption observation period, the last day of consumption period I, the last day of the washout period, and the last day of consumption period II. In addition, the subjects' IBS symptoms and quality of life (QOL) and any adverse events that they experienced were evaluated. RESULTS: No significant difference in IBS symptoms was noted among the various periods. However, the mean QOL scores were improved during the test capsule consumption.The frequencies of watery and mushy feces were significantly lower in the test capsule consumption period than during the pre-consumption observation period, and the frequency of abdominal pain was significantly reduced in the test capsule consumption period compared with the other periods.The frequency of the genus Bifidobacterium was significantly higher, and that of the genus Clostridium was significantly lower, after the test capsule consumption than after the placebo consumption. The frequencies of the genera Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Enterococcus were also investigated, but no differences in their frequencies were detected between the placebo and test capsule consumption periods. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics, the safety of which has been established, are used widely in various foods and can now be purchased readily. The results of the present study suggest that KB290 is useful for early intervention in IBS.},

Periods without organic loading were arranged between the each loading period. Stable operation at an OLR of 9.2 kg-VS (15.0 kg-COD) m(-3) day(-1) was achieved with a high VS reduction (91.8%) and high methane yield (455 mL g-VS-1). The cell density increased in the periods without organic loading, and reached to 10.9x10(10) cells mL(-1) on day 187, which was around 15 times higher than that of the seed sludge. There was a significant correlation between OLR and saturated TSS in the sludge (y=17.3e(0.1679x), r(2)=0.996, P<0.05). A theoretical maximum OLR of 10.5 kg-VS (17.0 kg-COD) m(-3) day(-1) was obtained for mesophilic single-stage wet anaerobic digestion that is able to maintain a stable operation with high methane yield and VS reduction.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The incidence of gastrointestinal infections continues to increase and infectious colitis contributes to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent advances in knowledge of pathogens causing infectious colitis. We describe the various pathogens and specifically focus on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Entamoeba histolytica infections, and their impact on long-term effects, including postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Salmonella, Campylobacter, and EHEC outbreaks continue to occur with disturbing regularity. Peanut butter and peppers were recently responsible for outbreaks of nontyphoid Salmonella. Recent research has identified Salmonella genes required for colonization of various hosts and transposon-mediated differential hybridization was recently used to identify genes required during infection in different animal models. A number of other strains of EHEC in addition to O157:H7 are emerging as serious threats to food safety in the USA. Campylobacter jejuni isolates are of interest because of absence of genes encoding for classical enterotoxins, and lack of plasmids encoding genes promoting bacterial invasion. Recent research has identified that the organism is able to invade and replicate in infected epithelia via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-4. Also patients with infectious colitis, in particular Salmonella and Campylobacter, are at increased risk of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease on long-term follow-up. The paradigm of Entamoeba histolytica infection is changing with recent reports of detection of E. dispar deoxyribonucleic acid sequences, previously considered nonpathogenic. SUMMARY: There has been an explosion in the understanding of the epidemiology, pathobiology, and mechanisms underlying infectious colitis. Additional studies to address prevention strategies and strict screening modalities for these infections are necessary.},

The authors, after the determination of the masticatory efficiency score (classification of Verkindere) of 100 subjects affected by colopathies and diagnosed in the service of gastroenterology of Cocody University Hospital (Abidjan), attempt to determine the importance of the masticatory deficiency in functional colopathies. Among the toothless subjects with functional colopathies, the restoration of the masticatory efficiency by functional prosthetic rehabilitation constitutes an essential therapeutic act in the reduction of the symptoms of the functional colopathies and the improvement of the comfort of the patients.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder comprising abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and disordered defecation. The prevalence of IBS is 10-15% in the general population. This study investigated the prevalence of IBS and the relationship between IBS and stress, lifestyle, and dietary habits among nursing and medical school students. METHODS: A blank self-administrated questionnaire was used to survey 2,639 students studying nursing or medicine. This questionnaire asked about IBS symptoms, lifestyle, dietary intake, life events, anxiety, and depression. The questionnaires were collected from 2,365 students (89.6%) and the responses of 1,768 students (74.8%) were analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS was 35.5% as a whole, 25.2% in males and 41.5% in females. Significantly higher stress scores (anxiety and depression) and life events were found in the IBS group than in the non-IBS group. Sleep disorders and the time spent sitting were also higher in males with IBS. In the IBS group, females ate less fish, fruit, milk, and green-yellow vegetables, and more processed food products than the non-IBS group (p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.032, p = 0.037, p < 0.001). The rates of missed meals and irregular mealtimes were significantly higher in females in the IBS group (p = 0.001, p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IBS was higher among nursing and medical students, and further interventional studies are needed to improve IBS symptoms.},

METHODS: A population-based postal study was carried out. Questionnaires were mailed to the same age- and gender-stratified random sample of the Icelandic population (aged 18-75 years) in 1996 and again in 2006. Subjects were classified with heartburn if they reported heartburn in the preceding year and/or week, based on the definition of heartburn. RESULTS: Heartburn in the preceding year was reported in 42.8% (1996) and 44.2% (2006) of subjects, with a strong relationship between those who experienced heartburn in both years. Heartburn in the preceding week was diagnosed in 20.8%. There was a significant relationship between heartburn, dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. Individuals with a body mass index (BMI) below or higher than normal weight were more likely to have heartburn. Heartburn caused by food or beverages was reported very often by 20.0% of subjects. CONCLUSION: Heartburn is a common and chronic condition. Subjects with a BMI below or higher than normal weight are more likely to experience heartburn. Heartburn has a great impact on daily activities, sleep and quality of life.},

   abstract = {The present study investigated the diet and quality of life of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients in comparison to the background population. Furthermore, it studied the effects of guidance on diet management on changes in food intake, quality of life and symptoms. A total of 35 healthy controls, 36 IBS patients and 43 IBS patients who had received guidance on diet management 2 years earlier were included. The controls and patients were asked to complete an FFQ questionnaire, an SF-NDI questionnaire, an IBS-QoL questionnaire and a Birmingham IBS symptom score questionnaire. There were no statistical differences in the intake of calories, carbohydrates, proteins and fat between the controls and IBS patients, with or without guidance on diet management. IBS patients made a conscious choice to avoid certain food items, some of which belong to fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosacharides and polyols (FODMAPs). They had a higher consumption, however, of other food items that are rich in FODMAPs. They also avoided other food sources which are crucial for their health. Two years after receiving guidance on diet management, IBS patients had a different diet profile. They avoided all FODMAPrich food, consumed more food with probiotic supplements and did not avoid food sources that were crucial to their health. In addition, they had improved quality of life and reduced symptoms. Although at first sight the diet of IBS patients did not differ from that of the background population, detailed examination showed avoidance of certain food items. Guidance on the management of diet improved their choice of a healthier diet, improved quality of life and reduced IBS symptoms.},

   abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is of interest because of its putative role in stress and psychiatric disorders. Maternal separation is used as an animal model of early-life stress and of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Animals exposed to the paradigm show altered gut function together with heightened levels of arousal and corticosterone. Some probiotic organisms have been shown to be of benefit in IBS and influence the brain-gut axis. Our objective was to investigate the effects of maternal separation on BDNF under basal conditions and in response to the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve 6330. The study implemented the maternal separation model which we have previously described. Polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridisation were performed to measure the effect of maternal separation on both BDNF total variants and BDNF splice variant (exon) IV in the hippocampus. Maternally separated and non-separated rats were treated with B. breve 6330, to investigate the effect of this probiotic on BDNF total variant and BDNF exon IV expression. Maternal separation increased BDNF total variants (P<0.01), whilst having no effect on BDNF exon IV. B. breve 6330 increased BDNF total variants (P<0.01), and decreased BDNF splice variant IV, in non-separated rats (P<0.01). B. breve 6330 did not alter BDNF levels in the maternally separated rats. Maternal separation caused a marked increase in BDNF in the hippocampus. While B. breve 6330 influenced BDNF in normal animals, it had no significant effect on BDNF in those which were maternally separated. We have demonstrated that an orally administered probiotic can influence hippocampal BDNF.},

Adverse reactions to food can be divided into toxic and non-toxic. The last ones are classified as immunologically mediated, called "allergies", and non-immunologically mediated, commonly defined as "intolerances". The gut wall is directly involved in these adverse reactions to some foods, since it plays a key role in food absorption and in the regulation of the immunitary system. In this paper we discuss food intolerances and allergies, evaluating the available diagnostic methods and their scientific reliability and focusing on IgG analysis based immunoenzymatic test which is the most relevant test for intolerance diagnosis.},

Investigations carried out during the last decade have contributed to a better understanding of the basic mechanisms of chronic constipation (CC), in particular its relationship to colonic transit and anorectal function. All possible causes affecting the occurance of constipation (methabolic, deficiency of fiber, medicines) should be taken into consideration at the patient's examination and anorectal pathology should be excluded. Functional chronic constipation consists of three subtypes: slow transit constipation, dyssynergetic defecation and IBS with predominance of constipation. Rome criteria are useful guidelines for diagnosis of functional constipation. Treatment should be based on evidence-based diagnosis of CC variants. Treatment of an inert colon should be based on enterokinetic type prucalopride and lubiprostone. The possibilities of biophydbectherapy should obligatory be used in dyssynergetic defecation treatment.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is traditionally defined as a functional disorder - that is the presence of symptoms in the absence of demonstrable pathological abnormalities. In recent times, low grade inflammatory infiltrates in both the small and large bowel of some patients with IBS - often rich in mast cells, along with serological markers of low grade inflammation have focussed attention on IBS as an inflammatory disease. The observation that mast cells often lie in close association to enteric neurons, and in-vitro and in-vivo animal studies demonstrating that mast cell mediators may influence enteric motility provides a biologically plausible causal mechanism in IBS. Pilot studies on patients with IBS using the mast cell stabiliser sodium cromoglycate ('proof of concept') have been encouraging. The essential question remains why mast cells infiltrate the bowel of IBS patients. A disturbance of the 'brain-gut axis' is the current favoured hypothesis, whereby childhood stress or psychiatric comorbidity act via neuro-immune mechanisms to modulate low grade inflammation. An alternative hypothesis is that food allergy may be responsible. Serum specific IgE, and skin prick tests are not elevated in IBS patients, suggesting type 1 IgE mediated food allergy is not the cause. However questionnaire based studies indicate IBS patients have higher rates of atopic disease, and increased bronchial reactivity to methacholine has been demonstrated. In this review, we highlight the potential role of mast cells in IBS, and current and future research directions into this intriguing condition.},

   abstract = {For decades, if not centuries, a variety of products with what would now be regarded as prebiotic and probiotic properties have been consumed by the general public and advocated for their benefits on health and, in particular, gastrointestinal well-being. More recently, medical science has taken a great interest in the population of micro-organisms, the gut microbiota that normally populates the human gut, and the range of important functions carried out by the microbiota in health is being progressively defined. As a corollary, the list of disorders and diseases that may result from disruption of the normal microbiota and/or its interaction with the host continues to grow. A scientific basis for the use of probiotics and prebiotics is, therefore, beginning to emerge. Unfortunately, although progress has been made, the clinical evidence to support the use of these preparations lags behind. Nevertheless, a number of human disease states may benefit from the use of probiotics, most notably, diarrheal illnesses, some inflammatory bowel diseases, certain infectious disorders, and irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics promote the growth of "good" bacteria, and although a variety of health benefits have been attributed to their use, prebiotics have been subjected to few large-scale clinical trials.},

   abstract = {The description of the de novo development of irritable bowel syndrome following an episode of bacterial gastroenteritis (pos-infectious irritable bowel syndrome) illustrated the potential for a luminal factor (a bacterial pathogen) to cause this common gastrointestinal ailment. As a consequence of these and other observations, as well as results of experiments involving animal models, the enteric flora and the immune response that it generates in the host have, somewhat surprisingly, come centre-stage in irritable bowel syndrome research, given their potential to induce the pathophysiological changes that are associated with irritable bowel syndrome. While evidence for immune dysfunction both in the mucosa and systemically continues to accumulate, methodological limitations have hampered a full delineation of the nature of the microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome. The latter is eagerly awaited and may yet provide a firm rationale for the use of certain probiotics and antibiotics in irritable bowel syndrome, whose benefits have now been described with some consistency. Despite its prevalence, there is a striking lack of effective therapeutic options for irritable bowel syndrome. While there is reason for optimism in the management of irritable bowel syndrome with several promising new agents currently undergoing clinical trials, confirmation of the efficacy and safety of these agents in wider patient populations is awaited. A clearer understanding of the physiopathologic mechanisms underlying irritable bowel syndrome, as well as of interrelationships between irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, will likely be required before effective drug therapies can be found.},

The objective of this trial was to determine the efficacy and safety of linaclotide in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). METHODS: This phase 3, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial randomized IBS-C patients to placebo or 290 mu g oral linaclotide once daily in a 12-week treatment period, followed by a 4-week randomized withdrawal (RW) period. There were four primary end points, the Food and Drug Administration ' s (FDA ' s) primary end point for IBS-C (responder: improvement of >/= 30 % in average daily worst abdominal pain score and increase by >/= 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) from baseline (same week) for at least 50 % of weeks assessed) and three other primary end points, based on improvements in abdominal pain and CSBMs for 9 / 12 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored. RESULTS: The trial evaluated 800 patients (mean age = 43.5 years, female = 90.5 % , white = 76.9 % ). The FDA end point was met by 136 / 405 linaclotide-treated patients (33.6 % ), compared with 83 / 395 placebo-treated patients (21.0 % ) ( P < 0.0001) (number needed to treat: 8.0, 95 % confidence interval: 5.4, 15.5). A greater percentage of linaclotide patients, compared with placebo patients, reported for at least 6 / 12 treatment period weeks, a reduction of >/= 30 % in abdominal pain (50.1 vs. 37.5 % , P = 0.0003) and an increase of >/= 1 CSBM from baseline (48.6 vs. 29.6 % , P < 0.0001). A greater percentage of linaclotide patients vs. placebo patients were also responders for the other three primary end points ( P < 0.05). Significantly greater improvements were seen in linaclotide vs. placebo patients for all secondary end points ( P < 0.001). During the RW period, patients remaining on linaclotide showed sustained improvement; patients re-randomized from linaclotide to placebo showed return of symptoms, but without worsening of symptoms relative to baseline. Diarrhea, the most common AE, resulted in discontinuation of 5.7 % of linaclotide and 0.3 % of placebo patients. CONCLUSIONS: Linaclotide significantly improved abdominal pain and bowel symptoms associated with IBS-C for at least 12 weeks; there was no worsening of symptoms compared with baseline following cessation of linaclotide during the RW period.},

   abstract = {The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is still unknown. However, several lines of epidemiological, physiological, and clinical data suggest a role for intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Recent microbiology studies demonstrated differences in the composition of the intestinal microbiota between patients with IBS and healthy individuals. In addition, physiological studies have shown that manipulation of the intestinal microbiota by antibiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics can affect intestinal functions (eg, motility and sensation) relevant in the pathogenesis of IBS. Several randomized control trials comparing the effects of probiotics versus placebo in IBS have been published. Despite considerable differences in study design, dosing regimens, probiotic species used, and reported clinical end points, the current data indicate improving IBS symptoms and reducing the risk of persistent IBS symptoms. The data on the use of probiotics in children with IBS is more limited but is also suggestive for beneficial effects. The inconsistencies between the studies underline the need to look at each probiotic product separately for specific conditions, symptoms, and patient populations. This review article discusses the rationale for targeting the intestinal microbiota in patient with IBS and provides an overview and a critical evaluation of the currently available clinical data on the use of probiotics in the treatment of patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest a role for the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of functional bowel disorders (FBDs). Probiotic studies in FBDs generated inconsistent results suggesting a strain-specific and product-specific effect. AIM: To investigate the clinical efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (L-NCFM) and Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 (B-LBi07) in nonconstipation FBDs. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-control clinical trial of the probiotic bacterias L-NCFM and B-LBi07 twice a day (2x10(11) CFU/d) versus placebo over 8 weeks. Primary endpoints were global relief of gastrointestinal symptoms and satisfaction with treatment. Secondary endpoints were change in symptoms severity, well-being, and quality of life. Microbiological effect was assessed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction on fecal samples. RESULTS: Sixty patients (probiotic, n=31; placebo, n=29), 72% females, 84% whites, mean age 37 years. Abdominal bloating improved in the probiotics compared with the placebo group at 4 weeks (4.10 vs 6.17, P=0.009; change in bloating severity P=0.02) and 8 weeks (4.26 vs 5.84, P=0.06; change in bloating severity P<0.01). Analyses on the irritable bowel syndrome subgroup (n=33) showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: L-NCFM and B-LBi07 twice a day improve symptoms of bloating in patients with FBDs. These data supports the role of intestinal bacteria in the pathophysiology of FBD and the role for probiotic bacteria in the management of these disorders.},

METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We included randomized controlled trials in humans that used a specified probiotic in the treatment or prevention of Pouchitis, Infectious diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile Disease, Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea, Traveler's Diarrhea, or Necrotizing Enterocolitis. Random effects models were used to evaluate efficacy as pooled relative risks across the eight diseases as well as across probiotic species, single vs. multiple species, patient ages, dosages, and length of treatment. Probiotics had a positive significant effect across all eight gastrointestinal diseases with a relative risk of 0.58 (95% (CI) 0.51-0.65). Six of the eight diseases: Pouchitis, Infectious diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile Disease, and Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea, showed positive significant effects. Traveler's Diarrhea and Necrotizing Enterocolitis did not show significant effects of probiotcs. Of the 11 species and species mixtures, all showed positive significant effects except for Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bifidobacterium infantis. Across all diseases and probiotic species, positive significant effects of probiotics were observed for all age groups, single vs. multiple species, and treatment lengths. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Probiotics are generally beneficial in treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases. Efficacy was not observed for Traveler's Diarrhea or Necrotizing Enterocolitis or for the probiotic species L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and B. infantis. When choosing to use probiotics in the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal disease, the type of disease and probiotic species (strain) are the most important factors to take into consideration.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable oral antibiotic that acts locally in the gastrointestinal tract with minimal systemic adverse effects. Rifaximin received new labeling for reduction in the risk of the recurrence of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in patients with advanced liver disease in March of 2010. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of rifaximin. The efficacy and safety of rifaximin in reducing the risk of the recurrence of overt HE in patients with advanced liver disease, the new US Food and Drug Administration-approved indication, is the focus of this review. Emerging data on the use of rifaximin in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) are also evaluated. METHODS: MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1983 to January 31, 2011, were searched using the key terms rifaximin, L/105, secondary hepatic encephalopathy, irritable bowel syndrome, and Clostridium difficile. Ongoing trials were identified using the clinicaltrials.gov Web site. Abstracts from the annual meetings of the American College of Gastroenterology and Digestive Disease Week from 2004 to 2010 and references from relevant articles were reviewed. Only trials examining use of rifaximin in secondary prophylaxis of HE were included. Studies on the efficacy and safety of rifaximin in the treatment of acute episodes of HE have been recently summarized elsewhere and are not reviewed here. RESULTS: Literature search identified one trial on rifaximin use in secondary prevention of HE, six trials in patients with IBS, and six small studies and case reports in patients with CDI. In a trial of 299 patients, use of rifaximin 550 mg by mouth twice daily for 6 months for prevention of recurrent HE was associated with significantly fewer breakthrough HE episodes compared with placebo (rifaximin 22%, placebo 46%; P < 0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.28-0.64). The rifaximin group also had fewer hospitalizations involving HE compared with placebo (rifaximin 13.6%, placebo 22.6%; P = 0.01), with a hazard ratio of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.29-0.87). Rifaximin improved IBS symptom management in approximately 9% more patients than placebo in 2 prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 1260 patients (in the rifaximin group, 40.8% patients reported IBS symptom improvement compared with 31.7% in the placebo group; P < 0.001). The efficacy of rifaximin has been reported for the treatment of refractory or recurrent CDI in small studies, case series, and a case report. Optimal dosing, duration, and role of rifaximin for CDI management is unclear. In clinical trials of rifaximin for prevention of recurrent HE and for nonconstipated IBS, its safety profile was comparable to placebo. In the trial of rifaximin for prevention of recurrent HE, the most common adverse events occurring in 10% to 15% of patients were ascites, dizziness, fatigue, and peripheral edema. Most common adverse effects in IBS trials included abdominal pain, diarrhea, bad taste, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection, occurring in <10% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin can be an effective option for reduction in the risk of the recurrence of HE in patients with advanced liver disease. Studies suggest that rifaximin provides relief of global symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS and bloating. Use of rifaximin in CDI requires further study.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple clinical trials within the past decade have aimed to study the safety and efficacy of various probiotic strains in treating patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, there exists much heterogenicity in study design among these trials, namely, in bacterial strain, dose, dosage form, sample size, study duration, and population demographics. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the shortcomings of clinical trials using probiotic treatments in subjects with IBS, so that researchers may realize where limitations exist, allowing them to curtail these limitations in future trials. METHODS: An extensive PubMed search was conducted using the following keywords: probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome, probiotic pharmacokinetics, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Alosetron, Tegaserod, Alosetron, and Tegaserod safety profile. A total of 62 articles were used in constructing this review, with 20 original articles. RESULTS: Stark differences in study design existed among the 20 original articles analyzed, as well as an outstandingly high "placebo effect," making the ability to compare these articles as a means for evidence-based treatment therapy in IBS very difficult. CONCLUSIONS: Future large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials must be conducted, embodying minimal variability in study designs, to appropriately assess the efficacy of specific probiotic strains over placebo.},

   abstract = {Sensory limitation plays an important role in the evolution of animal behaviour. Animals have to find objects of interest (e.g. food, shelters, predators). When sensory abilities are strongly limited, animals adjust their behaviour to maximize chances for success. Bats are nocturnal, live in complex environments, are capable of flight and must confront numerous perceptual challenges (e.g. limited sensory range, interfering clutter echoes). This makes them an excellent model for studying the role of compensating behaviours to decrease costs of finding resources. Cavity roosting bats are especially interesting because the availability of tree cavities is often limited, and their quality is vital for bats during the breeding season. From a bat's sensory point of view, cavities are difficult to detect and finding them requires time and energy. However, tree cavities are also long lasting, allowing information transfer among conspecifics. Here, we use a simple simulation model to explore the benefits of tree selection, memory and eavesdropping (compensation behaviours) to searches for tree cavities by bats with short and long perception range. Our model suggests that memory and correct discrimination of tree suitability are the basic strategies decreasing the cost of roost finding, whereas perceptual range plays a minor role in this process. Additionally, eavesdropping constitutes a buffer that reduces the costs of finding new resources (such as roosts), especially when they occur in low density. We conclude that natural selection may promote different strategies of roost finding in relation to habitat conditions and cognitive skills of animals.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder. The role of pharmacotherapy for IBS is limited and focused mainly on symptom control. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of bulking agents, antispasmodics and antidepressants for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. SEARCH STRATEGY: Computer assisted structured searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane library, CINAHL and PsychInfo were conducted for the years 1966-2009. An updated search in April 2011 identified 10 studies which will be considered for inclusion in a future update of this review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing bulking agents, antispasmodics or antidepressants with a placebo treatment in patients with irritable bowel syndrome aged over 12 years were considered for inclusion. Only studies published as full papers were included. Studies were not excluded on the basis of language. The primary outcome had to include improvement of abdominal pain, global assessment or symptom score. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data from the selected studies. Risk Ratios (RR) and Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. A proof of practice analysis was conducted including sub-group analyses for different types of bulking agents, spasmolytic agents or antidepressant medication. This was followed by a proof of principle analysis where only the studies with adequate allocation concealment were included. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 56 studies (3725 patients) were included in this review. These included 12 studies of bulking agents (621 patients), 29 of antispasmodics (2333 patients), and 15 of antidepressants (922 patients). The risk of bias was low for most items. However, selection bias is unclear for many of the included studies because the methods used for randomization and allocation concealment were not described. No beneficial effect for bulking agents over placebo was found for improvement of abdominal pain (4 studies; 186 patients; SMD 0.03; 95% CI -0.34 to 0.40; P = 0.87), global assessment (11 studies; 565 patients; RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.33; P = 0.32) or symptom score (3 studies; 126 patients SMD -0.00; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.43; P = 1.00). Subgroup analyses for insoluble and soluble fibres also showed no statistically significant benefit. Separate analysis of the studies with adequate concealment of allocation did not change these results. There was a beneficial effect for antispasmodics over placebo for improvement of abdominal pain (58% of antispasmodic patients improved compared to 46% of placebo; 13 studies; 1392 patients; RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.55; P < 0.001; NNT = 7), global assessment (57% of antispasmodic patients improved compared to 39% of placebo; 22 studies; 1983 patients; RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.25 to 1.77; P < 0.0001; NNT = 5) and symptom score (37% of antispasmodic patients improved compared to 22% of placebo; 4 studies; 586 patients; RR 1.86; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.76; P < 0.01; NNT = 3). Subgroup analyses for different types of antispasmodics found statistically significant benefits for cimteropium/ dicyclomine, peppermint oil, pinaverium and trimebutine. Separate analysis of the studies with adequate allocation concealment found a significant benefit for improvement of abdominal pain. There was a beneficial effect for antidepressants over placebo for improvement of abdominal pain (54% of antidepressants patients improved compared to 37% of placebo; 8 studies; 517 patients; RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.12; P = 0.03; NNT = 5), global assessment (59% of antidepressants patients improved compared to 39% of placebo; 11 studies; 750 patients; RR 1.57; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.00; P < 0.001; NNT = 4) and symptom score (53% of antidepressants patients improved compared to 26% of placebo; 3 studies; 159 patients; RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.99; P = 0.001; NNT = 4). Subgroup analyses showed a statistically significant benefit for selective serotonin releasing inhibitors (SSRIs) for improvement of global assessment and for tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) for improvement of abdominal pain and symptom score. Separate analysis of studies with adequate allocation concealment found a significant benefit for improvement of symptom score and global assessment. Adverse events were not assessed as an outcome in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that bulking agents are effective for treating IBS. There is evidence that antispasmodics are effective for the treatment of IBS. The individual subgroups which are effective include: cimetropium/dicyclomine, peppermint oil, pinaverium and trimebutine. There is good evidence that antidepressants are effective for the treatment of IBS. The subgroup analyses for SSRIs and TCAs are unequivocal and their effectiveness may depend on the individual patient. Future research should use rigorous methodology and valid outcome measures.},

The clinical evidence supporting the use of these agents is based on data from high-quality clinical trials. The use of serotonergic agents for IBS in the United States is limited to the 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonist alosetron in the treatment of women with severe IBS with diarrhea refractory to traditional therapy.},

   abstract = {Historically, it has been reported that patients with undetected celiac disease (CD) may present with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) type symptoms. This has led to the recommendation by the American College of Gastroenterology Task force that patients presenting with diarrhea predominant IBS type symptoms should be serologically tested for CD. Concurrently speculative media data suggest that the US general public have increased their uptake of a gluten-free diet (GFD) far in excess of the known prevalence of CD. This may suggest that individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms are deriving benefit from a GFD even if they do not have CD. This has led to the scientific community considering the evidence for an emerging concept of non-celiac wheat sensitivity. There is a significant disparity in our views about what this phenomenon may be. There is also confusion about the nomenclature for this entity and indeed whether patients are suffering due to symptoms related to gluten or perhaps other components of wheat, for example fructans. In this month's edition of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, we see evidence to support the clinical concept of wheat sensitivity or intolerance. Irrespective of the nomenclature Carroccio provides a clinically applicable approach that may be adopted internationally by clinicians. This offers a new option in our armamentarium when seeing patients with IBS type symptoms.},

Recent experimental work suggests that the gut microbiota have an impact on the brain-gut axis. A group of experts convened by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) discussed the role of gut bacteria on brain functions and the implications for probiotic and prebiotic science. The experts reviewed and discussed current available data on the role of gut microbiota on epithelial cell function, gastrointestinal motility, visceral sensitivity, perception and behavior. Data, mostly gathered from animal studies, suggest interactions of gut microbiota not only with the enteric nervous system but also with the central nervous system via neural, neuroendocrine, neuroimmune and humoral links. Microbial colonization impacts mammalian brain development in early life and subsequent adult behavior. These findings provide novel insights for improved understanding of the potential role of gut microbial communities on psychological disorders, most particularly in the field of psychological comorbidities associated with functional bowel disorders like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and should present new opportunity for interventions with pro- and prebiotics.},

   abstract = {Recent disappointing developments in the pharmacotherapy of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have not dampened the enthusiasm surrounding linaclotide, a novel guanylate cyclase-C agonist for the management of constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C). Two recent phase 3 studies reporting on a single, daily dose of linaclotide are presented in this issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology. Importantly, these studies are the first to examine a provisional Food and Drug Administration (FDA) combined response endpoint for IBS-C, which mandates improvements of both abdominal pain and defecatory symptoms. Potential limitations of this FDA endpoint relate to a lack of inclusion of other potentially important IBS symptoms and an inability to directly compare findings with other recent IBS-C trials. Both studies successfully reached this endpoint in approximately one-third of study subjects, resulting in numbers needed to treat (NNT) of five to eight, to achieve an FDA responder. Individual symptom responses to linaclotide were seen in nearly 50% of participants, and potential explanations for these discrepancies when compared with the FDA endpoint are offered. Adequate relief measures also were assessed and, with NNTs of 3.4-6.8, compared favorably with other contemporary IBS-C studies. Overall, both linaclotide trials found the medication to be safe in terms of serious adverse events, though the secretagogue mechanism of action led to diarrhea in approximately one in five subjects. Together, these studies inspire several other important questions regarding linaclotide, including its role in the management of IBS-C relative to existing treatment options, such as lubiprostone. Greater clinical use of linaclotide will reveal whether the observed responses measured with the FDA provisional endpoint will translate into real-world experiences of improvement in IBS patients.},

The treatment of these disorders is often empiric and most current therapies are indicated for episodic constipation. Over time, most patients become refractory to one or more laxatives. Lubiprostone (Amitiza) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic-idiopathic constipation [6]. It is an oral bicyclic fatty acid that selectively activates type 2 chloride channels in the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelial cells, hence stimulating chloride secretion, along with passive secretion of sodium and water, inducing peristalsis and laxation, without stimulating gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Several trials have shown it to be effective in the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation, and recently also IBS-C. It has little systemic absorption and almost free of any serious adverse effects, however, occasionally can cause nausea. Based on the available evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that lubiprostone should be added to the short list of evidence-based pharmacotherapies for chronic constipation and IBS-C. Given the overlap between chronic constipation and IBS-C, clinicians can consider two strategies when deciding on the initial dose of lubiprostone. Based on current product labeling, it is recommended that 8 mug bid be started in patients with IBS-C whereas 24 mug bid be used in those with chronic constipation. Thus far, lubiprostone offers a novel approach to our therapeutic armamentarium, however, there is a need for more drugs with different mechanisms of action, in order to treat constipation that is often multifunctional.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abdominal bloating and distension are common symptoms in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), however, relatively little is known about their treatment. AIM: To review the treatment trials for abdominal bloating and distension. METHODS: A literature review in Medline for English-language publications through February 2010 of randomised, controlled treatment trials in adults. Study quality was assessed according to Jadad's score. RESULTS: Of the 89 studies reviewed, 18% evaluated patients with functional dyspepsia, 61% with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 10% with chronic constipation and 10% with other FGIDs. No studies were conducted in patients diagnosed with functional abdominal bloating. The majority of trials investigated the efficacy of prokinetics or probiotics, although studies are heterogeneous with respect to diagnostic criteria and outcome measures. In general, bloating and/or distension were evaluated as secondary endpoints or as individual symptoms as part of a composite score rather than as primary endpoints. A greater proportion of IBS patients with constipation reported improvement in bloating with tegaserod vs. placebo (51% vs. 40%, P<0.0001) and lubiprostone (P<0.001). A greater proportion of nonconstipating IBS patients reported adequate relief of bloating with rifaximin vs. placebo (40% vs. 30%, P<0.001). Bloating was significantly reduced with the probiotics, Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 (1x10(8) dose vs. placebo: -0.71 vs. -0.44, P<0.05) and B. animalis (live vs. heat-killed: -0.56+/-1.01 vs. -0.31+/-0.87, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Prokinetics, lubiprostone, antibiotics and probiotics demonstrate efficacy for the treatment of bloating and/or distension in certain FGIDs, but other agents have either not been studied adequately or have shown conflicting results.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare chronic physical health disorder prevalence amongst Australian adults with and without mental illness. METHOD: Total n=1,716 participants (58% female) with a mean age of 52 +/- 13 years (range: 18 to 89 years) completed an online survey of Australian adults in 2010. Outcome measures including prevalence of chronic physical conditions and self-reported body mass index (BMI) in n=387 (23%) with a self-reported mental illness diagnosis were compared to respondents without mental illness. RESULTS: A significantly higher proportion of participants with mental illness were obese (BMI >/= 30; 31 vs 24%, p=0.005). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for coronary heart disease, diabetes, chronic bronchitis or emphysema, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, and food allergies or intolerances (OR range: 1.54-3.19) demonstrated that chronic physical disorders were significantly more common in participants with a mental illness. CONCLUSION: Australian adults with a diagnosis for mental illness have a significantly increased likelihood of demonstrating chronic physical health disorders compared to persons without mental illness. IMPLICATIONS: Health professionals must be alert to the increased likelihood of comorbid chronic physical disorders in persons with a mental illness and should consider the adoption of holistic approaches when treating those with either a mental or physical illness.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Our aim was to measure concentrations of platelet-poor plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine and to assess any relationship with gastrointestinal symptomatology under fasting and fed conditions in alternating-type irritable bowel syndrome during both constipation and diarrhea periods separately. Results of the two periods were compared with each other as well as with the results of the controls. METHODS: Nine patients with alternating diarrhea and constipation symptoms and 9 controls were enrolled. Serial plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine was measured for 1 hour under fasting and for 3 hour after a standard carbohydrate meal. Patients underwent the same measurements during constipation and diarrhea periods separately. Serum 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Symptomatology was assessed throughout the study. RESULTS: Patients exhibited higher concentrations of platelet-poor plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine under fed conditions during diarrhea, especially at postprandial 30 minutes (p<0.05) compared with concentrations during constipation. Increases in postprandial plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations relative to fasting concentrations were also significantly higher during the diarrhea period than during constipation and in controls (p<0.05). Although there was no significant correlation between plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations and symptom scores, patients had worse postprandial symptomatology during diarrhea compared with controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Platelet-poor plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations after meal ingestion differ between constipation and diarrhea periods in alternating-type irritable bowel syndrome. Postprandial symptomatology is also more prominent during diarrhea. These results suggest that differences in plasma levels of serotonin between diarrhea and constipation may underlie the pathogenesis of alternating-type irritable bowel syndrome and could be involved in some aspects of symptomatology.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the relevant publications during the last 12 months supporting that diet can influence gas-related symptoms in the absence of a malabsorption state. RECENT FINDINGS: Gas symptoms during carbohydrate fermentation: a diet incorporating beans is well tolerated by a majority of individuals involved in a program of heart disease biomarkers. By contrast, in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, a diet avoiding fermentable carbohydrates improved gas-related abdominal symptoms. The rate of fermentation determines the production of abdominal symptoms, and many slowly fermentable fibers have a rapid fermentation profile that can generate abdominal symptoms. Modulation of visceral sensitivity: diet can influence gas symptoms by increasing the tolerability of the intestine to gas. Capsaicin decreases visceral hyperalgesia and improved bloating in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Changes in gas-producing bacteria: different strains of Lactobacillus have antimicrobial properties against gas-forming coliforms. New clinical studies show beneficial effects of prebiotics and probiotics on abdominal bloating. SUMMARY: Actual data suggest that diet could improve gas-related abdominal symptoms acting on several mechanisms: gas production, visceral hypersensitivity and modulation of gas-producing enteric bacteria.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: to define the frequency of secondary lactase deficiency (SLD) in patients with postinfectious IBS and to develop therapy for the correction of mild SLD in adult patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this study, 138 patients (the mean age - 33.9 +/- 9.09; F/M - 112/26) with postinfectious IBS were analyzed concerning lactase deficiency. All patients underwent intestinal endoscopy with biopsies from the mucosa of the descending duodenum in order to determine lactase deficiency twice before and after therapy. To diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) all patients underwent lactulose breath test during 2 hours. RESULTS: SLD was detected in 59.4% of patients with postinfectious IBS. Mild SLD was determined in 43.5% of patients, and severe SLD - in 15.9% of patients. SLD in all cases was accompanied by SIBO (the mean level of lactulose breath test was 101 +/- 37 ppm, N<20 ppm). In group patients who took the probiotic during 14 days in 70.8% of patients recovering of lactose metabolism in the small intestine and decreasing of the intensity of clinical symptoms were registered. The decrease of the lactulose breath test level (86.9 +/- 40.9 ppm; 17.4 +/- 6.6 ppm; p<0.01) and negative LQT (p<0.01) were registered in the first group. In group patients who took placebo during 14 days there was no positive effect in 68.4% of cases. CONCLUSION: the probiotic Bifiform, composed of Bifidobacterium longum 10(7) and Enterococcus faecium 10(7), demonstrated efficiency in correction of mild SLD in patients with postinfectious IBS and can be used to prevent SIBO.},

   abstract = {It is increasingly perceived that gut host-microbial interactions are important elements in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). The most convincing evidence to date is the finding that functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may develop in predisposed individuals following a bout of infectious gastroenteritis. There has been a great deal of interest in the potential clinical and therapeutic implications of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in IBS. However, this theory has generated much debate because the evidence is largely based on breath tests which have not been validated. The introduction of culture-independent molecular techniques provides a major advancement in our understanding of the microbial community in FGID. Results from 16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling approaches demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative changes of mucosal and faecal gut microbiota, particularly in IBS. Investigators are also starting to measure host-microbial interactions in IBS. The current working hypothesis is that abnormal microbiota activate mucosal innate immune responses which increase epithelial permeability, activate nociceptive sensory pathways and dysregulate the enteric nervous system. While we await important insights in this field, the microbiota is already a therapeutic target. Existing controlled trials of dietary manipulation, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics are promising, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. In this article, the authors provide a critical review of current hypotheses regarding the pathogenetic involvement of microbiota in FGID and evaluate the results of microbiota-directed interventions. The authors also provide clinical guidance on modulation of gut microbiota in IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tricyclic antidepressants have good efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), but their clinical use is limited by considerations of tolerability. Tianeptine, another antidepressant, acts as a selective serotonin reuptake enhancer. We compared tianeptine with amitriptyline for the treatment of patients with IBS-D. METHODS: We undertook a multicenter, randomized, open-label, non-inferiority clinical study that compared tianeptine with amitriptyline, each in combination with probiotics, for the treatment of IBS-D. Subjects were randomized to receive tianeptine (37.5 mg)/probiotics (Bacillus subtilis + Streptococcus faecium) or amitriptyline (10 mg)/probiotics (Bacillus subtilis + Streptococcus faecium) for 4 weeks. A total of 228 patients were analyzed by the intention-to-treat approach. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who had global relief of IBS symptoms at week 4. The secondary efficacy endpoints were intensity of abdominal pain/discomfort, stool frequency/consistency, quality of life, and overall satisfaction with treatment. KEY RESULTS: At week 4, non-inferiority of the tianeptine group to the amitriptyline group (treatment difference -15.1%; 95% CI -26.6% to -3.8%) was shown, with 81.1% (99 of 122 patients) of the patients in the tianeptine group and 66.0% (70 of 106 patients) in the amitriptyline group reporting global relief of IBS symptoms. The secondary endpoints also demonstrated non-inferiority of the tianeptine group to the amitriptyline group. Adverse events such as dry mouth and constipation were significantly lower in the tianeptine group than the amitriptyline group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Tianeptine is not inferior to amitriptyline for treating IBS-D in terms of both efficacy and tolerability.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The effect of probiotics on IBS symptoms has been mixed, but remains an intriguing treatment option with appeal to the patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients fulfilling the Rome II criteria were randomized double-blind to a daily intake of 500 ml of fermented milk containing at least 5 x 10(7) CFU/ml of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 or an equal volume of acidified milk for 8 weeks. Symptoms were assessed at baseline and weekly using a disease-specific validated symptom rating scale (IBS-SSI). The predefined primary outcome measure was patient reported adequate symptom relief. Adherence to study protocol were assessed by performing stool samples at the of the treatment period. RESULTS: Eight-one patients were screened. Sixty-four patients were randomized; 18 patients did not complete the study due to protocol violations or withdrew due to lack of effect. Fifty-two patients (13 males) completed the study as per protocol; mean age was 51.3 years (range 29-67). The proportion of patients reporting adequate symptom relief increased in both patient groups, but there was not any statistical difference between the groups. IBS-SSI scores did not differ statistically between the groups at the end of the treatment period, but improved during the study period in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: During this 8-week trial gastrointestinal symptoms improved. However, there was no difference between treatment with fermented milk containing probiotics or acidified milk. The effect of probiotics on IBS symptoms remains uncertain and further studies are warranted.},

Questionnaire survey was conducted at a girl's middle and high school. Students from seventh to eleventh grade participated in the examination on Rome II criteria, lifestyle and dietary habits. Worry and stress were measured with the Korean version Penn State Worry Questionnaire-Children and the Korean version Brief Encounter Psychosocial Instrument. Worry score was significantly higher in the IBS group (22.07 +/- 9.38, P < 0.001) than in the normal group (18.65 +/- 8.99) and was higher in high school students than in middle school students (P = 0.02). Stress score also was higher in the IBS group than in the normal group (P < 0.001) and was higher in the high school girls than in the middle school ones (P = 0.04). Of all the lifestyle factors influencing IBS preference for fatty foods, preference for salty foods, drinking alcohol and sleeping for less than six hours a day were found to be significant. Worry and stress seem to be associated with IBS symptoms. The findings of this study draw a clue that less worry and stress will help decrease IBS symptoms.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) affects approximately 5% of the population in western countries. The majority of those afflicted are women. Symptoms are often detrimental to the individual's quality of life and incur high healthcare costs to society. There is no evidence to support changes in lifestyle, laxatives or over the counter supplements. Tegaserod appeared to have promising results but was promptly removed from the market due to adverse cardiovascular events. In 2008, lubiprostone (Amitiza) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of women with IBS-C. It is thought to selectively activate type 2 chloride channels in the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelial cells leading to chloride secretion. As result, sodium and water are passively secreted generating peristalsis and laxation, without stimulating gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Several trials with predominantly female patients have shown it to be effective in the treatment of IBS-C. Overall lubiprostone was safe, well tolerated and associated with mostly benign side effects. Nausea and diarrhea were the most commonly reported. Though there are no head to head comparisons with other pharmacological agents, it is our opinion that lubiprostone should be tried as a first line pharmacotherapy for women with IBS-C at a dose of 8 mug BID. Thus far, lubiprostone offers a welcome approach to our narrow therapeutic armamentarium. Further understanding of its mechanism of action may provide additional insight into the pathophysiology of IBS-C.},

The sufferer identified a substantial body of patient data surrounding this potential therapy on social media sites, and this paper, therefore, also reports the findings from a systematic analysis of patient-centred, internet-based data surrounding this phenomenon. Data from 37 IBS sufferers commenting on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on their condition were located; approximately 70% of these reported that high-dose supplementation improved their IBS symptoms. A randomised controlled trial into the effect of vitamin D supplementation on IBS symptomatology to test this association scientifically is merited.},

Prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides stimulate colonic bifidobacteria. However, the effect of restricting fermentable short-chain carbohydrates on the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota has never been examined. This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effects of fermentable carbohydrate restriction on luminal microbiota, SCFA, and GI symptoms in patients with IBS. Patients with IBS were randomized to the intervention diet or habitual diet for 4 wk. The incidence and severity of symptoms and stool output were recorded for 7 d at baseline and follow-up. A stool sample was collected and analyzed for bacterial groups using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Of 41 patients randomized, 6 were withdrawn. At follow-up, there was lower intake of total short-chain fermentable carbohydrates in the intervention group compared with controls (P = 0.001). The total luminal bacteria at follow-up did not differ between groups; however, there were lower concentrations (P < 0.001) and proportions (P < 0.001) of bifidobacteria in the intervention group compared with controls when adjusted for baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, more patients in the intervention group reported adequate control of symptoms (13/19, 68%) compared with controls (5/22, 23%; P = 0.005). This randomized controlled trial demonstrated a reduction in concentration and proportion of luminal bifidobacteria after 4 wk of fermentable carbohydrate restriction. Although the intervention was effective in managing IBS symptoms, the implications of its effect on the GI microbiota are still to be determined.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The traditional classification of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as a functional disorder has been challenged in recent years by evidence of ongoing low-grade gastrointestinal tract inflammation. Inflammation may alter gastrointestinal motility and thus be central to the pathogenesis of IBS. Many foods and food additives are known to cause allergic contact dermatitis. We hypothesize that allergenic foods and food additives may elicit a similar allergic reaction in the gastrointestinal tract, giving rise to symptoms suggestive of IBS. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether skin patch testing to a panel of foods and food additives may identify food allergens that may be responsible for symptoms of IBS. METHODS: We performed skin patch testing to common allergenic foods and food additives on individuals with a history of or symptoms suggestive of IBS. We used patch test-guided avoidance diets to determine whether avoidance alleviates IBS symptoms. RESULTS: Thirty of the 51 study participants showed at least 1 doubtful or positive patch test result. Fourteen of the participants reported symptomatic improvement, ranging from slight to great, upon avoidance of the foods/food additives to which they reacted. LIMITATIONS: Double-blind study design, inclusion of only patients with active IBS, larger sample size, more balanced gender distribution, testing of more foods/food additives, and longer duration of and more precise quantification of response to dietary avoidance are suggested for future studies. CONCLUSION: Allergic contact enteritis to ingested foods, food additives, or both may contribute to IBS symptoms. Patch testing may be useful in identifying the causative foods.},

   abstract = {Diverticular disease imposes a significant burden on Western and industrialized societies. The traditional pathogenesis model posits that low dietary fiber predisposes to diverticulosis, and fecalith obstruction prompts acute diverticulitis that is managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics or surgery. However, a growing body of knowledge is shifting the paradigm of diverticular disease from an acute surgical illness to a chronic bowel disorder composed of recurrent abdominal symptoms and considerable psychosocial impact. New research implicates a role for low-grade inflammation, sensory-motor nerve damage, and dysbiosis in a clinical picture that mimics irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and even inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Far from being an isolated event, acute diverticulitis may be the catalyst for chronic symptoms including abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and "post-diverticulitis IBS." In addition, studies reveal lower health-related quality of life in patients with chronic diverticular disease vs. controls. Health-care providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for the multifaceted presentations of diverticular disease, and remain aware that it might contribute to long-term emotional distress beyond traditional diverticulitis attacks. These developments are prompting a shift in therapeutic approaches from widespread antimicrobials and supportive care to the use of probiotics, mesalamine, and gut-directed antibiotics. This review addresses the emerging literature regarding epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of chronic, symptomatic diverticular disease, and provides current answers to common clinical questions.},

One hundred sixty-five individuals diagnosed with AS were invited to complete a self-administered postal questionnaire regarding demographic data, diet, medication, and gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to two established disease assessment questionnaires, i.e., the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). No significant correlation between diet and disease activity was found. Overall, 27% of the patients reported aggravating gastrointestinal problems when consuming certain foodstuff(s). The 30% of patients who reported suffering from gastrointestinal pain had significantly greater disease activity and poorer functional status according to their BASDAI and BASFI scores (p < 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively). Patients who reported gastrointestinal pain had a significantly higher consumption of vegetables (p < 0.01) and lower consumption of milk and soured milk (p = 0.04). No significant correlation was found between the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and gastrointestinal symptoms. In multiple regression models, BASDAI and the consumption of vegetables were independent and statistically significant predictors of gastrointestinal pain. To conclude, in a group of Swedish AS patients, no correlation between diet and disease activity could be detected. There were, however, correlations between diet and gastrointestinal pain. Gastrointestinal problems were also found to be prevalent in AS, independent of NSAID usage.},

   abstract = {Chronic diarrhea is a frequent and challenging problem in clinical medicine. In a considerable subgroup of these, no underlying cause is identified and this is referred to as functional diarrhea. A consensus definition for functional diarrhea is based on loose stool consistency and chronicity and absence of coexisting irritable bowel syndrome. Underlying pathophysiology includes rapid intestinal transit, which may be worsened by stress or be triggered by a preceding infectious gastroenteritis. Diagnostic work-up aims at exclusion of underlying organic disease. Treatment starts with dietary adjustments, aiming at decreasing nutrients that enhance transit and stool and at identifying precipitating food items.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the intensity of symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) or the consequences of the disease on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This observational investigation assessed the symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, number of stools per day, and stool consistency), impact on HRQOL, and consequence on anal continence in 297 patients with IBS-D before and after 1 month of probiotic treatment with Lacteol (inactivated Lactobacillus LB plus fermented culture medium). METHODS: Functional assessment using a standardized visual analogue scale in order to quantify abdominal pain, bloating, and quality of life before and after 1 month of treatment with 2 capsules/day of Lacteol. The number of symptomatic days per week, number of stools, consistency of stools, secondary fecal incontinence rate, and potential trigger effect of food were quantified. A chi2 test was used to compare qualitative data and the variance of quantitative criteria was analyzed. RESULTS: The pain score decreased from 4.46+/-0.15 on a scale of 0-10 before treatment to 2.8+/-0.14 after treatment (p<0.0001). Bloating decreased from 4.49+/-0.18 to 2.5+/-0.15 on a scale of 0-10 (p<0.0001). The HRQOL score, which is inversely correlated with quality of life, decreased from 5.99+/-0.14 to 3.92+/-0.16 (p<0.0001). In this cohort study, the fecal incontinence rate secondary to diarrhea was clearly higher than that of the general population: 18% versus a prevalence of 9-10%, according to different studies. The mean number of stools per week decreased from 17.59 to 12.83 after treatment (p<0.0001). Before treatment, 54% of patients had watery stools and 46% had smooth stools; at the end of treatment, only 18.5% of patients still had watery stools, and 34% had normal stools. 52% of patients attributed their symptoms to their diet: 34% to vegetables, 29% to fruit, 15% to milk, 15% to fat, 6% to peppers and spices, and 4% to sugar. CONCLUSION: This observational investigation shed new light on patients with IBS-D, the HRQOL of which is altered by a fecal incontinence rate twice as high as that of the general population. Correlation with diet is confirmed by 1 out of 2 patients reporting poor tolerance of fiber and dairy products. Nutritional management should thus be part of these patients' treatment. Inactivated Lactobacillus LB plus fermented culture medium is a probiotic drug that has been used by physicians for a long time to treat patients with diarrhea. Strongly concentrated, it has no side effects and seems to help these patients. Due to a strong placebo effect in patients with this pathology, however, a controlled study is necessary to confirm this result.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our understanding of the importance of nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to improve. With increasing evidence or cumulative evidence, this article reviews the current data for the role of nutrition in IBD pathogenesis, disease exacerbation and its use in the treatment of IBD in a clinically relevant context. RECENT FINDINGS: Irritable bowel syndrome and obesity prevalence is rising, and is increasingly being recognized in patients with IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition remains highly relevant because of its efficacy and superior side-effect profile, even when considered against new pharmacological treatments, but requires patient motivation. We are now beginning to understand the importance of micronutrients such as iron and vitamin D, which may not only alter the bowel flora but also have an immune-modulatory effect. More recently, a prebiotic and probiotic combination has been used in a randomized trial for the treatment of IBD. SUMMARY: Macronutrient and micronutrient assessment should be an essential part of nutritional assessment of all patients with IBD. Although research is needed to further our understanding of the immune-modulatory effects of nutrients and supplements, better and more effective therapies combining nutrition and drug treatments like immune-suppressants should be explored.},

   abstract = {WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The complexity and diversity of irritable bowel syndrome's (IBS) presentation make treatment difficult. Although there are reviews and guidelines for treating IBS, they focus on the efficacy of medications for IBS symptoms using high-priority endpoints, leaving those of lower priority largely unreported. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive evidence-based review of the efficacy of medications to treat IBS symptoms, reported by IBS subtype, including secondary symptom endpoints that are often underreported. METHODS: A review of PubMed for articles published through December 2009 using the keywords: 'irritable bowel syndrome', 'therapeutics', 'antidiarrhoeals', 'laxatives', 'loperamide', 'dietary fibre', 'psyllium', 'calcium polycarbophil', 'bulking agents', 'lubiprostone', 'antidepressant agents, tricyclics' and its representative entities, 'serotonin reuptake inhibitors' and its representative entities, 'dicyclomine', hyoscyamine', 'peppermint oil', 'parasympatholytics' and its representative entities, 'rifaximin', 'pregabalin', 'gabapentin', 'clonidine', 'octreotide', 'atropine' and 'probiotics' is provided. Placebo-controlled trials were evaluated for the strength of evidence supporting the efficacy of each medication for explicit IBS symptoms. The efficacy of each medication for the symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, stool form, mucus, urgency, feeling of incomplete evacuation, flatulence, frequency, or borborgymi and overall symptoms are reported by IBS subtype. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature search identified 58 placebo-controlled trials of the efficacy of medications for treating IBS symptoms, which were critically evaluated and reported. The available studies suggest improvement in various IBS symptoms with loperamide, fibre supplements, lubiprostone, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs), antispasmotics, rifaximin, pregabalin, gabapentin, clonidine, octreotide and probiotic treatments. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This review is the first to compile the available evidence on the efficacy of the various pharmacological treatments for IBS on the basis of IBS subtype and specific symptoms. This evidence is limited and more well-designed studies are required to better inform therapeutic decision-making in the management of this difficult syndrome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of probiotics and prebiotics on the health of children. SOURCES: MEDLINE and LILACS were searched for relevant English and French-language articles. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Human milk is rich in prebiotic oligosaccharides and may contain some probiotics. No data suggest that addition of probiotics to infant formula may be harmful, but evidence of its efficacy is insufficient for its recommendation. Since data suggest that addition of specific prebiotic oligosaccharides may reduce infections and atopy in healthy infants, their addition to infant formula seems reasonable. Long-term health benefits of pro- and prebiotics on the developing immune system remain to be proven. Selected probiotics reduce the duration of infectious diarrhea by 1 day, but evidence in prevention is lacking, except in antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Some specific probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis, and other microorganisms may be beneficial in Helicobacter pylori gastritis and in infantile colic. Evidence is insufficient to recommend probiotics in prevention and treatment of atopic dermatitis. The use of probiotics in constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and extra-intestinal infections requires more studies. CONCLUSIONS: Duration of administration, microbial dosage, and species used need further validation for both pro- and prebiotics. Unjustified health claims are a major threat for the pro- and prebiotic concept.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Barostat methodology is widely used for assessing visceral perception. Different barostat protocols are described with respect to the measurement of rectal compliance and visceral perception. The choice of protocols affects the duration, which is normally 60-90 min, and accuracy of the procedure. This study aimed to shorten the procedure by using the semi-random distension protocol for both compliance and visceral perception measurement and a correction based on rectal capacity (RC) instead of minimal distension pressure (MDP). METHODS: Twelve irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients (7 females) and 11 healthy controls (8 females) underwent a barostat procedure. Compliance was determined during both a staircase distension and a semi-random protocol. Visceral perception data were compared as a function of pressure or relative volume, corrected for MDP or RC, respectively. RESULTS: Compliance measurement using the semi-random protocol instead of the staircase distension protocol resulted in an overestimation in healthy volunteers, but not in IBS patients. The overall conclusion that IBS patients had a lower compliance compared to controls was not different between protocols. Data presentation of the visceral perception scores as a function of corrected volume instead of pressures corrected for MDP did not alter the conclusion that sensation scores in IBS patients were higher as compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that barostat procedures may be shortened by approximately 20 min, without losing the ability to discriminate between healthy controls and IBS patients. A correction for RC instead of MDP may improve the accuracy of the procedure.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present qualitative study was to develop the items and support the content validity for the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module for pediatric patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and organic GI diseases, hereafter referred to as GI disorders. METHODS: The iterative process included multiphase qualitative methods. A literature review of GI disorders was conducted to generate domains for the focus interviews. Six pediatric gastroenterologists with extensive clinical experience in GI disorders provided expert opinion regarding the conceptual framework. A total of 98 participants, 46 pediatric patients ages 5 to 18, and 52 parents of patients ages 2 to 18 with physician-diagnosed GI disorders (chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease [Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis], gastroesophageal reflux disease), participated in the focus interviews and cognitive interviewing phases, including think-aloud and cognitive debriefing protocols. RESULTS: Eleven domains were derived from the qualitative methods involving patient and parent interviews and expert opinion, with content saturation achieved, resulting in 76 items. The 11 domains consisted of items measuring stomach pain, stomach upset, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, gas and bloating, constipation, diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods involving pediatric patients and their parents in the item generation process support the content validity for the new PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module. The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module is undergoing national multisite field testing as the next iterative phase.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in our ability to identify and characterize the human microbiota have transformed our appreciation of the function of the colon from an organ principally involved in the reabsorption of secretory fluids to a metabolic organ on a par with the liver. High-throughput technology has been applied to the identification of specific differences in microbial DNA, allowing the identification of trillions of microbes belonging to more than 1000 different species, with a metabolic mass of approximately 1.5 kg. The close proximity of these microbes with the mucosa and gut lymphoid tissue helps explain why a balanced microbiota is likely to preserve mucosal health, whereas an unbalanced composition, as seen in dysbiosis, may increase the prevalence of diseases not only of the mucosa but also within the body due to the strong interactions with the gut immune system, the largest immune organ of the body. Such abnormalities have been pinpointed as etiological factors in a wide range of diseases, including autoimmune disorders, allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and colon cancer. Recognition of the strong potential for food to manipulate microbiota composition has opened up new therapeutic strategies against these diseases based on dietary intervention.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recent evidence suggests a role for increased colonic permeability and mucosal mast cell (MC) mediators on symptoms related to the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Whether allergic factors (AFs) are involved in the pathophysiology of IBS is unclear. We addressed the question of the possible influence of an allergic background on IBS symptoms. METHODS: We assessed paracellular permeability, mucosal MCs counts, and spontaneous release of tryptase of colonic biopsy specimens in 34 IBS patients and 15 healthy subjects. The severity of IBS was assessed through self-reported questionnaires. All individuals were tested for the presence of AF, including self-perception of adverse reaction to food, personal and familial history of atopic disease, elevated total or specific immunoglobulin E against food/inhalant antigens, blood eosinophilia, and skin tests. RESULTS: IBS patients had significant enhanced colonic permeability, higher number of MCs, and spontaneous release of tryptase than healthy subjects. The severity of IBS was significantly correlated with colonic permeability (r=0.48, P=0.004), MCs counts (r=0.36, P=0.03), and tryptase (r=0.48, P=0.01). In 13 IBS patients (38.2%) having at least three AFs, symptoms scores, colonic permeability, MCs counts, and tryptase release by colonic biopsies were significantly higher than in those with less than three AFs. IBS patients with at least three AFs were more prone to diarrhea or alternating symptoms. None AF was found to be predictive of IBS severity. CONCLUSIONS: In IBS patients, the presence of an allergic background correlates with a more severe disease and diarrhea predominance, possibly by enhancing mucosal MC activation and paracellular permeability.},

   abstract = {Patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders constitute the majority of patients seeking healthcare for gastrointestinal symptoms in primary and secondary care. Of these disorders irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common and affects 10-20% in the Western world. IBS is a functional bowel disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, and alteration of bowel habits in the absence of any detectable organic cause. Sex and gender aspects are important in understanding differences between men and women in their risk and experience of IBS. Relative to men, women are diagnosed more frequently with IBS. Female patients are more likely to be constipated, complain of abdominal distension and of certain extracolonic symptoms. Given the variability of IBS, the most successful treatment will be comprehensive, involving multiple strategies. Efficacy, safety and tolerability are important in the evaluation of IBS therapies, as patients are likely to require long-term treatment. Laxatives, antidiarrheals or antispasmodics are common in the treatment of IBS but the majority of patients receive antispasmodics followed by prokinetic agents. In treatment of IBS there appears to be a greater clinical response to serotonergic agents developed for IBS in women compared to men. There is an absence of drugs licensed specifically for the treatment of IBS. Further studies with novel agents are needed, to evaluate new approaches to IBS management including gender specific behavioral therapies and better characterization of patient subgroups with regard to drug therapy so that personalized therapy can be tested.},

   abstract = {At upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to investigate unexplained diarrhea and iron deficiency anemia, duodenal biopsies are often taken to exclude a diagnosis of coeliac disease. While histology remains the gold standard for this diagnosis, recent developments in serological testing may overtake this as a first line test and biopsy restricted to confirming the diagnosis. Established coeliac disease on biopsy is straightforward, but early lesions may pose a challenge. Newer endoscopic procedures such as push-pull enteroscopy (balloon enteroscopy) with biopsy allow access to the small bowel beyond the second part of the duodenum. Controversy remains as to what constitutes the normal histology of the duodenum, and small bowel. Lymphocytic duodenosis (increased intraepithelial lymphocytes with normal villous architecture) in patients with negative coeliac serology can be associated with Helicobacter pylori, drugs, autoimmune and other diseases including food allergy. Full thickness small intestinal biopsies can aid in investigation of enteric neuropathies in severe dysmotility disorders. Biopsies are also taken to investigate malabsorption due to suspected infectious and metabolic disorders. Despite highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), immunosuppressed patients may be affected by duodenal pathogens. The histology of duodenal mucosa in acid related disorders reflects the damage seen at endoscopy. Although the prevalence of duodenal ulcer disease is decreasing, drugs causing ulceration remain an important disease entity. Recent observations in functional bowel disorders suggest that the duodenum may be a key site for pathology. In functional dyspepsia, patients with early satiety may have excess eosinophil infiltration, and the mast cell is probably a key player in the irritable syndrome in the small intestine.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, about which there has been considerable recent research. The aim of this article is to briefly review the aspects of IBS pathogenesis that involve the gastrointestinal microbiota, and then to critically appraise the recent and emerging evidence for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in its management. RECENT FINDINGS: The increased risk of developing IBS following gastroenteritis and the co-existence of dysbiosis, elevated luminal gas production and immune activation, indicate that the gastrointestinal microbiota may be a therapeutic target in IBS. Most systematic reviews indicate that probiotics have a beneficial impact on global IBS symptoms, abdominal pain and flatulence. However, recent trials indicate that different probiotics can improve, have no effect, or even worsen symptoms, confirming that benefits are likely to be strain and symptom-specific. There are no recent clinical trials of prebiotics in IBS, although previous studies indicate potential benefit at lower doses. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics have considerable potential in the management of IBS; however, the benefits are likely to be strain-specific. Preliminary studies suggest low doses of prebiotics may improve symptoms of IBS, although further robust clinical trials are required.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterised by episodes of abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. Many IBS sufferers believe that diet may play a role in triggering these episodes and may avoid certain foods. However relatively few studies have undertaken a dietary assessment in IBS sufferers to examine the wider impact of the condition upon diet. METHODS: 104 individuals with IBS were recruited and asked to complete a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The data were analysed against Dietary Reference Values for food energy and nutrients for the United Kingdom and observed intakes for the general population and for differences between IBS subtypes and the UK population. RESULTS: The data show that the dietary intakes of this population of IBS sufferers met the UK Dietary Reference Values. The average energy intake of the population exceeded the Estimated Average Requirements of the UK population and the balance of macronutrients was favourable. Intakes of selected micronutrients significantly exceeded the reference nutrient intakes. There were no differences between IBS subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The IBS subpopulation appear to have an adequate and balanced macronutrient intake with no evidence of inadequate micronutrient intake.},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 75 children (aging 3-14 years) with recurrent abdominal pain without gastrointestinal disease and fructose malabsorption followed a fructose restricted diet for 4 weeks. RESULTS: A median decline of weekly pain frequency from 4 (mean 3.64+1.6) before diet to 1 (mean 1.46+1.4; p<0.001) under fructose restriction was documented. The intensity of pain decreased from median 6 (mean 5.83+2.0) before intervention to median 3 (mean 3.4+2.5; p<0.001) with diet. Several additional life quality-influencing parameters such as daily stool frequency, nausea, problems to fall asleep, missed school days also improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that dietary fructose restriction represents a useful approach to address recurrent abdominal symptoms in children with fructose malabsorption.},

   abstract = {The enteric nervous system regulates diverse functions including gastrointestinal motility and nociception. The sensory neurons detect mechanical and chemical stimuli while motor neurons control peristalsis and secretion. In addition to this extensive neuronal network, the gut also houses a highly specialised immune system which plays an important role in the induction and maintenance of tolerance to food and other luminal antigens and in the protection of the epithelial barrier against pathogenic invasion. It is now increasingly recognised that the gastrointestinal immune system and the enteric nervous system closely interact. This review will focus on two common functional gastrointestinal disorders in which neuroimmune interaction is involved in the pathophysiology: i.e. postoperative ileus and irritable bowel syndrome. Postoperative ileus arises after almost every abdominal surgical procedure. Handling of the bowel results in local inflammation and activation of inhibitory neuronal pathways resulting in a generalised impairment of gastrointestinal motor function or ileus. On the other hand, postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) occurs in 10 to 30% of patients who suffer from infectious gastroenteritis. PI -IBS patients develop abnormal gastrointestinal sensitivity, motility and secretion which contribute to abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating and abnormal bowel function (diarrhoea and/or constipation). Biopsy studies revealed persistent low-grade inflammation and altered immunological function which may lead to abnormal pain perception and motor activity within the gastrointestinal tract.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effects of lactase deficiency on digestive symptoms and diet in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have not been well defined. We assessed lactose absorption and tolerance and the intake of dairy products in healthy volunteers (controls) and patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS). METHODS: Sixty patients diagnosed with D-IBS at the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Hangzhou, China and 60 controls were given hydrogen breath tests to detect malabsorption and intolerance after administration of 10, 20, and 40 g lactose in random order 7-14 days apart; participants and researchers were blinded to the dose. We assessed associations between the results and self-reported lactose intolerance (LI). RESULTS: Malabsorption of 40 g lactose was observed in 93% of controls and 92% of patients with D-IBS. Fewer controls than patients with D-IBS were intolerant to 10 g lactose (3% vs 18%; odds ratio [OR], 6.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-30.8; P = .008), 20 g lactose (22% vs 47%; OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.43-7.02; P = .004), and 40 g lactose (68% vs 85%; OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.08-6.42; P = .03). H(2) excretion was associated with symptom score (P = .001). Patients with D-IBS self-reported LI more frequently than controls (63% vs 22%; OR, 6.25; 95% CI, 2.78-14.0; P < .001) and ate fewer dairy products (P = .040). However, self-reported LI did not correlate with results from hydrogen breath tests. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of LI is related to the dose of lactose ingested and intestinal gas production and is increased in patients with D-IBS. Self-reported LI, but not objective results from hydrogen breath tests, was associated with avoidance of dairy products.},

   abstract = {Visceral hypersensitivity is an important characteristic feature of functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This study evaluated the effect of Schisandra chinensis on visceral hyperalgesia induced by neonatal maternal separation (NMS) in an IBS rat model. The visceromotor responses to colorectal balloon distension (CRD) were measured by abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) and electromyographic (EMG) activities. NMS control rats (receiving vehicle) underwent aggravated visceral pain in response to CRD as compared to normal rats, evidenced by the reduced pain threshold, enhanced AWR scores and EMG responses. Treatment with a 70% ethanol extract of S. chinensis (0.3g/kg and 1.5g/kg/day) for 7 days resulted in an increase in the pain threshold (NMS control: 19.1+/-1.0mmHg vs low-dose: 24.8+/-1.3mmHg and high-dose: 25.2+/-1.8mmHg, p<0.01), and abolished the elevated AWR and EMG responses to CRD in NMS rats (AUC values of EMG response curve were: 1952+/-202 in NMS control group vs 1074+/-90 in low-dose group and 1145+/-92 in high-dose group, p<0.001), indicating that S. chinensis could reverse the visceral hypersensitivity induced by early-life stress event. The result of ELSA measurement shows that the elevated serotonin (5-HT) level in the distal colon of NMS rats returned to normal level after treatment with S. chinensis. Moreover, the increase in pain threshold in rats treated with S. chinensis was associated with a decline of the mRNA level of 5-HT(3) receptor in the distal colon. All available results demonstrate that S. chinensis can reverse visceral hypersensitivity induced by neonatal-maternal separation, and the effect may be mediated through colonic 5-HT pathway in the rat.},

In addition, most common pharmacological approaches target IBS symptom management rather than treatment, and prescribed medications often result in significant side effects. The purposes of this review article are to: (1) address current issues related to IBS, including symptom presentation, diagnosis, and current treatment options; (2) summarize benefits and side effects of currently available pharmacological regimens and other symptom management strategies, with an emphasis on commonly used CAM therapies and diet modification; and (3) outline recommendations and future directions of IBS management based on systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and research findings.},

   abstract = {The mechanism of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is still incompletely understood in the world although large amount of investigations have been carried out on it. There are many studies on the pathophysiology of IBS in China, which has huge amount of population suffering from IBS with special ethnicity and culture, including Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We collected the literatures to show the results and discuss whether there were any differences in the pathophysiologic findings between China and other countries, whether there were any differences among different subtypes and how the pathophysiology correlated with the manifestations of patients. Gene polymorphism, disturbances of gastrointestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal infection and inflammation, psychological disturbances, food hypersensitivity and intolerance, and altered gut microflora were reviewed in this paper. Some conflicting outcomes between China and other countries were noted although most of them were similar.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we explored the prevalence rates and association factors of functional gastrointestinal disorders and the most common modes and frequencies of bowel habit among a cohort of Chinese adolescents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A stratified, randomized study based on cross-sectional data was performed using cluster sampling, which recruited 3671 students in Shanghai, China. All of the students were requested to complete a questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall, 88.05% +/- 0.28% of students had a bowel movement frequency of between 1 of 2 times per day and once every 2 days. Female students were found to have a lower bowel frequency than boys (P < 0.01). The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional constipation, and functional diarrhea were 19.89%, 24.93%, and 5.42%, respectively. Certain factors adjusted for age and sex were significantly associated with IBS (P < 0.05), including gastrointestinal tract infection (odds ratio [OR] 2.26), abuse of analgesics (OR 1.25), air swallowing to terminate hiccups (OR 1.28), fatigue (OR 1.15), and depression (OR 1.36). Other factors that were adjusted for age and sex, such as fried food (OR 1.68), air swallowing to terminate hiccups (OR 1.21), anxiety (OR 1.12), and depression (OR 1.57), were significantly associated with the presence of functional constipation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: : Our findings suggest that normal bowel frequency among Chinese urban adolescents may be defined as between 1 or 2 bowel movements per day and once every 2 days. IBS, functional constipation, and diarrhea are common disorders among this adolescent group.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study bowel patterns (function/habits) and its associated variables in an adult Saudi population. METHODS: In a cross sectional study, a 21-item questionnaire on bowel function (habits and frequency) was distributed to 10,000 high school students from all 5 regions of Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia, between February and April 2011. The randomly selected students, and 2 of their household or family members completed the questionnaire. Socio-demographic characteristics, eating habits, chronic diseases, and medications used were studied. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent (N=4918) were above the age of 16 years, of which 51.5% were males, and 88.1% were Saudis. It was observed that 18.1% of respondents perceived their bowel movements as being irregular and abnormal. There was no association between gender and abnormal/irregular bowel movement (OR: 0.89; p=0.13). Individuals over 60 years suffered from bowel pattern abnormalities (OR=1.8; p=0.01). Educational status (secondary), occupation (teacher and unemployed), diet habits, and chronic diseases of study subjects were also statistically significantly associated with their bowel movements. Respondents consuming more vegetables, fruits, meats, dairy products, and rice had significantly more normal bowel movements. Females tended to defecate less frequently as compared with males (p<0.0001). Approximately 40% of both genders have bowel movements at least once a day. CONCLUSION: Our results may serve as a baseline for appropriate intervention strategies, and also for future studies to substantiate, negate, or add more observations/conclusions.},
