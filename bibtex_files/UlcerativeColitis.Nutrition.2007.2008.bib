   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is consistent evidence that 50% of patients with acute, steroid-resistant flare of ulcerative colitis (UC) may achieve remission and avoid colectomy if treated with cyclosporin (CsA). However, follow-up of the responders has shown that most of them relapse and need surgery shortly after the response. We compared the records of our CsA-treated patients with those of other groups in order to help clarify this matter. METHODS: All patients admitted consecutively to our Unit with an attack of UC and treated with CsA between January 1991 and December 1999 were studied. Patients were begun on continuously-infused CsA at 2 mg/kg/day (1991-1996), or on NEORAL at an initial dose of 5 mg/kg/day (1996-1999). The maintenance treatment included oral CsA for 3-6 months with or without azathioprine (AZA). CsA failure was defined as a relapse requiring steroids with or without progression to colectomy; the cumulative probability of relapse/colectomy was assessed by Fisher's exact tests and Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Among the patients, 39/61 (63%) initially responded. These 39 included a fatality and 4 drop-outs (unrelated to the side-effects of CsA), leaving 34 patients for the study. Of these, 61% and 35% were colectomy-free at 1 and 7 years, respectively; the corresponding figures were 80 and 60% respectively in the subset treated with AZA, but 47% and 15% in the AZA-untreated subgroup (p= 0.0007 at 7 years). Among the 34 patients, 44% were relapse-free at 1 year, but all had relapsed at 7 years (p = 0.0635). The overall resort to colectomy was 72%, while 19% of the patients remained colectomy-free. CONCLUSION: Sixty percent of a cohort of patients with steroid-refractory colitis responded to CsA and 60% of these responders retained the colon after 1 year. These figures fell to 35% at 7 years but improved to 60% on AZA. The overall need for colectomy remains high in these patients and toxicity must be monitored.},

   abstract = {Despite the accumulation of positive data, the role of azathioprine (AZA) in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis is still controversial. We looked at the follow-up of the ulcerative colitis patients who, after responding to either steroids or cyclosporin (CsA), received AZA at our referral center for over a decade. The 39 patients (29 m/10f) were treated between 1991 and 2007. Twenty-five of them had responded to CsA, the remaining 14 to corticosteroids. AZA was usually overlapped with either of the two agents at the initial dose of 2mg/kg/day. The definitions of remission, relapse, and AZA toxicity followed commonly agreed criteria. The median duration of the AZA treatment was 14 months (<1-201). Fifty-two percent and 14%, respectively, of the CsA and the steroid responders needed surgery (overall rate=38%). The figures were 32 and 15 at the first year. The majority of the patients had 1-2 relapses often in connection with withdrawal of AZA; only 3 of these relapsers needed hospitalization. AZA caused toxicity in 16/39 (41%) patients, requiring withdrawal in 23% of the cases; leukopenia (17%) and hepatitis/cholestasis (10%) ranked first and second for frequency. All of the patients in whom AZA was stopped (or reduced) relapsed. In conclusion, the 1-year colectomy rates compare favorably with the figures reported by the literature. By contrast, the toxicity rates were higher than expected. Failure to genotype or to use escalating AZA doses can only be hypothesized as causes.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advances in bioengineering have spawned various imaging modalities which have revolutionized endoscopy. Some of these technologies provide real-time, high-resolution, subcellular imaging. This review provides an update on these technologies and their role in the evaluation of colorectal neoplasia. RECENT FINDINGS: Narrow band imaging has been shown to visualize capillary patterns in early cancer and is complementary to magnification endoscopy. Optical coherence tomography has been used to evaluate neoplastic progression and distinguish Crohn's from ulcerative colitis. Confocal endomicroscopy has been shown to accurately predict neoplastic changes in polyps and identify areas of neoplasia in patients with colitis. Among the spectroscopic techniques, autofluorescence is best studied in the colon and has been used to identify adenomas and dysplasia in inflammatory bowel disease. Endocytoscopy is a relatively new technology but shows promise in distinguishing neoplastic lesions. SUMMARY: Recently a number of imaging technologies have arisen that have the potential to enhance our detection of colorectal neoplasia. Several of these, such as autofluorescent imaging and narrow band imaging, are 'red flag' techniques which enhance our visualization of mucosal change(s). Complementary technologies, such as confocal endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy, provide subcellular imaging. Combined with a 'red flag' technique, these may transform our approach to colonoscopy, allowing the real-time detection and diagnosis of neoplasia.},

Past medical history is significant for ulcerative colitis (UC) diagnosed at 9 years of age. Colonoscopy one week prior to admission revealed pancolitis. He was treated with Asacol 800 mg three times per day and prednisone 20 mg/d. He was subsequently admitted to the hospital for an exacerbation of his UC and started on intravenous solumedrol. He had improvement of his abdominal pain and diarrhea. The patient complained of new onset of chest pain upon initiating Asacol therapy. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed non-specific ST-T wave changes with T-wave inversion in the lateral leads. Echocardiogram (ECHO) revealed low-normal to mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function. The left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery were mildly prominent measuring 5 mm and 4.7 mm, respectively. His chest pain completely resolved within 24-36 h of discontinuing Asacol. A repeat echocardiogram performed two days later revealed normal left ventricular function with normal coronary arteries (< 3.5 mm). Onset of chest pain after Asacol and immediate improvement of chest pain, as well as improvement of echocardiogram and ECG findings after discontinuing Asacol suggests that our patient suffered from a rare drug-hypersensitivity reaction to Asacol.},

   abstract = {Ghrelin possesses various biological activities -- it stimulates growth hormone (GH) release, plays a major role in energy metabolism, and is one of the hormones that affects body composition. It also plays a role in modulating immune response and inflammatory processes. In this study we aimed to determine whether serum ghrelin levels had correlation with markers associated with disease activation. We also investigated any probable relationship between serum ghrelin level and nutritional status. Serum levels of ghrelin and its relationship with disease activity and nutritional status were evaluated in 34 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 25 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and 30 healthy controls. Serum ghrelin levels, serum IGF-1 and GH levels, and markers of disease activity (sedimentation, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen) were measured in all subjects. Body composition and nutritional status was assessed by both direct (by anthropometry) and indirect (by bioimpedance) methods. Serum ghrelin levels were significantly higher in patients with active UC and CD than in those in remission (108 +/- 11 pg/ml vs. 71 +/- 13 pg/ml for UC patients, P < 0.001; 110 +/- 10 pg/ml vs. 75 +/- 15 pg/ml for CD patients, P < 0.001). Circulating ghrelin levels in UC and CD patients were positively correlated with sedimentation, fibrinogen and CRP and was negatively correlated with IGF-1, BMI, TSFT, MAC, fat mass (%), and fat free mass (%). This study demonstrates that patients with active IBD have higher serum ghrelin levels than patients in remission and high levels of circulating ghrelin correlate with the severity of disease and the activity markers. Ghrelin levels in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients show an appositive correlation with IGF-1 and bioelectrical impedance analysis, body composition, and anthropometric assessments. Finally, we arrived at the conclusion that ghrelin level may be important in determination of the activity in IBD patients and evaluation of nutritional status.},

   abstract = {GPx2, the gastrointestinal glutathione peroxidase, is a selenoprotein predominantly expressed in the intestine. An anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic potential has been inferred from the development of colitis and intestinal cancer in GPx1 and GPx2 double knockout mice. Further, induction by Nrf2 activators classifies GPx2 as a protective enzyme. In contrast, enhanced COX-2 expression is consistently associated with inflammation. The antagonistic roles and an intriguing co-localization of GPx2 and COX-2 prompted us to investigate their possible mutual regulation. Both enzymes were upregulated in tissues of patients with colorectal cancer and colitis, and co-localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. A stable knockdown of GPx2 in HT-29 cells by siRNA resulted in a high basal and IL-1-induced expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1, enzymes required for the production of the pro-inflammatory PGE(2). Accordingly, si-GPx2 cells released high concentrations of PGE(2). Observed effects were specific for GPx2, since COX-2 and mPGES-1 expression was not affected by selenium-deprivation which resulted in the disappearance of GPx1. It is concluded that GPx2 by compartmentalized removal of hydroperoxides silences COX-2 activity and suppresses PGE(2)-dependent COX-2 expression. Thus, GPx2 may prevent undue responses to inflammatory stimuli and, in consequence, inflammation-driven initiation of carcinogenesis.},

Twenty percent to 40% of patients with IBD develop extraintestinal inflammation and symptoms, known as extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs).1-7 The most common EIMs affect the joints, skin, eyes, and biliary tract. The EIMs associated with IBD bear a negative impact on patients with UC and CD. Thus, the successful treatment of EIMs is essential for improving the quality of life of IBD patients. For most EIMs, their resolution often parallels that of the active IBD in both timing and therapy required. However, some EIM such as axial arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis run a clinical course independent of IBD disease activity. The advent of biologic response modifiers, e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) inhibitors, has improved the treatment of IBD and its associated EIMs. This article reviews the therapeutic experiences of the 2 most widely used anti-TNF neutralizing antibodies, infliximab and adalimumab, for immune-mediated EIM of IBD.},

   abstract = {A total of 15-19% of ulcerative colitis patients have a severe attack at some time during their illness. As a consequence of its high associated mortality and morbidity rates, a close collaboration between gastroenterologists and surgeons in their management is mandatory, in order to define, as best as possible, the timing of surgery (i.e., colectomy) when patients fail to respond to medical treatment or worsen despite optimal medical treatment. The first step in medical treatment consists of using intravenous corticosteroids as they have been demonstrated to reduce drastically the mortality rates. However, at 1 year approximately 25% of patients become corticosteroid dependent and 30% require colectomy, which can consistently affect their quality of life. Therefore, intravenous ciclosporin has been proposed as a rescue therapy, with a further improvement of short-term efficacy and reduction of surgery requirement. Nevertheless, its use is associated with a risk of toxicity and intravenous ciclosporin is not easy to use in non-specialised centres. In addition, long-term studies suggest that colectomy is often only delayed and relapse frequent. Consequently, some authors evaluate the potential use of infliximab. Available data are encouraging, reporting a significant short-term reduction in colectomy rate. Nevertheless, additional trials are required to better define the more effective and safe treatment option(s), for both the short- and long-term, in this patient setting; a question addressed in ongoing trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Toxic megacolon (TMC) denotes a rare clinical syndrome accompanied by colonic dilatation, and is a serious complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study assessed the clinical and radiologic characteristics of TMC in children with IBD. METHODS: A systematic search identified patients with IBD-associated TMC and matched them by age to controls with ulcerative colitis without evidence of TMC. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared with conditional logistic regression. Abdominal X-rays were interpreted by two blinded radiologists and findings were compared with controls. RESULTS: Ten children with TMC (median age 12.6 [7.3-15.5] yr) were matched with 20 controls (median age 12.8 [6.8-15.2] yr). Altered level of consciousness and hypotension were rare in children with TMC. Fever (P= 0.005), tachycardia (P= 0.0001), dehydration (P= 0.01), and electrolyte abnormalities (P= 0.0002) were more common in children with TMC than controls. Air-fluid levels (P= 0.005), intestinal thickening (P= 0.006), and abnormal colonic haustra (P= 0.012) were more commonly seen on X-rays of TMC cases. Transverse colon luminal diameter >or=56 mm was strongly suggestive of TMC (sensitivity 90%, specificity 90%, area under the ROC curve 0.91). No child with TMC died and 70% required colectomy during admission. Two of the three with intact colons at discharge required second-line therapy during the subsequent year. CONCLUSIONS: Colonic dilatation >or=56 mm in children with IBD strongly suggests TMC, if clinical signs are present. Mental alteration and hypotension may be less common in children than in adults. TMC in children with IBD is associated with poor outcome, with a high rate of corticosteroid failure.},

TGFbeta1 dysregulation has been observed in several chronic human diseases, including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and colon carcinoma. In the first two conditions, a marked oxidative stress is consistently present, while in the third one, levels of reactive oxygen species tend to be significantly lower than in the surrounding normal tissue. Lipid-derived compounds such as the aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) or cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) were shown able to induce expression and synthesis of TGFbeta1, an event which can be detrimental or beneficial, essentially depending on its actual intensity. Understanding how specific dietary lipids may influence the complex molecular signaling underlying this cytokine expression, may provide new indications for therapeutic and preventive strategies in inflammatory bowel diseases and colon carcinoma.},

   abstract = {Bowel commensals appear to be an important source of antigens that drive the chronic immune inflammation characteristic of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)]. Biopsy-associated bacteria are assumed to be particularly relevant in bacteriological investigations of IBD because they are assumed to be located on the mucosal surface and hence close to immunological cells. This investigation analysed the bacterial collections associated with bowel biopsies, aspirates of residual fluid after bowel cleansing and faeces from IBD patients and non-IBD subjects in Edmonton, Canada, and Mexico City, Mexico. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA gene sequences produced profiles of the bacterial collections and their similarities were compared. Similarity analysis showed that the profiles did not cluster according to disease status, but that Canadian and Mexican profiles could be differentiated by this method. Comparison of biopsy, aspirate and faecal samples obtained from the same subject showed that, on average, the profiles were highly similar. Therefore, biopsy-associated bacteria are likely to represent, at least in part, contaminants from the fluid, which resembles a faecal solution, that pools in the bowel after cleansing prior to endoscopy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have varied in the criteria used to classify patients as having Crohn disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), or indeterminate colitis (IC). Patients undergoing an initial evaluation for IBD will often undergo a series of diagnostic tests, including barium upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through, abdominal CT, upper endoscopy, and colonoscopy with biopsies. Other tests performed less frequently include magnetic resonance imaging scans, serological testing, and capsule endoscopy. The large amount of clinical information obtained may make a physician uncertain as to whether to label a patient as having CD or UC. Nevertheless, to facilitate the conduct of epidemiological studies in children, to allow the entry of children into clinical trials, and to allow physicians to more clearly discuss diagnosis with their patients, it is important that clinicians be able to differentiate between CD and UC. METHODS: A consensus conference regarding the diagnosis and classification of pediatric IBD was organized by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. The meeting included 10 pediatric gastroenterologists and 4 pediatric pathologists. The primary aim was to determine the utility of endoscopy and histology in establishing the diagnosis of CD and UC. Each member of the group was assigned a topic for review. Topics evaluated included differentiating inflammatory bowel disease from acute self-limited colitis, endoscopic and histological features that allow differentiation between CD and UC, upper endoscopic features seen in both CD and UC, ileal inflammation and "backwash ileitis" in UC, patchiness and rectal sparing in pediatric IBD, periappendiceal inflammation in CD and UC, and definitions of IC. RESULTS: Patients with UC may have histological features such as microscopic inflammation of the ileum, histological gastritis, periappendiceal inflammation, patchiness, and relative rectal sparing at the time of diagnosis. These findings should not prompt the clinician to change the diagnosis from UC to CD. Other endoscopic findings, such as macroscopic cobblestoning, segmental colitis, ileal stenosis and ulceration, perianal disease, and multiple granulomas in the small bowel or colon more strongly suggest a diagnosis of CD. An algorithm is provided to enable the clinician to differentiate more reliably between these 2 entities. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations and algorithm presented here aim to assist the clinician in differentiating childhood UC from CD. We hope the recommendations in this report will reduce variability among practitioners in how they use the terms "ulcerative colitis," "Crohn disease," and "indeterminate colitis." The authors hope that progress being made in genetic, serological, and imaging studies leads to more reliable phenotyping.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variants in the DLG5 gene have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in samples from some, but not all populations. In particular, 2 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), R30Q (rs1248696) and P1371Q (rs2289310), have been associated with an increased risk of IBD, and a common haplotype (called haplotype "A") has been associated with reduced risk. METHODS: We genotyped R30Q, P1371Q, and a haplotype A tagging SNP (rs2289311) in a New Zealand Caucasian cohort of 389 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 406 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 416 population controls. Each SNP was tested for association with disease susceptibility and clinical phenotypes. We also performed a meta-analysis of R30Q data from published association studies. RESULTS: The haplotype A tagging SNP was associated with reduced risk of IBD at the 0.05 significance level (P=0.036) with an allelic odds ratio of 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.99). Association with haplotype A was strongest (odds ratio approximately 0.57) in UC patients with familial IBD or extraintestinal manifestations. The R30Q and P1371Q polymorphisms were not significantly associated with UC, CD, or IBD. Analysis of male and female data did not find any gender-specific associations. Meta-analysis gave no evidence of association of R30Q with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis demonstrates that the minor allele of R30Q is not a risk factor for IBD across populations. This study provides some evidence that DLG5 haplotype A is associated with reduced risk of IBD in the New Zealand Caucasian population, but this association will need to be replicated in an independent sample.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Published association studies of the TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in caucasian populations have inconsistent results. We tested two TLR4 variants for association with IBD in the New Zealand caucasian population and assessed the cumulative evidence for association of TLR4 Asp299Gly and IBD. METHODS: The TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms were genotyped and tested for case-control frequency differences in a New Zealand white cohort of 389 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 405 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 416 population controls. Meta-analysis using a random effects model was performed to test whether 299Gly carriage was associated with UC, CD, or phenotypes of CD patients. RESULTS: There were no significant allele or genotype frequency differences between cases and controls or between CD phenotypes in our New Zealand data. Meta-analysis did not identify any significant associations between CD phenotypes and 299Gly carriage. However, meta-analysis demonstrated significantly higher 299Gly carrier frequencies in CD patients (odds ratio 1.45, 95% CI 1.11-1.90) and in IBD patients (odds ratio 1.36, 95% CI 1.01-1.84) compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis provides evidence that Asp299Gly is associated with CD and IBD in whites. Only the Asp299Gly polymorphism has been consistently genotyped in previous TLR4 studies with IBD patients, therefore other TLR4 variants with stronger associations with IBD may exist. Additional well-powered studies of Asp299Gly and other TLR4 variants are urgently needed.},

Seal and fish oils are rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and possibly therefore high doses of nasoduodenally administered seal oil rapidly relieved inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated joint pain in two recent studies. In the present study, we compared the effects of short-term oral administration of seal oil and cod liver oil on IBD-related joint pain, leucotriene B(4) level, serum fatty acid profile and IBD activity. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 21 had Crohn's disease and 17 ulcerative colitis. Ten milliters of seal oil (n=18) or cod liver oil (n=20) was self-administered orally 3 times a day for 14 days before meals in a double-blind setting. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two intervention groups or between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. There was a tendency toward improvement in several joint pain parameters after both seal oil and cod liver oil administration. Further, plasma leucotriene B(4) concentration, serum Sigma n-6 to Sigma n-3, and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) to eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) ratios were similarly reduced after administration of seal oil and cod liver oil. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in the two treatment groups were seen; in both groups, the changes in several joint pain parameters, leucotriene B(4) level of plasma, and serum fatty acid profile were putatively favourable.},

   abstract = {Fermented foods have been used since prehistoric times. Their number, variety and geographic origin are considerable, and different substrates and agents including bacteria, yeasts and moulds have been used in their preparation. In the last few decades the scientific approach to the study of the participating microorganisms and the resulting products have provided a better understanding of their biological importance. Among the many health-related properties of fermented foods, effects on blood pressure have been described after casein hydrolysis by lactic acid bacteria. Peptides with antimicrobial activity, mainly against Gram-negative bacteria, and derived from casein have also been identified. This could explain, at least in part, the antidiarrheal effects of fermented products including those on traveler's diarrhea and against colonization by Helicobacter pylori. One of the best known advantages of fermented milk products is their capacity to improve lactose tolerance in hypolactasic subjects. With the growing prevalence of allergies and inflammatory bowel diseases, considerable interest has been focused on the effects of lactic acid bacteria in these conditions; there is evidence that these agents are associated with improvements in allergy; no such evidence exists for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. A cholesterol-lowering capacity has also been described for some microorganisms. Not all the fermenting microorganisms have probiotic capacities as the latter are strain-specific.},

   abstract = {Digestive tract proteases are best known for their proteolytic activity in the digestion of alimentary proteins. However, during the last decade, a possible role of proteases as signalling molecules has been emphasized with the discovery of a novel class of G-protein coupled receptors located on cell membranes that may be activated by proteolytic cleavage of their N-terminal extracellular domain. Type 2 protease-activated receptors (PAR-2) are cleaved by serine-proteases such as trypsin and tryptase. PAR-2 is present in many intestinal cell types and particularly on epithelial cells. Multiple functions have been demonstrated in the gut for PAR-2, including epithelial permeability, mainly the intercellular permeability that is of paramount importance in the equilibrium between the external milieu (digestive contents) and the submucosal immune system. Alterations of both tissue and luminal levels of proteases or serine-protease activity may affect gut permeability and subsequently the immune status of the mucosa. Activation of PAR-2 on epithelial cells may directly affect cytoskeleton contraction by triggering phosphorylation of myosin light chain with subsequent changes in tight junction permeability. Enhanced fecal protease level has been recently reported in both organic (ulcerative colitis) and functional (irritable bowel syndrome) intestinal disorders and may play a role in the pathogenesis of such diseases.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and 2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89 months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive, multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab, thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.},

We evaluated the association of the polymorphisms of MTHFR, MTR, MTRR and TCN2 genes with ulcerative colitis in Central China. METHODS: 168 patients were genotyped for these polymorphisms and compared to 219 matched controls. RESULTS: Methionine synthase 2756G allele frequency was higher in ulcerative colitis than in controls 0.15 (95% C.I. 0.11-0.19) vs 0.09 (95% C.I. 0.07 - 0.12), (P = 0.0137) and predicted ulcerative colitis risk in logistic regression, with an Odds ratio at 1.8 (95% C.I. 1.15-2.84). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677TT genotype was 2.7-fold more prevalent in individuals with pancolitis than in those with left colitis or proctitis, with respective percentages of 27.3 (95% C.I.16.4-42.0) and 10.5 (95% C.I. 6.3-17.1) (P = 0.0123). The carriage of 677TT or 677CT/1298AC genotypes of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase was more frequent in cases with pancolitis than in subjects with left colitis or proctitis (P = 0.0048), with an Odds ratio adjusted by age and sex at 3.3 (95% C.I. 1.4-7.9), P = 0.0084) in logistic regression. CONCLUSION: Methionine synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase are genes of vitamin B12 and folate cellular metabolism associated respectively with risk and extent of ulcerative colitis, at least in Central China. This finding may open new insights, particularly for the potential interest in treating patients carrying the 677TT MTHFR genetic trait and a deficit in folate.},

   abstract = {In order to increase dietary folic acid intake and to improve nutritional status regarding folate by controlling homocysteine concentrations, ten patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease in the colon and ulcerative colitis) received individualized nutritional guidance and were followed up as outpatients for 2 months. The following procedures were performed at the beginning of the study (T0), after 1 month (T1) and at the end of the study (T2): collection of anthropometric data (weight and height), dietary data (24 h diet recall), and blood under fasting condition for the determination of serum folic acid, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and vitamin B12. Plasma folic acid deficiency was not detected but hyperhomocysteinemia was present in six individuals and C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased (>0.5 mg/dl) in seven patients. After the patients were instructed there was a significant increase in vitamin B6 intake (about 35%) and in folate intake (49.6%). Mean plasma levels of folic acid, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 did not change, but there was a significant decrease of CRP at T1, 0.36 mg dl(-1) on average (P = 0.01), which was maintained at T2. We conclude that the increased folate intake reported by this group of patients was not reflected in improved serum concentrations of folic acid and homocysteine. However, the guidelines for the patients probably induced them to choose a more adequate diet, providing nutrients that help control the inflammatory process.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data are sparse on the role of capsule endoscopy (CE) in classifying disease type, affecting patient management, and altering health outcomes in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a retrospective cohort analysis of symptomatic pediatric patients with previously diagnosed IBD, we evaluated whether data from CE would result in the recognition of new disease locations that could alter the current diagnosis and provide information to better manage the underlying disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CE evaluation was performed in 28 patients an average of 4.2 +/- 3 years after original IBD diagnosis, and was prompted by exacerbation of underlying disease, growth failure/weight loss, or presurgical evaluation. Of the patients, 7 of 28 (25%) were originally diagnosed as having ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 5) or indeterminate colitis (IC) (n = 2), while 21 of 28 (75%) were diagnosed as having Crohn disease (CD). RESULTS: Following CE examination, 4 of 5 patients with UC and 1 of 2 patients with IC (total 5 of 7, 71% of UC/IC patients) had their disease reclassified to CD based upon newly diagnosed small bowel mucosal lesions. Moreover, 13 of 21 (62%) patients with CD were found at the time of CE examination to have more extensive small bowel disease with newly diagnosed jejunal disease found in 12 of 13 (92%) patients. In the 5 newly diagnosed patients with CD, all of them had therapeutic changes made. One capsule retention occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Capsule endoscopy may lead to reclassification of IBD from UC/ IC to definitive CD. In addition, previously diagnosed patients with CD may be found to have a more significant burden of small bowel disease. Taken together, this information may facilitate more targeted and effective therapies and potentially lead to better patient outcomes.},

   abstract = {Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor involved in intestinal lipid homeostasis and cell proliferation. Here we show that haploinsufficiency of LRH-1 predisposes mice to the development of intestinal inflammation. Besides the increased inflammatory response, LRH-1 heterozygous mice exposed to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid show lower local corticosterone production as a result of an impaired intestinal expression of the enzymes CYP11A1 and CYP11B1, which control the local synthesis of corticosterone in the intestine. Local glucocorticoid production is strictly enterocyte-dependent because it is robustly reduced in epithelium-specific LRH-1-deficient mice. Consistent with these findings, colon biopsies of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis show reduced expression of LRH-1 and genes involved in the production of glucocorticoids. Hence, LRH-1 regulates intestinal immunity in response to immunological stress by triggering local glucocorticoid production. These findings underscore the importance of LRH-1 in the control of intestinal inflammation and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: To provide a review of studies on prognosis in ulcerative colitis by reviewing the relevant population-based cohort studies. On the basis of incidence and population studies, ulcerative colitis has a favourable clinical course, with good quality of life, a chronic course characterized by at least one relapse, and a surgery rate of 30% after 10 years from diagnosis. Patients affected by severe ulcerative colitis have a higher risk of colectomy, and some clinical variables may predict the disease's clinical course. Most patients respond to steroids and only a low percentage become dependent, or non-responders to steroids. Patients who have a long-lasting ulcerative colitis (>10 years) or are affected by an extensive disease have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer, while those treated with immunosuppressants for long period of time may have an increased risk of developing lymphomas. Data on mortality in ulcerative colitis patients are not homogeneous, but if a real risk exists it is in patients with extensive or severe disease. The evidence that patients with severe ulcerative colitis are often non-smokers may explain why in one study the mortality rate was lower.},

   abstract = {AIM: We investigated the contribution of variants of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and MDR1 genes in the predisposition and response to medical therapy in a large pediatric cohort of patients with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 200 patients with CD, 186 patients with UC, 434 parents (217 trios), and 347 healthy unrelated controls were investigated. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms -G308A and -C857T of the TNF-alpha gene and C3435T of the MDR1 gene were investigated and correlated with clinical subphenotypes and efficacy of medical therapy. RESULTS: The frequency of the -308A allele of the TNF-alpha gene was significantly increased in both patients with CD (15%; odds ratio [OR] = 2.79; P < 0.01) and patients with UC (11%; OR = 1.96; P < 0.003) compared with controls (6%). Carriers of this allele were 27% in CD (OR = 2.94; P < 0.01) and 19% in UC (OR = 1.86; P = 0.015) compared with 11% in healthy controls. No significant difference was found for both the -C857T and C3435T single-nucleotide polymorphisms. With the genotype/phenotype analysis, no correlation in patients with UC with the MDR1 gene was found. CD carriers of the -308A allele had a higher frequency of surgical resection (35% vs 20%; OR = 2.1; P = 0.035) and more frequent resistance to steroids (22% vs 8%; OR = 0.29; P = 0.032) compared with noncarriers. These findings were confirmed by stepwise logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: In our pediatric cohort, the promoter -308A polymorphism of TNF-alpha but not the MDR1 gene is significantly involved in the predisposition to both CD and UC. This polymorphism carries a significant reduction in response to steroid therapy, probably leading to a more frequent need for surgical resection.},

We hypothesized that anti-OmpC, in the absence of anti-S cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), is an assay that overestimates the presence of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of patients evaluated at our institution between January 2002 and June 2006 revealed that 170 had serodiagnostic immunological assays performed as part of an evaluation for possible IBD. The assays were screened for a pattern in which anti-OmpC was present in the absence of ASCA and ANCA. RESULTS: Seven patients between 3 and 20 years of age were discovered to be positive for anti-OmpC but negative for ASCA and ANCA. These patients were determined to have significant medical conditions without combined radiographic, endoscopic, or histological evidence of IBD. Despite the reported 85% positive predictive value of anti-OmpC for IBD, none of the 7 patients with isolated anti-OmpC had a diagnosis of CD or UC. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-OmpC, in the absence of ASCA and ANCA, is a serological pattern noted in a subset of medically complex cases in children and young adults without CD or UC.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Panproctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the operation of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis. The long-term nutritional consequences after pouch surgery are unknown. We have assessed the nutritional status of the essential trace elements-zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium-in patients several years (median, 10 (range, 2-15) years) after surgery. METHODS: Fifty-five patients with uncomplicated ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and 46 healthy control subjects were studied. A dietary assessment of trace element intake was undertaken by using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. The patients' trace elements status for zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium was assessed by measuring their concentrations in blood. RESULTS: The dietary intake of individual trace elements was similar in both groups (all P values > 0.4). There was no significant difference in the concentrations of plasma copper, zinc, and selenium between patients and healthy control subjects (all P values > 0.07). The concentration of whole blood manganese was significantly higher (P = 0.004) in patients (median, 178.5 nmol/l; range, 59-478 nmol/l) compared with healthy control subjects (median, 140 nmol/l; range, 53-267 nmol/l). Four (7 percent) patients had manganese concentrations more than three standard deviations of the mean of control group (>255 nmol/l). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that patients who have had uncomplicated pouch surgery have a normal dietary intake of trace elements and do not develop deficiencies in copper, zinc, manganese, and selenium. However, these patients may be at increased risk of manganese toxicity.},

We expanded our previous study of 14 patients and furthermore evaluated the success of weaning patients from infliximab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 27 pediatric patients with UC who were treated with infliximab instead of undergoing a colectomy. Patients with new-onset UC refractory to intravenous steroids for 5 to 10 days and patients with non-steroid-dependent UC with an acute exacerbation were classified as acutely ill (n = 16); patients with chronic steroid-dependent UC were classified as chronically ill (n = 11). The Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index (LCAI) was measured for all patients at baseline and at 1 and 2 months after treatment with infliximab was initiated. Patients were regarded as successfully treated if they remained off steroids and avoided colectomy. RESULTS: The acutely ill group had a mean LCAI score of 11.4 at induction and 0.3 after 2 months. The chronically ill group had a mean LCAI score of 11.2 at induction and 5.5 after 2 months. Treatment with infliximab was successful in 75% of acutely ill patients and in 27% of chronically ill patients. Infliximab was discontinued in 80% of successfully treated patients (83% of acutely ill, 67% of chronically ill). These patients had an average of 10 infusions and a mean follow-up time of 10 months from their last infliximab infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that infliximab is more effective in acutely ill UC patients than in patients with chronic steroid-dependent UC. In addition, some patients treated with infliximab can be weaned from infliximab and maintain remission.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human Paneth cell alpha-defensins, especially DEFA5, are involved in maintaining homeostasis of the human microbial microflora. Since breakdown of normal mucosal antibacterial defence occurs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), variants in the DEFA5 gene could be associated with IBD risk. SUBJECTS: A cohort of 25 patients with indeterminate colitis (IC), 405 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 385 with Crohn's disease (CD), were compared with 201 control individuals from the Canterbury region in New Zealand. METHODS: A 15 kb haplotype block surrounding DEFA5 contained 35 HapMap markers which were polymorphic in Caucasians. Four markers (A-D) were selected to tag 27 of the 35 markers at r(2)>0.68, and were genotyped in DNA samples. RESULTS: Minor allele frequencies for all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were somewhat elevated in patients. Subgroup analysis showed SNP A had odds ratio 1.44 in UC patients with pancolitis (95% C.I. 1.07-1.94), SNP B odds ratio 2.37 in CD patients with onset prior to 17 years age (95% C.I. 1.12-5.03), SNP C odds ratio 1.68 in UC patients with left colonic localisation (95% C.I. 1.12-2.52), and SNP D had odds ratio 1.56 in CD patients with one or more relatives with IBD (95% C.I. 1.03-2.35). Two two-marker haplotypes and one three-marker haplotype were associated with UC (p-values 0.025-0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The SNPs genotyped in our study were surrogates for common variants, and observed associations between these and IBD status are likely due to linkage disequilibrium with a functional common DEFA5 variant. Identifying such functional variants will be prioritized in subsequent work.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the role that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter of the tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene play in the risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in a New Zealand population, in the context of international studies. METHODS: DNA samples from 388 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 405 ulcerative colitis (UC), 27 indeterminate colitis (IC) and 201 randomly selected controls, from Canterbury, New Zealand were screened for 3 common polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha receptor: -238 G-->A, -308 G-->A and -857C-->T, using a Taqman assay. A meta-analysis was performed on the data obtained on these polymorphisms combined with that from other published studies. RESULTS: Individuals carrying the -308 G/A allele had a significantly (OR = 1.91, c2 = 17.36, P < 0.0001) increased risk of pancolitis, and a 1.57-fold increased risk (OR = 1.57, c2 = 4.34, P = 0.037) of requiring a bowel resection in UC. Carrying the -857 C/T variant decreased the risk of ileocolonic CD (OR = 0.56, c2 = 4.32, P = 0.037), and the need for a bowel resection (OR = 0.59, c2 = 4.85, P = 0.028). The risk of UC was reduced in individuals who were smokers at diagnosis, (OR = 0.48, c2 = 4.86, P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: TNF-alpha is a key cytokine known to play a role in inflammatory response, and the locus for the gene is found in the IBD3 region on chromosome 6p21, known to be associated with an increased risk for IBD. The -308 G/A SNP in the TNF-alpha promoter is functional, and may account in part for the increased UC risk associated with the IBD3 genomic region. The -857 C/T SNP may decrease IBD risk in certain groups. Pharmaco- or nutrigenomic approaches may be desirable for individuals with such affected genotypes.},

In this cross-sectional study thirty patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), twenty-one with Crohn disease (CD) and twenty-four controls were investigated (mean age: UC, 40.8 (sd 12.1); CD, 37.6 (sd 11.0); control, 31.5 (sd 8.4) years). Fatty acid composition of plasma lipids was determined by high-resolution capillary GLC. In plasma phospholipids, significantly higher values of eicosapentaenoic (20 : 5n-3), docosapentaenoic (22 : 5n-3) and gamma-linolenic (18 : 3n-6) acids were found in control patients and patients with UC as compared to patients with CD [median % (weight by weight), control v. UC v. CD : 20 : 5n-3, 0.09 (interquartile range (IQR) 0.05) v. 0.14 (IQR 0.10) v. 0.16 (IQR 0.10), P < 0.05; 22 : 5n-3, 0.14 (IQR 0.10) v. 0.27 (IQR 0.16) v. 0.31 (IQR 0.10), P < 0.001; 18 : 3n-6, 0.02 (IQR 0.02) v. 0.03 (IQR 0.02) v. 0.05 (IQR 0.03), P < 0.05]. When compared to the control, values of the principal n-3 and n-6 long-chain PUFA, arachidonic acid (20 : 4n-6) and DHA (22 : 6n-3) were significantly higher in patients with UC but not in patients with CD [median % (w/w), UC v. control: 20 : 4n-6, 8.43 (IQR 3.23) v. 6.92 (IQR 2.96), P < 0.05; 22 : 6n-3, 1.22 (IQR 0.56) v. 0.73 (IQR 0.39), P < 0.05]. As seen there are considerable differences between the long-chain PUFA status of patients suffering from UC or CD. The data obtained in the present study do not support the concept of eicosapentaenoic acid or DHA deficiency in patients with either UC or CD.},

   abstract = {The colonic epithelium is lined along its apical membrane with approximately 10(14) bacteria/g of tissue. Commensal bacteria outnumber mammalian cells in the gut severalfold. The reason for this degree of commensalism probably resides in the recent recognition of the microbiome as an important source of metabolic energy in the setting of poorly digestible nutrients. As in many themes in biology, the host may have sacrificed short-term benefit, i.e. nutritional advantages, for long-term consequences, such as chronic inflammation or colon cancer. In the present review, we examine the role of TLR (Toll-like receptor) signalling in the healthy host and the diseased host. We pay particular attention to the role of TLR signalling in idiopathic IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and colitis-associated carcinogenesis. In general, TLR signalling in health contributes to homoeostatic functions. These include induction of antimicrobial peptides, proliferation and wound healing in the intestine. The pathogenesis of IBD, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease may be due to increased TLR or decreased TLR signalling respectively. Finally, we discuss the possible role of TLR signalling in colitis-associated neoplasia.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe two cases of successfully prevented refeeding syndrome in a high-risk group of patients. METHODS: Case 1 was a 70-y-old woman who presented with a 4-mo history of poor dietary intake and ill health due to a connective tissue disease leading to myositis and dysphagia and complicated by respiratory failure needing mechanical ventilation. Twelve hours after starting nasogastric tube feeding, she developed a cardiac arrest from which she was successfully resuscitated. Repeated attempts to wean her from the ventilator failed. Case 2 was a 15-y-old girl who was readmitted after a total colectomy for severe ulcerative colitis with diarrhea and vomiting leading to significant weight loss. Her body mass index was 11.4 kg/m(2). RESULTS: In case 1, after consultation by the clinical nutrition team, the diagnosis of refeeding syndrome was made and the patient was duly started on a high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, multivitamin and trace-element supplements, and electrolyte infusion. Subsequently she was successfully weaned from the ventilator. In case 2, further investigation by the clinical nutrition team revealed low baseline electrolyte concentrations including potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphate and low serum albumin. Her low body mass index and baseline electrolyte concentrations put her at high risk of developing refeeding syndrome. She was initially started on low-calorie feeding, multivitamin and minerals, and her electrolytes were carefully monitored. She made a good recovery. CONCLUSION: Refeeding syndrome is a life-threatening, underdiagnosed, treatable condition but there is a need for a wider awareness of the condition among health professionals.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is characterised by elevated colonic lumenal serine protease activity. The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the origin of this elevated serine protease activity, (2) to evaluate if it may be sufficient to trigger alterations in colonic paracellular permeability (CPP) and sensitivity, and (3) to examine the role of the proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) activation and signalling cascade in this process. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Faecal enzymatic activities were assayed in healthy subjects and patients with IBS, ulcerative colitis and acute infectious diarrhoea. Following mucosal exposure to supernatants from control subjects and IBS-D patients, electromyographic response to colorectal balloon distension was recorded in wild-type and PAR-2(-/-) mice, and CPP was evaluated on colonic strips in Ussing chambers. Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and phosphorylated myosin light chain were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The threefold increase in faecal serine protease activity seen in IBS-D patients compared with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) or infectious diarrhoea is of neither epithelial nor inflammatory cell origin, nor is it coupled with antiprotease activity of endogenous origin. Mucosal application of faecal supernatants from IBS-D patients in mice evoked allodynia and increased CPP by 92%, both of which effects were prevented by serine protease inhibitors and dependent on PAR-2 expression. In mice, colonic exposure to supernatants from IBS-D patients resulted in a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and delayed redistribution of ZO-1 in colonocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated colonic lumenal serine protease activity of IBS-D patients evokes a PAR-2-mediated colonic epithelial barrier dysfunction and subsequent allodynia in mice, suggesting a novel organic background in the pathogenesis of IBS.},

Though there are several studies evaluating nutrition in patients with IBD from the developed world, the data from developing countries are scanty, where under nutrition is predominant. METHOD: 62 patients with IBD (55 ulcerative colitis [UC] and 7 Crohn's disease [CD] patients) and 42 healthy subjects (HS) were evaluated for nutrition using dietary survey, anthropometric and biochemical parameters. RESULTS: Of the patients with IBD, 23 (37%) had active disease and 39 (63%) were in remission. Daily intake of calories (1725 Kcal/d [500-2458] vs. 2239 Kcal/d [1835-3000], p<0.0001), protein (40 g/d [19-96] vs. 50 g/d [29-73], p=0.001) and iron (9 mg/d [1-16] vs. 12 mg/d [9-16], p<0.0001) and anthropometric parameters of nutrition such as body mass index (BMI) (19.8 [13.7-27.5] vs. 23 [17.9-27.2], <0.0001), biceps (0.3 mm [0.1-1.9] vs. 0.5 mm [0.2-1.0], p<0.0001) and triceps (0.7 mm [0.2-2.9] vs. 1.2 mm [0.5-2.3], p<0.0001) skin fold thickness (BSF, TSF) and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC, 25.9 mm [15-35] vs. 26.8 mm [23-32] <0.04) were lower among the IBD patients than among the HS. Though patients with CD had a lower level of haemoglobin (median 9.2 g vs. 10.8 g, respectively; p<0.05) and serum total protein (median 6 g, range 3-7 vs. 7 g, range 3-9, respectively; p<0.05), serum albumin, BMI, BSF and TSF thicknesses, MAMC and daily intake of protein, calories, calcium and iron were comparable between UC and CD patients. Though daily dietary intake was comparable between patients with active disease and those in remission yet patients with active disease had lower BMI, MAMC and serum protein level. CONCLUSION: Under nutrition is common in patients with IBD, particularly in those with acute exacerbation.},

   abstract = {Surgical resection of primary colonic lymphoma can be an important therapeutic tool. We performed a nonrandomized retrospective descriptive study at the University hospital tertiary care center. From January 1990 to June 2002, a total of 15 patients with primary colonic lymphoma were identified from the tumor registry at University of Alabama at Birmingham and retrospectively reviewed under Institutional Review Board approved protocol. Demographic data, clinical features, treatment method (surgery and/or chemotherapy), recurrence rate, and survival were analyzed. The results are presented as mean +/- standard deviation or median and range. Differences in survival were evaluated by the log-rank test and the interval of disease-free survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Main outcome measures included surgical results, morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rate. Mean age was 51.5 years (standard deviation 16.4), 33 per cent were male and 67 per cent were female. Presenting symptoms were diarrhea (53.5%), lower gastrointestinal bleeding (13.3%), and nausea and vomiting (46.7%) secondary to low-grade obstruction. Concomitant colorectal disease was present in one patient with ulcerative colitis. Preoperative diagnosis of lymphoma was made in 13 patients (87%) with colonoscopy and biopsy. CT scan was performed in all patients; and none had radiographic evidence of systemic extension. Only one patient had a history of lymphoproliferative disease and exposure to radiation. The most common disease location was the cecum (60%), followed by the right colon (27%), and the sigmoid colon (13%). The mean lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) value was 214.9 u/L (range 129-309). Thirty-three per cent of the patients had an LDH value that was above the upper normal limit. LDH returned to normal after treatment in all patients. Operations performed consisted of right hemicolectomy (13), total proctocolectomy with ileal J J-pouch (1), and sigmoid colectomy (1). Eighty-seven per cent had negative margins at the time of operation. Twelve patients received postoperative chemotherapy (80%). According to the clinical classification of primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of the gastrointestinal tract (Lugano, 1993) all patients corresponded to stage IE. Mean hospital stay was 6.4 days (range 3-26). There was no surgical mortality and the morbidity rate was 20 per cent (3 patients). One patient had a systemic recurrence (7%) approximately 4 months after surgical resection. Mean follow-up was 31 months (median 2-73). Surgical resection of localized, primary colonic lymphoma provides excellent local disease control and should be considered a primary treatment option. The role of chemotherapy remains controversial depending on the grade, stage, and extension of residual disease.},

   abstract = {Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are exposed to nutritional risk. Malnutrition in Crohn's Disease (CD) and to a somewhat lesser in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is very frequent. Depending on the severity of the disease, weight loss has been reported in 65% to 76% of those with CD and in 18% to 62% of those with UC. The role of Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is essential in very severe cases where enteral nutrition is not tolerated or standard drug therapy is not effective. Nutritional therapy is important for the correction of nutritional deficiency, especially in cases where elective surgical treatment is required. This study examined the effects of preoperative TPN administration in patients with IBD. Since 1990, 29 pts, 13 (44.8%) male and 16 (55.2%) female with severe IBD; 16 (55.2%) with UC and 13 (44.8%) with CD were treated with TPN in our department in the preoperative period. Evaluation of this group was compared with a group which was not treated with TPN preoperatively: 61 pts, 34 (55.7%) male, 27 (44.3%) female; 50 (82%) with CD, 11 (18%) with UC. Evaluation of this group was compared with the group of patients who were subjected to surgical procedure without prior TPN administration, in total a number of 61, of whom 34 (55.7%) were male and 27 (44.3%) female patients. In this group, the number of patients with CD and UC was 50 (82%) and 11(18%) respectively. During the course of the study, the following parameters were examined: Body mass index (BMI), Disease Activity Index (CDAI/AI), laboratory parameters and the number of hospital days. The parameters were analysed before the surgical intervention, and one week and six months after the surgical intervention. The duration of the application of TPN was 12.5 +/- 5 days. The analysis of these parameters has shown that there is no statistically significant difference in the number of hospital days in both groups, which was 18.9 +/- 8.9 in the intervention group and 18.9 +/- 6.5 days in the control group, p = 0.9808, but analysis of the Disease Activity (CDAI/AI) has shown that patients who were on TPN were in a more severe stage of the disease. In the TPN treated group of patients none, 0 pts (0%), of the pts had no Index of Activity, 1.7 pts (24.1%) had Index 2 and 22 (75.9%) had Index 3. In the other group 3 pts (4.9%) had Index 1; 39 pts (63.9%) had Index 2 and 19 pts (31.2%) had Index of Activity 3. During the monitoring period of six months the activity of the disease was lower in patients treated with TPN. The BMI in the group of patients treated with TPN was lower in both sexes. It was lower than 18.4 in 7 males and 5 females; between 18.4 and 19.9 in 2 males and 4 females; between 19.9 and 25 in 3 males and 6 females; between 25 and 19.9 in 1 male and 1 female; there were no pts with BMI higher than 29.9. In the control non-TPN group, 5 males and 3 females had BMI < or = 18.4; 2 males and 5 females had between 18.4 and 19.9; 23 males and 13 females had between 19.9 and 25; 3 males and 5 females had between 25 and 29.9 and 1 male and 1 female had BMI higher than 29.9. The BMI had an increasing trend in the postoperative period in both groups. The laboratory parameters that we examined were: number of erythrocytes and sedimentation, number of leukocytes, haemoglobin levels, total number of lymphocytes, albumin level, C-reactive protein, orosomucoid, electrolytes; sodium, potassium, calcium and serum iron, the enzymes (AP, AST and ALT); level of bilirubin and urea and creatinine. The results were analysed using the Tukey honest significant difference test (HSD), ANOVA and Student t-test. Statistically significant differences were observed between preoperative and postoperative period in both groups. The intergroup comparison showed significant differences in the level of albumin, AST, ALT and bilirubin.},

Occurring during a critical period of growth and development, pediatric Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis require special consideration. Children often experience growth failure, malnutrition, pubertal delay and bone demineralization. Medical treatment must be optimized to promote clinical improvement and reverse growth failure with minimal toxicity. In addition to pharmacologic and surgical interventions, nutritional therapies play a vital role in the management of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. This review will outline the epidemiology and clinical complications that are unique to pediatric inflammatory bowel disease, current trends, and recent advances in nutritional and pharmacologic treatment, and projected future therapeutic direction.},

   abstract = {In genetically susceptible individuals, an altered mucosal immune response against some commensal bacteria of the gut ecosystem appears to be the principal mechanism leading to intestinal lesions in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The information currently available does not provide an exact explanation about the origin of this important dysfunction of the interaction between host and commensal bacteria, but an altered microbial composition has been detected in the gut ecosystem of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Prebiotics are food ingredients not digested nor absorbed in the upper intestinal tract that are fermented by intestinal bacteria in a selective way promoting changes in the gut ecosystem. Experimental and human studies have shown that inulin and oligofructose stimulate saccharolysis in the colonic lumen and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation in animal models of IBD. Strong experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that inulin and oligofructose can offer an opportunity to prevent or mitigate intestinal inflammatory lesions in human Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis. Encouraging results have been obtained in preliminary clinical trials.},

Genetic susceptibility factors tend to be common, whereas complicating environmental factors such as cigarette smoking are generally not an issue. As opposed to the case in adult patients, Crohn's disease is usually diagnosed in children at an early, inflammatory phase of the disease. Pediatric ulcerative colitis tends to present with more severe and more extensive involvement than in adults. In both forms of IBD, the severity of disease activity often dictates the need for early aggressive nutritional, immunomodulatory, and biologic therapy. As a result, the lessons learned from the evaluation and treatment of children with IBD are critically important to the clinician caring for adults with the same disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than two-thirds of ulcerative colitis patients experience at least one relapse over a period of 10 years. Treatments that reduce the likelihood of relapses also reduce the risk of long-term complications. AIM: To review three topics: the current standard of treatment for ulcerative colitis, evolving concepts in treatment, and disease modification as a treatment goal of the future. RESULTS: Currently, 5-aminosalicylates are the standard treatment for the induction and maintenance of remission in mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis patients. Evidence suggests that patients who take oral 5-aminosalicylates regularly are nearly six times more likely to experience regression in disease severity than those who do not. Additional treatment options such as corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biological therapies and ciclosporin are available for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis patients, or those who do not respond to 5-aminosalicylate. Surgery becomes pertinent for more than one-third of ulcerative colitis patients during the course of their disease. With the availability of a variety of therapies, advances in surgery and improved management strategies, a better understanding of patient treatment expectations can help improve the quality of care for ulcerative colitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Disease modification is increasingly becoming a treatment goal in the management of ulcerative colitis. However, long-term studies are needed to examine further the disease modifying role of 5-aminosalicylates.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The causes of ulcerative colitis are unknown, although it is plausible that dietary factors are involved. Case-control studies of diet and ulcerative colitis are subject to recall biases. The aim of this study was to examine the prospective relationship between the intake of nutrients and the development of ulcerative colitis in a cohort study. METHODS: The study population was 260,686 men and women aged 20-80 years, participating in a large European prospective cohort study (EPIC). Participants were residents in the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Germany or Italy. Information on diet was supplied and the subjects were followed up for the development of ulcerative colitis. Each incident case was matched with four controls and dietary variables were divided into quartiles. RESULTS: A total of 139 subjects with incident ulcerative colitis were identified. No dietary associations were detected, apart from a marginally significant positive association with an increasing percentage intake of energy from total polyunsaturated fatty acids (trend across quartiles OR = 1.19 (95% CI = 0.99-1.43) p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: No associations between ulcerative colitis and diet were detected, apart from a possible increased risk with a higher total polyunsaturated fatty acid intake. A biological mechanism exists in that polyunsaturated fatty acids are metabolised to pro-inflammatory mediators.},

   abstract = {Human subjects and their enteric microbiota have evolved together to reach a state of mutual tolerance. Mounting evidence from both animal models and human studies suggests that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a malfunction of this relationship. The enteric microecology therefore represents an attractive therapeutic target with few side effects. Probiotics and prebiotics have been investigated in clinical trials as treatments for IBD, with conflicting results. The evidence for the use of probiotics in the management of pouchitis is persuasive and several studies indicate their effectiveness in ulcerative colitis. Trials of probiotics and prebiotics in Crohn's disease are less convincing. However, methodologies vary widely and a range of probiotic, prebiotic and combination (synbiotic) treatments have been tested in a variety of patient groups with an assortment of end points. Conclusions about any one treatment in a specific patient group can therefore only be drawn on evidence from relatively small numbers of patients. The present article reviews the role of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD and addresses the clinical evidence for the therapeutic manipulation of bowel microbiota using probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in IBD.},

   abstract = {Around 1 in 4 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) present in childhood, the majority around the time of their pubertal growth spurt. This presents challenges over and above those of managing IBD in adults as this period is a time of dramatic psychological and physical transition for a child. Growth and nutrition are key priorities in the management of adolescents and young adults with IBD. Growth failure in IBD is characterized by delayed skeletal maturation and a delayed onset of puberty, and is best described in terms of height-for-age standard deviation score (Z score) or by variations in growth velocity over a period of 3-4 months. Growth failure is common at presentation in Crohn's disease (CD), but less common in ulcerative colitis (UC). The etiology of growth failure is multifactorial. Principal determinants, however, include the inflammatory process per se, with proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1beta, IL-6) being directly implicated. Furthermore, poor nutrition and the consequences of prolonged corticosteroid use also contribute to the significant reduction in final adult height of almost 1 in 5 children. Initially a prompt, where possible steroid-free, induction of remission is indicated. The ideal is then to sustain a relapse-free remission until growth is complete, which is often not until early adulthood. These goals can often be achieved with a combination of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) and early use of immunosuppressants. The advent of potent and efficacious biological agents considerably improves the range of growth-sparing interventions available to children around puberty, although well-timed surgery remains another highly effective means of achieving remission and significant catch-up growth. We carried out a systematic review of publications to identify the best available evidence for managing growth failure in children with IBD. Despite the paucity of high-quality publications, sufficient data were available in the literature to allow practical, evidence-based where possible, management guidelines to be formulated. Although there is clear evidence that exclusive enteral nutrition achieves mucosal healing, its effect on growth has only been assessed at 6 months. In contrast to corticosteroids, EEN has no negative effect on growth. Corticosteroids remain the key therapy responsible for medication-induced growth impairment, although the use of budesonide in selected patients may minimize the steroid effect on dividing growth plates. Immunosuppressants have become a mainstay of treatment in children with IBD, and are being used earlier in the disease course than ever before. However, there are currently no long-term data reporting better growth outcome if these agents are introduced very soon after diagnosis. In comparison, recent data from a large prospective trial of infliximab in children with moderate to severe CD suggested significant catch-up growth during the first year of regular infusions. The only other intervention that has documented clear catch-up growth has been surgical resection. Resection of localized CD, in otherwise treatment-resistant children, early in the disease process achieves clear catch-up growth within the next 6 months. There are no data available that growth hormone improves final adult height in children with CD. In conjunction with expert endocrinological support, pubertal delay, more common in boys, may be treated with parenteral testosterone if causing significant psychological problems. The optimal management of children and adolescents requires a multidisciplinary approach frequently available within the pediatric healthcare setting. Dedicated dietetic support, along with nurse-specialist, child psychologist, and with closely linked medical and surgical care will likely achieve the best possible start for children facing a lifetime of chronic gut disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls. DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4 patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20 IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P = 0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7 ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400 microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis should be explored further.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is controversy in the literature regarding the effect of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on resting energy expenditure (REE). In many cases this may have resulted from inappropriate adjustment of REE measurements to account for differences in body composition. This article considers how to appropriately adjust measurements of REE for differences in body composition between individuals with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Body composition, assessed via total body potassium to yield a measure of body cell mass (BCM), and REE measurements were performed in 41 children with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in the Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. Log-log regression was used to determine the power function to which BCM should be raised to appropriately adjust REE to account for differences in body composition between children. RESULTS: The appropriate value to "adjust" BCM was found to be 0.49, with a standard error of 0.10. CONCLUSIONS: Clearly, there is a need to adjust for differences in body composition, or at the very least body weight, in metabolic studies in children with IBD. We suggest that raising BCM to the power of 0.5 is both a numerically convenient and a statistically valid way of achieving this aim. Under circumstances in which the measurement of BCM is not available, raising body weight to the power of 0.5 remains appropriate. The important issue of whether REE is changed in cases of IBD can then be appropriately addressed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions are a significant reason for therapeutic failure during thiopurine treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Some smaller series in this patient population have shown that a switch to mercaptopurine may be successful in many cases of azathioprine intolerance. AIM: To assess the long-term outcome of mercaptopurine treatment in a large patient population with azathioprine intolerance. METHODS: We identified 135 patients (74 women; median age 40 years) with Crohn's disease (n = 88) or ulcerative colitis (n = 47) and reviewed their medical records. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients (52%) tolerated mercaptopurine and were followed up for 736 (362-1080) days; 65 patients discontinued mercaptopurine due to adverse events after 25 (8-92) days. Mercaptopurine was tolerated in 71% (12/17) with hepatotoxicity and in 68% (13/19) with arthralgia/myalgia during azathioprine treatment. Previous abdominal surgery was more common in mercaptopurine intolerant patients [39/65 (60%) vs. 27/70 (39%); P = 0.02] and thiopurine methyltransferase activity was higher in mercaptopurine tolerant patients than in mercaptopurine intolerant patients [13.2 (11.4-15.3) vs. 11.8 (9.6-14.2) U/mL red blood cells; P = 0.04; n = 81]. CONCLUSIONS: A trial of mercaptopurine should be considered in azathioprine intolerance, as half of the patients tolerate a switch to mercaptopurine. Patients with hepatotoxicity or arthralgia/myalgia during azathioprine treatment might benefit more often than those with other types of adverse events.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Previous US studies of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) prevalence have sampled small, geographically restricted populations and may not be generalizable to the entire nation. This study sought to determine the prevalence of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in a large national sample and to compare the prevalence across geographic regions and other sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: We analyzed the health insurance claims for 9 million Americans, pooled from 87 health plans in 33 states, and identified cases of CD and UC using diagnosis codes. Prevalence was determined by dividing the number of cases by the number of persons enrolled for 2 years. Logistic regression was used to compare prevalence estimates by geographic region, age, sex, and insurance type (Medicaid vs commercial). RESULTS: The prevalence of CD and UC in children younger than 20 years was 43 (95% confidence interval [CI], 40-45) and 28 (95% CI, 26-30) per 100,000, respectively. In adults, the prevalence of CD and UC was 201 (95% CI, 197-204) and 238 (95% CI, 234-241), respectively. The prevalence of both conditions was lower in the South, compared with the Northeast, Midwest, and West. IBD appears to be more common in commercially insured individuals, compared with those insured by Medicaid. CONCLUSIONS: This estimation of the prevalence of IBD in the US should help quantify the overall burden of disease and inform the planning of appropriate clinical services.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by anorexia, malnutrition, altered body composition, and development of mesenteric white adipose tissue (WAT) hypertrophy. Increasing evidence suggests that adipokines synthesized either in WAT or in immune cells, are involved in these manifestations of IBD. Among adipokines leptin, adiponectin and resistin hold a fundamental role while the role of ghrelin in inflammation is not well established. Preliminary studies have shown overexpression of leptin, adiponectin, and resistin in mesenteric WAT of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and significant alterations of circulating serum levels of these adipokines in IBD. It has also been demonstrated that intestinal inflammation causes an increase in endogenous ghrelin production. In animal models of intestinal inflammation, existing data suggest that leptin, adiponectin, and resistin are pivotal mediators of inflammation. Interesting therapeutic interventions based on these data have been suggested. A specific role for hypertrophic WAT has also been implicated in CD. Further efforts with experimental and clinical studies are needed to better understand the role of adipokines in IBD.},

Such blends were recently shown to be highly promising for the site-specific delivery of drugs to the colon in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, in particular Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Importantly, and in contrast to various other colon targeting approaches, the system is adapted to the pathophysiological conditions in the disease state. However, it is yet unknown how desired membrane properties, especially water uptake and dry mass loss kinetics as well as mechanical stability can be adjusted to the specific needs of particular drug treatments. Different highly efficient and easy to apply tools were identified altering the membrane's properties, in particular their mechanical resistance required to withstand the shear forces resulting from the motility of the upper GIT and the hydrostatic pressure built up within the devices upon contact with aqueous media. This includes the variation of the Nutriose:ethylcellulose blend ratio and initial plasticizer content. Importantly, Nutriose also exhibits significant pre-biotic activity, normalizing the microflora in the patients' colon, which is of major clinical benefit in the case of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

Several studies suggest an association between dietary factors and the onset of ulcerative colitis; however, only few studies have examined the relationship between dietary intake and relapse of ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to assess the dietary intake and antioxidative capacity of ulcerative colitis patients and to elucidate the efficacy of dietary therapy for ulcerative colitis. Dietary intake, fatty acid composition of phospholipids in plasma and neutrophils, serum fat-soluble vitamin levels, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity were analyzed in 29 ulcerative colitis patients (7 males and 22 females), who were treated at the Department of Gastroenterology, Okayama University Hospital. Total fat intake, fat energy ratio and linoleic acid intake were significantly lower, while protein and carbohydrate intakes were significantly higher, in the patients than age- and sex-matched controls. In the neutrophil phospholipids of ulcerative colitis patients, significantly higher levels of linoleic aicd and arachidonic acid and a lower level of eicosapentaenoic acid were observed. The concentrations of serum retinol and beta-carotene but not alpha-tocopherol were significantly lower and serum oxygen radical absorbance capacity was also lower than in the controls. Significant correlations between serum oxygen radical absorbance capacity and retinol (r = 0.567, p = 0.0031), alpha-tocopherol (r = 0.560, p = 0.0036) and beta-carotene (r = 0.440, p = 0.0279) concentrations were observed in the ulcerative colitis patients. A diet restricting the intake of linoleic acid and supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid and antioxidative vitamins may be recommendable for the nutritional management of ulcerative colitis patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pouch inflammation after surgery for ulcerative colitis can significantly alter quality of life and thus ideally should be prevented. Dysbiosis or altered microflora is suspected to be the key pathogenic factor for pouchitis. However, dysbiosis in pouchitis has not been characterized carefully because of a lack of available sensitive microbiological technology suitable for in vivo studies in human beings. Thus, the aims of our study were as follows: (1) to show the use of the length heterogeneity polymerase chain reaction (LH-PCR) technique for studying microflora in human beings, and (2) to use the technique to characterize the microfloral patterns in the ileal pouch of patients with pouchitis. METHODS: Microfloral patterns initially were assessed using a 16S ribosomal RNA technique (LH-PCR) to determine the qualitative changes in the luminal and mucosal intestinal flora. We subsequently cloned and sequenced the LH-PCR amplification products from the community 16S ribosomal RNA found in patients with pouchitis and in control pouch to identify the microbial species involved in pouchitis. RESULTS: We have shown unique microfloral patterns in pouchitis. Through cloning and sequencing of the LH-PCR amplicons, we have shown the persistence of Fusobacter and Enteric species associated with the disease state and the absence of specific bacteria such as Streptococcus species in the inflamed pouch. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that the LH-PCR technique is suitable for studying microflora in human beings. By using this technique and the clone sequences, we have shown dysbiosis in the microbial biofilm adherent to the mucosa in pouchitis. Our data provide direct evidence of the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of pouchitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of children with newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from 2 prospective inception cohorts to examine body mass index (BMI) status at presentation. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical, demographic, and BMI data were obtained from 783 patients with newly diagnosed IBD. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data for 2748 healthy children were used as a control. RESULTS: Most children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis had a BMI in the normative range (5%-84%). Low BMI (<5%) was seen in 22% to 24% of children with Crohn's disease and 7% to 9% of children with ulcerative colitis. Ten percent of children with Crohn's disease and 20% to 30% of children with ulcerative colitis had a BMI at diagnosis consistent with overweight or risk for overweight. CONCLUSION: Children with IBD are affected by current population trends toward overweight. A significant subgroup of children with newly diagnosed IBD has a BMI categorized as overweight or at risk for overweight. Clinicians should be aware of possible IBD diagnosis in the presence increased BMI.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The impact of infliximab (IFX) on postoperative complications in surgical patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is unclear. We examined a large patient cohort to clarify whether a relationship exists between IFX and postoperative complications. METHODS: A total of 413 consecutive patients--188 (45.5%) with suspected CD, 156 (37.8%) with UC, and 69 (16.7%) with indeterminate colitis--underwent abdominal surgery at the Massachusetts General Hospital between January 1993 and June 2007. One hundred one (24.5%) had received preoperative IFX < or = 12 weeks before surgery. These patients were compared to those who did not receive IFX with respect to demographics, comorbidities, presence of preoperative infections, steroid use, and nutritional status. We then compared the cumulative rate of complications for each group, which included deaths, anastomotic leak, infection, thrombotic complications, prolonged ileus/small bowel obstruction, cardiac, and hepatorenal complications. Potential risk factors for infectious complications including preexisting infection, pathological diagnosis, and steroid or IFX exposure were further evaluated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients were similar with respect to gender (IFX = 40.6% men vs. non-IFX = 51.9%, p = 0.06), age (36.1 years vs. 37.8, p = 0.43), Charlson Comorbidity Index (5.3 vs. 5.7, p = 0.25), concomitant steroids (75.3% vs. 76.9%, p = 0.79), preoperative albumin level (3.3 vs. 3.2, p = 0.36), and rate of emergent surgery (3.0% vs. 3.5%, p = 1.00). IFX patients had higher rates of CD (56.4% vs. 41.9%, p = 0.02), concomitant azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine use (34.6% vs. 16.6%, p < 0.0001), and lower rates of intra-abdominal abscess (3.9% vs. 11%, p < 0.05). After surgery, the two groups had similar rates of death (2% vs. 0.3% p = 0.09), anastomotic leak (3.0% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.97), cumulative infections (5.97% vs. 10.1%, p = 1), thrombotic complications (3.6% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.06), prolonged ileus/small bowel obstructions (3.9 vs. 2.8, p = 0.59), cardiac complications (1% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.42), and hepatic or renal complications (1.0 vs. 0.6% p = 0.72). A logistic regression model was then created to assess the impact of IFX, as well as other potential risk factors, on the rates of cumulative postoperative infections. We found that steroids (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2, p = 0.74), IFX (OR 2.5, p = 0.14), preoperative diagnosis of CD (OR = 0.7, p = 0.63) or UC (OR = 0.6, p = 0.48), and preoperative infection (OR = 1.2, p = 0.76) did not affect rates of clinically important postoperative infections. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative IFX was not associated with an increased rate of cumulative postoperative complications.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK), menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of these vitamins.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, also called chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), affect up to 500 per 100,000 persons in the Western world. Recent studies in the etiology of IBD suggest that these diseases are caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Results from humans and especially animal models of colitis reported by our group and others have indicated that these diseases result from a lack of tolerance to resident intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts. Probiotic bacteria have health-promoting effects for the host when ingested and have also shown efficacy in ulcerative colitis and refractory pouchitis. In light of the efficacy of providing probiotic bacteria to patients with IBD, there has been interest in the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of inulin, oligofructose, and other prebiotics for patients with or at risk of IBD. Prebiotics are nondigestible dietary oligosaccharides that affect the host by selectively stimulating growth, activity, or both of selective intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Prebiotics are easy to administer and, in contrast to probiotic therapy, do not require administration of large amounts of (live) bacteria and are therefore easier to administer. Studies using prebiotics, especially beta-fructan oligosaccharides, for the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation have shown benefit in animal models of colitis. Studies using these prebiotics alone or in combination with probiotics are emerging and have shown promise. These dietary therapies could lead to novel treatments for these chronic debilitating diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The onset of UC at a young age has been considered a specific risk factor for CRC. This study reports the outcome with respect to DNA aneuploidy, dysplasia, CRC, and PSC in a cohort of patients with early-onset UC from a defined catchment area who were followed up for 45 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study period was from 1961 through 2005. In all, 46 children and adolescents, ages 18 or younger from our catchment area, were affected with UC during this time. Data were collected from our colonoscopic surveillance program and other medical records in the same hospital. RESULTS: The incidence rate of UC was 1.6 children or adolescents per 100,000 inhabitants per year. The onset of disease was at age 14 years (mean and median), and the observed duration of disease was 0 to 44 years. Five patients died, 3 of them of intercurrent disease. CRC developed in 1 patient, and no death caused by this disease was observed. PSC was diagnosed in 4 patients, in all of whom the onset of UC occurred before age 15. CONCLUSIONS: The earlier reports of increased risk of CRC in patients with early-onset UC was not seen in this study. This could be due to a high frequency of surgery together with a well-functioning surveillance program with excellent compliance. The recommendation of surgery in cases of high-grade dysplasia or repeated findings of low-grade dysplasia seems to be effective in the attempt to minimize the risk for CRC. We observed a rather high incidence of PSC, which may indicate that more attention should be paid to a search for this diagnosis in patients with early-onset UC.},

Ulcerous colitis is still effectively treated with salicylates and steroids in its mild and moderate forms. Severe forms require parenteral steroids, cyclosporine or infliximab, and these are successfully used with immunosuppressants (azathioprine or mercaptopurine) in steroid dependence. Maintenance with salicylates, that should be adequately complied with, is an important point. Crohn's disease is treated with steroids in its mild and moderate forms, and again in corticodependent ones with immunosuppressants, which we are using increasingly sooner. Refractory forms or fistulous forms benefit from the use of biological treatments (infliximab) generally accompanied by immunosuppressants.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of laparoscopic colectomy in 1991, experience in laparoscopic bowel surgery has gradually increased. Several reports from specialized centers have demonstrated that laparoscopic colorectal resections are feasible and safe, providing an acceptable alternative to laparotomy for a variety of diseases. Some studies have shown the feasibility, safety, and good functional outcome of the minimally invasive procedures for ulcerative colitis (UC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). No known studies have investigated laparoscopic proctocolectomy in Mexico. This report aims to describe the first laparoscopic proctocolectomies with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) performed at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran (INCMNSZ). METHODS: All the patients in the authors' institution who underwent a one- or two-stage laparoscopic total proctocolectomy with IPAA between June 2005 and December 2006 were included in the study. All the operations were performed by the same surgeon, who had already completed the learning curve for colorectal laparoscopic procedures. RESULTS: For the study, 10 patients underwent a laparoscopic proctocolectomy with IPAA by a single surgeon. Eight of the patients underwent a one-stage procedure, whereas two patients with severe colitis underwent a two-step procedure. All the cases were managed with a diverting loop ileostomy. Six patients underwent a standard double-stapled IPAA anastomosis, and two patients with FAP underwent a mucosectomy with a manual IPAA anastomosis. The mean operative time was 187 min, and the mean blood loss was 46 ml. There were two postoperative complications. One patient presented with an early small bowel obstruction due to an internal hernia, which required reoperation. The other complication was a wound infection. The mean return to oral intake was 1.5 days, and the mean length of hospital stay was 3.4 days. CONCLUSION: Although this was not a comparative study and although sample size imposed limitations, with this preliminary data, we conclude that the laparoscopic approach to UC and FAP at our institution is safe, feasible, and effective. However, to achieve the benefits in postoperative outcome, this procedure should be performed only by experienced laparoscopic surgeons.},

The sensitivity of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) IgG and ASCA IgA in CD is 60%-80%, whereas the specificity is almost 90%. There are no reports of study of ASCA in patients with IT, nor has it ever been used to differentiate CD from IT. Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; n=25), CD (n=59), and IT (n=30) and 21 healthy controls were included in this study. The location and behavior of CD were classified according to the Modified Montreal classification. Five milliliters of blood was taken from them and serum was stored at -70 degrees C. ASCA antibodies (both IgG and IgA) were estimated using commercially available ELISA kits (AESKU Diagnostics, Germany). Anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody was measured by indirect immunofluorescence test. ASCA IgA was positive in 4.7%, 28%, 33.9%, and 43.3% and ASCA IgG was positive in 4.7%, 24%, 50.8%, and 46.6% of healthy controls and patients with UC, CD, and IT, respectively. Either ASCA IgG or ASCA IgA was positive in 9.5%, 40%, 61% and 66.6% of healthy controls, UC, CD, and IT, respectively. ANCA was positive in 0%, 32%, 10.1%, and 6.6% of healthy controls, UC, CD, and IT, respectively. ASCA IgG was positive in a significantly higher number of patients with CD (P<0.0001) and IT (P<0.0001) in comparison to healthy controls. ASCA IgA was positive in a significantly higher number of patients with UC (P<0.04), CD (P<0.013), and IT (P<0.006) in comparison to healthy controls. In comparisons between diseases, ASCA IgG was positive in significantly more patients with CD (P<0.001) and IT (P<0.001) in comparison to UC. There was no significant difference in ASCA IgA (33.9% vs. 43.3%), ASCA IgG (50.86% vs. 46.6%), or ANCA (10.7%, 7.4%) in patients with CD and IT, respectively. There was no correlation between ASCA and duration, location and behavior of CD, and IT. We conclude that ASCA IgG and ASCA IgA do not help to differentiate between IT and CD.},

This review was undertaken to evaluate the effects of immunosuppressive therapy and other preoperative factors on infectious wound complications in children undergoing first stage surgical therapy for UC. METHODS: A 10-year retrospective review of children under 18 years of age receiving first stage surgical therapy for UC at a major children's hospital was performed. Preoperative clinical and treatment variables were identified and correlated with postoperative wound complications. RESULTS: A total of 51 children were identified: 19 underwent colectomy with ileo-anal-pouch anastomosis and 32 underwent total abdominal colectomy with Hartmann's pouch. A total of 20 infectious complications were identified in 18 patients. Preoperative steroid use was associated with a greater postoperative wound infection rate. Preoperative hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL (P < .05) and albumin less than 3 g/dL (P = 0.1) were associated with greater rates of postoperative infection. Preoperative body mass index and other immunosuppressive agents did not influence postoperative infectious morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of pediatric patients who require operative intervention for UC are debilitated from their disease and medication use. Children with normal serum albumin and hemoglobin who are not on steroid therapy have a low risk of postoperative infectious complications.},

As both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis remain medically incurable conditions associated with potentially significant morbidity, the focus of treatment must be to reduce or eliminate symptoms, optimize nutritional status, promote normal growth and development, prevent complications and minimize the potential psychological effects of these chronic illnesses. This review focuses on the evidence supporting the treatments currently used in children with inflammatory bowel disease, and suggests potential treatment algorithms for particular clinical circumstances.},

Cyclosporine A has showed to be an effective rescue therapy in acute attacks, avoiding colectomy. However, the long-term benefits are less promising and there is also very serious toxicity associated with its use. Therefore, novel effective therapies in paediatric ulcerative colitis are mandatory. We present a patient with a severe attack of steroid-resistant ulcerative-colitis in whom infliximab has proved effective in inducing a maintained remission and in avoiding the need for colectomy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Selective granulocyte-monocyte adsorption (GMA) apheresis is a safe technique that has shown efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially in adult steroid-dependent and steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. GMA apheresis is performed with Adacolumn, a direct blood perfusion system that selectively adsorbs circulating granulocytes and monocytes. Studies on efficacy of GMA apheresis in paediatric IBD are scarce. Our aim was to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of GMA apheresis in paediatric IBD patients followed for 1 year. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients with a mild to moderate flare-up (6 boys, 3 girls; 5 ulcerative colitis [UC], 4 Crohn disease [CD]) were included. Mean age at inclusion was 13 years and 9 months, and mean disease duration before inclusion was 28 months. All of our patients with UC were steroid-dependent; patients with CD had been unsuccessfully treated with other therapies. GMA apheresis consisted of 5 consecutive weekly sessions lasting 60 minutes each. RESULTS: After the 5 sessions, 4 of 5 patients with UC and 1 of 4 patients with CD achieved remission. This remission was maintained in 2 of 4 patients with UC and in the single patients with CD. Patients taking steroids could begin to taper their daily doses after the second apheresis, and 3 of 5 of these patients reached the end of the study steroid-free. GMA apheresis was well tolerated and no severe side effects related to the technique were observed. CONCLUSIONS: GMA apheresis is a safe, well-tolerated technique in paediatric IBD. As previously reported, we have observed a better efficacy in promoting and maintaining remission, and reducing conventional drugs in patients with UC than in patients with CD.},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal (GI) peptide hormones are chemical messengers that regulate secretory, mechanical, metabolic, and trophic functions of the gut. Restorative proctocolectomy (RPC) or resection of the colon and rectum with maintenance of intestinal continuity through the construction of an ileal pouch reservoir and preservation of the anal sphincters has become the standard of care for the surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. The manipulation of the digestive system to create the ileal pouch involves altering gut-associated lymphoid tissue among other anatomic changes that lead to changes in GI peptides. In addition, the ileal pouch epithelium responds to a wide variety of stimuli by adjusting its cellularity and function. These adaptive mechanisms involve systemic factors, such as humoral and neural stimuli, as well as local factors, such as changes in intestinal peristalsis and intraluminal nutrients. There have been conflicting reports as to whether the alterations in GI hormones after RPC have actual clinical implications. What the studies on alterations of GI peptides' response and behavior after RPC have contributed, however, is a window into the possible etiology of complications after pouch surgery, such as pouchitis and malabsorption. Given the possibility of pharmacologically modifying GI peptides or select components of adaptation as a therapeutic strategy for patients with ileal pouch dysfunction or pouchitis, a clear understanding of human pouch mucosal adaptation is of paramount importance. In this review, we summarize the evolution of the RPC and its effects on the GI hormones as well as their possible clinical implications.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Information on the occurrence and frequency of pulmonary involvement in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) is inconsistent. Some authors reported pulmonary impairment with UC by standard pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and documented a reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) especially in patients with active disease, whereas others could not detect differences in routine PFTs between UC patients and controls. AIM: The aim of this prospective study was to determine the frequency and type of pulmonary dysfunction in patients with UC with respect to disease activity. Furthermore, to evaluate the influence of smoking, nutritional status, sputum cytology and sulphasalazine therapy on PFT parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients with UC (20 with active disease, 6 inactive) and 16 age and sex matched healthy controls were investigated with respect to the following pulmonary function tests, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the 1s (FEV(1)%) and their ratio (FEV(1)/FVC) and forced expiratory flow 25-75% (FEF25-75%) as well as oxygen saturation. For UC patients, colonoscopy and biopsy were done. Disease activity was assessed by Truelove index for UC. Induced sputum was sampled for cytology. Smoking habit, body mass index (BMI) and medications were recorded. RESULTS: Fifteen out of 26 patients with UC (57.6%) exhibited at least one pathological pulmonary function test (<80% of predicted value). Small airway obstruction was reported in the 15 patients, restrictive dysfunction in 30.7% and obstructive dysfunction in 11.5%. The impairment of PFTs was significant and more pronounced in patients with active disease, FVC (-14% of predicted), FEV(1) (-9% of predicted) and FEF25-75% (-32% of predicted), P<0.01, 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. There was no significant influence of smoking and medications on PFTs. CONCLUSIONS: UC patients show significantly decreased lung function tests in comparison to healthy controls. The impairment in active disease exceeded that during the remission. Early recognition is important, as they can be strikingly steroid responsive.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although azathioprine usually is reserved for inflammatory bowel disease that proves difficult to control, routine early use has recently been advocated for children with Crohn disease. However, this practice carries with it an increased risk of adverse reactions. The objective of this study was to look for characteristics at first presentation that may identify those likely to benefit from early azathioprine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study setting was a tertiary pediatric gastroenterology department. Retrospective cohort study of 156 children (93 Crohn disease, 47 ulcerative colitis, 16 indeterminate colitis), comparing characteristics at presentation in those who did and did not eventually require azathioprine. Azathioprine was reserved for patients with frequent relapses and steroid dependence/resistance. Twenty variables were examined, including patient and disease characteristics and initial treatment response. These were analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazard regression. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 3.9 years (range 0.5-10.6 years). Azathioprine was used in 36% with Crohn disease and 40% with ulcerative colitis. Median time to commencing azathioprine was 14 months (range 3-77.5 months). Multifactorial analysis revealed an association with endoscopic colitis severity in Crohn disease (P < 0.02). However, only 50% with severe Crohn colitis actually needed azathioprine. There was an association with need for intravenous corticosteroids for induction of remission in Crohn disease (P < 0.006) and ulcerative colitis (P < 0.05). Of these patients, 75% required azathioprine. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the early use of azathioprine in children who require intravenous corticosteroids to induce initial remission. No other characteristics examined were of clinical utility in predicting need for azathioprine.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of wireless capsule endoscopy (CE) provides a unique opportunity to visualize the entire small bowel in a minimally invasive manner. Studies in adult patients have demonstrated that the disposable capsule is well tolerated and highly effective, but few studies have been done in children. The aims of our study were to compare the diagnostic yield of CE and small bowel series in children being evaluated for possible small intestine disease and to determine the risk of developing an adverse event following capsule endoscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all children who underwent CE at 1 institution between August 2002 and July 2005. Results of CE were compared with those of small bowel radiographic studies when available. RESULTS: There were 46 CE studies from 45 patients, 28 male and 17 female, with a mean age of 14.9 +/- 3.6 years and mean weight of 49.7 +/- 17.5 kg. The indications for CE included unresponsive Crohn disease (n = 16), possible intestinal polyps (n = 11), unexplained iron deficiency anemia (n = 7), growth failure (n = 5), unresponsive ulcerative colitis (n = 3), persistent abdominal pain (n = 1), protein-losing enteropathy (n = 1), and allergic enteropathy with occult gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 1). Of the 46 CE studies, 41 were completed and 5 were incomplete studies. Based on the CE, 9 patients were newly diagnosed with Crohn disease, 9 patients with Crohn disease were newly diagnosed with small bowel involvement, 8 patients had upper intestinal polyps, 1 patient had findings consistent with Menetrier disease, and 1 had a duodenal ulcer. Thirty-three patients had small bowel series before CE: 24 studies were normal, 6 had abnormal thickening of the small bowel, 2 had polyps, and 1 patient had antral narrowing. All 9 patients with abnormal small bowel series had abnormal CE studies. Of the 24 patients with normal small bowel series, 20 had completed CE studies, and in 10 children, the study was abnormal. Nine of the 45 subjects had adverse events. Five patients had delayed passage from the stomach, with 2 needing endoscopic retrieval of the CE, and 4 had delayed passage from the small intestine (>5 days), with 2 requiring surgical removal, 1 responding to steroids, and the final patient requiring an ileocolic resection 2 months after the CE for an undiagnosed ileal stricture. The only significant association noted was that older patients were more likely to have intestinal retention. CONCLUSIONS: CE provides a valuable tool in the evaluation of pediatric patients for possible small bowel disease. However, the risk of developing complications appears to be greater in the pediatric population, with 20% of our patients having an adverse event.},

Recent studies have identified innate immunity (NOD2), autophagy (ATG16L1) and Th17 pathway (IL23R) genes in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. The pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) is less clear; however, there is growing evidence that proteins involved in the apical junction complex are involved in UC. Here we review the up-to-date studies on the genetic basis for IBD and explore the newly described UC-associated apical junction complex pointing to a primary defect in barrier defense. We will focus on the PTPRS (encoding PTPsigma) gene and discuss its and other apical junction complex proteins' role in the pathogenesis of UC.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a relatively common chronic debilitating intestinal illness, is composed of two broadly defined groups, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Although several susceptibility genes for CD have been recently described, susceptibility genes exclusive for UC have not been forthcoming. Here, we show that receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPRS-encoding PTPsigma) knockout mice spontaneously develop mild colitis that becomes severe when challenged with two known inducers of colitis. We also demonstrate that E-cadherin and beta-catenin, two important adherens junction proteins involved in maintenance of barrier defense in the colon, act as colonic substrates for PTPsigma. Furthermore, we show that three SNPs (rs886936, rs17130, and rs8100586) that flank exon 8 in the human PTPRS gene are associated with UC. The presence of these SNPs is associated with novel splicing that removes the third immunoglobulin-like domain (exon 9) from the extracellular portion of PTPsigma, possibly altering dimerization or ligand recognition. We propose that polymorphisms in the human PTPRS gene lead to ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The natural history of paediatric inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is poorly understood. We aim to describe the disease course in this cohort and generate prognostic information for patients and clinicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient records from 6 tertiary paediatric gastroenterology centres were reviewed to generate data concerning original diagnosis, change in diagnosis, family history, surgical interventions, growth, and presence of extragastrointestinal manifestations. RESULTS: Data were collected on 116 children with Crohn disease (CD), 74 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 20 with indeterminate colitis (IC), followed for a mean period of 3.42, 3.3, and 2.9 years from date of diagnosis, respectively. A male predominance is demonstrated in CD. Revision of diagnosis in patients with IC is mainly to UC, with most children receiving a definitive diagnosis within 2 years of initial presentation. Of the children with UC, 17.6% underwent 1 or more major operations with a median time to surgery of 1.92 years. Of children with CD, 11.6% underwent 1 or more major intraabdominal procedures with a median time to surgery of 1.83 years. We recorded a positive family history in 2.7%, 8.2%, and 10% of cases for CD, UC, and IC, respectively. For both boys and girls with CD, but only for boys with UC, height standard deviation score became more negative over time. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study quantifies certain distinctions between IBDs diagnosed in paediatric and adult populations. We document a trend toward male predominance in children with CD. We also note impaired linear growth in children with CD, whereas it appears maintained in girls with UC. We also have recorded a low incidence of IBDs in the families of this cohort and suggest that environmental influences may be of greater importance. We document that major intraabdominal surgery may be required in about 15% of patients with either UC or CD within 2 years of diagnosis, and that the majority of those diagnosed initially with IC will be reclassified as either UC or CD within 2 years.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parenteral nutrition has a limited role in the in-patient management of inflammatory bowel disease. AIM: To determine nationwide patterns of in-patient parenteral nutrition utilization and its demographic determinants and impact on outcomes. METHODS: We identified inflammatory bowel disease discharges in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 1998 and 2003 and determined rates of parenteral nutrition utilization among US census regions, in-hospital mortality and hospital resource utilization. RESULTS: The parenteral nutrition utilization rate among hospitalized inflammatory bowel disease patients was 6%. Only 64% of Crohn's disease and 55% of ulcerative colitis discharges who received parenteral nutrition had malnutrition, fistulizing or obstructive Crohn's disease, or surgery as an indication. The adjusted odds ratio of receiving parenteral nutrition were 0.36 (95% CI: 0.26-0.51) for the mid-west, 0.47 (0.37-0.56) for the south and 0.70 (0.56-0.89) for the west, compared to the north-east. Use of parenteral nutrition was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (OR 2.5; 95% CI: 1.93-3.24), length of stay (13.7 vs. 5.7 days, P < 0.001) and hospital charges ($51,729 vs. $19,563, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In-patient utilization of parenteral nutrition for inflammatory bowel disease varies markedly by census region, expends significant resources, and leads to potentially significant adverse outcomes. These findings underscore the need for guidelines for judicious parenteral nutrition use in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at increased risk of protein-calorie malnutrition. We sought to determine the prevalence of clinically diagnosable malnutrition among those hospitalized for IBD throughout the United States and whether this malnutrition influenced health outcomes. METHODS: We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 1998 and 2004 to identify admissions for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) and a representative sample of non-IBD discharges. We assessed the prevalence and predictors of malnutrition and its association with in-hospital mortality and resource utilization. RESULTS: The prevalence of malnutrition was greater in CD and UC patients than in non-IBD patients (6.1% and 7.2% versus 1.8%, P < 0.0001). The adjusted odds ratio for malnutrition among IBD admissions compared with non-IBD admissions was 5.57 [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.29-5.86]. More IBD discharges than non-IBD discharges with malnutrition received parenteral nutrition (26% versus 6%, P < 0.0001). There was increased likelihood of malnutrition among those with fistulizing CD (OR 1.65; 95% CI: 1.50-1.82) and among those who had undergone bowel resection (OR 1.37; 95% CI: 1.27-1.48). Malnutrition was associated with increased in-hospital mortality 3.49 (95% CI: 2.89-4.23), length of stay (11.9 days versus 5.8 days, P < 0.00001), and total charges ($45,188 versus $20,295, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically apparent malnutrition is more frequent among IBD admissions than among non-IBD admissions. Its association with greater mortality and resource utilization may reflect more severe underlying disease that can lead to both malnutrition and worse outcomes. Nonetheless, diagnosable malnutrition may serve as a clinical marker of poor IBD prognosis in hospitalized patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Carboxylic acids (CAs), especially butyric acid, have been suggested to counteract colonic diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and colon cancer. Colonic formation of CAs can be influenced by the diet, but the concentrations and pattern formed need to be evaluated for different food products in humans. To elucidate how the colonic concentration of CAs in healthy subjects is influenced by dietary supplementation with oat bran, and whether the concentration varies over time and during consecutive days. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twenty-five healthy subjects (age 24+/-1.3) were recruited to the study. The subjects were given 40 g beta-glucan enriched oat bran per day, corresponding to 20 g dietary fibre, in 4 slices of bread. CAs were analysed in faeces during three consecutive days after 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks on this diet. RESULTS: The concentration of acetic, propionic, butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acid was higher (P<0.05-0.001) after 8 weeks on the oat bran diet as compared with values at entry, whereas that of lactic acid was lower (P<0.05). After 12 weeks, the concentrations of acetic, propionic and isobutyric acid were still higher and that of lactic acid lower. The variation between individuals was considerable, whereas in the same individuals there was little variation. CONCLUSIONS: Oat bran increased the faecal concentration of CAs after 8 weeks, indicating an increased concentration also in the distal colon. The concentration of all main acids increased, except for lactic acid, which decreased. Oat bran may therefore have a preventive potential adjunct to colonic diseases.},

Twenty-three clinically stable patients with IBD in the outpatient clinic (11 with Crohn's disease, 12 with ulcerative colitis), who are non-smokers and non-passive smokers, were selected and the concentration of CO in their breath was measured using a breath gas analyser (TRI lyser mBA-3000). The concentration of CO in the breath of 23 patients with IBD was 2.5+/-0.9 (1.1-4.3) ppm. This concentration comes within the range of standard values in our previous reports (2.5+/-2.2 ppm). Any significant difference was not observed between 2.4+/-0.9 (1.5-4.3) ppm for the 11 Crohn's disease patients and the 2.6+/-1.0 (1.1-3.9) ppm for the 12 ulcerative colitis patients. The results suggest that clinically stable patients with IBD do not show high values for concentration of CO in the breath.},

We aim to evaluate pediatric IBD response to adalimumab. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric IBD patients treated with adalimumab. We defined response as either a decrease in the disease activity index severity or remission after 3-6 months of treatment. RESULTS: Ten patients were identified. Seven had CD, three had ulcerative colitis (UC). All had colonic disease and disease in either the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Eight patients initially responded to infliximab, 5 with CD and 3 with UC; 2 CD patients had incomplete data for evaluation. The mean and median times between initial infliximab and initial adalimumab were 29.5 and 24 months, respectively. Eight patients responded to adalimumab 40 mg or 80 mg biweekly, or 80 mg initial dose followed by 40 mg biweekly. The mean Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) in CD patients before and after adalimumab were 12 and 4.2, respectively (normal <or=10). The mean Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index (LCAI) in UC patients before and after adalimumab were 9 and 5.1, respectively (normal <10). Corticosteroids were weaned off in 4/7 patients at 1 to 10 months after initiation of adalimumab. One patient with CD and 1 patient with UC failed adalimumab, required surgery, and remained on corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab is useful in pediatric IBD patients who become intolerant of infliximab.},

Studies on health care cost of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are reviewed here. These studies were carried out in various countries with disparate health care systems. In the United States, data were often modeled or retrieved from large insurance schemes. Surgery and in-patient hospitalization accounted for over half the outlay on UC and CD. Fistulous disease in CD and parenteral nutrition were very costly. In Canada, overall charges were lower than in the United States, but there too, surgical costs were relatively high. In European studies, economic data were abstracted directly from patients' files. One pan-European study examined the outlay on UC and CD in a community-based prospective inception cohort followed for 10 years. Overall costs in Europe were lower than in the United States. Surgery, hospitalization, year of follow-up, disease phenotype in CD and ASCA-positivity impacted significantly on costs. In all studies, the cost data were right skewed, aminosalicylates were expensive drugs, and biological agents the most expensive; moreover indirect costs were not calculated. Infliximab raised costs considerably in CD, but there were no long-term follow-up studies, so that the cost-benefit of biological agents remains unknown. In conclusion, costs of managing UC and CD vary by country, surgery, genotype and several other factors. The most important question for further research is whether the biological therapies are cost-effective in the long-term.},

With a high level of evidence, it is concluded that the use of certain strains of probiotics significantly reduces the risk for antibiotic-induced diarrhea. Although further studies are needed, the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics in people suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (particularly ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis) might improve the rates of remission induction/maintenance. The administration of probiotics and symbiotics to patients with liver transplant, severe acute pancreatitis, and intensive and surgical care patients, emerges as a promising therapeutic option that seems to reduce the number of infections; however, it is currently no possible to establish evidence-based recommendations, with a need for a higher number of better designed works. About safety of probiotics and symbiotics, the benefits/risks ratio clearly favors the former since the risk for infection is low, even in immunosuppressed patients. There are, however, selected groups of patients in which caution is advised.},

ONS and/or TF in addition to normal food is indicates in undernourished patients with CD or UC to improve nutritional status. In active CD EN is the first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant differences have been shown in the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and hole protein formulae for TF. In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid dependent patients in CD. In patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the adaptation phase and should be changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in addition to normal food. Special nutrition support should not be used routinely in patients with mild or moderate acute pancreatitis. EN is the preffered route in patients with pancreatitis and should be attempted before initiating parenteral nutrition. Nutrition assessment in patients with liver disease should include screening for micronutrient deficiencies. Protein restriction should be implemented for the acute management of hepatic encephalopathy and should not be implemented chronically in patients with liver disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To extend development of a pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measure by determining its factor structure and associations of factors with generic HRQoL measures and clinical variables. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of children and adolescents ages 8 years to 18 years and their parents attending any of 6 US IBD centers, recruited from either existing registry of age-eligible subjects or visits to participating centers. The survey included generic (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) and IBD-specific (Impact Questionnaire) quality of life measures, disease activity, and other clinical indicators. We carried out factor analysis of Impact responses, comparing resulting factors with results on the generic HRQoL and the clinical measures. RESULTS: We included 220 subjects (161 with Crohn disease and 59 with ulcerative colitis). Initial confirmatory factor analysis did not support the 6 proposed Impact domains. Exploratory factor analysis indicated 4 factors with good to excellent reliability for IBD responses: general well-being and symptoms, emotional functioning, social interactions, and body image. Two items did not load well on any factor. The 4 factors correlated well with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and subscales. Children with higher disease activity scores and other indicators of clinical activity reported lower HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further characteristics of a HRQoL measure specific to pediatric IBD and indicates ways to score the measure based on the resulting factor structure. The measure correlates appropriately with generic HRQoL measures and clinical severity indicators.},

Several recent series have suggested that, in most cases, CMV reactivation does not lead to severe complications and resolves spontaneously with the UC flare and discontinuation of immunosuppression. In the present paper, we describe two patients with active UC who developed a severe systemic CMV infection during a treatment with an oral microemulsion form of cyclosporine. This is of concern, particularly in a context of increasing use of immunosuppressive drugs in UC. We propose a prophylactic and curative approach to decrease morbidity related to CMV infection in active UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Normal sleep is paramount for a healthy lifestyle and high quality of life. Sleep modulates the immune system and thus affects the course of several chronic inflammatory conditions. There are no reported studies that address the role of sleep disturbance in the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to characterize sleep disturbance in IBD using validated measures of sleep and quality of life. METHODS: A self-administered, mail-in questionnaire package was sent to 205 subjects after a brief instruction. The questionnaire package was composed of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a measure of disease severity and the IBD-Quality of Life Questionnaire. A total of 119 subjects were recruited (58% response rate): 80 with inactive IBD, 24 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 15 healthy controls. RESULTS: The IBD subjects reported significantly prolonged sleep latency, frequent sleep fragmentation, higher rate of using sleeping pills, decreased day-time energy, increased tiredness and poor overall sleep quality compared to healthy controls. The abnormal sleep patterns in IBD subjects were similar to IBS subjects. The reported sleep quality was correlated with IBD disease severity score (r(2) = 0.55, P = 0.02). Both IBD and IBS subjects thought that sleep and their disease status were correlated. CONCLUSION: The results show that IBD patients have significant sleep disturbance even when their disease is not active. This problem might affect quality of life, gastrointestinal symptoms and coping ability, and might potentially modify disease severity or increase risk of flare-up. Regardless of the primary or secondary origin of this problem, sleep disturbance should be addressed in the clinical management of patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {The present study describes a novel bacterial isolate exhibiting high ability to synthesise and secrete butyrate. The novel isolated bacterium was obtained from human faeces and grown in selective liquid intestinal microflora medium containing rumen fluid under microaerobic conditions. Its probiotic properties were demonstrated by the ability of the isolate to survive high acidity and medium containing bile acids and the ability to adhere to colon cancer cells (Caco-2) in vitro. Phylogenetic identity to Enterococcus durans was established using specific primers for 16S rRNA (99% probability). PCR analyses with primers to the bacterial gene encoding butyrate kinase, present in the butyrogenic bacteria Clostridium, showed that this gene is present in E. durans. The in vivo immunoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of E. durans were assessed in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in Balb/c mice. Administration of E. durans ameliorated histological, clinical and biochemical scores directly related to intestinal inflammation whereas the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus delbrueckii was ineffective in this regard. Colonic cDNA concentrations of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were significantly down regulated in DSS-treated E. durans-fed mice but not in control or DSS-treated L. delbrueckii- fed mice. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation analyses of colonic tissue from mice fed E. durans, using a butyrate kinase probe, demonstrated that E. durans significantly adheres to the colonic tissue. The novel isolated bacterium described in the present paper, upon further characterisation, can be developed into a useful probiotic aimed at the treatment of patients suffering from ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nutrition plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and treatment of the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In addition, patients with inflammatory bowel disease are often found to have nutrient deficiencies at the time of diagnosis, whereas others develop features of malnutrition over the course of their illness. Therefore, an understanding of the relationship between nutrients and inflammatory bowel disease is important if these patients are to receive optimal care. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic and basic research has helped to shed light on the interaction between diet and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Numerous clinical trials utilizing various types of lipids, including fish oil and short chain fatty acids, suggest that fats play an important role in the inflammatory response that characterizes inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamins and other micronutrients involved in nutrient metabolism and modulation of oxidative stress are also considered in this review. SUMMARY: This update discusses nutritional issues that can be used to help prevent and treat nutrient deficiencies and ameliorate disease activity in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Dysregulation of interleukin-8 (IL-8) production has been proposed to contribute to intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Previous studies, which evaluate adult patients with long-standing or steroid-modulated disease, have reported conflicting results regarding the role of IL-8 in IBD pathogenesis. The present study evaluates IL-8 in colonic organ cultures and sera of newly and previously diagnosed pediatric IBD patients with various degrees of histopathologic activity. Colon and terminal ileum biopsies were obtained from 26 patients with Crohn's disease, 12 with ulcerative colitis, 4 with indeterminate colitis, and 12 age-matched normal controls. IBD patients were additionally characterized as newly or previously diagnosed. Supernatants from organ-cultured lamina propria biopsies and sera were evaluated by ELISA for IL-8 protein. IL-8 increased with degree of histologic inflammation regardless of diagnosis (no pathologic diagnosis, 62.6 ng/ml, interquartile range [IQR] 30.4-94.6 ng/ml; mild, 92.0 ng/ml, IQR 21.9-170.0 ng/ml; moderate, 676.2 ng/ml, IQR 46.4-2967.7 ng/ml; severe, 585.6 ng/ml, IQR 149.7-1602.2 ng/ml; P < 0.01). Lamina propria IL-8 was significantly elevated in moderately and severely inflamed tissue segments (603.26 ng/ml; IQR, 72.15-2240.4 ng/ml) compared to noninflamed and mildly inflamed segments (67.70 ng/ml; IQR, 30.38-124.1 ng/ml; P = 0.0009). There was no significant trend in IL-8 concentration when compared by clinical diagnosis. No significant difference was found in IL-8 concentrations in organ cultures from newly diagnosed patients versus those from previously diagnosed patients. There was no significant correlation between serum IL-8 concentration and organ culture IL-8 concentration. We conclude that higher concentrations of IL-8 are found in more histologically inflamed tissue segments from pediatric IBD patients. IL-8 does not appear to be associated with clinical IBD subtype. IL-8 appears to be an integral part of both early and established mucosal inflammation in pediatric IBD patients. These findings suggest that IL-8-specific therapies may universally modify inflammatory activity in IBD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To study the use patterns of a Persian web-based patient education system for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in Iran. METHODS: A web-based patient education system was developed with Persian content in three sections: general, ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD). The website included a forum for patients to communicate as a self-help group. A customized web tracking system recorded web use statistics. Polls at the bottom of each page collected the visitors' opinion on the extent of helpfulness and readability of page contents. Web use data were analyzed for an 18-month period from October 2004 to April 2006. RESULTS: Having excluded page visits from search engine robots, the website's homepage was visited 4452 times (mean of monthly visits: 234, range: 102-330). The web pages titled Anatomy of gastrointestinal system, Nutrition in IBD, Diagnostic tests, How to cope with IBD, and IBD in women were the most favorite in general section. The web page titled IBD treatment was the most visited in both CD and UC sections followed by the web pages on cause of disease, diagnostic procedures and complications in CD section; and those titled symptoms, cause of disease and risk factors in the UC section. Overall, the content evaluation polls received 294 hits (from 186 unique visitors) of which, 196 (67%) were from patients, 30 (10%) from patients' relatives/friends, 21 (7%) from doctors, and 47 (16%) from other groups. During the 18-month period, 47 patients registered in the self-help forum, 24 threads were opened, and 97 posts (33 in CD and 64 in UC section) were sent. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the increasing trend of Internet use in developing countries like Iran, and the consequent increase in the proportion of Internet-using patients, and finally the time constraints gastroenterologists face answering patients' questions; similar websites seem to be effective ways of patient education in close future.},

PN is indicated only at post-surgery when there are major complications associated with intestinal failure. Early post-surgery EN, or oral supplements, seems to be beneficial. Pouchitis occurs after proctocolectomy with ileoanal anastomosis with the creation of a reservoir in patients with ulcerative colitis, and is well managed with antibiotic therapy, steroids, and probiotics.

   abstract = {Genetic factors play a significant role in determining inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility. Epidemiologic data support genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of IBD, which include familial aggregation, twin studies, racial and ethnic differences in disease prevalence. Linkage studies have identified several susceptibility genes contained in different genomic regions named IBD1 to IBD9. Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are the most extensively studied genetic regions (IBD1 and IBD3 respectively) in IBD. Mutations of the NOD2 gene are associated with Crohn's disease (CD) and several HLA genes are associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) and CD. Toll like receptors (TLRs) have an important role in the innate immune response against infections by mediating recognition of pathogen-associated microbial patterns. Studying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in molecules involved in bacterial recognition seems to be essential to define genetic backgrounds at risk of IBD. Recently, numerous new genes have been identified to be involved in the genetic susceptibility to IBD: NOD1/Caspase-activation recruitment domains 4 (CARD4), Chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), IL-11, and IL-18 among others. The characterization of these novel genes potentially will lead to the identification of therapeutic agents and clinical assessment of phenotype and prognosis in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains only partially understood, and no specific or universally effective patient management procedure has been developed to date. Our study was designed to evaluate if colonic luminal serine-proteases may be a relevant pathophysiologic marker of IBS. METHODS: Fecal samples of 38 IBS patients, 15 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 15 healthy controls were studied. Fecal serine-protease activity was determined photometrically by using azocasein as a proteolytic substrate; fecal pancreatic elastase-1 and mast cell tryptase content were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fecal secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in control subjects and in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. RESULTS: Fecal serine-protease activity was 3-fold higher in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS than in both controls and IBS patients with either constipation or alternating bowel habits. Fecal serine-protease activity was not correlated with the frequency of bowel movements in all groups. Increased serine-protease activity also was detected in stools of UC patients. No significant difference was observed in the fecal mast cell tryptase and pancreatic elastase concentrations between all groups, or in the fecal secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor concentration between controls and diarrhea-predominant IBS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal serine-protease activity is increased markedly in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. This increase, however, is not coupled with changes in either mast cell tryptase or pancreatic elastase concentrations. Thus, serine-protease activity in the colon may be a pathophysiologic factor in the development of diarrhea-predominant IBS.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The induction and maintenance of disease remission and prevention of complications are primary goals in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Recent research has added new insights into the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and treatment options for children with inflammatory bowel disease, and the findings will enable clinicians to develop a more rational approach to the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Population-based studies have confirmed the increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in children. Previous medical history and serologies can be predictive of complications in Crohn's disease. Newer radiological and capsule endoscopic modalities have a potential future role in the diagnosis and interval assessment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Biological therapies play an increasingly prominent role in the management of children with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Studies of children with inflammatory bowel disease suggest that behavioral interventions may have a positive impact on morbidity and overall quality of life. SUMMARY: New information concerning the natural history of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and a better understanding of different treatment modalities will enable the development of increasingly effective and individualized pharmacological treatment plans for children with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases include chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorders, represented by ulcerative proctocolitis and Crohns disease, commonly associated with malnutrition. AIM: Characterize the nutritional and socioeconomic profile of patients hospitalized at the Pernambuco "Hospital das Clinicas", Recife, PE, Brazil. METHODS: Cross-sectional study carried out at the gastroenterology clinic, which was previously approved by the Ethics Commission for studies involving human beings. The methods included clinical history data, socioeconomic conditions and nutritional assessment. Data were subject to statistical analysis (Students t test for equal and unequal variables). RESULTS: The sample consisted of 24 male and female patients, with a mean age of 43.83 +/- 16.13 years, mostly married, coming from Recife, with low income, who lived in their own house with relatives. We found a higher prevalence of ulcerative proctocolitis (62.5%), with diagnosis time of more than 5 years, symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody-mucous diarrhea with 6-9 evacuations/day, with the distal colon being the most affected part. Osteoporosis was present in 26.7% of cases. Nutritional status was assessed through the body mass index. The weight loss percentage corresponded to 41.7% and 70.8%, respectively, classified as malnourished, associated or not with high prevalence levels of anemia, hypoalbuminemia and hypocalcemia. Gender correlation evidenced higher triceps fold and arm circumference values in men. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the study limitations, data suggest relevant information about the occurrence of these diseases in the northeast of Brazil, as well as about its frequent association with important nutritional deficiencies.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical experience of our center of the use of infliximab in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all infliximab infusions administered in the Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit from October of 1999 to October of 2006. Fourteen patients (nine with Crohn's disease, three with ulcerative colitis, and two with indeterminate colitis) with a mean age of 9.6 years at diagnosis were treated with infliximab. Seventy-seven infusions were administered. RESULTS: Efficacy was analyzed according to inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn's disease: in severe cases (PCDAI > 30), clinical remission (PCDAI < 10) was obtained in 80 % of the patients at week 10, decreasing to 60 % at week 54. Corticosteroid therapy could be reduced in 89 % of the patients and was discontinued in 55.5 %. Ulcerative colitis: clinical remission (modified Truelove-Witts index < 10) was initially obtained in 100 % of the patients but only 33 % were still in clinical remission at the end of the study. In the two corticosteroid-dependent patients, corticosteroid therapy could be reduced and even discontinued in one (50 %). Indeterminate colitis: neither of the two patients achieved clinical remission. The most frequent adverse effects observed were acute infusional reactions (42.8 % of the patients and 10.3 % of infusions), one of which was severe, and infections (28.6 % of patients), one of which (ileal abscess) required surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of infliximab seems to differ considerably in the distinct types of inflammatory bowel disease and is practically null in indeterminate colitis. Randomized controlled studies in children are required to assess the exact efficacy of infliximab in our patients.},

Ecological treatments including probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are actively studied in Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis. We review herein the literature on the rational use of probiotics in IBD considering efficacy (as evaluated in randomized controlled trials), mechanisms of action and safety issues. A probiotic effect is strictly restricted to one defined strain and cannot be generalized from one to another. There is evidence of efficacy of some probiotic drugs in pouchitis (VSL#3), and in the prevention of recurrence of UC (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917). However, the evidence for efficacy of probiotic drugs in CD is still low as well as that of dietary ecological treatments. Despite an ecological (hopefully nutritional) treatment of IBD is promising, many questions remain unanswered and further clinical and fundamental studies are needed.},

   abstract = {Diarrhea continues to be a prevalent symptom in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), requiring a wide differential diagnosis to define the pathophysiologic mechanisms in individual patients. It is essential that physicians properly evaluate complaints of diarrhea by assessing both patient symptoms and potential physiologic impacts on fluid and electrolyte status. Underlying mechanisms of diarrhea with IBD are the location, extent, and severity of inflammation; malabsorption; altered motility; and iatrogenic causes such as medications, diet, and antibiotic-associated colitis (eg, Clostridium difficile). When treating diarrhea, physicians need to control inflammatory activity using appropriate treatment algorithms. Therapies include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immune modifiers, and, most recently, biologic treatment. Other medications, including loperamide, diphenoxylate, codeine sulfate, and tinctures of opium, slow motility and increase the absorption of fluids and nutrients. For iatrogenic issues, medications that cause diarrhea should be withdrawn and individual diets modified. Not all diarrheas in the IBD patient are the same; therefore, it is essential to tailor therapies according to presumed etiologies. Antidiarrheal agents are not recommended in extremely ill patients and those with known hypersensitivity or evidence of obstruction or colonic dilation, fever, or abdominal tenderness. Concomitant use of loperamide with diphenoxylate and atropine should be avoided in early pregnancy.},

We applied proteome analysis (PA) to characterize changes in the protein expression profile of primary IEC from patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Surgical specimens from 18 patients with active CD (N = 6), UC (N = 6), and colonic cancer (N = 6) were used to purify primary IEC from ileal and colonic tissues. Changes in protein expression were identified using 2D-gel electrophoreses (2D SDS-PAGE) and peptide mass fingerprinting via MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) as well as Western blot analysis. PA of primary IEC from inflamed ileal tissue of CD patients and colonic tissue of UC patients identified 21 protein spots with at least 2-fold changes in steady-state expression levels compared to the noninflamed tissue of control patients. Statistical significance was achieved for 9 proteins including the Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor alpha that was up-regulated in CD and UC patients. Additionally, 40 proteins with significantly altered expression levels were identified in IEC from inflamed compared to noninflamed tissue regions of single UC (N = 2) patients. The most significant change was detected for programmed cell death protein 8 (7.4-fold increase) and annexin 2A (7.7-fold increase). PA in primary IEC from IBD patients revealed significant expression changes of proteins that are associated with signal transduction, stress response as well as energy metabolism. The induction of Rho GDI alpha expression may be associated with the destruction of IEC homeostasis under condition of chronic intestinal inflammation.},

The control of lactose digestion phenotypically divides populations into those who can [lactase persistent (LP)] and those who cannot [lactase nonpersistent (LNP)] assimilate lactose. LNP subjects, however, can adapt to lactose intolerance through intestinal bacteria. The DF/LNP status interactions may function as disease risk modifiers. We evaluated the relationship between DF and LNP with colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, and stomach cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD; Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Yearly per capita DF consumption, LNP national prevalence, cancer mortality, and incidence of IBD were obtained from several sources. A negative binomial regression model was used to derive incremental risks. There were statistically significant (P <or= 0.05) increases in risk for colorectal and prostate cancer and ulcerative colitis with DFs and a statistically significant decreased risk for stomach cancer. There were trends (P<0.1) for lung and ovarian cancers and Crohn's disease. As LNP prevalence increased, stomach cancer risk increased, whereas risks of all other conditions decreased (P<0.01). In 3 cancers (prostate, ovarian, and breast), meta-analyses of case-based studies support ecological data. In colorectal cancer, on the contrary, meta-analyses of case-based studies suggest protection. The possible importance of distinguishing LNP/LP status in studies is discussed.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are associated with extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) in approximately 40% of patients. Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha, is effective for induction and maintenance of remission of CD and UC. The role of infliximab for EIMs related to IBD has been less studied, but it is likely as effective. The EIMs may run a course that parallels IBD activity or may present separately. The EIMs that parallel intestinal inflammation (eg, peripheral arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, and episcleritis) generally respond to infliximab. Therefore, treating patients with IBD who have one of these EIMs will more often than not improve the EIM. The EIMs that run a separate course from IBD are more difficult to treat. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) have variable responses to IBD medications. Infliximab is efficacious for uveitis and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AS. The efficacy of infliximab for PSC is unknown. The dosing schedule of infliximab for IBD patients with EIMs should be induction doses with 5 mg/kg at 0, 2, and 6 weeks followed by every 8 weeks. Whether long-term infliximab therapy is necessary to maintain remission of EIMs, as in the case of IBD, has not been established.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is a potentially curative option for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). A rare, postoperative complication is terminal ileitis which has been poorly documented in paediatric patients. A search of our paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) database revealed two boys with UC who were resistant to medical therapy. They each underwent colectomy with IPAA. One year later, both children represented with bloody diarrhoea and weight loss. Several endoscopies and biopsies showed acute on chronic mucosal inflammation in the pouch and up to 50 cm into the terminal ileum (TI). Biopsies revealed mixed inflammatory infiltrate with no granulomas. CONCLUSION: Development of terminal ileitis after colectomy and IPAA can occur in children with UC. Although every effort should be made to exclude Crohn's disease as a cause of the terminal ileitis, this poorly defined condition should not be considered to be against the diagnosis of UC. More research is needed to develop a better understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of this uncommon condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Many IBD patients not responding to azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) preferentially metabolize 6-MP to 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP). We describe the use of allopurinol in AZA/6-MP nonresponders to deliberately shunt metabolism of 6-MP toward 6-thioguanine (6-TGN) and improve clinical responses. METHODS: Twenty outpatients who were AZA/6-MP nonresponders and had high 6-MMP metabolite levels were included. Subjects were commenced on allopurinol 100 mg daily, and the dose of 6-MP/AZA was reduced to 25%-50% of the original dose. RESULTS: After allopurinol was started, mean 6-TGN levels increased from 191.3 (+/- standard error of the mean) +/- 17.1 to 400.3 +/- 36.9 pmol/8 x 10(8) red blood cells (P < .001), whereas mean 6-MMP levels decreased from 10,604.7 +/- 1278.2 to 2000.6 +/- 437.1 pmol/8 x 10(8) red blood cells (P < .001). The addition of allopurinol led to a reduction in the mean partial Harvey Bradshaw Index in Crohn's disease patients from 4.9 +/- 1.0 to 1.5 +/- 0.3 points (P = .001), and in ulcerative colitis patients mean Mayo Scores decreased from 4.1 +/- 0.7 to 2.9 +/- 0.7 points (P = .13). The addition of allopurinol enabled a reduction in mean daily prednisone dosage from 17.6 +/- 3.9 to 1.8 +/- 0.7 mg (P < .001) and led to normalization of transaminase levels, with mean AST levels reducing from 42.5 +/- 8.1 to 23.5 +/- 1.6 IU (P = .12) and mean ALT levels reducing from 101.6 +/- 26.9 to 33.9 +/- 5.2 IU (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of allopurinol to thiopurine nonresponders with high 6-MMP metabolite levels is an effective and safe means of optimizing 6-TGN production, leading to improved disease activity scores, reduced corticosteroid requirements, and normalization of liver enzymes.},

   abstract = {The normal colonic microflora is intimately involved in the aetiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). These conditions are often refractile to conventional treatments involving the employment of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs, and this has led to a search for alternative therapies based on the use of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. The majority of investigations in this area have been done with probiotics, and while there is increasing interest in the abilities of prebiotics and synbiotics to control the symptoms of IBD, very few randomised controlled trials have been reported. Although the results have been variable, human and animal studies have demonstrated that in many circumstances, these functional foods can alter the composition of the colonic microbiota, reduce inflammatory processes in the gut mucosa, and have the potential to induce disease remission. More work is needed to understand the effects of prebiotics and synbiotics on microbial communities in the gut, and their interactions with the host's immune system.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is no clear evidence that dietary proteins aggravate Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to clarify the antibody response to dietary proteins in CD. METHODS: Antibody to porcine pancreatic amylase (PPA) a protease-resistant dietary protein (anti-PPA), was examined in CD patients (N = 104), ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (N = 85), and healthy controls (N = 83), and its relationship with the clinical characteristics of CD was investigated. Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), and antibodies to I2 from Pseudomonas fluorescens (anti-I2) were also examined. RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent (39/104) of the CD patients expressed anti-PPA antibodies, and this percentage was significantly higher as compared with the control group (5%, 4/83) and the UC group (9%, 8/85) (P < 0.001). A significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibodies was detected in patients with "small bowel disease-dominant" CD than in those with "colitis-dominant" CD (P < 0.05). Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin were not specifically expressed in CD patients. As ASCA was detected in 33% and anti-I2 in 46% of the CD patients, 72% of the CD patients were found positive for at least one of the three antibodies including anti-PPA antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients showed a specific antibody response to PPA, as compared with UC patients and controls. There was a significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibody in patients with "small bowel disease-dominant" CD, suggesting that dietary proteins could play a role in the inflammatory response in CD patients with small bowel disease. Anti-PPA antibodies combined with ASCA/anti-I2 may be useful for the diagnosis of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) it is not known whether reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) are a consequence of bone turnover alterations and if BMD improves with treatment. METHODS: In a cohort of children with IBD, we prospectively measured indicators of bone remodeling, body mass index (BMI), disease activity, intact parathyroid hormone, serum IL-6, and insulin-like growth factor-I at diagnosis and then every 6 months for 2 years. BMD was determined annually using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). BMD Z-scores were calculated using height/age. Baseline measurements and calcium intake were compared with a group of age- and sex-matched healthy children. RESULTS: We observed that at diagnosis total body BMD Z-score (mean +/- SD) was -0.78 +/- 1.02 for Crohn's disease (CD, n = 58), -0.46 +/- 1.14 for ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 18), and -0.17 +/- 0.95 for control (CL, n = 49) (P < 0.01, CD versus CL). In CD, a BMD Z-score <-1.0 was associated with lower BMI and higher serum IL-6. Patients with CD and UC had low bone turnover. Activation of bone formation paralleled clinical improvement, but BMC gain was less than expected over the 2-year study period, especially in CD. Prednisone use did not correlate with low BMD. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased bone turnover occurs in children newly diagnosed with IBD. Although indicators of osteoblast activity increase with clinical improvement, bone mineral accrual does not accelerate. Children with low BMI may be considered for BMD screening, since they are at risk for low bone mass.},

   abstract = {Upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease has become increasingly recognized, even in the absence of specific localizing symptoms, as patients more frequently undergo upper endoscopy. Although the recent Montreal classification system allowed classification of upper GI involvement in Crohn's disease (CD), independent of other locations, a consensus regarding the definition of what qualifies as significant "involvement" is still lacking. Reported incidence data vary considerably depending on the definitions used and the selected target population. Pediatric data suggest that upper endoscopy is useful in differentiating CD from ulcerative colitis, when inflammation is otherwise predominantly confined to the colon; however, this question has yet to be studied in adults. Infliximab therapy for upper GI-CD seems as effective as that seen for more distal GI inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Colonoscopic appearance, the primary measure of disease activity in adult ulcerative colitis, is less acceptable to children. Our aim was to develop a noninvasive activity index of pediatric ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Item selection was performed judgmentally using a Delphi group of 36 experts in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Item weighting was performed by regression modeling using a prospective cohort of 157 pediatric ulcerative colitis patients. Validation was assessed on a separate prospective cohort of 48 children with ulcerative colitis undergoing complete colonoscopy. Responsiveness was evaluated at a follow-up visit of 75 children using effect size statistics and diagnostic utility approaches. RESULTS: A list of 41 items was generated and reduced to 11 by rank order. Two physicians completed the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) on each of the patients in the weighting cohort. Six clinical items were significant in the regression analysis; the laboratory items and an endoscopic appearance item did not improve the PUCAI performance. In the validation cohort, the PUCAI was highly correlated with the Physician's Global Assessment (r = 0.91, P < .001), Mayo score (r = 0.95, P < .001), and colonoscopic appearance (r = 0.77, P < .001). Correlations were higher than 2 noninvasive adult indices calculated concurrently. Interobserver and test-retest reliability were excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93-0.97). Cut-off points were established using receiver operator characteristic curves on the full cohort. Excellent responsiveness was found at repeated visits (effect size = 1.9, area under the receiver operator characteristic curve = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: The rigorously developed PUCAI is a noninvasive, valid, highly reliable, and responsive index with which to assess disease activity in pediatric ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3, fish oil) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, n-3 therapy may be beneficial in chronic inflammatory disorders such as ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the efficacy and safety of n-3 for maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis (UC). SEARCH STRATEGY: The following databases were searched from their inception without language restriction: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Healthstar, PubMed, and ACP journal club. Experts were contacted for unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) of fish oil for maintenance of remission in UC were included. Studies must have enrolled patients (of any age group) who were in remission at the time of recruitment, and were followed for at least six months. The intervention must have been fish oil given in pre-defined dosage. Co-interventions were allowed only if they were balanced between the study groups. The primary outcome was relapse rate and the secondary outcome was frequency of adverse events. Other outcomes to assess efficacy were change in disease activity scores and time to first relapse. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality. Meta-analysis weighted by the Mantel-Haenszel method was performed using RevMan 4.2.8 software. Random or fixed effect models were used according to degree of heterogeneity and subgroup analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity. A sensitivity analysis was performed excluding a study of questionable quality . MAIN RESULTS: The three studies that were included used different formulation and dosing of n-3 but none used enteric coated capsules. The pooled analysis showed a similar relapse rate in the n-3 treated patients and controls (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.51 to 2.03; P = 0.96). Combining the studies resulted in virtually no statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.93, I(2) = 0%). Various subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar results. However, the total number of patients enrolled in these studies was small (n = 138). No significant adverse events were recorded in any of the studies and not enough data were available to pool the other secondary outcomes for meta-analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found that supports the use of omega 3 fatty acids for maintenance of remission in UC. Further studies using enteric coated capsules may be justified.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the predominance of extensive disease in children with ulcerative colitis, data concerning severe paediatric ulcerative colitis are sparse. We reviewed rates and predictors of response to intravenous-corticosteroid therapy in a single-centre cohort with long-term follow-up. METHODS: 99 children (49% males; age 2-17 years) were hospitalised (1991-2000) for treatment of severe ulcerative colitis (90% extensive; 49% new onset ulcerative colitis). Clinical, laboratory and radiographic data were reviewed. A population-based subset was used to assess incidence. Predictors of corticosteroid response were analysed using univariate and multivariate analyses at days 3 and 5 of therapy. Colectomy rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. RESULTS: 28% (95% CI, 23 to 34%) of children with ulcerative colitis resident in the Greater Toronto Area required admission for intravenous corticosteroid therapy, of whom 53 (53%; 95% CI, 44 to 63%) responded. Several predictors were associated with corticosteroid failure, but in multivariable modelling only C-reactive protein [OR = 3.5 (1.4 to 8.4)] and number of nocturnal stools [OR = 3.2 (1.6 to 6.6)] remained significant at both days 3 and 5. The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), Travis and Lindgren's indices strongly predicted non-response. Radiographically, the upper range of colonic luminal width was 40 mm in children younger than 11 years versus 60 mm in older patients. Cumulative colectomy rates at discharge, 1 year and 6 years were 42%, 58% and 61%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ulcerative colitis commonly experience at least one severe exacerbation. Response to intravenous corticosteroids is poor. The PUCAI, determined at day 3 (>45 points) should be used to screen for patients likely to fail corticosteroids and at day 5 (>70 points) to dictate the introduction of second-line therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colectomy is a potentially life-saving procedure for patients with severe attacks of UC who fail medical therapy. We aimed to systematically review studies that reported the short-term colectomy rate in severe UC or reported variables that could predict treatment failure. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search for cohort studies and controlled trials published between 1974-2006. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria; 16 reported short-term outcome and predictors of therapy failure, 13 only outcome, and 3 only predictors. In the pooled analysis, 581 of 1991 patients required colectomy (weighted mean 27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26%-28%), and 22 died (1%; 95% CI, 0.7%-1.5%). In a heterogeneity-controlled meta-regression, colectomy rate did not change during the last 30 years (R(2) = 0.07, P = .8). Cyclosporine was used in only 100 patients, with a 51% (95% CI, 41%-60%) short-term success rate. A second meta-regression failed to demonstrate a dose-colectomy response of methylprednisolone therapy beyond 60 mg daily (R(2) < 0.01, P = .98). More than 20 variables were identified in 19 studies to predict medical therapy failure, but only a few were consistently reproduced: disease extent, stool frequency, temperature, heart rate, C-reactive protein, albumin, and radiologic assessment. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term colectomy rate in severe UC has remained stable during the last 30 years, despite the introduction of cyclosporine, which was not used frequently. We could not find any support for administering methylprednisolone at a higher dose than 60 mg/day. Variables that predict outcome of corticosteroid therapy could aid in the development of guidelines for introduction of rescue therapies in severe UC.},

The immune response and inflammation are mediated by polyunsaturated fatty acids and influenced by dietary fats and lipid metabolism. This study examined the qualitative and quantitative fat intake of IBD patients and healthy controls on plasma phospholipid and erythrocyte membrane phospholipid (EMP) fatty acid content. Measurement of the fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipid and EMP were performed in 29 UC patients, 20 CD patients, and 31 healthy controls. Anthropometric characteristics and data on dietary intake were also collected. We observed significantly lower lipid intake in UC and CD patients vs controls. The UC and CD patients had significantly higher levels of linoleic acid in their EMP than did controls. There were no significant differences in the levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but there were significantly higher levels of the n-6 in the EMP of UC and CD patients compared with controls. The significant differences persisted after the data were adjusted for potential confounders and lipid intake. Higher levels of linoleic acids and n-6 fatty acids, which are involved in production of proinflammatory mediators, were found in IBD patients compared with controls, thereby implicating n-6 fatty acids in the pathophysiology of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This prospective, controlled, and multicentric study evaluated nutritional status, body composition, muscle strength, and quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in clinical remission. In addition, possible effects of gender, malnutrition, inflammation, and previous prednisolone therapy were investigated. METHODS: Nutritional status (subjective global assessment [SGA], body mass index, albumin, trace elements), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, anthropometry), handgrip strength, and quality of life were assessed in 94 patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 61 female and 33 male, Crohn's Disease Activity Index 71 +/- 47), 50 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; 33 female and 17 male, Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index 3.1 +/- 1.5), and 61 healthy control subjects (41 female and 20 male) from centers in Berlin, Vienna, and Bari. For further analysis of body composition, 47 well-nourished patients with inflammatory bowel disease were pair-matched by body mass index, sex, and age to healthy controls. Data are presented as median (25th-75th percentile). RESULTS: Most patients with inflammatory bowel disease (74%) were well nourished according to the SGA, body mass index, and serum albumin. However, body composition analysis demonstrated a decrease in body cell mass (BCM) in patients with CD (23.1 kg, 20.8-28.7, P = 0.021) and UC (22.6 kg, 21.0-28.0, P = 0.041) compared with controls (25.0 kg, 22.0-32.5). Handgrip strength correlated with BCM (r = 0.703, P = 0.001) and was decreased in patients with CD (32.8 kg, 26.0-41.1, P = 0.005) and UC (31.0 kg, 27.3-37.8, P = 0.001) compared with controls (36.0 kg, 31.0-52.0). The alterations were seen even in patients classified as well nourished. BCM was lower in patients with moderately increased serum C-reactive protein levels compared with patients with normal levels. CONCLUSION: In CD and UC, selected micronutrient deficits and loss of BCM and muscle strength are frequent in remission and cannot be detected by standard malnutrition screening.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Adipokines are fat-derived hormones and cytokines with immune-modulating and metabolic properties. Most of them are associated with insulin resistance. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate circulating levels of adipokines and glucose homeostasis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to evaluate possible associations with the course and characteristics of the disease. METHODS: Serum leptin, resistin, visfatin, retinol-binding protein-4, adiponectin, glucose, insulin, and inflammatory parameters were analyzed in 93 patients with inactive IBD (49 with Crohn's disease [CD], 44 with ulcerative colitis [UC]), 35 patients with active IBD (18 with CD, 17 with UC), and 37 age- and body mass index-matched healthy controls. Ninety-two patients were followed for 6 mo. RESULTS: Leptin was similar in patients with IBD and controls, whereas resistin and visfatin were increased in patients with active disease but not in those in remission. In active and inactive disease, adiponectin was decreased (P < 0.001) and retinol-binding protein-4 was increased (P < 0.001) compared with controls. About 60% of patients with IBD showed increased levels of insulin, whereas serum glucose remained normal, resulting in increased homeostasis model assessment values in most patients. Hyperinsulinemia was associated with the decrease in adiponectin (r = -0.572, P < 0.001) and proved to be an independent protective factor for 6-mo maintenance of remission (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: IBD led to largely similar alterations in circulating adipokines and hyperinsulinemia in patients with CD and those with UC. The unexpected protective effect of hyperinsulinemia on relapse rate denotes the role of the metabolic-inflammatory response as a modulator in IBD.},

   abstract = {Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a subset of lymphocytes that express cell surface molecules of both conventional T cells and natural killer cells and share the features of both innate and adaptive immune cells. NKT cells have been proposed to make both protective and pathogenic contributions to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). On the one hand, recent studies have shown that these cells are involved in the maintenance of mucosal homeostasis. On the other, NKT cells were shown to play a pathogenic role in human ulcerative colitis. Similar contrasting data have been generated in murine models of IBD. Whether the apparent differences in NKT response patterns depend on variations in NKT antigens and/or on the presence of specific subsets of mucosal NKT cells remains to be elucidated. In this article we review the current literature on intestinal NKT cells and their roles in IBD pathogenesis. Specifically, the nomenclature, NKT antigens, and immune mechanisms of NKT cells within the intestinal mucosa are discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fecal lactoferrin (FLA) is a neutrophil-derived surrogate marker of intestinal inflammation that is elevated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. However, the correlation between FLA levels and serological markers of disease activity has not been previously reported, to our knowledge. In the present study we evaluated the ability of FLA levels to reflect disease activity in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We further assessed the relationship between FLA levels and customary laboratory and clinical measures of inflammation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fecal specimens were collected from 148 consecutive pediatric patients (79 with Crohn disease, 62 with ulcerative colitis, and 7 with irritable bowel syndrome) and 22 healthy control individuals. Lactoferrin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IBD-SCAN, TECHLAB, Inc). Disease activity was assessed at the time of sample provision by laboratory measures (including erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and albumin) and previously validated disease activity indices (Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index, Kozarek, Harvey Bradshaw Activity Index). RESULTS: Lactoferrin levels were significantly higher in patients with ulcerative colitis (1880 +/- 565 microg/mL) (mean +/- SE) or Crohn disease (1701 +/- 382 microg/mL) than in healthy control individuals under 21 years of age (1.17 +/- 0.47 microg/mL, P < 0.001). Lactoferrin levels correlated significantly with ESR, hematocrit, albumin, and platelet count (P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that FLA levels were comparable to ESR in detecting patients with clinically active disease (P < 0.001). Patients who experienced a clinical flare within 2 months of specimen collection displayed higher lactoferrin levels (845 +/- 452 microg/mL) than did those who remained in clinical remission (190 +/- 90 microg/mL, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Data presented here demonstrate that FLA is a sensitive and specific biochemical marker of inflammation for use in the diagnosis and interval assessment of pediatric patients with IBD, and its level correlates well with both clinical disease activity indices and ESR. Elevated levels of FLA may also identify patients at greater risk for the development of subsequent clinical flares.},

Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is an important constituent of the innate immune system, and deficiency of MBL has been reported to increase the overall susceptibility of an individual to infectious disease. This study was aimed to investigate the associations between polymorphisms of the MBL gene and UC. Recruited in this study were 108 Japanese patients with UC and 144 healthy control subjects. Polymorphism at codon 54 of exon 1 of the MBL gene was investigated by polymerase chain reaction based restriction fragment length polymorphism. In general, no significant difference in MBL polymorphism was found between UC patients and health controls. However, the frequency of A carriers was significantly higher in the relapsing cases than controls (Odds ration = 2.19, 95%CI, 1.10-4.34; p = 0.023), and similar tendency was also found in A/A genotype. In conclusion, the polymorphism at codon 54 of exon 1 of the MBL gene associated with the susceptibility to the relapsing phenotype of ulcerative colitis. It suggests that codon 54 A variants of MBL gene may have an increased risk for the flare-ups of UC.},

It is thought to be due to an abnormal and uncontrolled immune response to normally occurring constituents of the intestine. Microbial agents appear to be involved in the pathogenesis and intestinal bacteria seem to be an important factor in the development and chronicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the colonic microbiota of a patient with UC. The colonic tissues were taken during surgery from a 12-year-old girl suffering from UC. The microbiota on the colonic samples was studied by cloning and sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA genes. Compared with healthy subjects, alteration of the dominant bacterial group was observed in the UC patient. We found a high incidence of Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides fragilis, and the single phylotype of the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii-like "Butyrate-producing bacterium" L2-6. Furthermore, there was a substantial presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the present case of UC. The high proportion of adverse proinflammatory species is striking in the present case compared with more normal situations. Even if those bacteria are not the cause of the UC, they most probably enhance the symptoms of the disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recognizing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is straightforward when alarm symptoms are present, such as bloody diarrhea and weight loss. When the presentation is subtle or atypical, physicians must determine which patients warrant evaluation for IBD. Appropriate use of noninvasive tests can help identify which patients should undergo further investigation. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently IBD serologies lack high enough sensitivity and specificity to make them useful as a screening test for distinguishing IBD from other disorders, but they may have a role in classifying subtypes of IBD. Fecal markers seem promising for helping to differentiate IBD from irritable bowl syndrome and for monitoring disease activity. Pharmacogenetically guided dosing is recommended for safe use of thiopurines but ongoing routine laboratory monitoring remains important. Thiopurine metabolite measurement can be useful but may not be needed in all cases. SUMMARY: Primary care physicians should continue to rely on routine laboratory tests and clinical suspicion to decide which patients with abdominal pain to refer to a gastroenterologist. Serology panels are not useful for IBD screening as the results may lead to unnecessary procedures. Although fecal markers do show promise as a screening test for IBD, patient resistance to providing stool samples may limit its usefulness in disease monitoring. Thiopurine metabolite levels are best used in conjunction with clinical status and routine laboratory tests to monitor clinical response and adverse events.},

Mainstays of drug treatments for IBD include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, methotrexate and cyclosporin. Advances in basic research of the pathophysiological process in IBD have been applied to generate a variety of new therapeutics targeting at different levels of the inflammatory processes. New therapies are classified as: (1) Anti-TNFalpha antibodies; (2) Recombinant cytokines; (3) Selective adhesion blockade; (4) Growth factors; (5) Innate immunostimulation; (6) Nucleic acid based therapies; (7) Gene therapy; (8) Autologous bone-marrow transplantation; (9) Helminths and (10) Extracorporeal immunomodulation.

However, it has not been studied extensively in hospitalized patients who require colectomy as a rescue therapy for severe ulcerative colitis refractory to intravenous corticosteroids. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of infliximab in hospitalized patients with severe ulcerative colitis refractory to intravenous corticoids as a rescue therapy before colectomy. METHODS: 10 severe ulcerative colitis patients refractory to intravenous hydrocortisone administered for at least 7 days and candidate for colectomy were selected to receive a single infusion of infliximab (5 mg/kg). RESULTS: 8 patients failed to respond to infliximab and required colectomy during the hospitalization period. The median time to operation after infliximab infusion was 21 days. Of 8 patients, 6 had a partial clinical response manifested by a decreasing number of bowel movements and rectal bleeding during 7-14 days after the infliximab infusion, and the remaining 2 patients showed a lack of response to infliximab infusion. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a single infliximab infusion seems to be ineffective as a rescue therapy of colectomy in hospitalized patients with severe ulcerative colitis refractory to systemic corticosteroids.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate tacrolimus in 3 situations: for the induction of remission in children with severe steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis (UC); for steroid sparing in children with steroid-dependent UC in whom treatment with other immunosuppressants fails; and for the maintenance of remission in children with steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant UC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 18 consecutive patients (13 with pancolitis) who were treated with oral tacrolimus at our institution from May 1999 to October 2005. Nine patients had steroid-resistant UC and 9 patients were steroid-dependent. We started patients initially on tacrolimus 0.2 mg/kg divided twice daily, with a goal plasma trough level of 10 to 15 ng/mL for the first 2 weeks, and then titrated doses to achieve plasma levels between 7 and 12 ng/mL after induction. RESULTS: Of the 18 patients in this study, 17 showed a positive response to tacrolimus therapy (ie, cessation of diarrhea and other symptoms) and 5 showed a prolonged response to tacrolimus. The mean time from initiation of tacrolimus therapy until response was 8.5 days. The mean duration of response was 260 days. Eleven of 18 patients required colectomy, including all of the patients with steroid-resistant UC, but only 2 of 9 who were steroid-dependent. The mean time from initiation of tacrolimus until colectomy was 392 days. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that tacrolimus may benefit selected patients with steroid-dependent UC, including those who are intolerant of 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine. Conversely, patients with steroid-resistant UC are unlikely to sustain a prolonged clinical response to tacrolimus and seem to require colectomy eventually. Careful considerations of risk versus benefit, as well as close monitoring for adverse effects, are essential in all patients.},
