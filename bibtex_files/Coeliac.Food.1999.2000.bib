   abstract = {Quality of life is receiving increasing attention as a criterion for the assessment of treatment, not least for surgery, in pancreatic cancer. In exocrine pancreatic cancer there are three main symptoms that must be dealt with: pain, loss of weight and jaundice. All of them seriously impair quality of life, but most often pain is the most feared by the patients. Despite this, the intensity and the quality of the pain is all too often only scantly described. In 85 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer we have prospectively registered the quality and quantity of their pain and correlated it to tumor and patient characteristics. It was found that about one fourth of the patients were totally pain free and half of all suffered a pain described by two or less on a Visual Analogue Scale. Only one in ten had severe pain. Although more and more patients were treated with morphine, it was still about one third of all patients that had no or only little pain in the last part of their life. Pain had a strong correlation to survival. This may be due to secondary effects like depressing the mood of the patient and reducing the food intake, but is probably more often a reflection of that generalized cancer induces more pain. Analgesic drugs are the cornerstone of the pharmacologic management of pain due to pancreatic cancer. A significant part of the patients do well with only paracetamol and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Combining these agents with narcotic analgesics can enhance pain control while lessening the dose of narcotics. A wide range of narcotics are available as well as different modes for delivery: regular pills, slow release forms, injections, subcutaneous injections, epidural etc. Each patient's pain management should be individualized, based on the intensity of pain, the type of pain and the side effects. It is essential not only to describe the medication, but also to follow-up the development of the pain and the patient's total experience of the situation. As an alternative to narcotics, plexus celiac blocks have been used with somewhat different result; in the hands of the experts the percutaneous approach is usually sufficient, but in the hands of other also poor results are reported. During the last years thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy has been tried as a complement giving long-standing pain relief with little or no side effects in the majority of patients. With this approach the sympathetic fibers lead by the symphathetic chain and further by the nervus splanchnicus major, minor and minors are divided. The denervation is easily done and can be performed bilateraly in one seance. This method will probably be used more often as the technique is now well described.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although clinical manifestations of celiac disease may change throughout life, clinical, histologic, immunologic, and genetic studies show that there are incomplete forms of this condition, making it difficult to define the disease at a given moment. Because there is no information published in the Latin American-Amerindian population, this study was conducted to assess relations between these parameters in Chileans with celiac disease and their first-degree relatives. METHODS: Sixty-two persons with confirmed celiac disease (mean age, 17.9 +/- 5.1 years; 78.3% females) and 126 relatives (mean age, 27.9 +/- 17.2 years; 65.1% females) were evaluated. Clinical manifestations, antiendomysial antibodies (EMAs), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes were studied in patients. Additionally, jejunal biopsy specimens were assessed (light microscopy) in EMA-positive (EMA+) relatives. RESULTS: Of the patients, 24.1% adhered to a strict gluten-free diet; 26% were oligosymptomatic, and none were malnourished; 45% were EMA+; 13.8% who ingested gluten were EMA-negative (EMA-); one patient consuming a strict gluten-free diet was EMA+. The DQA1*0501 allele was present in the highest frequency (48%, P < 0.0005), whereas combinations of DQ8 were predominant. Of the relatives, 4.8% were EMA+; they had a significantly higher frequency of diarrhea, weight loss, and anorexia (P < 0.03); and all had abnormal histology in biopsy specimens. CONCLUSIONS: After childhood, celiac disease is oligosymptomatic and is often unrecognized by patients. Disease in 13.8% of patients and in 4.8% relatives appeared as incomplete forms of celiac disease. Predominance of DQ8 HLA haplotypes reflects the genetic Spanish-Mapuche heritage of this population.},

   abstract = {The great majority of patients that are intolerant of wheat gluten protein due to celiac disease (CD) are human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2(+), and the remaining few normally express HLA-DQ8. These two class II molecules are chiefly responsible for the presentation of gluten peptides to the gluten-specific T cells that are found only in the gut of CD patients but not of controls. Interestingly, tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-mediated deamidation of gliadin plays an important role in recognition of this food antigen by intestinal T cells. Here we have used recombinant antigens to demonstrate that the intestinal T cell response to alpha-gliadin in adult CD is focused on two immunodominant, DQ2-restricted peptides that overlap by a seven-residue fragment of gliadin. We show that tTG converts a glutamine residue within this fragment into glutamic acid and that this process is critical for T cell recognition. Gluten-specific T cell lines from 16 different adult patients all responded to one or both of these deamidated peptides, indicating that these epitopes are highly relevant to disease pathology. Binding studies showed that the deamidated peptides displayed an increased affinity for DQ2, a molecule known to preferentially bind peptides containing negatively charged residues. Interestingly, the modified glutamine is accommodated in different pockets of DQ2 for the different epitopes. These results suggest modifications of anchor residues that lead to an improved affinity for major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and altered conformation of the peptide-MHC complex may be a critical factor leading to T cell responses to gliadin and the oral intolerance of gluten found in CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Olestra is a nonabsorbable fat substitute that consists of fatty acids esterified to a sucrose molecule. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of olestra consumption on measurements of fecal fat excretion. DESIGN: Controlled cross-over trial. SETTING: Clinical research center and outpatient research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: 10 healthy volunteers. INTERVENTION: On days 1 to 6 of the study, participants consumed 5 oz of conventional potato chips per day; on days 7 to 12, they consumed 5 oz of potato chips containing 40 g of olestra per day. MEASUREMENTS: Quantitative measurement of fecal fat by the van de Kamer titration, van de Kamer gravimetric, and Jeejeebhoy gravimetric methods and qualitative assessment of fecal fat by Sudan III staining. RESULTS: Excellent correlation was seen among the three quantitative assays, but the van de Kamer titration method yielded lower measurements than the two gravimetric methods. When participants consumed 40 g of olestra per day, the excretion of fecal fat increased to levels observed in patients with steatorrhea caused by the malabsorption syndrome. CONCLUSION: Consumption of olestra can cause false-positive results on tests for steatorrhea and may therefore lead to an erroneous diagnosis of the malabsorption syndrome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal motor abnormalities could account for some of the dyspeptic symptoms of celiac patients. However, the data on gastric emptying time are conflicting, and the pathophysiology of motor disturbances is still unclear. Neurotensin modulates upper gastrointestinal motor activity, and its postprandial increase is a reliable index of nutrient delivery to the ileum. We therefore assessed both plasma neurotensin levels and gastric emptying in untreated celiacs. METHODS: The gastric antral area of nine untreated celiac patients and nine controls was measured with ultrasound at base line and every 30 min after a fatty meal (227 kcal, 45% fat); the base-line and postprandial neurotensin plasma levels were determined by means of radioimmunoassay. The data are mean values +/- standard deviation and were analyzed by using non-parametric tests. RESULTS: The overall and half gastric emptying time were significantly longer in the patients (203+/-32 versus 133+/-15 min, P = 0.0117, and 137+/-32 versus 78+/-11 min, P = 0.0001). The pattern of the changes in antral area was similar in both groups during the observation period as a whole but differed significantly in the first 120 min (P = 0.0343). Base-line neurotensin levels were significantly higher in the patients (41.6+/-23.9 versus 18.2+/-5.5 pg/ml, P = 0.0214) and their net postprandial increase was lower than in controls (15.0+/-15.9 versus 29.8+/-13.0 pg/ml, P = 0.046). In both groups the base-line neurotensin levels were related to the half gastric emptying time (P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: In untreated celiac patients gastric emptying time is longer than in controls and is concomitant with an increase in base-line plasma neurotensin levels.},

METHODS: Five pairs of monozygous female twins, of whom one or both were affected by gluten sensitivity (i.e., celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis), were followed-up for 11-23 yr. RESULTS: Three pairs were concordant for celiac disease: the onset was comparable and synchronous in two pairs; in the third, one member presented an overt malabsorption syndrome, and the other developed iron deficiency anemia 10 yr later. Discordance for gluten sensitivity was found in the remaining two pairs, one of whose members was diagnosed as having, respectively, celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. CONCLUSIONS: As no environmental factors were found to affect the phenotypic expression of the disease, genetic factors seem to play a major role. The presence of overt or latent celiac disease in three of the four siblings of the three concordant twins, and the association with cystic fibrosis in all three siblings of one of these families, further supports this hypothesis.},

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the nutritional status and body composition of adult celiac disease patients consuming a gluten-free diet who were in clinical, biochemical, and histologic remission. DESIGN: We studied 71 patients (51 women and 20 men; mean age: 27 y; range: 17-58 y) and 142 healthy control subjects matched by sex and age. The subjects' height, weight, body mass index, fat and lean mass, and bone mineral content (evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were measured; a 3-d dietary questionnaire was administered; and total daily energy, fat, carbohydrate, and protein intakes were calculated. RESULTS: The weight, height, and body mass index of male celiac disease patients and the weight and body mass index of female celiac disease patients were significantly lower than the corresponding measurements in control subjects. The fat and lean mass of both male and female patients was significantly different from that of control subjects; however, bone mineral content was significantly lower only in females in whom celiac disease was diagnosed in adulthood. Total energy intake was lower in the patients than in the control subjects (9686 +/- 1569 and 11297 +/- 1318 kJ/d in males and 6736 +/- 1318 and 7740 +/- 1715 kJ/d in females), and the diet of the patients was unbalanced, with a higher percentage of energy as fat and a lower percentage of energy as carbohydrates. CONCLUSIONS: Although strictly compliant with their gluten-free diet and in complete remission, patients with celiac disease showed differences in body composition and dietary intakes compared with control subjects. Strict follow-up and dietary advice in terms of the choice and composition of foods seem necessary to prevent malnutrition.},

   abstract = {There have frequently been doubts as to the relevance of food allergy, in particular as far as the involvement of the intestinal tract is concerned. Several studies, however, have confirmed the existence of allergic reactions in the gut, with an estimated prevalence of about 1-2% in adults. Clinical symptoms are unspecific and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping and diarrhea. Intestinal mast cells, as well as intestinal eosinophils, have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of food-allergy-related enteropathy. In addition to classical IgE-dependent degranulation, further agonists have been demonstrated for mast cell activation, for example IL-4. The methods used to confirm the diagnosis of intestinal allergy are still insufficient. Until now, blinded oral challenge procedures with food antigens have been accepted as the 'gold standard' in diagnosing food allergy, although these tests have practical problems. Therefore, new test systems have been developed, such as endoscopic provocation tests, that may improve diagnostic procedures. Elimination diet still presents the main basis of therapy. Aspects to be focused on in the future are the role fo IgE-independent allergic mechanisms in intestinal allergy, the impact of cross-reactivity with other allergens and the relationship to other inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome.},

DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial. SETTING: Institutionalized patients in three gastroenterological rehabilitation clinics. PARTICIPANTS: 52 institutionalized patients with a faecal fat output > or = 14 g/day, operated on for malignant gastric disease a median of 198 days (interquartile range (IQR) 47-608) previously, and free from recurrence and/or metastasis. INTERVENTIONS: Nine sachets of pancreatic enzymes per day (each containing lipase 36,000, amylase 27,000, protease 2400 FIP (Federation International Pharmaceutique)) or identical-looking placebo were given for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Abdominal symptoms, energy intake, bowel habits and fat malassimilation. RESULTS: After treatment, patients on enzyme therapy felt better overall (P = 0.006), but no improvement of a specific symptom could be identified. During the intervention, the median kilojoule intake per kilogram body weight was 9% higher in the placebo group (170.8 (IQR 146.9-202.6)) than in the enzyme-treated group (157.0 (IQR 134.8-170.4)) (P = 0.03). Enzyme treatment did not result in a significant difference between the placebo and the enzyme-treated group regarding bowel habits or fat malassimilation. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of high-dose pancreatic enzymes supplementation on symptoms and steatorrhoea after total gastrectomy is marginal and does not justify its routine use.},

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique is the most appropriate assay for performing this kind of studies. Even though anti-gliadin determination has been the test most frequently used as the first step in screening procedures, many false-positive results produced a low-specificity test. In a previous work a selective recognition of omega-gliadins, mainly by IgA antibodies, was observed. Results also indicated that omega-gliadins can be useful as antigens in serologic detection of coeliac disease. We therefore wanted to analyse the anti-gliadin antibody reactivity by using purified gliadins and to evaluate the actual performance of the anti-omega-gliadin antibody test. METHODS: A population consisting of 105 coeliac patients, 81 healthy controls, and 73 subjects in a disease control group was analysed. Anti-endomysium (EMA), both IgG and IgA anti-omega-gliadins, and anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies were determined. RESULTS: Concordant results, positive and negative, in the EMA and IgG and IgA anti-gliadin determinations were observed in 220 of 259 samples from the total population analysed. The three assays showed high efficiency, being 96.9%, 90.7%, and 91.1% for EMA and anti-omega-gliadins IgG and IgA, respectively. Anti-tTG determination was performed on 103 samples (69 controls and 34 coeliac patients), finding 4 false results (2 false positive and 2 false negative), whereas anti-omega-gliadins showed 10 false results (5 false negative and 5 false positive), 3 of which were coincident with anti-tTG determination. To compare the reactivity of anti-gliadin antibodies, alpha-, beta-, gamma- and omega-gliadins were isolated under non-denaturing conditions by acid preparative electrophoresis and cation-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and used in an indirect ELISA test. The composition of these fractions was analysed by means of capillary electrophoresis, showing no cross-contamination among them. CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of results using purified gliadins shows that omega-gliadins present a differential reactivity that has not previously been documented. Results using omega-gliadins isolated by either preparative electrophoresis or FPLC were similar. Tests using the purified omega-gliadin fraction present the best performance when anti-gliadin antibodies are evaluated.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To assess the influence of dietary restrictions on psychological development in adolescents with coeliac disease. DESIGN: Statistical analysis on coeliac patients on gluten-free diet who agreed to answer the questionnaire. SETTING: Children with coeliac disease on gluten-free diet followed by the Department of the Pediatric Division of the City Mayor Hospital, Chair of Paediatrics, Verona University. SUBJECT: 39 patients (15 male and 24 female) from 10 years old to 21 who chose to answer a questionnaire of 25 questions dealing with the psychological implications of coeliac disease and with the need of following a particular dietary regime, in the presence of a psychologist. The questionnaire was made up of 6 SIGNALLING questions, 15 EVALUATING questions, 4 FILTER questions. They also filled up an information sheet on the composition and social position of the family. RESULTS: Fathers were on average 45.5 years old, mothers 43. Only 2 parents had no educational qualifications. Father's professions were of various kinds, 22 mothers were housewives. Only 4 patients were only children, 22 had one brother or sister. 13 patients only out of 39 claimed not to have been admonished by their parents, though, showed a conflictual relationship with food. The awareness of their difference from friends was: a) lack in children 10 to 12, b) uneasiness in adolescents 13 to 17, c) maturation and consensus in older patients. A significant number of patients feel different from their friends and these patients showed a latent envy to friends on free diet. A sense of latent envy towards the condition of independence was exhibited by patients who felt different from friends. CONCLUSIONS: The acceptance of a gluten-free diet is problematic for the majority of coeliac children and adolescents, particularly for those between 12 and 17. In this group the search of an individual personality is disturbed. Difficulties connected with gluten-free diet seem to be absent in the family environment, whereas difficulties emerge significantly when relating with friends. The number of cases of our study was limited but we consider these conclusions quite significant. DESCRIPTORS: Gluten-free diet, adolescents and children, relationship with parents, relationship with friends.},

When possible, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be discontinued. If steatorrhea is documented, a low-fat diet may be helpful. In the presence of bile salt malabsorption, binding resins such as cholestyramine might be useful. Nonspecific diarrheal agents such as loperamide hydrochloride, diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine, deodorized tincture of opium, or codeine might prove effective in some patients. Antibacterial agents such as bismuth subsalicylate (8 chewable 262-mg tablets daily) have been effective in symptom control. Metronidazole and erythromycin achieve response rates of 60%. Sulfasalazine, at the usual dose of 2 to 4 g daily, used in collagenous-lymphocytic colitis, demonstrated cessation of diarrhea in 1 to 2 weeks for 50% of patients. Other 5-aminosalicylic (5-ASA) compounds are preferred for patients with a history of sulfa allergy, and those who experience adverse reactions to sulfasalazine. Adrenocorticoid medication is reserved for patients whose conventional treatment with sulfasalazine or 5-ASA has failed. Resolution of diarrhea has been documented in 80% to 90% of patients within 1 week of treatment, however, in most patients, long-term therapy is required. Surgical management is reserved for those patients with disease refractory to medical therapy. Colectomy with ileostomy resulted in clinical and histologic resolution in small case series. If there is no abatement of symptoms, rule out other etiologies of diarrhea such as thyroid dysfunction, celiac disease, or bacterial overgrowth.},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal manometry has gained wide acceptance in the approach to patients with suspected enteric neuromuscular disorders. However, performing gastrointestinal manometry in these subjects without a previous exhaustive diagnostic evaluation is unjustified. Twelve children (median age: 7.0 years; range: 8 months-13 years), with clinical and x-ray features suggesting chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, were referred to our unit for gastrointestinal manometry. The latter was performed with a perfused catheter for 5 hr in the fasting state and for 90 min after feeding. Data were compared with those recorded in eight age-matched controls. In all patients and controls, interdigestive motor complexes with propagated phases III were detected; a regular postprandial antroduodenal motor activity was also recorded. Patients and controls did not differ for fed antral and duodenal motility indexes, fed antroduodenal coordination, and length of duodenal phase III. Most of the patients showed short or prolonged bursts of nonpropagated activity in the fasting and/or fed states; in four cases fasting and/or fed sustained phasic activity was recorded. Manometric evidence of migrating motor complexes and postfeeding activity did not support the diagnosis of intestinal pseudoobstruction and suggested redirecting the diagnostic evaluation. Final diagnoses were: Munchausen syndrome-by-proxy (four cases), celiac disease (two cases), intestinal malrotation (two cases), Crohn's disease (two cases), multiple food intolerance (one case), and congenital chloride-losing diarrhea (one case). It is concluded that in children with suspected chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction manometric evidence of migrating motor complexes and fed motor activity excludes an enteric neuromuscular disorder and suggests a reassessment of the diagnostic work-up. Furthermore, if gastrointestinal manometry shows migrating motor complexes and postfeeding motor activity, qualitative abnormalities of the manometric tracings do not indicate an underlying enteric neuromuscular disorder and must not be overemphasized. Patients referred for gastrointestinal manometry should previously undergo an extensive diagnostic investigation to exclude disorders mimicking chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction.},

   abstract = {Both total subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (TVAGX) and serotonin(3) receptor blockade with tropisetron or ondansetron attenuate amino acid-imbalanced diet (Imb) anorexia. Total vagotomy is less effective than tropisetron in reducing Imb-induced anorexia and also blunts the tropisetron effect. With the use of electrocautery at the subdiaphragmatic level of the vagus, we severed the ventral and dorsal trunks as well as the hepatic, ventral gastric, dorsal gastric, celiac, and accessory celiac branches separately or in combination to determine which vagal branches or associated structures may be involved in these responses. Rats were prefed a low-protein diet. On the first experimental day, tropisetron or saline was given intraperitoneally 1 h before presentation of Imb. Cuts including the ventral branch, i.e., TVAGX, ventral vagotomy (above the hepatic branch), and hepatic + gastric vagotomies (but not hepatic branch cuts alone) caused the highest (P < 0.05) Imb intake on day 1 with or without tropisetron. The responses to tropisetron were not affected significantly. On days 2-8, groups having vagotomies that included the hepatic branch recovered faster than sham-treated animals. Because the hepatic and gastric branches together account for most of the vagal innervation to the proximal duodenum, this area may be important in the initial responses, whereas structures served by the hepatic branch alone apparently act in the later adaptation to Imb.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammation is known to be associated with enhanced nitric oxide production. A role for nitric oxide in coeliac disease has been suggested because of increased expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase in the small intestine of patients with untreated coeliac disease. DESIGN: During small bowel endoscopy in 11 control subjects, 10 patients with untreated coeliac disease and seven patients with treated coeliac disease, gas was aspirated from different parts of the upper gastrointestinal tract and immediately analysed using a chemiluminescence technique. Luminal nitric oxide concentrations were also quantified in 13 control subjects who had undergone colonoscopy. RESULTS: Jejunal luminal nitric oxide concentrations were more than 20 times higher in patients with coeliac disease than in normal control subjects (mean 755 +/- 173 ppb, range 215-1690 ppb, vs. mean 31 +/- 9 ppb, range 1-83 ppb, P < 0.001). Jejunal luminal nitric oxide levels in patients with treated coeliac disease (mean 54 +/- 18 ppb, range 3-126 ppb) did not differ from those of control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that intraluminal jejunal nitric oxide concentrations are significantly increased in patients with untreated active coeliac disease.},

Serum IgA-class anti-endomysium and IgA-class anti-gliadin antibodies were positive in 5.8% and 1.9% of relatives, respectively. HLA-DQ2 haplotype was present in 64% of relatives, and the overall rate of celiac disease diagnosed by intestinal biopsy was 5.5%.

The most frequent clinical features--diarrhea, anemia, food intolerance, and growth retardation--were not present in one third of the celiac disease relatives. We conclude that the assessment of IgA-class anti-endomysium antibodies alone seems a reasonable approach for screening celiac disease in relatives and cannot be replaced by an accurate clinical anamnesis. HLA-DQ2 haplotype may identify the population with a high genetic susceptibility to celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whereas many people with coeliac disease (CD) are asymptomatic when consuming a gluten-free diet (GFD), a proportion continues to experience symptoms. The reasons for this are unclear. METHODS: Thirty-nine adult members of The Coeliac Society of New South Wales, all of whom had persistent gastrointestinal symptoms despite adhering to a GFD, were evaluated. Dietary analysis indicated that 22 (56%) were consuming a GFD as defined by the WHO/FAO Codex Alimentarius (Codex-GFD), in which foods containing up to 0.3% of protein from gluten-containing grains can be labelled as 'gluten free'. The remaining 17 were following a no detectable gluten diet (NDG)-GFD, as defined by Food Standards Australia. All subjects were required to follow a NDG-GFD during the study. Those in whom symptoms persisted after changing from a Codex-GFD and those who entered the study already on a NDG-GFD began an elimination diet followed by open and double-blind challenges to identify specific non-gluten food or food chemical intolerances. RESULTS: Of 22 patients who switched to a NDG-GFD symptoms resolved in 5 (23%) and were reduced in 10 others (45%). Thirty-one subjects commenced the elimination diet. Symptomatic improvement was experienced in 24 (77%). Subsequent food or food chemical challenges resulted in a mean of five positive challenges per individual. Diarrhoea was the most commonly provoked symptom, followed by headache, nausea, and flatulence. Symptoms were especially provoked by amine, salicylate and soy. CONCLUSION: The consumption of trace amounts of gluten, traditionally allowed in a Codex-GFD, may be responsible for the continuing symptoms seen in some patients with CD. Further investigation for non-gluten food intolerances should follow if symptoms persist after adherence to a NDG-GFD.},

The possible influence of somatostatin, which inhibits gallbladder motility, however, has never been evaluated. In this study gallbladder emptying and cholecystokinin and somatostatin plasma levels were evaluated in response to a fatty meal in patients with celiac disease at diagnosis and after long-term gluten-free diet and in controls. METHODS: Gallbladder volume and plasma levels of cholecystokinin and somatostatin were measured by ultrasonography and radioimmunoassay, respectively, at 0 time and 30, 60, 75, and 90 min after an oral fatty meal (227 kcal, 45% fat) in 10 celiac patients at diagnosis and after 18 months of successful gluten-free diet and in 10 healthy subjects. The pattern of gallbladder emptying was evaluated by mixed factorial analysis of variance and the curve fitting by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients at diagnosis had significantly greater fasting gallbladder volume and higher somatostatin plasma levels than controls (25.7 +/- SD 9.7 ml vs 16.8 +/- 7.0 ml, p = 0.021 and 9.3 +/- 4.6 vs 4.8 +/- 3.4 pmol/L, p = 0.023, respectively), significantly lower fatty meal-induced gallbladder ejection fraction (55 +/- 11.2% vs 76 +/- 7.2%, p = 0.005), and cholecystokinin peak and smaller area under the cholecystokinin secretion curve (3.1 +/- 2.3 pmol/L vs 10.5 +/- 6.9 pmol/L, p = 0.028 and 157 +/- 142 pmol/L/90 min vs 453 +/- 229 pmol/L/90 min, p = 0.028, respectively). The two groups had a similar emptying pattern (p = 0.8913) expressed by a significant quadratic term of the emptying function (p = 0.0001). The mean overall emptying volume was significantly greater in patients than in controls (p = 0.0007). Gluten-free diet normalized these findings. CONCLUSIONS: In patients at diagnosis, elevated somatostatin levels were associated with increased gallbladder fasting volume, whereas decreased cholecystokinin secretion was responsible for the reduced gallbladder emptying. Gluten-free diet reversed these abnormalities.},

   abstract = {Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a blistering skin disease characterized by cutaneous deposits of IgA and an associated, most often asymptomatic, gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE). Gluten sensitive enteropathy is also seen in patients that do not have skin disease or cutaneous IgA deposits, but do have significant gastrointestinal (GI) complaints. Patients with DH and with GSE without skin disease have similar small bowel morphologic changes and HLA associations and both the skin disease and the GI symptoms can be controlled by a gluten free diet. It is not known what factors allow almost all patients with DH to continue to eat gluten and not develop symptomatic gastrointestinal disease. We have examined the expression of the Vbeta T-cell receptor (TCR) in the small bowel of patients with DH (n=11) and of patients with both symptomatic (n=10) and asymptomatic (n=7) GSE without skin disease to determine if differences in the pattern of TCR Vbeta expression are associated with differences in the clinical manifestations of these diseases. TCR Vbeta expression was analyzed using RT-PCR from small bowel biopsies. Patients with DH and those with GSE without skin disease that were on a gluten free diet and asymptomatic were found to express 6.6 and 5.6 out of 20 Vbeta families respectively, with no single family preference. Examination of peripheral blood lymphocytes from these patients did not reveal any restriction of TCR Vbeta family expression. In contrast, patients with symptomatic GSE expressed 12.6 Vbeta families (P< 0.05), with no consistent preferential expression of any single Vbeta family between patients. Patients with DH, who are continuing to ingest wheat, show a more restricted pattern of TCR Vbeta utilization, similar to that of treated patients with GSE without skin disease, and significantly different from GSE without skin disease patients eating gluten. These findings suggest that the restricted nature of the TCR Vbeta expression may play a role in the different clinical manifestations of dermatitis herpetiformis and isolated gluten sensitive enteropathy.},

The article consists in a review of published reports, and an account of our experience of including oats in the gluten-free diets of adults. Oats were found to be safe and well tolerated by adults with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis, though the risk of wheat contamination of commercial oat products remains a cause of concern. Similar findings were reported from a study of adolescents, but no such studies have been made of small children. Thus, the inclusion of oats, known to be a fibre-rich, naturally gluten-free food, would broaden the range of foodstuffs tolerable to coeliac patients, though for safety reasons they should be used only by adults until more information is available.},

There is also good evidence for enhanced protection for years after the termination of breastfeeding against Haemophilus influenzae type b infections, otitis media, diarrhoea, respiratory tract infections and wheezing bronchitis. In some reports breastfeeding has also improved vaccine responses. Several studies show that milk may actively stimulate the immune system of the offspring via transfer of anti-idiotypic antibodies and lymphocytes. This may explain why breastfeeding diminishes the risk of developing coeliac disease. Some investigations suggest that there may also be a similar effect on allergic diseases and autoimmune diseases, as well as inflammatory bowel diseases and certain tumours. This needs to be confirmed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An association between Down syndrome and celiac disease has been reported. This study was conducted to determine the association between childhood celiac disease and Down syndrome in the county of Uppsala, Sweden. METHODS: All 76 children with Down syndrome (1-18 years) were screened for the occurrence of anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) and anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA). Twelve children with suspected celiac disease were investigated further. RESULTS: Increased levels of both IgA and IgG AGA were found in 26% of the children and of EMA in and 5 of 76. Celiac disease was diagnosed in at least three of the children (3.9%; 95% confidence interval 0%-8.3%), and it could have been present in as many as eight. Three of the five EMA-positive children with suspected celiac disease had the HLA phenotype DR3, DQ2. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that determination of EMA is more useful as a screening test for celiac disease and for follow-up than is AGA in children with Down syndrome. The present study also confirms that celiac disease is overrepresented among Swedish children with Down syndrome and that celiac disease should be considered in all persons with Down syndrome.},

   abstract = {The hypothesis that early exposure of the infant to cow's milk (or lack of breast-feeding) predisposes the child to type 1 diabetes dates from the 1980s. It has important implications, but remains controversial because the evidence on which it is based has been indirect and is open to criticism. Two meta-analyses of multiple studies in which diabetes prevalence was associated retrospectively with infant feeding revealed only a marginal increase in relative risk. Two recent prospective studies found no apparent association between development of antibodies to islet antigens and feeding patterns in high-risk infants with a first-degree type 1 diabetic relative. Studies reporting increased humoral and cellular immunity to cow's milk proteins in children with type 1 diabetes often lack appropriate controls and standardization and do not, in themselves, establish a causal connection to disease pathogenesis. A review of published data leads to the conclusion that increased immunity to cow's milk proteins is not disease-specific, but reflects genetic predisposition to increased immunity to dietary proteins in general, associated with the HLA haplotype A1-B8-DR3-DQ2 (A1*0501, B1*0201), which also predisposes to celiac disease and selective IgA deficiency. We suggest that the cow's milk hypothesis could be productively reframed around mucosal immune function in type 1 diabetes. Breast milk contains growth factors, cytokines, and other immunomodulatory agents that promote functional maturation of intestinal mucosal tissues. In the NOD mouse model, environmental cleanliness may influence diabetes incidence through mucosal mechanisms, and exposure of the mucosa to insulin (present in breast milk) induces regulatory T-cells and decreases diabetes incidence. The mucosa is a major immunoregulatory barrier, and cow's milk happens to be the first dietary protein it encounters. The basic question is whether impaired mucosal immune function predisposes to type 1 diabetes.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are caused by the alcohol soluble fractions of wheat, barley, and rye. Reliable serological tests are available for both mass and risk group screening and recent epidemiological studies on celiac disease suggest that the prevalence varies between 1:100-300 in different continents. The clinical manifestations of the disease has changed in the West and the classical symptomatic cases represent only approximately 1/7th of all diagnosed cases. Symptoms such as, anemia, short stature, dental enamel defect or osteoporosis can be the only manifestations of the atypical disease. There is an increased prevalence of celiac disease in patients with autoimmune diseases. Recent data suggest that there is a correlation between the prevalence of autoimmune diseases and the number of years that an individual consumes gluten-containing foods. Genetic studies revealed a high prevalence of certain HLA antigens in celiac patients, however, there is likelihood that non-HIA genes are also important in the pathomechanism. An interesting new development is the recognition of tissue transglutaminase (tTG), an enzyme that probably forms an autoantigen with gluten. It is generally accepted that antibodies to tTG are identical to the previously described antiendomysium antibodies. Whether or not tTG is responsible for the initiation of an immunoreaction against prolamines or just exacerbates the immune response is a subject of further investigations.},

Our aim was to determine the prevalence of latent coeliac disease in apparently healthy (i.e. asymptomatic) Norwegian individuals. METHODS: Blood donor sera were tested for gluten antibodies (IgA, IgG). Positive samples (IgA AGA > 0.35, IgG AGA > 0.90) were further tested for endomysium antibodies (IgA EMA). EMA positive individuals were offered gastroenterological investigation. RESULTS: Of 2096 sera, 83 fulfilled the criteria for EMA testing (M/F = 55/28). Eight individuals were EMA positive. On biopsy, seven out of eight had villous atrophy (six subtotal, one partial). None of the patients had significant symptoms. Biochemical data showed iron deficiency (two), hypocalcaemia (one), and low serum zinc (five). All patients were treated with a gluten-free diet and followed up. CONCLUSION: The study indicates a prevalence of 1:340 among asymptomatic and presumably healthy people. This is in keeping with studies from other countries. Lack of symptoms does not exclude secondary deficiency conditions.},

SETTING: Teaching hospital, Japan. SUBJECTS: 142 patients who had dissection along the left gastric and common hepatic arteries and dissection of the perigastric nodes during curative distal gastrectomy without splenectomy or pancreatectomy between 1990 and 1994. 79 who had no dissection around the coeliac artery were compared with 63 who had. INTERVENTIONS: Questionnaires sent out in February 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Short term and long term morbidity. RESULTS: The patients who had had coeliac dissection were significantly more likely to prefer digestible and light food (p = 0.006); and were significantly more likely to complain of diarrhoea (p = 0.001), abdominal pain (p = 0.02), and late dumping (p = 0.03) than those who did not. Patients who had had coeliac dissection tended to eat more digestible foods in smaller volumes/meal during the early postoperative years, and had more abdominal pain, fullness, and oesophageal reflux during the later years. CONCLUSION: Limiting coeliac dissection during curative distal gastrectomy can improve the patients' physical condition postoperatively.},

There is usually a 30 to 40-min delay between the stimulus and the pain and, after exclusion of other causes of pain, an ERCP is performed. A minority of patients will have pancreatic function tests carried out while increasingly the diagnosis is being made by MR scanning. The control of pain is often the most important aspect of management to the patient. In those with large ducts due to compression of focal areas of the duct system surgical by-pass therapy is indicated. There is a bigger problem in patients with small ducts and chronic pancreatitis in whom extensive resection may be inappropriate. Our experience with minimally invasive thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy has been encouraging over the last three years. Having previously tried both percutaneous coeliac ganglion block and surgical excision of this nerve tissue, it is a great deal easier to carry out this procedure which usually takes only 15-20 min per side. Patients are usually only admitted for 48 h and the immediate beneficial effect usually results in opiate analgesia being discontinued with considerable improvement in the quality of life. While there is a slight drop-off in benefit between 6 and 12 months post-operatively, the clinical effectiveness of this approach is to be commended and the author's experience will be presented to support this view.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease, or permanent gluten sensitive enteropathy, has emerged as a widespread health problem. It is considered an immunological disease, possibly of autoimmune type, albeit strictly dependent on the presence in the diet of wheat gluten and similar proteins from rye and barley. There are reasons to believe that the aetiology of coeliac disease is multifactorial, i.e. that other environmental exposures than the mere presence in the diet of gluten affect the disease process. Our studies have shown that prolonged breast-feeding, or perhaps even more important, ongoing breast-feeding during the period when gluten-containing foods are introduced into the diet, reduce the risk for coeliac disease. The amount of gluten consumed is also of importance in as much as larger amounts of gluten-containing foods increase the risk for coeliac disease, while it still is uncertain if the age for introducing gluten into the diet of infants is important. Thus, a challenging possibility, that need to be further explored, is if the coeliac enteropathy can be postponed, or possibly even prevented for the entire life span, by favourable dietary habits early in life.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether gluten challenge with soda bread in subjects with transiently positive IgA-AGA could induce a significant titre of IgA-AGA. DESIGN: Food challenge study. METHODS: All subjects with positive IgA-AGA on screening at the time of the MONICA project in 1991 (T0) who developed negative serology at 3-year follow-up (T1) were invited to participate in a 'soda bread challenge' (1 loaf per day) for 1 month. Analysis of food intake was carried out prior to the challenge (T2) and compared to the analysis at the time of screening (T0). IgA-AGA and IgA antiendomysial antibodies (EMA) were checked pre- (T2) and post-challenge (T3). RESULTS: Ten subjects agreed to participate. Quantities of food ingested for the various categories did not differ significantly from T0 to T2. IgA-AGA titres did not differ significantly from T1 to T2 (20.2 versus 35.0, P=0.085). Mean IgA-AGA titres rose significantly between T2 and T3 (35.0 versus 40.3, P=0.005), although none of the subjects developed a significant titre of IgA-AGA. None of the subjects were positive for IgA-EMA. CONCLUSIONS: Intake of soda bread does not appear to be an important explanation as to why subjects may have a transient rise in IgA-AGA titre since none of the subjects developed a significant titre of IgA-AGA.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In children with celiac disease (CD) bone metabolism and mineralization are frequently disturbed. The present study aimed to assess the influence of gluten free diet (GFD) on bone mineral density (BMD) in 73 children with CD, mean age of 12.4 +/- 0.4 years and mean body mass index (BMI) 17.9 +/- 0.4 kg/m2 (mean +/- SEM). Diagnosis of CD was established according to ESPEGAN criteria. Compliance to the GFD was verified on the basis of interview and by estimation of antiendomysial antibodies (IgAEmA/IgGEmA) in blood serum. BMD was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Plasma calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) concentrations, alkaline phosphatase (AP) and its bone fraction (BAP) were estimated before BMD measurement. All children were divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 33 children where gluten free diet was strictly respected for 11.7 +/- 0.6 years. The second group (Group B) comprised 40 children without strictly respected GFD. Children who strictly followed GFD showed statistically higher BMI, AP-spine BMD and total body BMD in comparison with children without GFD (BMI 19 +/- 0.52 kg/m2 vs 17.3 +/- 0.4 kg/m2; p < 0.01, AP-spine BMD 0.951 +/- 0.04 g/cm2 vs 0.767 + 0.03 g/cm2; p < 0.005, Total Body BMD 1.013 +/- 0.02 g/cm2 vs 0.933 +/- 0.01 g/cm2; p < 0.05) respectively. No significant differences were found in plasma Ca, P, AP, BAP between both groups. A statistically significant positive correlation (p < 0.001) was found between duration of GFD and AP-spine BMD and total body BMD, respectively. A statistically significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) was also found between duration of GFD and BMI. CONCLUSION: Long-term GFD significantly improves BMD and BMI in children with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated whether wheat starch-based gluten-free products are safe in the treatment of gluten intolerance. METHODS: The study involved 41 children and adults with coeliac disease and 11 adults with dermatitis herpetiformis adhering to a gluten-free diet for 8 years on average. Thirty-five newly diagnosed coeliac patients at diagnosis and 6 to 24 months after the start of a gluten-free diet and 27 non-coeliac patients with dyspepsia were investigated for comparison. Daily dietary gluten and wheat starch intake were calculated. Small-bowel mucosal villous architecture, CD3+, alphabeta+, and gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes, mucosal HLA-DR expression, and serum endomysial, reticulin, and gliadin antibodies were investigated. RESULTS: Forty of 52 long-term-treated patients adhered to a strict wheat starch-based diet and 6 to a strict naturally gluten-free diet; 6 patients had dietary lapses. In the 46 patients on a strict diet the villous architecture, enterocyte height, and density of alphabeta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes were similar to those in non-coeliac subjects and better than in short-term-treated coeliac patients. The density of gammadelta(+)cells was higher, but they seemed to decrease over time with the gluten-free diet. Wheat starch-based gluten-free flour products did not cause aberrant upregulation of mucosal HLA-DR. The mucosal integrity was not dependent on the daily intake of wheat starch in all patients on a strict diet, whereas two of the six patients with dietary lapses had villous atrophy and positive serology. CONCLUSION: Wheat starch-based gluten-free flour products were not harmful in the treatment of coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abdominal complaints after ingestion of cereals are not uncommon. We assessed how reliable such a history is as a marker for the presence of overt coeliac disease, and whether we should also take into account latent coeliac disease and cereal allergy. METHODS: The study group comprised 93 consecutive adults from health centres spontaneously reporting abdominal symptoms after consumption of cereals. Small bowel mucosal morphology, CD3+, alphabeta+ and gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), HLA DQ alleles and serum IgA-class endomysial (EmA), tissue transglutaminase (tTg) and gliadin (AGA) antibodies were determined. Skin prick and patch tests and serum radioallergosorbent tests for cereals were carried out. Thirty non-coeliac adults served as biopsy controls. RESULTS: Eight (9%) patients had coeliac disease and one mild partial villous atrophy. Altogether 17 had an increased density of gamma delta+ IELs without atrophy. However, only seven (8%) showed evidence of latent coeliac disease, i.e. both an increase in gammadelta+ IELs and the presence of coeliac disease-type HLA. One or more of the allergy tests for cereals was positive in 19; 9 adopted a gluten-free diet and abdominal symptoms were alleviated in all. In non-coeliac patients, serum EmA and tTg tests were negative in all, whereas AGA was seen in 40%. CONCLUSIONS: Intolerance to cereals is not a specific sign of overt or latent coeliac disease. All experimental dietary interventions before proper diagnosis of coeliac disease are therefore to be discouraged. Allergy to cereals, on the other hand, should be considered even in adults.},

This study was designed to assess the significance of LNH and other mucosal lesions of the foregut in diagnosing food allergy and distinguishing it from other clinical pathological states. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a one-year period, 136 diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopies were conducted in children, 34 of whom had been diagnosed as having food allergy using an oral challenge test. The endoscopic findings were analyzed in the final diagnostic groups. RESULTS: LNH of the duodenal bulb with a normal villous pattern was the main endoscopic finding in 22 of the 34 children with food allergy (65 %). On the other hand, it was seen in none of the 18 patients with celiac disease, who had an atrophic duodenal mucosa. All 11 patients with Helicobacter pylori infection had lymphonodular gastritis, but no LNH beyond the pylorus. Esophagitis (six patients) and gastritis (eight patients) were also common endoscopic findings associated with food allergy. CONCLUSION: LNH in the duodenal bulb was associated mainly with food allergy in children. An endoscopic examination can be used as a new method of assessing gastrointestinal food allergy and differentiating it from celiac disease and other distinct types of gastrointestinal pathology.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated whether children with food allergy (FA) express increased densities of intraepithelial gammadelta+ T cells similarly to subjects with celiac disease. METHODS: The duodenal specimens taken by gastroduodenoscopy from 20 children with untreated FA, 17 with treated FA, 12 with celiac disease (CD) and 12 controls were studied with monoclonal antibodies and a three-layer peroxidase staining method. RESULTS: The subjects with untreated FA expressed equal densities of total intraepithelial CD3+ and alpha/beta+ T cells, but significantly higher densities of gammadelta+ cells than the subjects currently on an elimination diet for FA or the controls. Accordingly, their gammadelta+/CD3+ ratio was higher. On the other hand, the results differed clearly from CD, where all the three cell populations showed high densities. Another finding that discriminated the subjects with FA from the CD patients was endoscopic examination. Lymphonodular hyperplasia (LNH) of the duodenal bulb with a normal villous pattern was demonstrated in 14 (70%) of the 20 subjects with untreated FA and in 8 (47%) of the 17 with treated FA, but in none of the celiac patients or controls. Surprisingly, the biopsy samples from the subjects with FA showed quite normal histological findings. CONCLUSIONS: According to this preliminary observation, high densities of intraepithelial gammadelta+ T cells and a significantly elevated gammadelta+/CD3+ ratio are associated with untreated FA. If seen LNH in a gastroduodenoscopy and/or increased densities of gammadelta+ T cells in the biopsy specimen, the possibility of gastrointestinal FA should be reliably assessed by a food challenge.},

Animals of both groups were intragastrically given either gliadin or albumin (control animals) or gliadin from birth till day 55. When compared to the controls, spleen lymphocytes from both groups of gliadin-treated rats cultivated in vitro exhibited a significant increase of spontaneous 3H-thymidine incorporation. Moreover, the proliferation of spleen and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) lymhocytes from both groups of gliadin-treated suckling and hand-fed rats was specifically increased by the in vitro gliadin challenge. Spleen B cells from gliadin-treated rats spontaneously produced higher amounts of gliadin-specific antibodies than those from the controls, however, in vitro stimulation by gliadin caused no further increase in antibody production. Apoptotic DNA fragmentation in MLN cells was higher in gliadin-treated rats than in albumin-treated ones, independently of the milk diet during the suckling period.},

To further investigate the site of action of Ent, we compared the feeding responses to Ent injected intra-arterially near the celiac artery, into the carotid artery, or intravenously in rats adapted to a high-fat diet. After near-celiac arterial injection there was an immediate dose-dependent (0.05-13.5 nmol) inhibition of food intake occurring within 5 min in overnight-fasted rats that lasted up to 20 min. Carotid arterial Ent had a similar, immediate dose-related response, and the inhibitory effect was long lasting. The response to intravenous Ent was only evident at the highest dose (13.5 nmol) and was delayed for at least 120 min. Pretreatment with capsaicin, which causes degeneration of vagal sensory neurons, abolished the inhibitory responses to near-celiac Ent but not to intravenous or intracarotid Ent. These results provide further evidence for both a gastrointestinal site of action for peripheral Ent and a central site of action for intracarotid Ent and suggest that the delayed response to intravenous Ent may reflect either binding or slow uptake of this peptide into the central nervous system.},

The aim here was to establish whether such a diet sustains abdominal symptoms. METHODS: The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) was applied to 58 coeliac disease patients on gluten-free diets and 110 non-coeliac controls. An estimate was made of daily dietary fibre and wheat starch-derived gluten. Psychological well-being was evaluated by a structured interview. Twenty-three coeliac patients consented to small-bowel biopsy. RESULTS: The mean GSRS score in coeliac disease patients did not differ from that in control subjects. Poorer psychological well-being was associated with abdominal symptoms in coeliac patients, whereas the daily amount of wheat starch had no effect on GSRS score. Overall dietary compliance was good, and villous atrophy was found in only 2 out of 23 patients. The average fibre consumption, 13 g per day, was lower than recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Wheat starch-based gluten-free products are well-tolerated in coeliac disease patients, provided that their diets are otherwise strict.},

   abstract = {In this review, I hope to have highlighted that cytokines are of crucial importance in the normal homeostasis of the gut immune system, the interactions of the gut immune system with enteric antigens and also in tissue injury associated with IBD. There is evidence from a number of different systems that the response to nominal non-replicating antigens, administered nasally or orally, is skewed towards a non-Th1 type of response. To say that the response is Th2, Th3 or Tr is premature. IL-10 and TGF beta seem to be important in downregulating potentially tissue-damaging Th1 responses to the normal flora and possibly food antigens. However, it need to be seen whether the mouse results also apply to humans. A consistent pattern in disease states, whether it be human or mouse, is an exaggerated Th1 type response with excess local production of IFN-gamma and TNF alpha, and its association with tissue injury. An important question to address is whether this represents a switch from the Th2, Th3, or Tr pathway towards a Th1 pathway, or whether the Th1 pathway is in fact always present in the gut, but is kept in check and non-pathogenic by regulatory cells. Equally important is the need to discover where regulation occurs: is it in the PP or the lamina propria? Intriguing results from Kronenberg and colleagues have shown that SCID mice reconstituted with CD45RBhi or CD45RBlo cells show no difference in the re-population of the gut prior to disease (ARANDA et al. 1997). The reason for colitis developing in those mice reconstituted with CD45RBhi cells is therefore more complex than merely differential re-population kinetics. No matter what the outcome is, these and other related questions dealing with the induction and expression of mucosal T-cell responses are going to produce some surprises in the next few years.},

   abstract = {Based on analysis by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry, we have developed a new method for fast and sensitive fingerprinting of gliadins and glutenins in wheat flour. Using this procedure the two protein fractions from seven durum wheat varieties have been analysed by high resolution high performance liquid chromatographic separation coupled to accurate determination of molecular mass. In this way, the molecular mass of the single components from both gliadin and glutenin fractions were measured and more than forty components were detected for each fraction indicating a high heterogeneity. Although the chromatographic profiles were similar, the molecular masses of protein components with similar retention times among the varieties were often different. The difference ranged from a few mass units corresponding to single amino acid substitution(s) up to thousands implying peptide deletion or insertion along the protein chain. Two components representing about a half of the gliadin fraction, e.g. gamma(2)- and gamma(3)-gliadin, were identified through the N-terminal sequence and molecular mass determination. We suggest the use of the high level and the molecular mass of these gliadin components as markers to detect traces of wheat in gluten-free food preparations for celiac patients.},

The Coeliac Society currently has more than 36,000 members. Essentially, coeliac disease is a complication of the gastrointestinal tract. Coeliac patients must avoid gluten in food products in order to avoid debilitating symptoms which include diarrhoea and iron deficiency. This article looks at the patients who are likely to be 'at-risk' of having coeliac disease and how they should be treated via adherence to a permanent gluten-free diet. The article focuses on osteoporosis, a common long-term condition associated with coeliac disease, and the risks coeliac patients face. The aim of this article is to provide background information on coeliac disease and its treatment, related conditions, and supporting patient and professional organizations.},

Isolated intestinal trehalase deficiency is found in 8% of Greenlanders, but is rare elsewhere. The normal range of trehalase activity and the incidence of isolated trehalase deficiency in the UK have not been reported. Patients (n 400) were investigated for suspected malabsorption. Endoscopic distal duodenal biopsies were taken for histological assessment and maltase, sucrase, lactase and trehalase estimation. Disaccharidase activities were determined by Dahlqvist's technique (Dahlqvist, 1968). Most patients (n 369) had normal duodenal histology. In these, square root transformation of trehalase activity produced a normal distribution. The normal range (mean +/- 2 SD) was 4.79-37.12 U/g protein. One patient had an isolated borderline trehalase deficiency. The thirty-one patients with villous atrophy had significantly reduced disaccharidase activities. With ingestion of a gluten-free diet, maltase, sucrase and trehalase activities recovered to normal in most patients, whereas lactase activity did not. The normal range and very low incidence of isolated enzyme deficiency is comparable with that described in populations from the USA and mainland Europe. Activity is significantly reduced in untreated coeliac disease and recovers with treatment with a gluten-free diet. There is no place for routine determination of trehalase activity in the UK population and there should be no concern over the introduction of trehalose-containing dried foods.},

Failure to take this into account creates difficulties when attempting to compare data on pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in different countries. The authors examined the incidence and grade of steatorrhea in Japanese chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients whose daily fat intake was <40 g (25 patients) or > or =40 g (35 patients). In addition, 23 CP patients with steatorrhea and daily fecal fat excretion > or =5 g were given a pancreatic enzyme preparation at a dose 3-8 times higher than the usual dose to investigate its effect on fecal fat excretion. Among CP patients whose fat intake was <40 g, the incidence of fecal fat excretion <5 g was 56% and that of fecal fat excretion > or =10 g (severe steatorrhea) was 8%. In CP patients whose fat intake was > or =40 g, the incidences were 27.9 and 34.9%, respectively; a significant increase in the number of affected patients was noted when fat intake was > or =40 g. The fat absorption rate was 76.2% among patients whose fat intake was <40 g and 77.8% among patients whose fat intake was > or =40 g, revealing no significant difference between the two groups. The proportion of CP patients whose fat absorption rate < or =80% was 32% at a fat intake <40 g and 39% at a fat intake > or =40 g, revealing no significant difference between the two groups.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and potential pathogenetic factors of hypertransaminasaemia in patients with coeliac disease prior to initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) and to assess the course of transaminases on a GFD. PATIENTS: A retrospective study was made of 178 patients with coeliac disease (130 women, 48 men; median age 36 years; range 17-84 years) at the gastroenterological department of a university hospital. METHODS: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured prior to initiation of a GFD and at 3, 6 and 12 months of GFD. Intestinal permeability, a test for functional integrity of the small bowel, was investigated before starting a GFD in 116 patients by an oral test using lactulose and mannitol. RESULTS: In 72 patients (40.4%) AST and/or ALT were increased prior to initiation of a GFD. Within 1 year on a GFD ALT and AST normalized except in eight cases (4.6%). The intestinal permeability index (% lactulose/% mannitol in 5 h urine) was higher in patients with elevated (median 0.34; range 0.03-1.43) than in patients with normal transaminases (0.11; 0.02-1.28) (P < 0.0001) and correlated with AST (tau = 0.34; P < 0.0001) and ALT (tau = 0.32; P < 0.0001). In five cases with hypertransaminasaemia a liver biopsy was performed prior to initiation of a GFD. Two patients had mild to moderate hepatitis with septal fibrosis. The other three had minimal lymphocytic infiltrates of the portal tracts. Inflammatory alterations of the bile ducts were not found. CONCLUSION: Hypertransaminasaemia before GFD is frequent in coeliac patients, correlates with intestinal permeability and normalizes on a GFD in most patients. In cases of persistently elevated liver function tests of unknown origin underlying coeliac disease should be considered.},

We report the details of the operative technique and the outcome. METHODS: PPG with lymph node dissection was performed, preserving the hepatic, pyloric, and celiac branches of vagal nerve. The jejunum was cut approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. Marginal vessels were not divided in order to preserve the nerves in the jejunum that were used to construct the pouch. A linear stapler was used to perform a side-to-side jejunojejunostomy. A 12-cm-long pouch was formed by firing the stapler twice. The pouch was interposed between the residual parts of the stomach. Postoperatively, the patients were interviewed periodically. A dual-phase, dual-isotope radionucleid pouch-emptying study was performed 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 13 patients underwent the operation. No complication developed. During the first 6 months after surgery, the body weight of the patients was maintained at 91% of the preoperative level. The radioisotope retention rate for the combined pouch and residual stomach was 46% for liquid food and 76% for solid food 120 min after ingestion. The pattern of its emptying was similar to that in healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The pouch-emptying test demonstrated a satisfactory retention capacity and acceptable emptying for the gastric substitute. A reasonably good quality of life has been obtained for patients undergoing PPG with interposition of a nerve-preserving jejunal pouch.},

The aim of this study was to assess the concentrations of AGA-IgA in breast milk during lactation, and whether these concentrations vary with the socioeconomic status of the women. Samples of serum for determination of IgA albumin and AGA-IgA, and samples of breast-milk for AGA-IgA were collected from 105 healthy mothers (aged 17 - 36 years). Women were divided into two groups: group 1 were of low and group 2 were of high socioeconomic status. No differences were observed between the study parameters in the two groups. Serum AGA-IgA in both groups was, however, significantly lower than that in colostrum. AGA-IgA concentrations in both groups gradually decreased during 45 days of lactation; the difference between colostrum and the samples taken at days 10 and 30 - 45 of lactation was significant. The encouragement of sufficient and long-term (e.g. 4 - 6 months) breast-feeding seems likely to be beneficial in preventing coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis is a severe form of allergy; the reaction is caused by ingestion of a specific food before exercise. This disorder often escapes diagnosis because neither the ingested food nor the exercise alone induces the symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to characterize the allergens involved in wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis and to describe the clinical outcome in a series of 18 adult patients. METHODS: All 18 patients had experienced recurrent episodes of generalized urticaria during exercise, 17 patients in association with collapse and 15 patients with an anaphylactic reaction. The symptoms appeared only when the patients had eaten food containing wheat before exercise. Wheat allergens were detected by immunoblotting, purified by gel filtration and reversed-phase chromatography, and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The IgE-binding ability of the purified proteins was studied by ELISA, and their in vivo reactivity was studied by skin prick testing. RESULTS: IgE antibodies from pooled patient sera were bound to 65-kd and 40-kd wheat proteins in immunoblotting. The 65-kd allergen was a previously undescribed wheat protein, showing 61% sequence identity to gamma-gliadin, whereas the 40-kd allergen had 100% identity to alpha-gliadin. In ELISA, all 18 patients showed elevated IgE levels to the novel gamma-like gliadin, and 13 of the patients showed elevated IgE levels to the alpha-gliadin. None of the 54 control subjects with wheat allergy, urticaria, or coeliac disease had IgE antibodies to the gamma-like gliadin. The in vivo reactivity of the gamma-like gliadin was verified by positive skin prick test responses in all of the 15 patients who were tested. During the follow-up on a gluten-free or wheat-free diet, 3 patients experienced reactions after having unknowingly eaten wheat before exercise, but all the other patients who were adhering to the diet remained symptom-free. CONCLUSION: This study shows that wheat is a frequent cause of food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis and suggests that the major allergen is a previously undescribed gamma-like gliadin. For screening of this life-threatening allergy, we recommend skin prick testing with crude gliadin and we recommend a gluten-free diet for treatment.},

   abstract = {Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a marked negative relationship between diarrhoea and physical growth and development of a child. Each day of illness due to diarrhoea produces a weight deficit of 20-40 gms. Poor nutrition is associated with more serious prolonged diarrhoea. 'Catch-up growth' often does not occur in malnourished children. Malnutrition, particularly wasting, is a strong predictor of diarrhoeal duration and the prolonged illness could exacerbate nutritional faltering, thereby increasing the subsequent risk of death. Poor appetite, vomiting, deliberate withholding of food resulting in poor intake; malabsorption of macro and micronutrients; hastening of intestinal transit time; disturbance of metabolic and endocrine functions; and direct loss of protein and other nutrients in gastrointestinal tract are some of the known mechanisms which have an impact on the nutrition during an episode of diarrhea. In addition diarrhoea of infectious origin causes cytokine induced malnutrition which results from the actions of proinflammatory cytokines like tumour necrosis factor and interleukin 1, 6 and 8. Preexisting malnutrition is associated with decreased turnover of epithelial cells resulting in delayed recovery which may prolong an episode of infectious diarrhoea by itself as well as by promoting tissue invasion by other enteropathogens. Malnutrition may also alter protective host factors and thereby favour intestinal colonization by the pathogenic microbes. Mucosal damage varying from moderately severe changes to flat lesions indistinguishable from those of celiac disease may occur in kwashiorkar. Diarrhoea malnutrition interaction represents a dangerous web which can be distangled by prevention of disease transmission by promoting exclusive breast feeding, hygienic weaning practices, safe drinking water and handwashing, improved host defences by breast feeding, improved nutrition, measles vaccine and other vaccines against enteropathogens in the offing; and promotion of standard case management with special emphasis on nutritional support and rehabilitation.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a permanent gluten intolerance strongly associated with HLA class II antigens. The over presentation of particular HLA alleles and haplotypes has been described in several populations. Different lines of evidence obtained during the last years suggest that a particular HLA-DQ heterodimer, encoded by the DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201 genes in cis or trans conformation, confers the primary disease susceptibility. We report the HLA class II allelic distribution and DQA1/ DQB1 genotypes in 62 Chilean celiac patients compared with 124 control subjects in Santiago, Chile. We found a pronounced increase of the "susceptible" alleles :DQA1*0501 (0.480 vs 0.169, Pc < 0.0005), DQB1*0302 (0.430 vs 0.242, Pc = 0.002) and DQB1*0201 (0.250 vs 0.125, Pc = 0.037) in celiac patients in comparison with control children. As for "protective" alleles, we detected a high frequency of DQA1*0101 (0.310 vs 0.160, Pc = 0.01), DQA1*0201 (0.105 vs 0.010, Pc < 0.0075) and DQB1*0301 (0.250 vs 0.100, Pc = 0.010) in controls. In relation to risk haplotypes, the main combination observed was the conformation DQ8 (DQB1*0302/DQA1*0301) over DQ2 (DQB1*0201/DQA1*0501). In conclusion, results show that celiac disease in Chilean patients is primarily associated with DQ8 conformation. This is concordant with the high frequency of DR4 alleles (in linkage disequilibrium with DQB1*0302) detected in Amerind groups in Chile, where DQB1*0302 is more frequent than DQB1*0201.},

   abstract = {Multiunit celiac and single-unit cervical recordings of vagal afferents were performed before and during infusions of fatty acids, triglycerides, or saline into either the ileum or jejunum of the rat. In multiunit recordings, lipids increased activity of vagal afferents to a greater extent than saline. The greatest increases in vagal afferent activity resulted from infusions of linoleic acid, conjugated linoleic acid, or oleic acid. The triglycerides, corn oil or Intralipid, were less effective than the fatty acids in affecting vagal afferent activity. Ileal pretreatment with the hydrophobic surfactant Pluronic L-81 significantly attenuated the response of celiac vagal afferents to ileal infusion of linoleic acid. Single-unit recordings of cervical vagal afferents supported the multiunit data in showing lipid-induced increased vagal afferent activity in approximately 50% of ileal units sampled and 100% of a limited number of jejunal units sampled. These data demonstrate that free fatty acids can activate ileal and jejunal vagal afferents in the rat, and this effect can be attenuated by pretreatment with a chylomicron inhibitor. These data are consistent with the view that lipid-induced activation of vagal afferents could be a potential substrate for the inhibitory effects of intestinal lipids on gastrointestinal function, food intake, and body weight gain.},

   abstract = {Plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) rise rapidly after nutrient ingestion, suggesting the existence of a proximal gut signal regulating GLP-1 release from the L cells of the distal small intestine. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) has been shown to be one such proximal signal; however, the dependence of GIP on gastrin-releasing peptide, a neuromodulator, suggested a role for the nervous system in this proximal-distal loop. Investigations into the nature of this proximal signal were therefore conducted in an in situ model of the rat gastrointestinal system. Infusions of corn oil into a 10-cm segment of duodenum that was isolated by loose ligation (to ensure that the luminal contents did not progress to the ileal L cell) increased the secretion of GLP-1 in parallel with that of gut glucagon-like immunoreactivity (gGLI; r = 0.85; P < 0.05). Infusion of fat into a transected segment of duodenum also significantly raised gGLI secretion compared with saline infusion, reaching a peak value of 132 +/- 37 pg/ml above basal (P < 0.05). However, peak secretion was significantly delayed when the gut was transected compared with that after ligation alone (19 +/- 4 vs. 6 +/- 1 min, respectively; P < 0.05). Furthermore, bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in conjunction with gut transection completely abolished the fat-induced rise in gGLI secretion (P < 0.001). Consistent with a role for the vagus in the regulation of the L cell, stimulation of the distal end of the celiac branch of the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve significantly stimulated the secretion of gGLI to a level of 71 +/- 14 pg/ml above basal (P < 0.05). As found previously, supraphysiological infusion of GIP significantly increased gGLI secretion in control animals by 123 +/- 32 pg/ml (P < 0.05); this was not prevented by hepatic branch vagotomy (96 +/- 25 pg/ml; P < 0.05). In contrast, although infusion of GIP at physiological levels into sham-vagotomized animals also increased gGLI secretion, by 40 +/- 6 pg/ml (P < 0.05), selective hepatic branch vagotomy abolished GIP-induced gGLI secretion (P < 0.05). The results of these experiments therefore demonstrate that the secretion of GLP-1 and gGLI from the ileal L cell in response to fat is regulated by a complex neuroendocrine loop, involving the enteric nervous system, the afferent and efferent vagus nerves, as well as the duodenal hormone GIP.},

   abstract = {Vagotomy suppresses fever and hyperalgesia caused by intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but has little effect on the febrile response to intravenous or intramuscular LPS. This suggests that some vagus-mediated mechanisms are recruited only when LPS is administered via the intraperitoneal route. We hypothesized that such mechanisms are associated with LPS transport from the peritoneal cavity to the circulation. Adult Wistar rats underwent total subdiaphragmatic, bilateral selective celiac, or sham vagotomy. On day 28-32 after surgery, they were injected IP with Escherichia coli LPS (5, 20, or 100 microg/kg) or saline and decapitated 90 min thereafter. Their plasma levels of LPS and their plasma interleukin-6, adrenocorticotropin, and corticosterone responses to LPS were measured. Success of intraperitoneal administration of LPS was verified by increased interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6 concentrations in the peritoneal lavage fluid. Effectiveness of vagotomies was confirmed by increased stomach mass (food retention) and pancreas mass (hypertrophy). In the shams, LPS caused a dose-dependent endotoxemia and increased plasma levels of interleukin-6, adrenocorticotropin, and corticosterone. Neither celiac nor total vagotomy affected any of these responses. LPS escapes from the peritoneal cavity by two primary routes, viz., the hematogenous (via the portal vein) and lymphogenous (via the lymphatic system). The design of the present study did not allow for evaluating the rapid, hematogenous transport. The results obtained suggest that the abdominal vagus does not control the slow. lymphogenous escape of LPS from the peritoneal cavity.},

   abstract = {The mucosal lesion in coeliac disease (CD) represents an immunologically mediated injury triggered by gliadin and is restricted by a particular assortment of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. Therefore, immunomodulatory strategies to tolerize gliadin-specific, class II-restricted T-cell responses could represent an alternative to current treatments of CD, which are based on a gluten-free diet. In this study, BALB/c mice derived from a gluten-free diet colony were tolerized by either intranasal (i.n.) or intravenous (i.v.) administration of single or multiple doses of gliadin. While a single dose failed to induce tolerance, a significant decrease in gliadin-specific T-cell proliferation was detected (P < 0.001) after multiple i.n. or i.v. administrations. No significant difference in antibody titre was detected for antigen-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) or the IgG1 subclass, but a lower IgG2a-specific titre was observed. Both interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin (IL)-2 expression, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were reduced on antigen administration, both i.v. and i.n. Neither regimen showed a regulatory effect on IL-4 production. As T helper 1 (Th1) cytokines seem to be important in the pathogenesis of CD, our data therefore highlight the potential of i.n. and i.v. routes for the design of useful immunomodulatory strategies for CD.},

We studied jejunal morphology and immunohistochemistry in 26 patients with IDDM, 13 of whom had the HLA-DQB1*0201 gene and therefore a higher risk of coeliac disease. The findings were compared with those in specimens from age-matched controls. Villous structure and the density of the intraepithelial lymphocytes were normal in every biopsy specimen. The extent of positivity with anti-DR and -DP antibodies in the villous epithelium was significantly greater in the specimens from patients than in those from controls (P = 0.0002 in both comparisons). The crypts were also more positive: for DR P = 0.0001, and for DP P = 0.002. The densities of T cells, CD4+, CD8+, and T cell receptor alpha/beta+ and gamma/delta+ cells in the epithelium and lamina propria were similar in patients and controls, but the patients had significantly more alpha 4/beta 7 integrin+ cells in the lamina propria (P = 0.006). No difference was seen between HLA-DQB1*0201-positive and -negative patients. These findings reflect a stage of inflammation in the structurally normal intestines of patients with IDDM and suggest secretion of inflammatory Th1-type cytokines in the intestine.},

Immunological abnormalities characteristic of celiac disease, such as circulating antibodies and increased numbers of intra-epithelial lymphocytes containing a high percentage of gamma-delta T cells have been demonstrated. Other pictures of clinical presentation besides the classical one deserve attention namely short stature, iron-resistant anaemia, enamel hypoplasia, constipation, neurological manifestation and osteoporosis, among others. Asymptomatic presentation has been recognized since development of serological markers such as anti-gliadin, anti-reticulin and anti-endomysium antibodies. Up to now, small intestinal biopsy is the only decisive diagnostic approach. A Federal law has recently imposed food manufactures to place labels informing the presence of gluten in industrialized foods in Brazil. Lately there has been an increase in celiac disease patients registered in the Brazilian Celiac Association.},

In the last years the diagnosis and therapy, classically invasive and surgical, was supplemented by duplex ultrasound and percutaneous techniques like angioplasty and stenting. A 56 year-old man from Greece presented with epigastric pain, which was intensified by food ingestion. These symptoms were caused by a stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery, which was diagnosed by duplex sonography and angiography. No blood flow was detected in the inferior mesenteric and the celiac artery. Occlusion of one internal carotid artery made the patient a poor candidate for surgery. Therefore an interventional approach was chosen. A good result was achieved by angioplasty and stent implantation. On the day after the intervention oral food intake was possible without any pain. 18 months after the intervention the patient was free of abdominal symptoms. Therapy of mesenteric ischemia by percutaneous angioplasty and stenting is published only in case-reports and small series. Therefore the indication is mainly restricted to patients with a high risk for a surgical intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is expected that in patients with coeliac disease the small-bowel mucosal mucosa will return to normal if they adhere to a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, in many this is not the case. This study aims to determine whether this persistent villous atrophy (VA) could be due to continued ingestion of the trace amounts of gluten in 'gluten-free' foods, as defined by the WHO/FAO Codex Alimentarius. METHODS: Duodenal biopsy specimens from 89 adults with long-standing coeliac disease were examined, and the findings correlated with their form of gluten-free diet. RESULTS: In 51 subjects the duodenal specimen was normal, whereas in 38 there was villous atrophy (partial, 28; subtotal, 8; total, 2). There was no relationship between the presence or absence of VA and ingestion of either a GFD as defined by the Codex Alimentarius (Codex-GFD; 39 patients) or a GFD that contained no detectable gluten (NDG diet: 50 patients). Intraepithelial lymphocyte counts were higher, and lactase levels lower, in subjects with an abnormal biopsy specimen than in those in whom it was normal. However, within each of these biopsy groups there was no difference in these variables between patients on a Codex-GFD and those on an NDG-GFD. IgA antigliadin antibody was detected in 4 of 29 patients on a Codex-GFD and in 3 of 13 on a NDG-GFD (NS). CONCLUSION: The persistent mucosal abnormalities seen in patients with coeliac disease on a GFD are not due to the ingestion of trace amounts of gluten. The consequences of these abnormalities have yet to be determined.},

These antinutritional peptides are also able to: (a) prevent in vitro recovery of atrophic coeliac mucosa; (b) to inhibit differentiation of isolated rat fetal and chick fetal intestines; and (c) to interact with undifferentiated cells either agglutinating them or affecting their proliferation and metabolism. Studies performed with A-gliadin, a highly purified bread wheat prolamin fraction, and its fragments obtained either by chemical cleavage of A-gliadin or by synthesis from aminoacids, clearly pointed out to a few small sequences very rich in glutamine and proline residues as the biologically-active agents. Several protective substances, including mannan and N,N',N"-triacetylchitotriose, have been identified as being able to prevent the effects of these peptides in vitro, but the evidence of their in vivo activity is still missing. The present paper provides a synthetic overview of the available data concerning this highly complex matter and offers a critical appraisal of present hypotheses on the action mechanism of biologically-active peptides derived from cereal prolamins.},

   abstract = {Experience gained through investigations on coeliac disease makes it possible to propose a screening method based on agglutination of isolated K562(S) cells to evaluate the occurrence in food protein of amino acid sequences that are able to adversely affect coeliac and related gluten-sensitive patients. The method consists of in vitro sequential peptic and tryptic digestion of food protein fractions under optimal pH, temperature and time conditions and in vitro incubation of the digest with K562(S) cells; the toxic potential is detected as an agglutination of K 562 (S) cells after a short incubation. Other in vitro test systems, including atrophic coeliac intestinal mucosa and rat fetal intestine, can be used to confirm the results obtained with the isolated cells. A fractionation step of the proteolytic digest on a sepharose-mannan column before exposure of the in vitro systems to the separated peptide fractions adds to the sensitivity of the method. This screening method is not only very useful to investigate action mechanisms in coeliac disease, but also to assess the safety of genetically-modified plant foods and novel foods for gluten-sensitive patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with cystic fibrosis who have steatorrhea frequently are underweight and have essential fatty acid (EFA) depletion, which is associated with a poor clinical course. It has been stated that poor EFA status is difficult to correct in patients with cystic fibrosis, and an impaired EFA metabolism with reduced synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has been proposed. In this study, the effects of an oral energy supplement rich in linoleic acid were investigated in patients with cystic fibrosis who had a body weight below 95% of normal for height. METHODS: Thirty-six patients (16 girls) more than 4 years of age were randomized either to a control group (n = 20, age 13.3 +/- 3.8 years, mean +/- SD) receiving intensive dietary counseling only, or an intervention group (n = 16, age, 10.4 +/- 4.3 years) treated for 3 months with dietary counseling plus 628 +/- 254 mL (= kcal) per day of an energy supplement rich in fat (31% of energy) and linoleic acid (16% of energy). RESULTS: In contrast to the control group, the patients with supplemented diets achieved significant increases of energy intake (2189 +/- 731 kcal/day vs. 2733 +/- 762 kcal/day), weight for height (82.8% +/- 8.6% vs. 84.8% +/- 9.6% of normal), and body fat (5.1 +/- 1.7 kg vs. 5.8 +/- 2.2 kg) as well as the initially low values of plasma phospholipid linoleic acid (11.8% +/- 1.1% vs. 17.6% +/- 1.6% of total phospholipid fatty acids) and its main metabolite arachidonic acid (4.4% +/- 0.4% vs. 5.9% +/- 0.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cystic fibrosis with low body weight and poor EFA status benefit from EFA-rich energy supplements and can synthesize arachidonic acid from the precursor linoleic acid.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatment of human exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is suboptimal. This study assessed the effects of bacterial lipase, porcine lipase, and diets on carbohydrate, fat, and protein absorption in pancreatic-insufficient dogs. METHODS: Dogs were given bacterial or porcine lipase and 3 diets: a 48% carbohydrate, 27% fat, and 25% protein standard diet; a high-carbohydrate, low-fat, and low-protein diet; or a low-carbohydrate, high-fat, and high-protein diet (66%/18%/16% and 21%/43%/36% calories). RESULTS: With the standard diet, coefficient of fat absorption increased dose-dependently with both lipases (P < 0.05), but more fat was absorbed with porcine lipase (P < 0.05); 600, 000 IU of bacterial lipase (240 mg) and 300,000 IU of porcine lipase (18 g) nearly abolished steatorrhea. With 300,000 IU of bacterial lipase or 135,000 IU of porcine lipase, fat absorption was greater with the high-fat and -protein diet (P < 0.05 vs. low-fat and -protein diet). There were no interactions among carbohydrate, fat, and protein absorption. CONCLUSIONS: Correcting steatorrhea requires 75 times more porcine than bacterial lipase (18 vs. 240 mg). High-fat and high-protein diets optimize fat absorption with both enzymes. High-fat diets with bacterial or porcine lipase should be evaluated in humans with pancreatic steatorrhea.},

   abstract = {Macrophages play an important role in effector mechanisms of various chronic inflammatory diseases. We studied the effect of gluten, the agent inducing celiac disease, and other food antigens on the activation of macrophages. Nitric oxide (NO) and cytokine production were followed as markers of activation, using cultured murine peritoneal macrophages. None of the food antigens tested caused direct inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activation in macrophages. Unlike other food antigens gluten, gliadin, and their proteolytic fragments significantly enhanced NO production when applied together with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), the most efficient being fragments originating from 25- to 45-min peptic digestion. The activation pathway was mediated via direct stimulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion. The NO-enhancing effect was confirmed at the level of iNOS mRNA transcription. In case of sustained local inflammatory reaction connected with increase of IFN-gamma, gluten and its proteolytic fragments may thus elevate NO production. Increased NO level could consequently participate in the development of mucosal lesions in the gut of celiac patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cereal grains are recognized as the cause of adverse reactions in some patients exposed to grain or flour by either inhalation or ingestion. Cereal-related diseases, such as celiac disease and baker's asthma, have been well studied and the causative cereal proteins have been characterized. Although cereals form an essential part of daily nutrition, the allergenic proteins causing symptoms on ingestion in atopic dermatitis (AD) have remained obscure. In this study, we have investigated the allergenic fraction of wheat in AD. METHODS: Skin prick tests (SPT) with a NaCl wheat suspension and the ethanol-soluble wheat gliadin were performed on 18 wheat-challenge-positive or -negative children with AD, six adult AD patients with suspected cereal allergy, and one adult with wheat-dependent exercise-induced urticaria/anaphylaxis. Serum total IgE and specific IgE-antibody levels to wheat and gluten were measured with the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) simultaneously. In addition serum samples of all 25 patients were analyzed by IgE immunoblotting with the ethanol-soluble wheat-protein extract. RESULTS: Thirteen of the AD children were wheat-challenge-positive, 11/12 of them appeared to be positive with gliadin SPT, and all had an elevated gluten RAST value. Those challenge-negative were negative with both gliadin SPT and gluten RAST. Positive wheat SPT and RAST alone were not associated with positive challenges. Four of the adult patients responded to a cereal-free diet, although only two of them appeared to be positive with gliadin SPT and gluten RAST. A broad and intensive staining of gliadin peptides in IgE-immunoblotting studies was seen in challenge-positive children with positive gliadin SPT and/ or gluten RAST. Besides staining of peptides in the main gliadin area of 30-46 kDa, a characteristic finding was the staining of small, <14-kDa proteins with sera of challenge- and gliadin-SPT-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found that wheat-allergic AD patients have IgE antibodies against gliadin that can be detected by both SPT and the sensitive immunoblotting method. This suggests that gliadin peptides are important allergens, and ingestion of wheat causes symptoms of AD. A broad and intensive IgE staining was seen of gliadin peptides against both the previously characterized peptides in the main gliadin area and small, previously uncharacterized peptides of less than 14 kDa. The gliadin SPT and gluten RAST are good screening methods. Further characterization of the IgE-stained gliadin proteins is needed.},

Children with IDDM and biopsy-proven coeliac disease aged <18 years were included and compared with IDDM controls matched for age, sex and duration of diabetes. Twenty patients with coeliac disease and IDDM participated (15 female, age 7.4-17.3 yr), with two matched IDDM controls for each (age 6.9-17.4 yr). The prevalence of coeliac disease in this diabetes clinic population was 2.6%. All patients completed a 3 day food record (3DFR) and a 7 day food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to assess dietary intake and gluten-free compliance. Diabetes control measured by HbA1c was not different between groups or compared to the overall clinic population (8.48 +/- 0.98% for coeliac patients vs 8.87 +/- 1.46 for IDDM controls vs 8.60 +/- 1.30 for overall clinic population aged 5.0-17.9 yr). Height, weight and BMI standard deviation scores were not different between coeliac patients and IDDM controls. No clinically significant differences were found in intake of energy, macronutrients or micronutrients. The proportion of energy intake from carbohydrate, protein and fat was within recommended ranges, except for a higher saturated fat intake. Only 30% of coeliac patients complied with a strict gluten-free diet, but growth parameters were unaffected by dietary compliance. Thus, we found that children and adolescents with coexisting IDDM and coeliac disease have normal growth, equivalent diabetes control and no differences in energy or nutrient intake compared to matched IDDM controls in our clinic population.},
