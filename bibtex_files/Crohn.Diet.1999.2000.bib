   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glutamine is traditionally considered a nonessential amino acid but may be conditionally essential in patients with catabolic conditions. Glutamine-supplemented foods in these patients have been shown to prevent deterioration of gut permeability, protect against the development of intestinal mucosal atrophy, and improve nitrogen balance. Animal models of inflammatory bowel disease suggest that glutamine-enriched enteral diets may lead to less severe intestinal damage, less weight loss, improved nitrogen balance, and reduced disease activity. The purpose of the current study was to compare the efficacy of a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet with a standard low-glutamine polymeric diet in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Eighteen children with active Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to receive a 4-week course of either a standard polymeric diet with a low glutamine content (4% of amino acid composition; group S) or a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet (42% of amino acid composition; Group G). The two diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous with an identical essential amino acid profile. Remission rates were analysed on an intent-to-treat basis. Changes in clinical and laboratory parameters of disease activity were also compared after 4 weeks of nutritional treatment. RESULTS: Two of the children, both in group G, were withdrawn from the trial because of nontolerance of the diet. There was no difference between the two groups in proportion of patients achieving remission (intent-to-treat basis): 5 (55.5%) of 9 in group S versus 4 (44.4%) of 9 in group G (p = 0.5). Improvement in mean paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) was significantly more in group S (p = 0.002) but changes in orosomucoid level, platelet count, and weight were not different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet offers no advantage over a standard low-glutamine polymeric diet in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. Rather, it appears to be less effective in improving PCDAI. The reported beneficial effects of glutamine seen in many catabolic states must be viewed with caution when extrapolating to the management of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Focus group meetings were held with two groups, each containing 12 children with Crohn's disease aged 8 to 12 and 12 to 17 years. The children were asked broad questions about how Crohn's disease and its treatment affected their lives. To explore these areas in more detail, an 88-item questionnaire was developed and read to an additional 16 of 20 children with Crohn's disease selected at random from outpatients. At first, many of the children denied that Crohn's disease affected their lives at all, but it soon became apparent that many were frustrated or angry about physical symptoms, lack of understanding about Crohn's disease, unpleasant investigations, treatment, and hospitalisation. METHODS: The questionnaire covered six domains of health-related quality of life including symptoms and treatment, social, emotional, family, educational, and future aspects. RESULTS: Elemental diet was the preferred treatment, although surgery was more effective in controlling symptoms. Children receiving steroids had more depressive symptoms. Absenteeism from school and inability to engage in school sports, swimming, and running were frequent problems. There were also difficulties with taking holidays and staying at friends' houses. Worry was reported in 14 of 16 children, anger and frustration and feeling fed up in 12 of 16. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to being a symptomatically disabling condition, Crohn's disease has a great impact on the health-related quality of life of affected children. Future studies of treatment in children with inflammatory bowel disease should include an attempt to assess the impact on the child's health-related quality of life.},

SETTING: Private clinic, USA. SUBJECTS: 74 patients who had ileocolic resection and anastomosis for Crohn's disease between August 1991 and July 1996, 48 through conventional laparotomy and 26 in whom it was laparoscopically assisted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age, operating time, duration of hospital stay, early and late morbidity, and patients' subjective assessment. RESULTS: The mean age was 42 (+/- 17) in the conventional group and 40 (+/- 15) in the laparoscopically assisted group. The mean operating time was significantly shorter in the conventional group, 90.5 +/- 3.7 minutes, compared with 150 +/- 1.2 minutes in the laparoscopic-assisted group (p < 0.0001), but they stayed in hospital significantly longer, 9.6 +/- 0.6 days in the conventional group, compared with 7 +/- 0.8 days in the laparoscopic-assisted group (p < 0.0001). There were no differences between the groups in the incidence of early complications or the cost of admission, but at a mean follow up of 30 months (range 2-59) significantly more patients in the conventional group had developed symptomatic bowel obstruction (15/48 compared with 2/26, p = 0.02). 31 patients in the conventional group (65%) and 16 in the laparoscopically assisted group (62%) returned their subjective assessments. There were no differences between the groups in the number with changed bowel habits, use of drugs for bowel movement, or restricted diet, but patients in the laparoscopically assisted group returned to work more quickly (3.7 +/- 1.2 weeks) compared with 8.2 +/- 1.1 weeks in the conventional group, had better cosmetic results (14/16 compared with 13/31, p = 0.004), and were more likely to have improved social and sexual lives (8/16 compared with 5/31, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopically assisted ileocolic resection for Crohn' s disease is safe and has less morbidity than conventional laparotomy.},

   abstract = {Weight loss and malnutrition are common features in patients with Crohn's disease. This study was designed to evaluate diet-induced thermogenesis and substrate oxidation in patients with Crohn's disease. Twenty-three patients (17 women, 6 men; age 34 +/- 2 y) and 17 healthy control subjects (13 women, 4 men; age 36 +/- 3 y) were studied. Resting energy expenditure and fasting substrate oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry in the morning after an overnight fast. After a standard homogenized test meal (10 kcal/kg), indirect calorimetry was performed every 30 min for 3 h to measure the diet-induced thermogenesis and the postprandial substrate oxidation. In the fasting state, resting energy expenditure was significantly higher in patients than in control subjects (1433 +/- 43 versus 1279 +/- 53 kcal/24 h). Lipid oxidation was higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects (1.17 +/- 0. 07 versus 0.61 +/- 0.11 mg. kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.01). Postprandially, diet-induced thermogenesis was significantly lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects (4.6% +/- 0.5 versus 6.3% +/- 0.5 of energy intake, P < 0.01). Lipid oxidation was significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects (0.78 +/- 0.05 versus 0.56 +/- 0.08 mg. kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.05), and glucose oxidation was lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects. In patients with Crohn's disease, lipid oxidation positively correlates with the disease activity evaluated by the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (r = 0.48, P150), fasting and postprandial lipid oxidation was significantly higher than in patients with inactive Crohn's disease (P < 0.05). In conclusion, patients with Crohn's disease have increased fat oxidation, which correlates with disease activity and this may explain the reduced fat stores in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Environmental factors play an important role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease. There is a strong and consistent association between smoking and Crohn's disease, and between nonsmoking and ulcerative colitis. Despite extensive research, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms for these associations remain unclear. In spite of this, some clinical trials with nicotine-patches showed beneficial effects for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Associations of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with other environmental factors are weaker like the association with use of oral contraceptives or those less well investigated such as the association with childhood hygiene. Most studies suggesting a potential pathogenetic role of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis or an effect of tuberculostatic therapy in Crohn's disease could not be reproduced by others. Perinatal or childhood infections by viruses like measles are heavily debated, but not proven to be causal for inflammatory bowel disease. Coagulation disorders have been described as protecting from inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting hypercoagulability to be a pathogenetic factor. Some studies described that appendectomy may prevent the onset of ulcerative colitis in man and mice. Other environmental factors such as hydrogen sulfide, tonsillectomy, diet, blood transfusions, and Listeria also require confirmation. There are, however, convincing data from genetic animal models and twin studies that environmental factors as the intestinal bacterial flora interact with susceptible hosts to cause inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory bowel diseases have multifactorial etiologies, which require a differentiated approach for treatment and prevention.},

The first evidence of the importance of dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was derived from epidemiologic observations of the low incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Eskimos. The aim of this paper was to briefly review the literature on the use of n-3 fatty acids in inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease), the results of which are controversial. The discrepancies between studies may reside in the different study designs used as well as in the various formulations and dosages used, some of which may lead to a high incidence of side effects. Choosing a formulation that lowers the incidence of side effects, selecting patients carefully, and paying strict attention to experimental design are critical when investigating further the therapeutic potential of these lipids in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {There have frequently been doubts as to the relevance of food allergy, in particular as far as the involvement of the intestinal tract is concerned. Several studies, however, have confirmed the existence of allergic reactions in the gut, with an estimated prevalence of about 1-2% in adults. Clinical symptoms are unspecific and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping and diarrhea. Intestinal mast cells, as well as intestinal eosinophils, have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of food-allergy-related enteropathy. In addition to classical IgE-dependent degranulation, further agonists have been demonstrated for mast cell activation, for example IL-4. The methods used to confirm the diagnosis of intestinal allergy are still insufficient. Until now, blinded oral challenge procedures with food antigens have been accepted as the 'gold standard' in diagnosing food allergy, although these tests have practical problems. Therefore, new test systems have been developed, such as endoscopic provocation tests, that may improve diagnostic procedures. Elimination diet still presents the main basis of therapy. Aspects to be focused on in the future are the role fo IgE-independent allergic mechanisms in intestinal allergy, the impact of cross-reactivity with other allergens and the relationship to other inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antisecretory factor (AF), a 41 kDa cloned and sequenced protein, suppresses intestinal inflammation and hypersecretion in animals. Endogenous AF production can be induced by dietary modifications in several animal species, and this feed has been shown to reduce the incidence of diarrhoeal disease in weaning piglets. The role of AF in intestinal disease in humans is not known. AIMS: To study the effects of hydrothermally processed cereals, optimised for AF induction in animals, added to the diet of patients with longstanding symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PATIENTS: Fifty three patients with IBD (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) were entered into the study, and 50 completed follow up. The experimental group consisted of 16 females (mean age 50 (SEM 5) years) and 10 males (41 (4) years) and the placebo group of 12 women (41 (4) years old) and 12 men (51 (5) years). METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive either hydrothermally processed cereals (active treatment) or the same amount of ordinary cereals (placebo treatment) for four weeks in a double blind study design. Baseline diet and medications remained unchanged. Bowel symptoms, plasma levels of AF, and colonic biopsies were evaluated before and after treatment. RESULTS: The active treatment significantly improved subjective ratings of clinical symptoms and increased plasma AF levels compared with placebo. Plasma lipid levels were unaffected. CONCLUSION: Hydrothermally processed cereals can induce AF production in human IBD. This increase in endogenous AF activity is associated with clinical improvement. Further studies are warranted to clarify the exact role of AF in human intestinal disease.},

Many patients visit specific complementary practitioners, while others attempt to educate themselves, trusting advice from employees at local health food stores or the Internet. Thirty-two retail health food stores were surveyed on the nature of the information provided by their staff. A research assistant visited the stores and presented as the mother of a child in whom Crohn's disease had been diagnosed. Seventy-two per cent (23 of 32) of store employees offered advice, such as to take nutritional and herbal supplements. Of the 23 stores where recommendations were made, 15 (65%) based their recommendation on a source of information. Fourteen of the 15 stores using information sources used the same reference book. This had a significant impact on the recommendations; the use of nutritional supplements was favoured. In conclusion, retail health food stores are not as inconsistent as hypothesized, although there are many variances in the types of supplements recommended for the same chronic disease.},

Indications, operative findings, clinicopathologic, and postoperative data were recorded. METHODS: In this study, the mean age was 37 years (range, 16-70 years), and 55% of the participants were women. Indications for surgery included obstruction (64 cases), pain (22 cases), peritonitis (1 case) and abscess (1 case). Seventy patients underwent ileocolic resection, 28 of whom had a previous history of one or two ileocolic resections. Eight of these patients had additional procedures including tubal ligation (1), sigmoidectomy (1), cholecystectomy (3 cases), and enterectomy (3 cases). Small bowel resection (13 cases), right hemicolectomy (3 cases), subtotal colectomy (3 cases), anterior rectal resection (2 cases), and sigmoid resection (3 cases) were performed in the remaining patients. All but one procedure were completed laparoscopically with extracorporeal anastomosis. The average length of intestine resected was 33 cm (range, 10-92 cm). Forty-one patients had 58 fistulae between ileum, jejunum, mesentery, colon, abdominal wall, skin, or bladder. Mean blood loss was 168 ml (range, 30-800 ml) and mean operative time was 183 min (range, 96-400 min). RESULTS: More than 85% of the patients were tolerating a liquid diet on the first postoperative day. Average length of hospital stay was 4.2 days (range, 3-11 days). Complications included anastomotic leak necessitating reoperation, stricture requiring endoscopic dilation, hemorrhage treated expectantly, urinary tract infection, pulmonary embolus, line sepsis, and early postoperative intestinal obstruction (7 cases) requiring reoperation in three cases. CONCLUSIONS: Experience with both advanced laparoscopic techniques and conventional surgery for inflammatory bowel disease allowed successful laparoscopic management of patients with complicated Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Since malnutrition and lactose intolerance are frequently reported in Crohn's disease (CD), we evaluated the differences in terms of compliance-to-treatment and nutritional status in inactive CD patients after two different treatments using either a standard polymeric diet or a vegetable-protein-rich and lactose-free diet. STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study. SUBJECTS: Forty CD patients with inactive disease were randomly divided into two groups. Group A (10 men; aged 33.9+/-7.2 years; BMI, 21.8+/-1.7 kg/m2) received a conventional polymeric enteral diet, while group B (10 men; aged 35.6+/-6.8 years; BMI, 21.4+/-1.8 kg/m2) was administered a soy-rich and lactose-free polymeric diet, over a 4-week period. METHODS: All the patients had a clinical and laboratory examination. Body composition was assessed by isotopic dilution and resting metabolic rate (RMR), and substrate oxidation rates were measured by indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: Body weight significantly increased after treatment in both groups (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.01), as well as fat-free mass (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.05) and fat mass (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.01). RMR slightly increased, although it did not reach statistical significance. Treatment did not influence substrate oxidation rates. Group B lactose-intolerant patients reported a greater compliance-to-treatment than those in group A. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a polymeric enteral diet rich in vegetable protein and not containing milk protein, eaten at home, with no need for positioning a nasogastric tube, significantly improved body composition in inactive and lactose-intolerant CD patients, with no effect on energy metabolism, suggesting that it could be useful in improving nutritional status in these patients.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the length of postoperative ileus in patients undergoing colectomy by either laparotomy or laparoscopy. METHODS: A total of 166 patients were studied. These patients were divided into two groups: Group 1, in which colectomy was done laparoscopically, and Group 2, consisting of patients undergoing laparotomy. Both groups contained 83 patients who were matched for disease severity, indications for surgery, and procedure. Indications for surgery included sigmoid diverticulitis in 12 (14 percent) patients, polyps in 22 (27 percent), Crohn's disease in 21 (25 percent), colorectal cancer in 11 (13 percent), stoma reversal in 8 (10 percent), rectal prolapse in 3 (4 percent), and other indications in 6 (7 percent) in each group. Operations were colectomy with anastomosis (42 ileocolic, 26 colorectal, 6 colocolic, 4 ileorectal, and 2 ileal J pouch) or without anastomosis (3 abdominoperineal resections) performed by the same surgeons during the same time period January 1993 to October 1996). The nasogastric tube was removed from all patients immediately after surgery in both groups. All patients received a clear liquid diet on the first postoperative day, followed by a regular diet as tolerated. The nasogastric tube was reinserted if two or more episodes of emesis of more than 200 ml occurred in the absence of bowel movement. Patients were discharged from the hospital when tolerating a regular diet without evidence of ileus. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact probability test. RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio was 38 to 45 in both groups. A total of 10 (12 percent) and 23 (28 percent) patients in Group 1 and Group 2 had emesis (P = 0.02), and the rate of nasogastric tube reinsertion was 5 (6 percent) and 13 (16 percent), respectively (P > 0.05). There were significant differences between Groups 1 and 2 relative to the lengths of ileus (3.5 +/- 1.3 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.7 days, respectively; P < 0.001), hospitalization (6.6 +/- 3.3 vs. 8.1 +/- 2.5 days, respectively; P < 0.002), and operative time (170 +/- 60 vs. 114 +/- 46 minutes, respectively; P < 0.001). The morbidity rate was 16 (19.2 percent) and 18 (21.6 percent) in the laparoscopy and laparotomy groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although early oral intake is safe and can be tolerated by 84 percent of patients after colectomy by laparotomy, laparoscopic colectomy reduced the lengths of both postoperative ileus and hospitalization.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In earlier studies, erythromycin stimulated but octreotide inhibited gastric antral contractions, as each drug induced phase 3-like episodes. METHODS: To assess the effect of erythromycin pretreatment on octreotide-induced changes in antroduodenal motility, 16 patients were studied (mean age, 8.7 +/- 1.5 years, 8 male): 6 with severe gastroesophageal reflux, 4 with cyclic vomiting, 3 with gastroparesis, 2 with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and 1 with Crohn's disease and unexplained nausea and vomiting. After recording fasting antroduodenal motility for 3 hours, 1 mg/kg intravenous erythromycin was administered over 30 minutes. Sixty minutes after the erythromycin infusion, 0.5 microg/kg subcutaneous octreotide was administered, followed 1 hour later by a meal. RESULTS: Phase 3 occurred spontaneously in 10 patients and after erythromycin in 12 patients. When administered after erythromycin, octreotide immediately induced phase 3s contractions in 15 patients, beginning in the antrum. In 7 children, some of the octreotide-induced phase 3s did not propagate. After the meal, antral contractions continued in all patients. The fed pattern was replaced in 14 patients by alternating phase 3 and phase 1 activities. CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with erythromycin prevented octreotide-induced inhibition of antral contractions. Inhibition of antral contractions by octreotide may be mediated through either a direct or indirect suppression of motilin release, because antral contractions persist after pretreatment with the motilin receptor agonist erythromycin.},

   abstract = {Human breast milk is rich in nutrients, hormones, growth factors and immunoactive molecules, which influence the growth, development and immune status of the newborn infant. Although several of these factors are also present in bovine milk, the greater susceptibility of the formula-fed infant to infection and disease and the development of allergy is often attributed to the reduced level of protective factors in milk formulas. Nevertheless, modifying manufacturing processes may preserve the biological activity of some bioactive molecules in end products. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is one such molecule. TGF-beta is a polypeptide, which has been described in both human and bovine milk. It is implicated in many processes, including epithelial cell growth and differentiation, development, carcinogenesis and immune regulation. The present article discusses the biological activity of TGF-beta2 that has been preserved and activated in a cow's milk-based product. More specifically, it addresses possible mechanisms of action in the intestinal lumen and speculates on how milk products containing naturally occurring TGF-beta2 could be exploited in functional foods for the infant or as therapies for specific intestinal diseases.},

The bleeding sites were located in the ulcer lesions of ileum, in the oral side near to the ileum-colon transition. The first bleeding point was at the longitudinal ulcer of the terminal ileum and the secondary bleeding site was at the profound ulcer of ileum appearing in the oral side near to the ileo-colic anastomosis. This is the first case of Crohn's disease with recurrent life-threatening massive hemorrhage in the terminal region of ileum, for which operative bowel resections were necessary. This case suggests that we should search for the bleeding site in ileal lesions developed in the circumference of and especially the oral side near to the anastomosis due to prior resection, when intestinal massive bleeding occurs again after bowel resection, and that the careful follow-up and strict treatment with diet therapy and/or anti-inflammatory drugs are necessary for the protection of recurrence in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {After a short introduction (chapter 1) methods of measuring gastrointestinal pH are described in chapter 2. The methods are divided into intubation techniques and tubeless methods, and the advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Measurements with pH-sensitive, radiotransmitting capsules are highlighted, and methodological problems with these capsules are described. Chapter 3 concerns the gastrointestinal pH profile of healthy subjects. The intraluminal pH is rapidly changed from highly acid in the stomach to about pH 6 in the duodenum. The pH gradually increases in the small intestine from pH 6 to about pH 7.4 in the terminal ileum. The pH drops to 5.7 in the caecum, but again gradually increases, reaching pH 6.7 in the rectum. The physiological background of these pH values is discussed. Chapter 4 describes the effect of gastrointestinal pH on bacterial flora, absorption of vitamins and electrolytes, and on the activity of digestive enzymes. The pH-profile in children is described in chapter 5. The profile is identical with that of adults, and it is therefore concluded that the release of a drug from pH-dependent, controlled-release preparations is also probably identical with that of adults. Chapter 6 describes the correlation between certain diseases and the gastrointestinal pH. A resection of the colon and the creation of an ileostomy do not affect the pH of the remaining gut. An ileocaecal resection shortens the small intestinal transit time, increases pH of the proximal colon, but does not change the pH-profile of the small intestine. Chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis seem to decrease pH of the proximal small intestine. Very low colonic pH values have been observed in severe active ulcerative colitis and in Crohn's disease, but the background and clinical implication of this phenomenon are not clear. Chapter 7 describes the modulating effect of diet and drugs on gastrointestinal pH. Diet primarily has an effect on the colonic pH, whereas drugs might affect both small intestinal and colonic pH. The different effects are described. Finally, chapter 8 summarizes the present knowledge about gastrointestinal pH, and future investigations are proposed.},

AIM: To assess the effects of a specific oral polymeric diet (CT3211; Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland), which is rich in transforming growth factor beta2, on the mucosal inflammatory process. METHODS: Twenty-nine consecutive children with active intestinal Crohn's disease were treated with CT3211 as the sole source of nutrition for 8 weeks. Patients were assessed clinically, and endoscopically, whilst cytokine mRNA was measured in mucosal biopsies before and after treatment by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: After 8 weeks 79% of children were in complete clinical remission. Macroscopic and histological healing in the terminal ileum and colon was associated with a decline in ileal and colonic interleukin-1beta mRNA (pre-treatment to post-treatment ratio 0.008 and 0.06: P < 0.001, P = 0.006). In the ileum there was also a fall in interferon gamma mRNA (ratio 0.15, P < 0.001) with a rise in transforming growth factor beta1 mRNA (ratio 10, P = 0.04), whilst in the colon interleukin-8 mRNA fell with treatment (ratio 0.06, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical response to oral polymeric diet CT3211 is associated with mucosal healing and a down regulation of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA in both the terminal ileum and colon. In the ileum there was also an increase in transforming growth factor beta1 mRNA.},

   abstract = {Energy-protein malnutrition and the sub-clinical deficiencies of vitamins and trace elements, are frequent findings in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and these may negatively influence the clinical course of these diseases. In general, the majority of the patients with ulcerative colitis and uncomplicated Crohn's disease can ingest a normal diet that is well balanced and without any restrictions. The intolerance to specific foods is rare in Crohn's disease and the application of exclusion diets in a routine manner is not indicated. When the nutritional status cannot be adequately maintained with normal ingestion, the use of artificial nutrition is indicated. Enteral nutrition is the first choice nutritional support system if the gastrointestinal tract is accessible and at least partially functional. In Crohn's disease enteral nutrition could have a specific anti-inflammatory effect ("primary treatment"), and it has been suggested that this could be effective to induce the clinical remission of the activity bouts of the disease. Some types of dietary fiber could be effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Initial studies suggest their usefulness in maintaining the remission of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Butyrate enemas may be effective in the treatment of active distal ulcerative colitis. Because colonic fermentation of Plantago ovata seeds (dietary fiber) yields butyrate, the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of Plantago ovata seeds as compared with mesalamine in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. METHODS: An open label, parallel-group, multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted. A total of 105 patients with ulcerative colitis who were in remission were randomized into groups to receive oral treatment with Plantago ovata seeds (10 g b.i.d.), mesalamine (500 mg t.i.d.), and Plantago ovata seeds plus mesalamine at the same doses. The primary efficacy outcome was maintenance of remission for 12 months. RESULTS: Of the 105 patients, 102 were included in the final analysis. After 12 months, treatment failure rate was 40% (14 of 35 patients) in the Plantago ovata seed group, 35% (13 of 37) in the mesalamine group, and 30% (nine of 30) in the Plantago ovata plus mesalamine group. Probability of continued remission was similar (Mantel-Cox test, p = 0.67; intent-to-treat analysis). Therapy effects remained unchanged after adjusting for potential confounding variables with a Cox's proportional hazards survival analysis. Three patients were withdrawn because of the development of adverse events consisting of constipation and/or flatulence (Plantago ovata seed group = 1 and Plantago ovata seed plus mesalamine group = 2). A significant increase in fecal butyrate levels (p = 0.018) was observed after Plantago ovata seed administration. CONCLUSIONS: Plantago ovata seeds (dietary fiber) might be as effective as mesalamine to maintain remission in ulcerative colitis.},

Knowledge of the nutritional status in patients with recently diagnosed IBD is limited. The aim of this study was to establish a comprehensive picture of the nutritional status in recently diagnosed IBD patients. SUBJECTS: Sixty-nine IBD patients (23 Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 with ulcerative colitis (UC)) within 6 months of diagnosis and 69 age- and sex-matched population controls were included in the study. METHODS: The nutritional status was assessed by: (1) body composition (anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry); (2) dietary intake (dietary history); (3) biochemical indexes of nutrition; and (4) muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometer). RESULTS: Body weight and body mass index were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. The mean daily intake of carbohydrates was significantly higher in CD patients and the intakes of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls, respectively. Serum concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene, magnesium, selenium and zinc) were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. Serum vitamin B12 concentration was significantly lower in CD patients. Muscle strength did not significantly differ between IBD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the nutritional status of IBD patients was already affected negatively at time of diagnosis. It needs to be elucidated whether nutritional supplementation in recently diagnosed IBD patients may improve the clinical course of the disease.},

   abstract = {In patients with Crohn's disease (CD), malnutrition is frequently observed and is generally accepted to be an important issue. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 3 months of supplementation with a liquid formula containing either antioxidants (AO) or n-3 fatty acids plus AO on the antioxidant status and fatty acid profile of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue, respectively, in patients with long-standing CD currently in remission. In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study, CD patients received either placebo, AO, or n-3 fatty acids plus AO for 3 months in addition to their regular diet. In all, 25/37 CD patients completed the study. AO status was assessed by blood biochemical parameters. A statistical per-protocol analysis was performed. Serum concentrations of selenium, vitamin C, and vitamin E, the activity of superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant status were significantly (p < 0.05) increased after AO supplementation. Furthermore, compared with controls, serum concentrations of beta-carotene, selenium, and vitamin C and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were significantly (p < 0.05) lower before supplementation; however, after AO supplementation these levels were not significantly different from controls (except for GPx). N-3 fatty acids plus AO supplementation significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the proportion of arachidonic acid, and increased the proportion of eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexanoic acid in both plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue. Supplementation with antioxidants improved antioxidant status in patients with CD in remission. In addition, supplementation with n-3 fatty acids plus antioxidants significantly changed the eicosanoid precursor profile, which may lead to the production of eicosanoids with attenuated proinflammatory activity. This study indicates that an immunomodulating formula containing n-3 fatty acids and/or AO may have the potential to play a role in the treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory process, the aetiology of which remains unknown. Nutrition may play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD. The evidence regarding the role of specific dietary components in the pathogenesis of IBD is still inconclusive. Many studies have been subject to methodological limitations; studies of better design are necessary to confirm the hypothesis that nutritional factors may indeed play a role in the development of IBD. Several studies have reported nutritional and functional deficiencies in IBD patients, especially in Crohn's disease. It is, however, hard to discriminate between disease-induced and malnutrition-induced changes in nutritional parameters. Maintaining adequate nutritional status has been suggested to be beneficial to the course of the disease in IBD. Studies have provided further insight into the possible beneficial effects of nutritional supplementation as primary and adjunctive therapy in IBD. The effects of specific nutritional therapy may be caused by alterations in intestinal flora and hence in the production of intraluminal proinflammatory substances. Immunonutrients such as n-3 fatty acids and antioxidants may also play a role in the treatment of IBD. In this paper, the relation between nutritional aetiological factors, nutritional status and nutritional therapy is discussed in detail.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fatty acid metabolism is involved in the immune response and inflammation processes in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Fatty acid changes may be relevant to the clinical course of the disease. The aim of this study was to compare the qualitative and quantitative fat intake and fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue in a defined population of CD patients with those in matched controls. METHODS: Dietary fat intake and fatty acid profile of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue were assessed in two patient populations: 20 patients with recently diagnosed CD and 32 patients with longstanding (> 10 yr) CD clinically in remission, matched for age and gender with healthy controls. RESULTS: We observed no significant differences in quantitative or qualitative fat intake between CD patients and controls. Percentages of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid in plasma phospholipids or adipose tissue were not significantly different between patients and controls. However, we observed a significantly (p < 0.05) lower percentage of the sum of the n-3 fatty acids, with significantly (p < 0.01) higher levels of clupanodonic acid (22:5n-3) and significantly (p < 0.05) lower levels of docosahexaenoic (22:6n-3) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6). The aberrant fatty acid profile was more evident in patients with longstanding CD than in patients with recently diagnosed CD. CONCLUSION: The aberrant fatty acid profile found in these CD patients is a result of altered metabolism rather than of essential fatty acid malabsorption. The reported findings may be important in the pathophysiology of CD and hence in the choice of fatty acids to be used when therapeutic supplementation is considered in CD patients.},

METHODS: Antioxidant status (serum antioxidant vitamins and minerals, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase activity), disease activity, dietary intake, and the fatty acid profile in plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids were studied in patients with active CD (n = 12), inactive CD (n = 50), and controls (n = 70). Eight patients with active CD were re-evaluated during the subsequent phase of clinical remission. The relation between the variables was assessed by multiple linear regression. RESULTS: We observed a significantly diminished antioxidant status in patients with active CD compared with inactive CD and controls. Furthermore, the antioxidant defence was depleted in patients with inactive CD compared with controls. An aberrant fatty acid profile in plasma phospholipids was found in active and inactive CD compared with controls. Multivariate analysis showed that the plasma phospholipid fatty acid indices were significantly associated with several antioxidants (beta-carotene, vitamin E, and glutathione peroxidase) in CD patients but not in controls. CONCLUSION: The fatty acid profile in CD patients is significantly associated with disease activity and serum antioxidant concentrations. This observation, along with the diminished antioxidant defence in patients with active and inactive CD, indicates that antioxidants should be considered in the therapy of inflammation in CD.},

Complications and inadequate responses to current treatment modalities have resulted in the development of new and more specific biologic therapies. The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) is present in elevated concentrations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease; therefore, it has been targeted for treatment approaches. Infliximab is a chimeric, monoclonal antibody to TNF alpha developed to inhibit the interaction of TNF alpha with its receptor, to result in amelioration of inflammation. This biologic agent has received the most attention and is the most studied of those for the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease. This article reviews the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, the traditional treatment approaches used, the role of TNF alpha in disease pathogenesis, and the value of infliximab in treatment.},

We examined the effect of preoperative nutritional therapy with elemental diet on the interval until and the outcome after surgical treatment in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODOLOGY: We reviewed the records for 73 patients with Crohn's disease who underwent intestinal resection in our department between January 1, 1974 and December 31, 1996. Thirty-two of them had not received elemental diet (No ED group) and 41 had received elemental diet therapy (ED group) before the first resection. RESULTS: The median interval between the onset and first resection was 19.3 months for the NoED group and 67.5 months for the ED group (P = 0.0005). All patients received ED therapy after the first resection. The incidence of second resection was significantly different between the ED and the NoED group after the first operation. (P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Elemental diet therapy is effective in prolonging the interval between the onset and first resection and in reducing the incidence of second resection. The initial introduction of elemental diet therapy is useful in the management of the clinical course of Crohn's disease minimizing surgical intervention.},

A number of studies have examined the prevalence of abnormal bone mineral metabolism in children and adolescents. Studies, conducted over the past decade, indicate a greater likelihood of clinically significant problems in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. Corticosteroids have been proven to impair bone mineral status. It is increasingly clear that inflammation and other factors play a bigger role than malabsorbtion of minerals or vitamin D in most patients. As the use of the bisphonate class of drugs is limited in pediatric patients, there is a need to emphasize the role of diet and exercise in children and teenagers, particularly in those affected by inflammatory bowel disease.},

This paper reports about the relationship between food habits and reactions to foods in people with IBD. A database was designed to incorporate the date of data collection, the IBD disease, food habits, the quantity consumed and a response rating of the subjects' reactions to each food. For each of 122 foods, subjects were asked simultaneously about these five categories. Thirty three subjects with Crohn's disease and 27 with ulcerative colitis completed the questionnaire in two seasons. The focus of the examination was directed to the upper and lower limit of reactions to foods. Foods that affect people negatively and foods that affect people positively were identified in relation to habits of consumption. Foods that affect people negatively were among those never consumed while foods that affect people positively were among the regularly consumed foods. Findings included an increased number of foods that caused problems for people with Crohn's disease when compared with people with ulcerative colitis. Problems with chocolate, dairy products, fats and artificial sweeteners were documented in both groups of IBD. A standard food list generated without the input of individuals with a chronic illness may be inadequate to collect data about their consumption since many of the foods on the list were reportedly never consumed and there may be other foods not on the list that are consumed by this chronically ill population.},

A database was created to capture the season of data collection, the disease, the food, and the subject's reaction to each food. A 122-item food list was used. Sixty patients with IBD (n = 33 persons with Crohn's disease, n = 27 persons with ulcerative colitis) completed the questionnaire about foods and their reactions to the foods in the fall and spring representing summer and winter consumption. Foods that made the subjects feel better and worse were identified. Although the original purpose of the study was to assess people with IBD as a group, it became apparent that reactions to foods were different according to whether a subject had Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Failure to distinguish between the two diseases and use only the pooled data made the data meaningless. The importance of this finding and themes related to foods that had a positive or negative effect on the subjects is discussed in this article.},

   abstract = {The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still unknown. However, a satisfactory solution cannot be far away. IBD actually encompasses two diseases, i.e. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerous colitis (UC). These diseases resemble each other so closely that they cannot be distinguished even pathologically, but differ from each other sufficiently to regard them as independent entities. Epidemiological observations may be helpful in identifying the true causative factors of this evasive disease. Geographically, the prevalence of the disease has a slope from North to South and, to a lesser degree, from West to East. The Western-Eastern discrepancy can be attributed to a difference in Western life styles. The incidence of the disease has been increasing world-wide of late, but its spread has been slowing down in highly affected countries. Racial and ethnic relations in different populations and immigration studies offer interesting data which can reflect genetic, inherited, environmental and behavioural factors. The disease seems to have a characteristic racial-ethnic distribution: the Jewish population is highly susceptible everywhere, but its prevalence in that population nears that of the domestic society in which they live. In Hungary, the Roma (Gypsies) have a considerably lower prevalence than the average population. This can be attributed to a genetic or environmental influence. According to age, the onset of the disease occurs more often in the second or the third decade of life, but there also is another peak in the 60s. Regarding sexual distribution, there is a slight preponderance of colitis ulcerosa in men and of Crohn's disease in women. It may correspond to the stronger auto-immune affection in the process of Crohn's disease. Environmental factors and behavioural influences also are investigated. Diet, the role of the early ages, smoking habits and the influence of hormonal status and drugs are viewed as useful contributing factors in the manifestation of the disease. Genetic studies show that one-fourth of IBD patients have an affected family member. HLAB27 histocombatibility also plays an important, but not determining role in the development of the disease. Genetic factors seem to have a stronger influence in Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis. The existence of multiple sclerosis-IBD families may reflect the common genetic background or the similar microbial effect as well. A great number of bacterial and viral factors has been suspected of being infectious factors in IBD, mostly in CD. Mycobacteria, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Clostridium, Clamidias, etc. as well as bacteria and some viruses such as herpes and rotavirus and the primary measles virus. None of them has been proven as a real and exclusively pathogenic factor. Immunological background has an important function in the manifestation of the disease. If an individual has a genetic susceptibility to infections, the down regulation of an inflammation in the bowel wall does not occur in a proper way. This initiates the auto-immune process which is a self-increasing cycle. Extra-intestinal manifestations of IBD are of high importance because they can not only follow intestinal symptoms, but precede them by years. Hepatic and biliary disturbances (primary sclerosing cholangitis), are the most serious complications. Mucocutaneous manifestations can be the first appearance of the main disease (in the mouth). Auto-immune consequences (erythema nodosum) or complications caused even by the therapy can occur. Ocular and musculoskeletal manifestations supposedly have the same genetic background and often precede the intestinal symptoms. Considering the epidemiological, genetic and immunological data, we can conclude that ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are heterogeneous disorders of mutifactorial etiology in which hereditary (genetic) and environmental (microbial, behaviour) factors interact to produce the disease.},

In superacute conditions also total parenteral nutrition can be used. In the quiescent stage the patient must have an adequate energy intake and a low-residue (low-fibre) diet. As to medication, sulfasalazine which has some side-effects is abandoned and 5-ASA (5-aminosalicylic acid) preparations are used, either by the oral route or in enemas, while 4-ASA is little used in this country and is known as PAS. The administration of corticoids which also have side-effects will be abandoned in favour of so-called rapidly metabolized corticoids (Tixocortol pivalate, beclomethasone, budenoside and fluticasone) by the oral route and in enemas and foams. As antimicrobial treatment ciprofloxacine is used combined with metronidazole. As to immunosuppressive drugs azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, cyclosporin A, cyclophosphamide and methotrexate are tested. A hope for the future is so-called biological treatment (anticytokines, monoclonal antibodies against cytokines, against CD4+ TNF, interleukines IL-10 and 11, immunoglobulin; plasmapheresis is also tested). Treatment must be individual and surgery as late as possible, only in case of complications, and should be very sparing, stenoses should be treated by plastic operations of strictures.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a panenteric, transmural inflammatory disease of unknown origin. Although primarily managed medically, 70% to 90% of patients will require surgical intervention. Surgery for small bowel Crohn's is usually necessary for unrelenting stenotic complications of the disease. Fistula, abscess, and perforation can also necessitate surgical intervention. Most patients benefit from resection or strictureplasty with an improved quality of life and remission of disease, but recurrence is common and 33% to 82% of patients will need a second operation, and 22% to 33% will require more than two resections. Short-bowel syndrome is unavoidable in a small percentage of Crohn's patients because of recurrent resection of affected small bowel and inflammatory destruction of the remaining mucosa. Although previously a lethal and unrelenting disease with death caused by malnutrition, patients with short-bowel syndrome today can lead productive lives with maintenance on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). This lifestyle, however, does not come without a price. Severe TPN-related complications, such as sepsis of indwelling central venous catheters and liver failure, do occur. Future developments will focus on more powerful and effective anti-inflammatory medication specifically targeting the immune mechanisms responsible for Crohn's disease. Successful medical management of the disease will alleviate the need for surgical resection and reduce the frequency of short-bowel syndrome. Improving the efficacy of immunosuppression and the understanding of tolerance induction should increase the safety and applicability of small-bowel transplant for those with short gut. Tissue engineering offers the potential to avoid immunosuppression altogether and supplement intestinal length using the patient's own tissues.},

This is not the case in individuals with chronic inflammatory or trophic changes at vitamin B12 absorption sites. Without supplementation, vitamin B12 deficiency can be expected within 5 years of gastrectomy. Characteristic features of type A gastritis are hyposecretion and mucosal atrophy in the fundus and body of the stomach, with absent intrinsic factor. In the small intestine, active and/or passive absorption is impaired by extensive ileal resection, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and chronic inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease. Definitive plasma concentrations cannot be quoted for vitamin B12 deficiency. Dietary habits, subjective symptoms, hematological laboratory results, function tests and gastrointestinal endoscopic and histological findings must all be taken into account in the diagnosis. Modern diagnostic parameters, such as methylmalonic acid and homocysteine serum assays, are useful for achieving early diagnosis and hence optimal treatment. With their assured availability, parenteral vitamin B12 preparations remain the treatment of choice. Results from vitamin B12 bioavailability studies in healthy subjects suggest that > 300 micrograms probably suffices as an oral maintenance dose after parenteral loading. Further well-documented cases are needed in order to establish whether these doses are adequate in malabsorption syndromes and gastrointestinal diseases. Various case reports indicate the value of prophylactic and therapeutic oral vitamin B12 administration, especially in disorders of homocysteine metabolism, a substance postulated as a further important risk factor for atherosclerosis.},

This prospective study was therefore undertaken to define the role of Doppler sonography in the assessment of disease activity and in the prediction of early relapse. METHODS: Splanchnic flowmetry was performed in 59 patients with Crohn's disease and 20 healthy volunteers during fasting and 30 min after ingestion of a standardized meal. Twenty-one patients measured during the active state and in clinical remission were followed-up for 6 months. Hemodynamic parameters of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries and the portal vein were related to clinical (Crohn's disease activity index [CDAI]), laboratory (C-reactive protein), and endoscopic (Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity) parameters of disease activity. RESULTS: The postprandial mean velocity of the superior mesenteric artery correlated closest with clinical activity (CDAI, p < 0.005) and C-reactive protein (p < 0.01), but was unrelated to endoscopic activity. All patients in remission after 6 months (9/9) showed an increase in postprandial pulsatility index of the superior mesenteric artery, compared with an initial measurement during active disease (+28%). In contrast, the majority of patients with later relapse or surgery (11/12) had decreased pulsatility index during initial remission (-20%). The positive predictive value of this index for maintenance of remission was 0.82. CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial flow measurements in the superior mesenteric artery are closely related to clinical but not endoscopic disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease. The repeated measurement of the postprandial pulsatility index allows estimation of the risk of recurrence.},

   abstract = {The BB rat spontaneously develops autoimmune diabetes. Feeding these animals a hydrolyzed casein diet significantly reduces the incidence of this disease, suggesting that a dietary antigen is involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. In other syndromes associated with luminal antigens, including celiac and Crohn's disease, increased intestinal permeability has been suggested to play an etiological role. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether increased permeability was also present in BB rats before disease development. By measuring gastrointestinal permeability, in animals on a regular or hydrolyzed casein diet, we were able to demonstrate that increased gastric and small intestinal permeability appeared before the development of both insulitis and clinical diabetes. Although hydrolysis of dietary protein significantly reduced the incidence of diabetes, it did not alter the small intestinal permeability abnormality, suggesting that this is an early event. Increased permeability appears to have an early role in the genesis of several immunological diseases and may represent a common event in these diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although malnutrition is frequently observed in Crohn disease (CD), its cause is not clear. Regulation of energy metabolism and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) have not been adequately studied in CD. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study DIT and substrate oxidation in patients with inactive ileal CD. DESIGN: After a test meal providing 50.2 kJ/kg body wt, DIT was assessed by indirect calorimetry performed over 360 min in 18 CD patients and 12 healthy volunteers matched for age, sex, weight, and height. Body composition was evaluated with the labeled-water-bolus injection technique. RESULTS: Fat-free mass did not differ significantly between groups, but CD patients had markedly lower fat mass than control subjects (13.8+/-5.63 compared with 19.0+/-3.49 kg; P < 0.001). Nonprotein respiratory quotient was lower in CD patients than control subjects (0.80+/-0.04 compared with 0.86+/-0.03; P < 0.001). Average respiratory quotient between 75 and 150 min after the test meal was 0.85+/-0.03 in CD patients and 0.91+/-0.02 in control subjects (P < 0.001). Lipid oxidation rate was higher in CD patients than in control subjects (2.26+/-1.13 compared with 1.50+/-0.75 kJ/min; P < 0.05). DIT was higher in CD patients than in control subjects (9.89+/-1.93% compared with 5.67+/-0.91% of energy intake; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inactive ileal CD had significantly higher DIT and lipid oxidation rate than do healthy volunteers. These results may explain why CD patients have difficulty maintaining adequate nutritional status, and the findings also suggest that a diet relatively rich in fat may attain better energy balance.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic intra-abdominal hand-sewn anastomosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven patients (four males and three females, mean age 48 years) were included. There were two ileocolic resections for recurrence of Crohn's disease, two right colectomies (one for Crohn's disease and one for carcinoid tumor of the appendix), two left colectomies for diverticulitis and one segmental colectomy for sigmoid volvulus. There were: four side-to-side anastomoses, two side-to-end anastomoses and one end-to-end anastomosis. Anastomoses were fashioned with interrupted single layer sutures in four cases (two ileo-colic and two colorectal anastomoses) and with single layer running sutures in three cases (two ileo-colic and one colo-colic anastomoses). The specimens were retrieved by means of a plastic bag through a 3 to 5 cm long minilaparotomy in five cases and through the rectum in two cases. RESULTS: Mean additional time to perform hand-sewn intra-corporeal anastomosis was 90 +/- 15 min. There was no operative mortality and no intraoperative complications. Postoperative course was uneventful in six patients. Patients were started on an oral fluid diet on day 2 and discharged on day 5, except for one patient with Crohn's disease who had a severe anastomotic bleeding on postoperative day 2 and who required laparotomy for hemostasis through a service colotomy with a single suture. He was discharged on day 8. CONCLUSION: Intra-abdominal hand-sewn anastomoses are feasible and seem reliable. This represents a new step making laparoscopic procedures even closer to conventional techniques. This technique must be evaluated in larger series.},

   abstract = {Short bowel syndrome most commonly results after bowel resections for Crohn's disease. The normal human small intestinal length ranges from about 3 to 8 m, thus if the initial small intestinal length is short, a relatively small resection of the intestine may result in the problems of a short bowel. Two types of patient with a short bowel are encountered in clinical practice: those with their jejunum anastomosed to a functioning colon, and those with a jejunostomy. Both types of patient have problems absorbing adequate macronutrients, and both need long-term vitamin B12 therapy. Patients with a jejunostomy also have major problems with large stomal losses of water, sodium, and magnesium. This high-volume jejunostomy output is treated by restricting oral fluids, giving a glucose-saline solution to drink, and using drugs that either reduce gastrointestinal motility (loperamide or codeine phosphate) or secretions (H2 antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, or octreotide). Patients whose jejunal length is less than 100 cm, and whose stomal output is greater than their oral intake, benefit most from antisecretory drugs. In patients with a retained colon, bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrate in the colon results in energy being salvaged. However, they have increased oxalate absorption and a 25% chance of developing calcium oxalate renal stones. Thus patients with a colon are advised to eat a high-energy diet rich in carbohydrate but low in oxalate. Patients with a jejunostomy need a high-energy iso-osmolar diet with added salt. Both patient types have a 45% prevalence of gallstones. With current therapy most patients with a short bowel have a normal body mass index and a good quality of life.},

We determined serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) ASCA was measured by using an ELISA in serum samples from 19 patients with ulcerative colitis, 18 patients with Crohn's disease and 7 healthy controls. The ASCA level was significantly higher in patients with ulcerative colitis and patients with Crohn's disease than in controls, and was significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease compared with patients with ulcerative colitis. Age, gender, disease activity, extent of disease and small bowel involvement each did not affect ASCA levels. The use of elemental or polymeric diet therapy for Crohn's disease and administration of corticosteroids to patients with inflammatory bowel disease also did not affect ASCA levels. The ASCA titer was significantly lower in patients with Crohn's disease taking mesalazine than in those not taking it, although, serum IgG levels did not differ between these two groups, which might imply a suppression of IgG production by mesalazine at the intestinal level. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of increased serum ASCA titers in patients with inflammatory bowel disease suggests that Saccharomyces cerevisiae may play a role in the pathophysiology of this condition.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Educating patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) about their disorder may promote a strong physician-patient interaction, is a recommended approach for treating mild IBS and may reduce healthcare use. Our aim was to identify the information needs, levels and associated factors in IBS, and to contrast this with patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). DESIGN: Seventy adult IBS patients (Rome criteria) were prospectively recruited, together with 82 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 60 Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Demographic data, clinical data, and anxiety and depression scores (HAD scale) were recorded. Patients rated their perceived levels of disease knowledge and satisfaction with their knowledge level on visual analogue scales. Qualitative data on disease information needs were obtained by an open-ended question. SETTING: Gastroenterology out-patient clinic. RESULTS: The majority of IBS patients (77%; n = 54) and over half of IBD patients (56%; n = 79) required further information about their disease. The primary issues for IBS patients were bowel cancer risk and diet. Queries about medications ranked top for UC, while prognosis and cancer risk jointly ranked top for CD. In the IBS group, 27% rated their knowledge as < 25 out of 100 compared to 10% of IBD patients. The perceived level of knowledge in IBS was significantly negatively associated with length of hospital consulting (r(s) = -0.32; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Most IBS patients feel insufficiently informed, particularly in relation to risk of serious disease and role of diet. Educating IBS patients about their disorder may play a role in reducing healthcare use.},

   abstract = {In our ongoing studies on the chemoprevention of cancer we have a particular interest in the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, of which olive oil is a major component. Recent studies have shown that extravirgin olive oil contains an abundance of phenolic antioxidants including simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol), aldehydic secoiridoids, flavonoids and lignans (acetoxypinoresinol, pinoresinol). All of these phenolic substances are potent inhibitors of reactive oxygen species attack on, e.g. salicylic acid, 2-deoxyguanosine. Currently there is growing evidence that reactive oxygen species are involved in the aetiology of fat-related neoplasms such as cancer of the breast and colorectum. A plausible mechanism is a high intake of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are especially prone to lipid peroxidation initiated and propagated by reactive oxygen species, leading to the formation (via alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes such as trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) of highly pro-mutagenic exocyclic DNA adducts. Previous studies have shown that the colonic mucosa of cancer patients and those suffering from predisposing inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease generates appreciably higher quantities of reactive oxygen species compared with normal tissue. We have extended these studies by developing accurate high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods for the quantitation of reactive oxygen species generated by the faecal matrix. The data shows that the faecal matrix supports the generation of reactive oxygen species in abundance. As yet, there is a dearth of evidence linking this capacity to actual components of the diet which may influence the colorectal milieu. However, using the newly developed methodology we can demonstrate that the antioxidant phenolic compounds present in olive oil are potent inhibitors of free radical generation by the faecal matrix. This indicates that the study of the inter-relation between reactive oxygen species and dietary antioxidants is an area of great promise for elucidating mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis and possible future chemopreventive strategies.},

   abstract = {Ileal-pouch anal anastomosis is sometimes performed inappropriately in Crohn's disease patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term results in this subset. In 54 ileal-pouch anal anastomoses performed between 1985 and 1997 for CUD the patient was eventually diagnosed as having Crohn's disease in seven cases. A retrospective review was performed. Definitive diagnosis was established on histopathology, endoscopy, and clinical presentation. The principal outcome factors were pouch failure, reason for failure, and functional results in cases of retained pouch. Patients ranked their quality of life between 1 and 10. We found three failures due to pelvic abscess, anoperineal disease, and anovulvar fistula. The pouch was excised in the latter patient; four patients retained their pouch. Functional results were good in the four (7 year follow-up): 7.25 bowel movements per day, ability to discriminate flatus from feces in three, soiling in one, urgency in one, perianal pad in one, ability to differ bowel movement for 66 min, diet, and antidiarrheal medication all four, pouchitis in one, sexual troubles in one woman, no urinary or obstetric trouble. Quality of life was judged satisfactory by six of the seven patients. Our 13% rate of inadvertent ileal-pouch anal anastomosis is higher than results usually reported. This difference is explained by the diagnostic criteria, whose validity is controversial. Three-stage surgery to decrease inadvertent restorative coloproctectomy is worth considering. Even if results are good when the pouch is functioning, Crohn's disease remains a contraindication to ileal-pouch anal anastomosis because of its high rate of failure and excision.},

   abstract = {Various specific and non-specific environmental factors have been associated with the induction and/or exacerbation of disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. One such factor is the potential role of ingested ultrafine particles. In fact, based on a Western diet, recent data suggest that more than 10(12)ultrafine particles are ingested per person every day. These microparticles have been considered inert although they adsorb endogenous constituents of the intestinal lumen and are taken up by human intestinal lymphoid aggregates. Based on these observations, we determined whether one such dietary microparticle, titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), alters intestinal cell responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using colonic biopsy specimens from 28 patients with ulcerative colitis, 21 with Crohn's disease, and 36 healthy controls. These samples, as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells when available, were incubated alone (control), or with either (a) LPS (1-2,000 ng/ml), (b) TiO(2)(5 microg/ml) or (c) LPS (1 ng/ml) adsorbed to TiO(2)(5 microg/ml). In each case, the levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1) produced in these assays were quantitated by bioassay and by ELISA. Interestingly, there was dramatic stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells using the TiO(2)-LPS conjugate, with values 30-60-fold above controls and only minor stimulation with LPS or TiO(2)alone. In intestinal organ cultures there was no increase in IL-1 secretion when challenged with TiO(2)alone or with up to 2,000 ng/ml LPS. However, the TiO(2)-LPS conjugate produced a two-to-three-fold, significant increase in the intestinal secretion of IL-1. Our data demonstrate that ultrafine dietary particles are not immunologically inert and may be important adjuncts in overcoming normal gut cell hyporesponsiveness to endogenous luminal molecules. This may be particularly relevant to patients with inflammatory bowel disease where there is abnormal intestinal permeability.},

   abstract = {Human milk lipids contain preformed LCPUFA in considerable amounts, which serve as precursors for the formation of prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and other lipid mediators, as well as essential components in membrane-rich tissues (such as the brain and the retina), thus affecting functional outcomes. Besides a balanced nutrient composition and a number of conditionally essential nutrients, human milk provides different types and classes of bioactive factors, such as enzymes, hormones, and growth factors, many of which appear to have a role in supporting infantile growth and development. The bioactive agents include antimicrobial factors (e.g., secretory IgA, oligosaccharides, FA); anti-inflammatory agents; transporters (e.g., lactoferrin); and digestive enzymes (e.g., BSSL). Several nonpeptide hormones (thyroid hormones, cortisol, progesterone, pregnanediol, estrogens, and artificial contraceptive) and peptide hormones and growth factors (erythropoietin, hHG, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, epidermal growth factor insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, nerve growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, gastrointestinal regulatory peptides and thyroid-parathyroid hormones) have been isolated and quantitated in human milk. Some of these components are also involved in the maturation of the gastrointestinal tract of the infant. In addition to the passive benefits provided by human milk, several data support the hypothesis that breastfeeding promotes the development of the infant's own immune system, which might confer long-term benefits for the newborn infant. The risk of IDDM, Crohn's disease, and atopic disease is lower in individuals who had been breastfed during infancy. Areas of major interest in human milk research include the study of human milk synthesis and the contributions of dietary composition and maternal metabolism to human milk composition, infantile utilization of human milk components, and the study of bioactive components, such as oligosaccharides, proteins and peptides, and lipids and their in vivo fate and biologic effects in the recipient infant.},

The patient had come to hospital with nausea, vomiting, fever and liquid, explosive diarrhoea without pathologic products. There was no clinical remission with astringent diet, hydroelectrolitic reposition and antidiarrheic opiates. The patient was admitted in hospital when he had blood in the diarrhoea. This progressed to a toxic megacolon in three days and the patient had to be operated on urgently. The surgeons found perforations in the colon and the pathologists diagnosed Crohn disease. Even without previous E.B.D. history we reached the diagnosis from the clinical and analytical data and the plain abdominal radiology. It was impossible to confirm the diagnosis with a colonoscopy because of the high risk of perforation. In cases like this, early surgery may save the life of the patient.},

   abstract = {Among the 127 patients who underwent surgical treatment for Crohn's disease at Tohoku University Hospital, urinary complications were noted in 13 patients (10.2%), including urolithiasis in 6 patients (4.7%), a ureteral obstruction in 4 (3.1%), and urinary fistula in 3 (2.4%). In patients with urolithiasis, conservative therapy was effective. An ureteral obstruction was detected on the right side in all 4 of these cases because of the inflamed terminal ileum. In 2 of the 4 cases, the symptoms improved by either preoperative total parenteral nutrition or elemental diet therapy. A resection of the inflamed intestine was necessary in all cases. In patients with urinary fistulas, a resection of the inflamed intestine combined with a reconstruction of the urinary tract was carried out after total parenteral nutrition. In conclusion, conservative therapy with preoperative total parenteral nutrition or elemental diet therapy proved to be effective for a ureteral obstruction since it improved the intestinal inflammation. As a definitive treatment, surgery is still necessary for the management of urinary fistulas and ureteral obstruction. Based on our findings, patients with urolithiasis in Crohn's disease should thus be treated conservatively in the same way as patients without Crohn's disease.},

Puberty is also frequently delayed. Over 50% of patients may have a subnormal height velocity, and approximately 25% will have short stature. The endocrine status is characterized by normal growth hormone secretion and a slightly subnormal serum level of insulin-like growth factor I, which is related to nutritional status. Principal therapeutic options are intestinal resection for localized disease, and enteral nutrition--using a polymeric diet--for more widespread disease, particularly involving the small intestine. Growth responses to both modalities are often excellent and produce considerable psychological benefit. Optimum therapy is achieved by close collaboration between gastroenterologists and endocrinologists, and by the use of auxological methods to document pre- and post-therapeutic management.},

The terms EC and MEED were both used to describe a disease in horses characterized by infiltration of intestine and extraintestinal tissues with eosinophils. We use EC to describe IBD characterized by only intestinal infiltration by eosinophils. Horses with GE, MEED, or LPE are usually examined because of weight loss and depression, but horses with EC are usually examined because of signs of abdominal pain. Typically, horses with IBD have low concentrations of serumal proteins, especially albumin, and fail to adequately absorb glucose or xylose. Antemortem diagnosis of IBD can only be made by histologic examination of affected intestine. In some cases, antemortem diagnosis is made from histologic examination of rectal mucosa obtained by biopsy. Suspected causes of IBD in the horse include abnormal immune response to bacterial, viral, parasitic, or dietary antigens. Most horses with IBD do not survive, but horses with EC are more likely than those with LPE, MEED, or GE to respond to treatment. Successful treatments of horses with IBD include resection of grossly affected intestine and administration of corticosteroids.},

Twenty-two patients with severely and moderately active ulcerative colitis (8 severe and 14 moderate) and 12 patients with Crohn's colitis were analyzed retrospectively. Eleven of 22 patients with ulcerative colitis were treated with TPN and corticosteroids (TPN group). The remaining 11 patients were treated with corticosteroids alone and hospital meals (oral diet group). Both groups were matched regarding disease severity at pretreatment. The clinical characteristics, and the initial and total dosages of corticosteroids for 3 weeks were similar between the two groups. The authors compared the changes in the clinical, inflammatory, and nutritional parameters and short-term outcome between the TPN and the oral diet groups with ulcerative colitis. The same evaluations were also made for 12 patients with Crohn's colitis who received TPN (CD group). The TPN group did not show any significant improvement in the clinical parameter, inflammatory signs, or nutritional state compared with the oral diet group with ulcerative colitis. The remission rate after 3 weeks of therapy and a colectomy rate also showed no significant difference between the two groups. In contrast, TPN resulted in a disappearance of clinical symptoms and an improvement in both the inflammatory and nutritional parameters in the CD group. Only one of the 12 patients with Crohn's colitis underwent colectomy. TPN induced no additional benefit in corticosteroid therapy in an acute attack of ulcerative colitis. In contrast, TPN may have primary effects on Crohn's colitis.},

   abstract = {Most conventional forms of drug therapy suppress or modify the host immunoinflammatory response and neglect the other contributor to disease pathogenesis-the environmental microflora. Probiotics are live microbial food ingredients that alter the enteric microflora and have a beneficial effect on health. The rationale for using probiotics in IBD is mainly based on evidence from human studies and experimental animal models implicating intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The relationship between bacteria and intestinal inflammation is complex and does not appear to reflect a simple cause and effect. Similarly, the field of probiotics is complex and in need of rigorous research. Until the indigenous flora are better characterized and mechanisms of probiotic action defined, the promise of probiotics in IBD is unlikely to be fulfilled. Because of strain-specific variability and clinical and therapeutic heterogeneity within Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, it cannot be assumed that a given probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Although preliminary results of probiotic therapy in animal models and humans with ulcerative colitis and pouchitis have been encouraging, their efficacy in treatment or maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease remains to be clarified. However, the circumstantial evidence for some form of biotherapeutic modification of the enteric flora in Crohn's disease seems compelling. In the future, probiotics may offer a simple adjunct to conventional therapy with the emphasis on diet shifting from one of nutritional replenishment alone to a more functional role.},

   abstract = {Human beings evolved consuming a diet that contained about equal amounts of n-3 and n-6 essential fatty acids. Over the past 100-150 y there has been an enormous increase in the consumption of n-6 fatty acids due to the increased intake of vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseed, and soybeans. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids ranges from approximately 20-30:1 instead of the traditional range of 1-2:1. Studies indicate that a high intake of n-6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction and decreases in bleeding time. n-3 Fatty acids, however, have antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. These beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids have been shown in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and, in some patients with renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most of the studies were carried out with fish oils [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. However, alpha-linolenic acid, found in green leafy vegetables, flaxseed, rapeseed, and walnuts, desaturates and elongates in the human body to EPA and DHA and by itself may have beneficial effects in health and in the control of chronic diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel. In a preliminary study, we evaluated whether the administration of growth hormone (somatropin) as well as a high-protein diet would ameliorate the symptoms of the disease. METHODS: We randomly assigned 37 adults with moderate-to-severe active Crohn's disease to four months of self-administered injections of growth hormone (loading dose, 5 mg per day subcutaneously for one week, followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg per day) or placebo. We instructed all patients to increase their protein intake to at least 2 g per kilogram of body weight per day. Patients continued to be treated by their usual physicians and to receive other medications for Crohn's disease. The primary end point was the change in scores on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index from base line to month 4. Scores can range from 0 to 600, with higher scores indicating more disease activity. RESULTS: At base line, the mean (+/-SD) score on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index was somewhat higher among the 19 patients in the growth hormone group than among the 18 patients in the placebo group (287+/-134 vs. 213+/-120, P=0.09). Three patients in the placebo group withdrew before their first follow-up visit and were not included in the data analysis. At four months, the Crohn's Disease Activity Index score had decreased by a mean of 143+/-144 points in the growth hormone group, as compared with a decrease of 19+/-63 points in the placebo group (P=0.004). Side effects in the growth hormone group included edema (in 10 patients) and headache (in 5) and usually resolved within the first month of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary study suggests that growth hormone may be a beneficial treatment for patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {CD and UC represent a spectrum of chronic IBD that present in protean ways and are accompanied by a variety of systemic sequelae. Sulfasalazine and the newer 5-aminosalicylates are important in the management of mild-to-moderate disease, whereas corticosteroids remain the primary therapy for most patients with moderate-to-severe disease (Tables 2-5). The toxicities associated with long-term steroid therapy, combined with their ineffectiveness as maintenance medications, have led to increased use of immunomodulators, such as azathioprine and 6-MP, for the treatment of steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant IBD. Infliximab is a novel therapeutic adjunct for chronically active and fistulizing CD that will herald a new era of biologic therapy for IBD. Meanwhile, CSA remains an alternative to urgent colectomy in severe UC unresponsive to corticosteroids and also for CD patients with severe disease or refractory fistulas. Finally, continued insights into the etiopathogenic pathways in IBD will provide evolving and innovative approaches until the eventual causes and cures are elucidated. In the meantime, clinicians should remain optimistic regarding current ability to reduce the morbidity and maintain the quality of life for patients suffering with these frustrating diseases.},

To answer questions about the effects on ONS on body weight and structure, spontaneous food intake and body function, a critical systematic review was undertaken (Stratton & Elia, 1999a). Eighty-four trials were reviewed (forty-five randomized, thirty-nine non-randomized: 2,570 patients; diagnoses including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome and cancer). Most studies (83 %) were conducted in patients living at home. The supplements were typically mixed macronutrients in liquid form, providing < 0.42-10.5 MJ/d for 1 week-2 years. The studies reviewed in patients with predominantly chronic conditions living in the community suggested that: (1) ONS produce demonstrable clinical (including functional) benefits, but the nature and extent of these benefits varies with the underlying chronic condition; (2) ONS increase total energy intake with > 50 % of the energy from ONS typically additional to that from habitual food intake; (3) improvements in body weight, total energy intake and body function following ONS appear to occur more frequently in individuals with a BMI < 20 kg/m2 than in those with a BMI > 20 kg/m2.},

The purpose of this study was to verify whether concentrations of eosinophilic cationic protein in gut lavage fluid from children with inflammatory bowel disease correlate with clinical and laboratory indexes of disease activity. METHODS: Twenty-three children with Crohn's disease, 14 with ulcerative colitis, and 22 age-matched control subjects entered the study. Radioimmunoassay and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques were used to measure eosinophilic cationic protein, total immunoglobulin G and interleukin-1beta, respectively. RESULTS: Gut lavage eosinophilic cationic protein levels were significantly (p < 0.005) higher in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in control subjects. Intestinal eosinophilic cationic protein levels decreased in three of four children with Crohn's disease who were fed an elemental diet. There was a significant (p < 0.001) correlation between eosinophilic cationic protein concentrations and immunoglobulin G and interleukin-1beta levels in gut lavage fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated intestinal eosinophilic cationic protein levels in inflammatory bowel disease suggest that eosinophils are involved in the gastrointestinal inflammation in this disease. Intestinal eosinophilic cationic protein concentration is another marker with which to discriminate between active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease.},

We therefore investigated a trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) ileitis model. Dietary fat in Crohn's disease is still a controversial risk factor for IBD. We therefore also studied the effects of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and long-chain triglycerides (LCT) on TNBS ileitis. METHODS AND RESULTS: An intraileal injection of TNBS induced ulceration and inflammation with thickening of the intestinal wall, which were characterized histologically by infiltration of polymorphic nuclear leucocytes and by granuloma formation. The mucosal damage score and serum sialic acid levels reached their highest 7 days after the TNBS injection and then gradually decreased. The mucosal damage series in the MCT group was significantly lower than in the LCT group, and levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) tended to be lower in the MCT group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that TNBS enteritis might be useful as an IBD animal model and that MCT modulates intestinal inflammation and is less damaging than LCT.},

However, a decrease in ED compliance with long-term use is becoming problem. We developed an n-3 fatty acid-rich diet and carried out nutritional education specifically for Crohn's disease patients using HEN to facilitate compliance and to improve their nutritional status. After the introduction of this n-3 rich diet, disease activity was not altered, and nutritional status, especially serum n-3 fatty acid levels, improved. The remission periods in patients with poor compliance seemed to be prolonged by the nutritional education. Thus, a n-3 rich diet in combination with nutritional education specific for Crohn's disease patients is very important for the in maintenance of high compliance and for maintaining nutritional balance.},

   abstract = {Short-bowel syndrome is functionally defined as a state of malabsorption following loss of small bowel. Most cases occur in the neonatal period after extensive resection for necrotizing enterocolitis, or due to congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract. A smaller percentage originate later in life from surgical treatment of Crohn's disease, neoplastic disorders, or vascular events. The physiological, morphological and functional intestinal gradient determines the clinical picture leading to better tolerance of jejunal than ileal resections. The subsequent adaptation process requires enteral feeding with a different impact of specific nutrients, and is also influenced by a number of humoral mediators such as enteroglucagon, gastrin, growth factors, prostaglandins and polyamines. Nutritional management starts parenterally via a central venous line covering basic demands, substituting current losses and restoring pre-existing deficiencies. Continuous enteral tube feeding is added as soon as postoperative ileus resolves, beginning with an elemental diet, which is gradually increased first in concentration, then in quantity, and supplemented by small oral meals. Cycling of parenteral nutrition is the next step. As soon as sufficient stability is reached, the child should be discharged home under continued outpatient care. Main long-term problems comprise bacterial overgrowth, fluid and electrolyte disequilibration, nutritional deficiencies, parenteral nutrition-related liver disease, and central venous line complications such as sepsis and thrombosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Enteral feeding is now an established primary therapy for active Crohn's disease. This first-double blind randomized trial was designed to compare the therapeutic efficacy of a polymeric diet (PD) with an elemental diet (ED). METHODS: Patients with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's disease activity index [CDAI] > 150, increased bowel uptake of Tc-HMPAO-labeled leukocytes, and abnormal C-reactive protein [CRP]), were randomized to receive either an ED or a PD. The two preparations were identical except for the nitrogen source, which was amino acid based in ED and intact protein in PD. Enteral feeding was considered successful if clinical remission was achieved as defined by a final CDAI of < or = 150, a reduction in the CDAI by at least 100 points from baseline level, and a normal CRP. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled of whom 11 were randomized to PD and 10 to ED. The two groups were comparable at entry. Clinical remission was obtained in eight (80%) patients receiving ED and six (55%) patients receiving PD, p = 0.1. The treatment failed in three and two patients in the PD and ED groups, respectively. Another two patients were intolerant to the feed (PD). Reduction in the CDAI after treatment with ED (359 +/- 67 to 112 +/- 19) was similar to that seen with PD (303 +/- 27 to 97 +/- 11). Similar changes in the CRP were also observed (16 +/- 5 to 4 +/- 1.6) and (62 +/- 20 to 9 +/- 6), respectively. Overall, enteral feeding was successful in 14 patients (63%). CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutrition is effective in treatment of active Crohn's disease. Differences in nitrogen sources of enteral feeds are not relevant to their therapeutic efficacy, as polymeric and elemental diets are equally effective.},

However, the role of supplementing normal food with elemental diet in the long-term management of Crohn's disease has hitherto not been explored. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of 39 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease in clinical remission were studied. Of these, 21 patients (Group 1) received oral nutritional supplementation, taken in addition to their normal diet. Their outcome (relapse rate, Crohn's disease activity index, inflammatory markers) was compared with that of 18 patients (Group 2), who were maintained on a normal unrestricted diet over an observation period of 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (81%) tolerated the nutritional supplementation. On an intention-to-treat basis, 10 patients (48%) remained in remission for 12 months, compared to 4/18 (22%) patients in Group 2, p<0.0003. Their Crohn's disease activity index and CRP remained stable while their weight and body mass index improved during the period of nutrition therapy Seven patients in Group 1 and 14 in Group 2 relapsed at a mean of 7.4+/-0.9 and 6.2+/-0.4 months, respectively. The response to nutrition supplement was independent of age, sex, disease duration or location. Four patients (19%) were intolerant to enteral feeding. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional supplementation is safe, well tolerated and effective in the long-term management of patients with quiescent Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Till about 3 decades ago, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was considered as non-existent in our country. However, since that time several reports of IBD, mainly ulcerative colitis have been published. More recently, Crohn's disease is also being reported from the country. This trend of UC appearing first in a population followed by CD also appears to be true in other developing nations. A substantial increase in the rates of CD over UC in the last few decades is reported from developed nations as well. Of the other epidemiological factors, an increased risk of CD and lower risk of UC in smokers is established in adults. However, it appears that smoking increases the risk of IBD in children. The etiology of IBD remains elusive. Within the triad of genetics, immunity and antigen responsible for the development of IBD, maximum advances have been made in the field of immune aberrations and this is being exploited to treat the disease. It is well established that IBD results from a disordered immune system in the gut, in response to an unidentified antigen in a predisposed individual. The immune response is enhanced and revolves around antigen-presenting cells, CD 4 T-lymphocytes and tumor necrosis factor alpha. CD results from an enhanced Th1 activity. The pathogenesis of UC is less clear but appears to be humoral. Advances in diagnostics include the availability of serology, ultrasound and nuclear scans, none of which have been tried in our setting where infectious diseases and tuberculosis is rampant. Growth failure and the importance of nutrition in IBD, especially CD, cannot be underemphasized. In many situations nutritional interventions have been used solely as a form of therapy for CD. Newer steroid molecules with minimal systemic effects are also being considered. Other treatment options highlighted are the use of immunosuppressive agents, biologic agents and role of surgery.},
