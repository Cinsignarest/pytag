   abstract = {A pathogenic role for high numbers of bacteria in the small intestine had been suggested previously by bacterial counts on luminal aspirates, but these investigations were flawed by the sampling device "contamination" in the mouth and the changing nature of fluent intestinal content. A procedure was developed to sterilize the Watson biopsy capsule with HCl in the upper portion of the duodenum. Bacteria were counted in the mucosal homogenate of the first (diagnostic) duodenojejunal biopsy in 80 untreated celiac children, and in 46 children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in a four-cell, controlled, randomized investigation. Persistence of bacteria on the mucosa for 20 h after the last meal was investigated in 62 subjects, and for 26 h after the last meal in 64 subjects. Bacteria, mainly streptococci and staphylococci, persisted at a concentration of 10(6) per gram of mucosa 20 h after the last meal. The number of bacteria per gram of mucosa was 24 times higher in all 62 children of the 20-h fast groups than in all 64 children of the 26-h fast groups (p < 0.001). The bacteria count in celiac children was 39 times higher in the 20-h fast group than in the 26-h one. This difference was significantly higher than the 11 times difference that was found on the normal mucosa between the 20- and 26-h fast IBS groups (p < 0.001), which was still significant. The number of bacteria on duodenojejunal mucosa depends on nutrient absorption and persists longer than the intermeal interval in these subjects.},

   abstract = {We sought to prospectively characterize and compare the symptoms of children > or = 5 years of age with recurrent abdominal pain to previously established criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults. For all eligible subjects, a detailed questionnaire concerning characteristics of abdominal pain and defecatory pattern was completed at presentation. In addition, a battery of screening tests was performed and additional evaluation was done at the discretion of their physician. In all, 227 subjects fulfilled the entrance criteria, but 56 were subsequently excluded because of diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease (nine cases), lactose malabsorption (46 cases), or celiac disease (one case). Of the remaining 171 patients, 117 had IBS symptoms. In the IBS subjects, lower abdominal discomfort (p < 0.001), cramping pain (p < 0.0009), and increased flatus (p < 0.0003) were more common, whereas dyspeptic symptoms such as epigastric discomfort (p < 0.003), pain radiating to the chest (p < 0.009), and regurgitation (p < 0.02) were more common in the non-IBS subjects. Our study not only confirms the clinical heterogeneity of children with recurrent abdominal pain but also concomitantly demonstrates that most children with this disorder have symptoms that fulfill the standardized criteria for IBS in adults. The identification of subgroups of children with recurrent abdominal pain can provide a framework for the diagnosis of functional bowel disease as well as establish the need for invasive and expensive tests.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although previous studies have shown that psychological disturbances are frequently associated with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the relation was not necessarily cause and effect. The development of chronic bowel symptoms after an episode of acute gastroenteritis has allowed us to examine prospectively the role of psychological factors. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with acute gastroenteritis completed a series of psychometric tests soon after admission to hospital. Of these, 22 had persistent symptoms compatible with IBS after the acute illness, and in 20 of these the symptoms were still present at six months. FINDINGS: At the time of their initial illness, patients who subsequently developed IBS had higher scores for anxiety, depression, somatization and neurotic trait than those who returned to normal bowel function. The psychometric scores had not changed when remeasured after the acute illness. Lactose malabsorption was not an important factor. INTERPRETATION: These results support the hypothesis that psychological factors are important in IBS.},

   abstract = {Chronic diarrhea, defined by frequent bowel movements with decreased stool consistency lasting for longer than 3 weeks represents a major problem in gastroenterology. In addition to the very frequent functional disturbances of irritable bowel syndrome a wide variety of infectious, drug-induced, alimentary, metabolic, hormonal and organic causes requires a thorough evaluation of this symptom. To reach diagnosis an algorithm applying a wide array of diagnostic procedures based on the results of thorough anamnesis, physical examination and stool visit should be followed. In addition to alleviation of symptoms, reconstitution and prevention of nutrional deficits (volume, electrolytes, trace elements, vitamines, calories) therapeutic approaches should eliminate underlying causes whenever possible. Symptomatic relief is provided by substances inhibiting secretion and motility as the opiatagonist Loperamid or anticholinergics. Substitution of vitamins, trace elements, calories, enzymes or bile salts should be adapted to the individual needs. Elimination of a cause of chronic diarrhea is generally provided be anti-infectious therapy, other causes however (e.g. sprue by the elimination of gliadin from diet) may be treated effectively as well.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which affects up to 25% of the population in western countries and accounts for up to 50% of referrals to gastroenterologist, remains mainly a diagnosis of exclusion. We have studied, for the first time, prolonged ambulatory motility recordings from the oesophagus, small intestine and colon of a patient who was referred to us with a 12-year history of abdominal pain and a presumptive diagnosis of IBS. The results indicated that the diagnosis was pseudo-obstruction syndrome rather than IBS. Wider clinical use of the new techniques of prolonged ambulatory intestinal motility monitoring in IBS would offer considerable potential not only in achieving a greater understanding of its pathophysiology but also in providing a more precise definition of clinical and therapeutic subgroups.},

   abstract = {Colonic bacterial production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) plays an important role in the salvage of unabsorbed carbohydrate and in colonic absorption of electrolytes and water. The objective of this study was to determine whether patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (DP-IBS) have a different pattern and rate of fermentation of carbohydrate and fiber to SCFA compared with controls. Fecal homogenates from 10 patients with DP-IBS and 10 age-matched controls were studied. SCFA were measured by gas chromatography in baseline fecal samples and in fecal homogenates in an in vitro anaerobic fermentation system after incubation with no additional substrate, lactulose, potato starch, citrus pectin, and hemicellulose over a 24-hour period. Net SCFA production rates were calculated for the first 6 h of the incubation period. Patients with DP-IBS had a consistently different pattern of less total SCFA, a lower percentage of acetate (p < 0.05), and a higher proportion of n-butyrate (p < 0.05) than controls. In stool homogenates from both controls and DP-IBS patients, lactulose fermentation resulted in the highest rate of SCFA production followed by pectin, starch, and hemicellulose. However, at all time points, the fecal homogenates from controls generated a higher concentration of total SCFA, acetate, and propionate with all substrates tested. SCFA production rates were higher in controls incubated with lactulose, starch, and hemicellulose. The fecal SCFA profile of patients with DP-IBS is characterized by lower concentrations of total SCFA, acetate, and propionate and a higher concentration and percentage of n-butyrate. Fecal flora from these patients produced less SCFA in an in vitro fermentation system in response to incubations with various carbohydrates and fibers. Differences in SCFA production by colonic bacterial flora in patients with DP-IBS may be related to the development of gastrointestinal symptoms.},
