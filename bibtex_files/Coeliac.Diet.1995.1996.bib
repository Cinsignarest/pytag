METHODS: A case report is presented of a 39-year-old man with mild hypocalcemia, diarrhea, and arthralgias, and the appropriate clinical and laboratory assessment for these complaints is outlined. RESULTS: Secondary hyperparathyroidism, celiac sprue, and extensive osteonecrosis were detected by hematologic and radiologic studies. The hematologic variables normalized after institution of a gluten-free diet and calcium supplementation. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of celiac sprue and osteonecrosis in one patient. A possible causal relationship due to secondary hyperparathyroidism is suggested, and alternative explanations are discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current knowledge on splanchnic haemodynamics in coeliac disease is limited and incomplete. AIM: To evaluate splanchnic arterial and venous blood flow in coeliac disease. METHODS: In 22 coeliac (13 untreated, nine treated) patients and in nine healthy subjects the following variables were assessed: vessel diameter and mean flow velocity in portal vein, splenic vein, superior mesenteric vein, and superior mesenteric artery. Peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity and pulsatility index were also determined in the superior mesenteric artery. Five patients of the untreated group were re-evaluated after nine months on a gluten free diet. RESULTS: Significant differences in haemodynamic variables between the three groups were shown only in the superior mesenteric artery. An increase in both mean flow velocity and end diastolic velocity and a reduction in pulsatility index occurred in untreated patients compared with treated patients (p < 0.002; p < 0.04; p < 0.035) and with healthy controls (p < 0.001; p < 0.025; p < 0.0003). Similar results were obtained for the five patients evaluated before and after treatment (p < 0.03; p < 0.02; p < 0.03), in whom the mean flow velocity in the superior mesenteric vein also decreased after treatment (p < 0.05). No significant differences were noted between treated coeliac patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: In untreated coeliac disease there is a hyperdynamic mesenteric circulation that decreases after treatment.},

At diagnosis, 67 patients (42%) had raised aspartate and/or alanine transaminase levels (AST and ALT; mean, 47 IU/L, range, 30 to 190; and 61 IU/L, range, 25 to 470, respectively), whereas 91 patients had normal liver function tests (LFT). Patients with and without hypertransaminasemia were comparable for epidemiological data, body mass index (18.5 vs. 19.6), and severity of intestinal histological involvement. All patients were given a strict GFD and were followed for 1 to 10 years (median, 4). At 1 year, a highly significant improvement in intestinal histology was observed in both groups (P < .0001). In the 67 patients with raised transaminase levels body mass index (BMI) also increased significantly (from 18.5 to 21.0, P < .001), and transaminase levels normalized in 60 (95%). In the other seven cases liver biopsy showed fatty infiltration in two and chronic active hepatitis (CAH) in the other five, related to chronic infection with hepatitis B virus in three and hepatitis C virus in one, and to autoimmune type in the fifth. We conclude that in adult celiac patients elevated serum transaminases are a frequent finding and normalize in most cases after GFD. When they persist, liver biopsy is mandatory to further investigate hepatic involvement, which is our series was mainly attributable to CAH.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease, or nontropical sprue, is a cause of mucosal malabsorption. A decreased number of jejunal folds and an increased number of ileal folds (jejunoileal fold pattern reversal) found at small-bowel follow-through have been reported for patients with celiac disease. We asked three questions regarding jejunoileal fold pattern reversal found at small-bowel follow-through in patients with celiac disease. (1) How often is it present, either partially or completely? (2) How often is it associated with other findings of malabsorption? (3) How reliably can it be distinguished from the normal pattern? MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight small-bowel follow-through examinations performed on 25 adult patients with celiac disease (confirmed by characteristic small-bowel biopsy and clinical response to a gluten-free diet) were reviewed retrospectively by two authors, who agreed by consensus on partial or complete jejunoileal fold pattern reversal and on other findings of malabsorption. Two methods were used to control for retrospective bias. (1) The prospective and retrospective readings of fold pattern reversal were compared for agreement. (2) The author who had not participated in the retrospective review was asked to distinguish, on the basis of the presence or absence of fold pattern reversal, 24 cases of celiac disease (all of which showed partial or complete fold pattern reversal on retrospective review) from 25 normal control cases (patients with diarrhea) (conformed by normal small-bowel biopsy). RESULTS: Partial or complete jejunoileal fold pattern reversal was identified retrospectively in 24 of the 28 small-bowel examinations (86%) performed on patients with celiac disease. One-half lacked other findings of malabsorption. The prospective and retrospective readings of fold pattern reversal agreed in 21 of the 28 examinations (75%). Forty-four of 49 examinations (90%) were correctly identified by the third author on the basis of fold pattern reversal. CONCLUSION: In patients with celiac disease, partial or complete jejunoileal fold pattern reversal discovered at small-bowel follow-through is common, is often not associated with other findings of malabsorption, and can be reliably distinguished from the normal pattern. Identification of jejunoileal fold pattern reversal found at small-bowel follow-through should prompt an appropriate clinical evaluation for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines are raised in the small intestine of patients with coeliac disease after ingestion of gluten but there are equivalent data on interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) producing cells. These cytokines are known to exert important regulatory effects on pro-inflammatory cytokine production from lymphocytes and macrophages. AIMS: To investigate whether there is a primary deficiency of IL-4 and IL-10 producing cells and their site of production in the small intestine of patients with coeliac disease in relation to the changes in inflammatory cell infiltrate. PATIENTS: Jejunal biopsy specimens from patients with coeliac disease (11 untreated, 10 treated) and nine disease controls were studied. METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining of sections for IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines and the cell phenotypic markers CD3 (T lymphocytes) and CD45 (total inflammatory cell infiltrate) was carried out using monoclonal antibodies. Expression of IL-4 and IL-10 messenger RNA was detected by in situ hybridisation with oligonucleotide probe cocktails for each cytokine. RESULTS: IL-4 and IL-10 mRNA and protein were detected in the lamina propria of treated and untreated coeliac patients and disease controls but not in the epithelium. A significant increase in the number of CD45 (p < 0.005) and CD3 (p < 0.05) positive cells was found in the lamina propria of patients with untreated coeliac disease compared with treated coeliac patients and disease controls but there were no differences in IL-4 or IL-10 between these groups with either method. CONCLUSIONS: There is no primary deficiency of IL-4 and IL-10 producing cells in the small intestine of patients with coeliac disease. Detectable concentrations of IL-4 and IL-10 were found in control patients which suggests that these cytokines are involved in normal mucosal immunoregulation. The increased number of T lymphocytes but not IL-4 or IL-10 producing cells in the lamina propria of patients with untreated than in those with treated disease suggests not only that the lamina propria is the major mucosal compartment for cytokine production but that newly recruited mucosal T lymphocytes are directed to a predominant Th1 and not a Th2 cytokine response in coeliac patients on a diet containing gluten.},

The Istituto Superiore di Sanita (Italian National Institute of Health) has carried out the analytical control of the composition of infant foods present on the Italian market, and verified the nutritional quality and the presence, if any, of undesirable substances. Since 1980 the research has often required the development of specific and accurate analytical methods for these products. Adapted and follow-up formulas, cereal-based weaning products and those meant for subjects in special physiological conditions (premature, coeliac, allergic) have been analyzed, monitoring their qualitative transformation during the years. The main essential nutrients-proteins, lipids and minerals-have been assayed to evaluate whether the nutritional requirements of infants during the first year of life were satisfied. The protein and lipid composition of infant formulas was compared with that of human milk, and the influence of such feedings on plasma amino acid levels and erythrocyte fatty acids was assessed.},

The result of anti-endomysium antibody (AEA) testing was available from all cases. The testing of 121 sera in different test systems permitted comparison of the range of concentration and sensitivity of the quantitative IgG and IgA anti-gliadin tests. Each test uses its own arbitrary calibration. To permit direct comparison of the different test ranges the values of the different positive reference sera were converted into Pharmacia arbitrary units (AU). The AGA and IgG tests ranged from 0 to a maximum of 157-430 AU and the maximum IgA test results from 81 to 855 AU. This illustrates the need for an internationally accepted standard. All three EIA kits met the performance claims of the manufacturers and were easy to use. Most results agreed with the clinical diagnosis when the sera were positive for anti-endomysium antibodies. However, AEA negative specimens showed a considerable incidence of positive AGA in non-coeliacs. The study emphasises the need to test for both AGA and AEA in order to reliably diagnose coeliac disease. The qualitative test showed a high degree of false positive results and could be used to monitor the dietary compliance of coeliac patients.},

The neurological syndrome was dominated by action and stimulus sensitive myoclonus of cortical origin with mild ataxia and infrequent seizures. Plasmapharesis and immunosuppressive treatment were tried in two patients but were not beneficial. Post-mortem examination of the brain in one case showed selective symmetrical atrophy of the cerebellar hemispheres with Purkinje cell loss and Bergmann astrocytosis, and with preservation of the cerebral hemispheres and brainstem. Coeliac disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients presenting with a progressive myoclonic ataxic syndrome.},

In children with growth hormone deficiency mean (SD) height SD score increased from -4.3 (1.8) to -1.9 (1.4) and in patients with coeliac disease from -1.8 (0.9) to -0.1 (0.8). Height SD score after four years correlated positively with injection frequency and height SD score at start of treatment in children with growth hormone deficiency. All patients with coeliac disease reached a height above -2 SD scores after four years, while the height of 26% of children with growth hormone deficiency on daily injections and of 86% of children on 2 or 4 injections/week was still below -2 SD scores. In patients with growth hormone deficiency on daily injections with an initial height SD score between -2 and -4 catch-up was similar to that of patients with coeliac disease with a comparable initial height deficit. Growth hormone deficient children with an initial height SD score < -4 did not reach full catch-up growth within four years. In conclusion, catch-up growth in early treated children with growth hormone deficiency over four years is adequate provided that daily injections are given and the initial height SD score is not less than -4.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate their diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, and their prevalence in a group of coeliac adults taking a gluten-free diet followed in Ile-de-France. METHODS: One hundred and forty-five sera from 134 patients were examined for IgA and IgG anti-endomysium and anti-reticulin antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence. Sixty-eight patients were confirmed coeliacs; 8 patients with noncoeliac (unresponsive to a gluten-free diet) duodenal villous atrophy and 58 patients with no villous atrophy served as controls. RESULTS: In active coeliac disease, the sensitivity of anti-endomysium and anti-reticulin antibodies was 88% and 50%, respectively. Their specificity was 100%: they were never detected in case of noncoeliac villous atrophy. Under a strict gluten-free diet, their prevalence was 7% and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In the studied population, the diagnosis accuracy of IgA anti-endomysium antibodies confirms their usefulness in screening and follow-up of coeliac disease. The absence of anti-endomysium and anti-reticulin antibodies in those cases with noncoeliac villous atrophy suggests that in the latter, different immunopathologic mechanisms, as compared with coeliac disease, are concerned.},

   abstract = {To investigate the prevalence and clinical and genetic patterns of celiac disease (CD) among siblings of CD patients, 103 siblings and one twin of 80 celiac children were evaluated by means of their clinical history, physical examination, blood indices of nutritional status, and antigliadin antibodies (AGA). Antiendomysium antibody (AEA) levels were determined in 70 patients and 85 subjects were human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typed. On the basis of clinical or laboratory data or both, 21 siblings (20.2%) were submitted to intestinal biopsy, whereas intestinal biopsy in six siblings with positive serologic screening (AGA IgA or AEA or both) was not performed because of parental refusal. In a high percentage of cases (18%), all on a gluten-containing diet, the intestinal mucosa was atrophic, and CD was subsequently diagnosed. Because we could not submit all the siblings to intestinal biopsy, this figure could underestimate the real prevalence of the disease in our series; consequently, it was not possible to calculate accurately the sensitivity and specificity of AGA and AEA. Nevertheless, AEA (positive in all the nine siblings with mucosal atrophy), followed by AGA IgA, proved to be the best screening for CD. Eighteen of 19 CD siblings showed HLA-predisposing antigens. Among the 19 CD siblings, one showed a typical form with gastrointestinal symptoms, two had short stature, one suffered from recurrent vomiting, and in 15, the disease was clinically silent. On the contrary, among siblings who were first diagnosed (index cases), the majority (73.7%) had a typical form of CD, and no clinically silent cases were observed. We did not find any difference between index cases and CD siblings in food habits and distribution of HLA antigens. In 15 of 18 cases, the sibling diagnosed subsequently was the older one. Finally, the typical form of CD was significantly more frequent among the younger brother than the older. In conclusion, the high prevalence of the silent form of CD in our cases indicates that siblings of CD subjects should always be screened for CD. The combination of AGA IgA and AEA represent a good screening method to use in selecting children for the intestinal biopsy.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is the classical food-sensitive enteropathy and is caused by an antigen-specific immunologic hypersensitivity response to gluten within the small intestinal mucosa. Antibody and T-cell hypersensitivity may play a role in vivo, but it is more likely that the primary problem is an inappropriate T-cell response to gluten. The deleterious effects of gluten in celiac patients can be completely explained by the immune-mediated alterations in upper small-intestinal mucosal shape; these alterations include the replacement of long villi and short crypts with short or absent villi and hyperplastic crypts. It is an extremely unusual disease in that it is highly linked to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2, and CD4+ T-cell clones that recognize gluten in the context of DQ2 have been isolated from celiac mucosa lamina propria. HLA-DQ2 is commonly used in Whites, but the incidence of celiac disease varies greatly between different countries and with time, without any obvious explanation. Celiac disease is also unusual in that it has features of autoimmune disease. Patients with active disease have immunoglobulin (Ig)A antibodies in endomysium, an uncharacterized extracellular matrix protein, and the presence of these antibodies is very specific for this condition. However, because celiac disease is more common in IgA-deficient patients, the IgA antiendomysial antibodies are unlikely to be pathogenic.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that some of the limitations of the Van de Kamer method for fecal fat measurement could be overcome with the Jeejeebhoy method or the near-infrared reflectance assay. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, a fecal fat test was carried out with the three methods, adding butter or MCT oil to the diet of four steatorrhoic patients. An in vitro recovery study of long- and medium-chain triglycerides was also performed. RESULTS: The Jeejeebhoy method measured long- and medium-chain fats more accurately than the Van de Kamer method. It found consistently higher steatorrhea values. Mean results of the near-infrared reflectance analysis resembled those of the Van de Kamer method, but with wide discordance of individual data. CONCLUSION: The Jeejeebhoy method is more accurate than the Van de Kamer method for fecal fat measurement. The difference may be clinically relevant when most fecal fatty acids derive from medium-chain triglycerides. Near-infrared reflectance may be a viable proposition only when a greater degree of approximation is acceptable.},

   abstract = {Five adults had inflammatory rheumatic disorders 6 to 20 years before the diagnosis of coeliac disease. It is known that joint inflammation occurs in certain patients with adult coeliac sprue who develop either a specific inflammatory rheumatic disease or an atypical progressive polyarthropathy, sometimes as the first manifestation of the intestinal disorder. The diagnosis of adult coeliac sprue should be entertained in these cases even in absence of major digestive disorders or malabsorption. IgA anti-reticulin antibodies and atrophy of the duodenojejunal villosities are the best indicators for diagnosis. There are two important reasons for making the diagnosis of "asymptomatic adult coeliac sprue". First a gluten-free diet can improve or even cure the inflammatory joint disease, a rare situation which emphasizes the causal relationship between these two diseases. Second, the risk of developing lymphoma (especially in the small bowel) is apparently lower in patients on gluten-free diet. Pathogenesis is unclear. Frequently the two autoimmune disorders simply appear to coincide in the same patient; more rarely, arthritis is a symptom of coeliac disease. The immunological mechanisms probably begin when antigens cross an excessively permeable intestinal mucosa.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The possibility of assaying antiendomysial antibodies (EmA) on the human umbilical cord instead of monkey esophagus has recently been suggested. We therefore evaluated in patients with celiac disease (CD) the sensitivity and specificity of EmA and of antigliadin antibodies (AGA) for both umbilical cord and monkey esophagus. METHODS: We studied 36 patients with CD and atrophy of the intestinal mucosa (median age, 1.4 years), 14 patients with CD on gluten-free diet for 8-12 months (median age, 3.0 years), 36 controls without gastrointestinal disease (median age, 4.0 years), and 72 patients with cow's milk protein enteropathy (CMPE) (median age, 1.2 years). AGA and EmA on monkey esophagus were assayed with commercially available kits; the slides with umbilical cord were prepared in our laboratory. RESULTS: There was a perfect concordance between EmA results evaluated on umbilical cord and those on monkey esophagus; there was a doubtful result in only one case on human umbilical cord, which was positive with low titer on monkey esophagus. EmA specificity was 100%; the specificity of AGA IgG varied between 72% and 94% and of AGA IgA between 90% and 100% depending on whether controls without gastrointestinal disorders or patients with CMPE were considered. EmA sensitivity was 97%, AGA IgG was 89%, and AGA IgA 72% sensitive. The only false negative for EmA was positive for AGA IgG and AGA IgA. CONCLUSIONS: Using human umbilical cord as a substrate for EmA may provide the same sensitivity and specificity as offered by the test using monkey esophagus substrate, thus reducing costs and avoiding the use of endangered species.},

Twenty patients (8 males, 12 females), mean age 14.2 months (group A) received an enzyme substitution preparation. The control group (group B) included 20 patients (9 males, 11 females), mean age 14.5 months, treated with placebo. Before starting treatment, we performed a stratification for age, weight-for-age at diagnosis, and degree of pancreatic insufficiency. The therapies were then administered randomly in double-blind fashion. On diagnosis and 30 and 60 days after commencement of a gluten-free diet with identical calorie intake in both groups, a series of anthropometric variables were determined. After 30 days weight increase in group A patients was significantly higher (in grams) than in group B: 1131 +/- 461 vs 732 +/- 399 (P < 0.006). Weight-for-age increase also was greater in group A than in group B: 9.2 +/- 5.1% vs 5.0 +/- 4.0% (P < 0.002). The increase in height Z score, weight-for-height, arm circumference, and subscapular and tricipital fold measurements were greater in group A patients than those in group B, but the difference was not significant. After 60 days of therapy none of the parameters considered were significantly different in the two groups. We concluded that pancreatic enzyme therapy is certainly useful in the first 30 days after diagnosis of celiac disease.},

Specifically, the H2-BT with D-xylose has been shown to be as valid as the traditional urinary test for the recognition of intestinal malabsorption. We have now investigated the H2-BT with D-xylose in the follow-up of patients with celiac disease. Seventeen patients with celiac disease established clinically and confirmed by jejunal biopsy were studied. H2-BT was performed before and after treatment with a gluten-free diet for at least five months. Alveolar breath samples were obtained before administering orally 25 g of D-xylose and thereafter at 30 min intervals for 5 hr. Samples were analyzed for H2 by chromatography. Simultaneously, the 5-hr urinary excretion of D-xylose was determined by colorimetry. Gluten removal significantly decreased the H2 delta change (from 56.5 +/- 5.9 ppm to 32.2 +/- 8.8, P < 0.05). A similar decrease was observed in the area under the curve (P < 0.05). Conversely, urinary D-xylose excretion increased significantly (P < 0.05). Eleven of the 17 celiacs clinically improved after treatment. The H2-BT normalized in every patient who entered remission on the gluten-free diet, whereas the urinary D-xylose excretion remained abnormal in six of them. In the six nonresponder patients the H2-BT remained high in five, whereas urinary D-xylose excretion paradoxically normalized in 2. We conclude that H2-BT with D-xylose is a useful and practical test for the follow-up of celiac disease and is simpler and more reliable than the urinary D-xylose test.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease has always been considered a permanent condition. A relapse, defined on the basis of mucosal changes, occurring within 2 years of reintroducing gluten to a patient's diet (challenge) has been taken as confirmation of the permanence of the disease. Some observers have questioned whether the disease is permanent, since long periods of unexplained clinical remission occur, mainly among adolescents. However, the presence or absence of symptoms has no correlation with the histologic activity of the disease or with the results of serologic tests. With very few exceptions, patients in whom celiac disease is diagnosed during their childhood eventually have a relapse. However, in some cases, many years may elapse before a relapse; therefore, the 2-year limitation is no longer considered valid. On the other hand, there have been anecdotal observations that some patients eating a normal diet containing gluten appear to have experienced a "natural recovery." This recovery is partial and probably temporary, since there is evidence that celiac disease can be present in a latent form. Long-term randomized studies, in which morphometric and ultrastructural measurements are taken, that show villous integrity, the absence of abnormal inflammation and a lack of long-term complications of a diet containing gluten are needed before the current "zero-gluten" approach to celiac disease is altered. The individual variation in the extent and time course of celiac disease does not contradict the evidence that the disease persists throughout life, actively, silently or latently. Currently, there is no justification for recommending long-term consumption of gluten for either children or adults with celiac disease.},

M.A. presents little growth in terms of height and weight and intestinal alterations (an abundance of fatty and mucous stool). The initial diagnosis was that of coeliac disease. After two months of diet without gluten one observed an increase in weight, but o result for the intestinal disturbances. The positive result revealed from the sweat-test and the study of genomic mutation (delta F508) showed the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis associated with coeliac disease. The specific treatment of both syndromes resolved intestinal alterations and caused the diminution of the acute bronchitis frequent during the first and the second infancy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effect of gluten-free diet on pregnancy outcome and lactation in 125 women affected with celiac disease. METHODS: The study has been designed as a case-control study and a before-after study. RESULTS: In the case-control study, comparison of 94 untreated with 31 treated celiac women indicated that the relative risk of abortion was 8.90 times higher (95% confidence limits: 1.19/66.3), the relative risk of low birth weight baby was 5.84 times higher (90% confidence limits: 1.07/31.9), and duration of breast feeding was 2.54 times shorter (p < 0.001) in untreated mothers. Abortion, low birth weight of baby, and duration of breast feeding did not significantly relate to the severity of celiac disease among untreated women. In the before-after study, 12 pregnant celiac women in either treated or untreated condition were compared. Results indicated that the gluten-free diet reduced the relative risk of abortion by 9.18 times (95% confidence limits: 1.05/79.9), reduced the number of low birth weight babies from 29.4% down to zero (p < 0.05), and increased duration of breast feeding 2.38 times (p < 0.10). Both case-control and before-after studies indicated that threatened abortion and premature delivery did not significantly relate to treatment of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence of abortion, of low birth weight babies, and of short breast-feeding periods is effectively corrected by gluten-free diet in women with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate indices of calcium (Ca) homeostasis in celiac disease (CD). METHODS: Urinary Ca excretion rate, intestinal absorption of strontium (Sr) (used as index of intestinal Ca absorption), and other variables related to these end points were measured in newly diagnosed, untreated adult patients (n = 32) with overt and subclinical CD and compared with those of healthy controls (n = 27). Subclinical CD was defined by the absence of diarrhea (> or = 3 bowel movements/24 h), steatorrhea (fecal fat excretion > 6 g/24 h), and low body mass index (weight/height, kg/m2 < 21). RESULTS: Compared with controls, untreated celiac patients had 2 x lower Ca excretion (p < 0.0001) in 24-h and overnight urine (fed condition) but normal Ca excretion in urine samples collected under fasting (2-h) condition; the increase in urinary Ca excretion from fast to fed condition was 4 x lower in untreated celiac patients (p < 0.0001). Patients with overt and subclinical CD did not have significantly different urinary Ca excretion rates. Sr absorption rate was 45% lower in untreated patients than controls (p < 0.0001). Patients with overt and subclinical CD did not have significantly different Sr absorption rates. Sr absorption rate (r = 0.576, p < 0.0001) related to the increase in urinary Ca excretion from fast to fed condition. In celiac patients, 24-h urinary Ca excretion increased by 52% (p < 0.0001) over baseline after 6 months of gluten-free diet, and urinary Ca excretion under fasting condition did not significantly change. CONCLUSIONS: Overt and subclinical CD is associated with low urinary Ca excretion under fed condition, which relates to low intestinal absorption.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis is a lifelong, gluten sensitive skin disease. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, similar to patients with coeliac disease not adhering to a gluten free diet, seem to have increased risk for lymphoma. AIMS: This study looked at the occurrence of malignancy and survival of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and compared the results with those seen in patients with coeliac disease or in the general population. PATIENTS: A total of 305 adult patients with dermatitis herpetiformis diagnosed at the University Hospital of Tampere in 1970-1992 were studied. Most patients started a gluten free diet and at the end of the study 93% of the patients were adhering to the diet. A control group comprised 383 adult patients with coeliac disease, 81% of them adhered to a gluten free diet, 6% had a normal diet, and in 13% the diet history remained unknown. METHODS: The occurrence of malignant diseases and survival of the patients were assessed up to the end of 1993. Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals were used for the malignant diseases. The survival of the patients was compared with that of the general population. RESULTS: Thirteen (4.3%) patients with dermatitis herpetiformis developed 14 malignant disorders during the follow up (SIR 1.25; 95% confidence intervals 0.68 to 2.09). A non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurred in four patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, significantly more than expected (SIR 10.3; 2.8-26.3). Thirteen (4.3%) patients with dermatitis herpetiformis died during the follow up but there was no increased general mortality. In coeliac disease, 13 (3.4%) patients developed malignancy (SIR 1.16; 0.62 to 1.97), 31 (8.1%) patients died but the survival rate did not differ from that in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was significantly increased in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. The results also confirm that the patients with dermatitis herpetiformis treated mainly with a gluten free diet have no increased general mortality.},

AIMS: To investigate the occurrence of subclinical coeliac disease in patients with infertility or recurrent miscarriages. SUBJECTS: Women of reproductive age who were attending the hospital because of either primary or secondary infertility, or two or more miscarriages. Women undergoing sterilisation served as control subjects. METHODS: The diagnostic investigation for infertility included the endocrine status, diagnostic laparoscopy, investigation of tubal patency, postcoital test, and semen analysis of the partner. Circulating antibodies against IgA class reticulin and gliadin were used in screening for coeliac disease. In positive cases, the diagnosis was confirmed by small bowel biopsy specimens. RESULTS: Four (2.7%) of 150 women in the infertility group, and none of the 150 control subjects were found to have coeliac disease (p = 0.06). All four women with coeliac disease suffered from infertility of unexplained origin. Altogether 98 women had no discoverable reason for infertility. Thus, in this subgroup the frequency of coeliac disease was 4.1% (four of 98), the difference from the control group being statistically significant (p = 0.02). None of the coeliac women had extensive malabsorption, but two had iron deficiency anaemia. One women with coeliac disease has had a normal delivery. None of the 50 women with miscarriage had coeliac disease. CONCLUSION: Patients having fertility problems may have subclinical coeliac disease, which can be detected by serological screening tests. Silent coeliac disease should be considered in the case of women with unexplained infertility.},

   abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that a significant proportion of primary gastrointestinal lymphomas are driven by exogenous agents/antigens. In the stomach, Helicobacter pylori appears to be responsible for most cases of low-grade lymphomas (MALToma), whereas an infectious etiology is suspected in immunoproliferative small intestine disease (IPSID). Similarly, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphomas appear to result from a disordered response to gluten, although this profile remains controversial. Accordingly, although traditional antineoplastic treatments, such as surgery and radiation, are still important for the treatment of primary GI lymphomas, antibiotics may be the first line of therapy for low-grade gastric MALToma, and they are often used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for IPSID. In patients with celiac sprue, a gluten-free diet appears to markedly reduce the risk for lymphoma. An important caveat for the treatment of gastric lymphomas is that only low-grade gastric MALTomas have consistently responded to antibiotics. Treatment of high-grade gastric lymphoma is evolving. Although surgery was once considered central to diagnosis, staging, and treatment of gastric lymphoma, most patients can now have a diagnosis established by endoscopic biopsy and are candidates for chemotherapy and adjuvant radiation. The risks of fatal hemorrhage and perforation have probably been vastly overestimated and appear to be equal or less than the mortality associated with surgery. In addition, the long-term effects of gastric resection on quality of life have been almost completely ignored. Systemic lymphomas involve the GI tract far more often than is clinically apparent. In most cases, treatment should not be affected.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is frequently associated with other autoimmune disorders but has never been reported in association with alopecia areata. In a routine clinical practice, 3 patients with such an association were observed. In one of the patients, celiac disease was diagnosed after the occurrence of malabsorption symptoms. In the youngest patient, a 14-year-old boy, gluten-free diet resulted in complete regrowth of scalp and body hair. A prospective screening program for celiac disease using antigliadin and antiendomysial antibodies was therefore set up in 256 consecutive outpatients with alopecia areata. Three patients, all completely asymptomatic for intestinal diseases, were found to be positive and underwent biopsy. Histological analysis showed a flat intestinal mucosa consistent with the diagnosis of celiac disease. The results show that alopecia areata may constitute the only clinical manifestation of celiac disease and that the association between these two conditions is a real one because the observed frequency of association is much greater than can be expected by chance. It is suggested that antigliadin and antiendomysial antibodies should be included in the work-up of patients with alopecia areata.},

Similar changes were observed in serum calcium, whereas, as regards parathyroid hormone, no significant difference was found between subclinical and classical patients. 25-vitamin D was significantly lower, and 1,25-vitamin D was significantly higher in subclinical and classical patients than in healthy volunteers. Indices of bone remodeling were higher in the subclinical and classical groups than in the volunteers, but lower in the subclinical than in classical patients. Eight subclinical and 8 classical patients were reexamined after a period of gluten-free diet (GFD), and in both groups BMD had significantly improved. Our results show that osteopenia is a frequent feature also in subclinical CD, although the extent of bone and mineral metabolism derangements is lower than in classical CD. GFD is able to normalize BMD in subclinical and to significantly improve it in classical patients.},

Therefore, bone mass and metabolism were evaluated in adults with celiac disease in a cross-sectional study. METHODS: Bone mineral density (BMD), assessed by total body dual-photon absorptiometry, and serum indices of bone metabolism and remodeling were evaluated in 17 patients with untreated celiac disease, 14 with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet, and 24 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: BMD, expressed as a z score, was significantly lower in patients with untreated celiac disease than in patients with treated celiac disease and volunteers and lower in patients with treated celiac disease than in volunteers. Similar changes were observed in serum calcium level, whereas intact parathyroid hormone level was significantly higher in untreated than in treated patients with celiac disease and volunteers, and no difference was found between the latter two groups. 25-Vitamin D level was significantly lower and 1,25-vitamin D level significantly higher in untreated celiac disease than in treated celiac disease and volunteers. Indices of bone remodeling were significantly higher in untreated than in treated patients and volunteers and significantly and positively correlated with iPTH in untreated patients with celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: BMD is almost invariably low in patients with untreated celiac disease. Results in treated patients suggest that gluten-free diet improves but does not normalize BMD. Untreated celiac disease is characterized by high levels of 1,25-vitamin D and by increased bone turnover, caused by the increase in intact parathyroid hormone level.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a chronic disease characterized by small bowel villous atrophy which impairs nutrient absorption and improves on withdrawal of wheat gliadins and barley, rye and oat prolamins from the diet. Knowledge of the adult form of coeliac disease has greatly improved in recent years. Although this knowledge is not yet sufficiently widespread among referring clinicians, it has, over the past few years, allowed an increasing number of patients to be diagnosed with subclinical forms characterized by minor, transient or apparently unrelated symptoms. As a consequence, our views on the clinical and epidemiological aspects of this condition, the prevalence of which in the general population is believed to be close to 1 in 300, have changed and are still changing. Since it has been demonstrated that a strict gluten-free diet is protective against the complications of adult coeliac disease, it is important that even subclinical and silent forms are diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Non-invasive screening tests, such as anti-gliadin and anti-endomysium antibody estimation, should therefore be used systematically in groups considered to be at risk of coeliac disease. These include first-degree relatives of coeliac patients and patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, iron-deficiency anaemia, epilepsy with cerebral calcification, recurrent aphthous stomatitis and dental enamel hypoplasia. Other conditions will probably be identified in the near future.},

Significant reductions in intake were produced by near-celiac infusions of 400, 800, and 1,600 ng CCK-8, but only the two highest doses affected intake when infused intravenously. In a second experiment, which replicated previous observations, near-celiac bolus infusions of 70 ng CCK-8 significantly reduced sucrose intake but intravenous infusions did not. Behavioral observations indicated that although bolus infusions produced immediate disruption of feeding, suggesting an aversive effect, effects of continuous CCK-8 infusions on temporal intake patterns were consistent with enhancement of satiety. These data provide further evidence that CCK-8 acts on a site within the upper gastrointestinal tract to produce satiety.},

We therefore conducted a study on children with active celiac disease to detect possible GI motor abnormalities in this disease. Fourteen children (age range, 1-13 years) were studied; they underwent fasting and fed manometric recordings in the gastroduodenojejunal area. Four patients were restudied after a 6-month gluten-free diet. Data were compared with those obtained in eight control children. As compared with controls, celiac disease patients showed a shorter duration of activity fronts (p < 0.01) and a significant (p < 0.01) reduction of the postprandial antral motility index; furthermore, > 90% of the patients displayed marked fasting and/or fed motor abnormalities, suggesting a neuropathic disorder. Interestingly, gut dysmotilities disappeared in the four subjects reassessed after the gluten-free diet. It is concluded that celiac disease frequently affects the motor behavior of the gut and that its effects may be reversed by appropriate diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to determine whether retroperitoneal approach for aortic surgery has certain physiologic, technical advantages. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The retroperitoneal approach for abdominal aortic reconstruction classically had been reserved for select patients with either high-risk comorbid disease or specific anatomic problems that preclude the transabdominal approach. With increasing appreciation of the physiologic, anatomic, and technical advantages of the extended posterolateral retroperitoneal approach, the authors have expanded its use for repair of all types of aortic visceral and renal artery disease as well as ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and infected aortic grafts. METHODS: From January 1981 to September 1995, 2340 retroperitoneal aortoiliac reconstructions were performed in 2243 patients. Aortic reconstructions accounted for 1756 cases: 1109 for elective abdominal aortic aneurysms, 210 for ruptured and symptomatic aortic aneurysms, 399 for occlusive disease, 18 for infected aortic grafts, and 20 for other indications. Iliofemoral disease was the indication for 584 procedures. As experience was gained, this approach also was used for 417 renal and 50 celiac and superior mesenteric artery reconstructions. RESULTS: The mean age was 67 years with 1590 men and 653 women. Overall mortality was 5.2% for all aortic cases: 2.4% for elective, 12.6% for symptomatic, and 29.0% for ruptured aortic aneurysms. Major complications occurred in 12.5% of the elective procedures and in 38.3% of emergency procedures. Over the past 5 years, the average length of hospital for uncomplicated elective abdominal aortic aneurysms was 6.1 days, intensive care unit stay was 0.7 day, and diet was resumed by postoperative day 1. Five-year graft patency was 99% for aneurysms and 95% for occlusive disease. CONCLUSIONS: The retroperitoneal approach offers certain physiologic advantages associated with minimal disturbance of gastrointestinal and respiratory function, thereby reducing the length of intensive care unit and hospital stay. In addition, its technical advantages and flexibility facilitates visceral and juxtarenal aortic reconstructions without the need for thoracotomy.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 1114 patients affected by IDDM were screened for CD using antigliadin and antiendomysium antibodies. Patients who were positive for at least one test underwent an endoscopic biopsy of the descending duodenum in order to verify the presence of villous atrophy. Subjects with CD started a gluten-free diet and underwent a clinical follow up. RESULTS: Villous atrophy was found in 63 patients (5.6%). Among the Italian population, the rate was 7%. Twenty-four percent of coeliac patients presented with diarrhoea, while 22% were completely symptom-free. A significant correlation was found between the presence of villous atrophy and the duration and onset of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CD in IDDM is higher than previously reported, although the ratio range in different centres from 1.7 to 10%, probably due to both environmental and genetic factors. Twenty-two percent of coeliac patients were completely symptom-free. The prevalence seems to be significantly related to the duration and onset of IDDM.},

We studied the dietary intake in a group of children with CD on GFD. CD was diagnosed according to Espgan criteria. Strict compliance to GFD was ascertained by Hydrogen breath-test. For each patient a thorough dietary history was obtained; the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) 1986/1987--Istituto Nazionale della Nutrizione were used as reference measurements. 71.3% of our patients had a daily calorie intake lower than recommended (mean +/- 1SD = -110 +/- 389 kcal/day). Calorie deficiency was mainly due to a low carbohydrate intake (50.2 +/- 7% of daily calorie intake vs. 59% RDA; difference = -4.7 +/- 7%). Fast absorbed simple carbohydrates exceeded by 46% the recommended 10% ratio to complex carbohydrates. Daily fat intake was higher than RDA (+7.7%) in 94.1% of our patients, who obtained from fat 35.7 +/- 5.2% of their daily calorie intake vs 28% recommended. Saturated to unsaturated fat ratio was unbalanced towards saturated fat intake (2.3 +/- 1.1 vs 0.33 recommended). Coeliac children on a GFD have low caloric and carbohydrate intakes and a high fat intake. An unbalance towards simple sugar and saturated fat ingestion was detected. A lifelong protraction of these dietary habits may favour the onset of metabolic diseases in mature age.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic papulovesicular immune-mediated disorder associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. We report eight cases in which DH appeared many years after celiac disease (CD) in child. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of CD was based on histological features of total or subtotal villous atrophy, full remission after withdrawal of gluten from the diet, and eventually circulating antibodies (IgA gliadin, antireticulin and antiendomysium) at the time of diagnosis and their disappearance under gluten-free diet. The diagnosis of DH was made from clinical findings, histological examination of the involved skin and direct immunofluorescence microscopy of normal or perilesional skin. HLA class II typing was performed in five patients. DRB1, DQA1, DQB1 and DBP1 alleles were studied. RESULTS: DH appeared between 3 and 22 years after the initial diagnosis of CD. Five patients did not show at that time any digestive symptoms. In three cases, a break in the gluten-free diet or a recent revival of the normal diet preceded the rash. In only one case, DH appeared while the patient was under gluten-free diet. In three patients, the rash appeared many years after the gluten-free diet had been stopped. Phenotype DR3 and/or DR7 of the celiac disease could be found in four of the five patients studied; three of them were found to bear DQW2. The DR2 allele was not found in any of the five tested patients. DISCUSSION: These eight cases illustrate the absence of precise nosological barrier between gluten-sensitive enteropathy of the DH and that observed in CD. The presence of the DR7 allele, and especially the absence of the DR2 allele, could explain the particularly severe and symptomatic course of the enteropathy in these patients. The delay in the appearance of DH, after a very variable period of normal diet, could correspond to the necessary time for progressive accumulation of IgA (or immune complex IgA-gluten) in the skin after a digestive sensitization to gluten. The preventive role of gluten-free diet is thus probable. CONCLUSION: CD and DH likely correspond to two different stages of the same disease, thus requiring a prolonged follow-up of both digestive and skin tissues. Long-term eviction of gluten to prevent eventual DH must be balanced with the demand and the cost of such a diet.},

Of 129 patients, ALP was the only elevated enzyme in 12 (9%) and in most cases was not thought to reflect significant liver disease. Seventeen (13%) had elevated AST and/or ALT with normal ALP. Levels normalized in 15 patients after dietary gluten exclusion and remained elevated in 2 noncompliers. Two patients (2%) with elevated AST, ALT, and ALP underwent further investigation: one had negative autoantibodies, liver biopsy, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and the other had ANA-positive chronic active hepatitis; enzymes in both cases improved with a gluten-free diet. There was no significant association between elevated AST/ALT and positive ANA/SMA; no patient had AMA. Abnormalities in liver enzymes are common in celiac sprue, but usually respond to dietary gluten exclusion. We propose that there is no need for invasive liver investigation in these patients unless there is more specific evidence of primary liver disease or failure of dietary response.},

   abstract = {The aims of medical therapy in chronic pancreatitis are mainly to relieve the recurrent pain and to correct any malabsorption secondary to digestive insufficiency resulting from deficient exocrine pancreatic function. The treatment of the pain initially involves the use of dietary measures and analgesic drugs. The results of the use of pancreatic extracts and somatostatin reported in the literature are controversial, as are those of coeliac plexus block. Of unquestionable efficacy, at least in the short to medium term, are surgical decompression interventions in patients, with pain refractory to these measures and who present significant dilation of Wirsung's duct at ERCP. Endoscopic decompression constitutes an alternative to surgical decompression. In view of the transitory results of endoscopic decompression, which, in any event, should be implemented only by endoscopists possessing the necessary experience and expertise, the use of this technique may perhaps be targeted at carefully selected patients to be submitted to surgical decompression. As far as maldigestion is concerned, which occurs only when the pancreatic functional deficit reaches 90% or more, replacement therapy with pancreatic extracts must be resorted to. Multi-Unit Dose preparations are to be preferred, consisting in gastro-protected microspheres measuring not more than 2 mm in diameter and containing high doses of lipase, since at least 30,000 I.U. of lipase are required in the post-prandial phase for reasonably satisfactory correction of the steatorrhoea. Should this fail to prove effective, it is good policy to add antisecretory drugs (H2-antagonists, proton-pump inhibitors).},

Subjects presenting with both CD and DH generally show an HLA pattern in which A1, B8, DR2, DR7, DQw2 are the most frequent antigens one can find. We report about 2 brothers presenting with DH, clinically asymptomatic, without antigliadin serum antibodies (AGA), but positive to the research of antiendomysial (EMA) ones. The biopsy performed by digestive endoscopy showed a complete atrophy of duodenal villi and the diagnosis of CD was confirmed according to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN) criteria. The diet without gluten caused the DH to recovery and the duodenal villi microscopic aspect to normalize as well. Both the brothers had the same HLA pattern: A1, B8, DR3-DR2, DQw2. Our clinical study suggests that it is very important, especially for the general practitioner, to recognize a DH and in every child presenting with a dermatitis like that it will be mandatory to perform a laboratory research of both AGA and EMA.},

   abstract = {In France as well as in most of the other European countries, the prevalence of coeliac disease is underestimated. In order to point out a good screening test, we have determined the most sensitive combination (technique-marker) for the diagnosis of the disease among 81 individuals (50 with coeliac disease and 31 controls). Serum anti-gliadin antibodies were measured using three methods: the qualitative dot-blot (Gliastick-Eurospital) and two quantitative methods Elisa (homemade-Saint-Antoine Hospital and alpha-Gliatest-Eurospital); serum anti-endomysium antibodies (EmA) and anti-reticulin antibodies (ARA) were detected using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. We have shown that the simple and fast Gliastick test can fulfil the selected criterion with a sensitivity of 0.90. Nevertheless, uncertain and positives results have to be confirmed by one of the two more specific quantitative tests. The two other markers (ARA and EmA) have shown a better specificity (1) but they were less sensitive (0.54 and 0.56 for ARA and EmA respectively). Thus, they have both to be used as confirmation tests and for follow-up with supervision of the compliance to recommended diet. In conclusion, the Gliastick can be considered as a good screening test for the detection of anti-gliadin antibodies and it would represent the expected help to determine the prevalence of coeliac disease on a large-scale map.},

   abstract = {Celiac sprue (CS) is frequently complicated by malignancy, most commonly small intestinal lymphoma. Our study was performed in an area with a high prevalence of CS to define the clinical features, response to treatment, and outcome of this tumor. Of a total of 31 lymphomas complicating CS identified, 30 case records and 24 tumor specimens were reviewed. Overall 1-year survival was 9 of 29 (31%) and 5-year survival 3 of 27 (11%). Seven previously diagnosed celiac patients developed lymphoma; length on gluten-free diet ranged from 12 to 252 months (median 44 months). In this group, presentation was nonspecific, diagnosis difficult, and survival poor (lymphoma diagnosed in life in four of seven, mean survival 2.25 months). Twenty-three patients had CS and lymphoma diagnosed during the same illness. In this group, 14 of 23 presented with a surgical emergency and were treated with tumor resection and chemotherapy. Nine are disease-free and alive or died of another cause after 10-196 months (mean 74 follow-up). Celiac-associated lymphoma is a frequent, difficult to diagnose, and commonly fatal complication of CS. An aggressive diagnostic approach, including laparoscopy, is recommended. Long-term survival can be expected in a significant number of these patients and in our series was almost exclusively confined to those treated with chemotherapy.},

Histology of biopsy specimens taken from these sites confirmed ulceration and showed other features consistent with a diagnosis of coeliac disease. They both showed pronounced clinical improvement and satisfactory linear growth on a gluten free diet. A year later the diagnosis of coeliac disease was confirmed on a biopsy controlled gluten challenge, and repeat endoscopy showed complete resolution of the intestinal ulceration.},

We found 28 biopsy-proven coeliac patients who were invited to start the gluten-free diet (GFD). The aim of this study was a clinical and laboratory follow-up in these screening-detected coeliac adolescents. Patients were 17 females and 11 males with a mean age at diagnosis of 12.8 +/- 1 years (range 11-4). Mean follow-up duration time was 23 +/- 7 months (range 9-37). Twenty-three of the 28 screening-detected coeliac patients came to the control visit, 3 refused the follow-up and 2 subjects were not found. Twelve patients (52.2%) stated that they never ate any gluten-containing food, while 11 of them (47.8%) reported occasional transgressions to the diet. GFD acceptance was reported as good (n = 6), moderate (n = 11) or low (n = 6). After starting the GFD, signs of improvement were seen in most patients, such as weight gain, increased height velocity and increased feeling of well-being. AGA (both IgG and IgA classes) and antiendomysium antibodies (AEA) were normal in 19 subjects, 2 cases had IgG-AGA and AEA positivity, 1 patient showed abnormal AGA and AEA levels, while isolated IgA-AGA positivity persisted in 1 case. This study shows that even silent CD cases can clinically benefit from the GFD. The consequences of occasional transgressions to the GFD remain unclear.},

The sensitivity and specificity of antigliadin antibodies (AGAs), the clinical features of subjects with DS and CD (DS-CD+), the incidence of CD, and the results of serological and molecular class I and II HLA typing were determined in a sample of 57 Sicilian subjects with DS. Six (10.5%) and 17 subjects (29.8%) showed high levels of IgA AGAs and IgG AGAs, respectively. AGAs sensitivity and specificity were lower than in the population without DS. Ten people with DS were submitted to jejunal biopsy, and seven (12.2%) showed CD according to ESPGAN criteria. All seven patients were put on gluten-free diet, followed by rapid disappearance of symptoms. Class I and II HLA serological and molecular typing was carried out in seven DS-CD + subjects, 22 people with DS without CD (DS-CD-), five subjects with CD without DS, and 20 controls. Between DS-CD + and DS-CD- subjects, no statistically significant difference regarding serum HLA class I antigens was found. DQA1*0101 allele appears significantly in DS-CD + patients and deserves to be searched for in a larger sample to assess its meaning in the DS-CD association.},

The reply rate was 100% in celiac and 91.6% in reference children. The celiac children were breast-fed for a significantly shorter time than reference children, and they were less often breast-fed at the introduction of gluten. The age of the children at gluten introduction was similar, but the celiac children were significantly more often introduced by a gluten-containing follow-up formula, while the reference children more often started on a gluten-containing porridge. The results can be interpreted in two ways. First, it could be argued that breast milk per se protects against symptoms of celiac disease in childhood. It could, however, also be claimed that breast-feeding merely modulates the gluten introduction, causing a less abrupt introduction of gluten in the baby diet and thereby fewer overt symptoms of the disease.},

   abstract = {Lectins recognize carbohydrate moities of glycoproteins and glycolipids, and can elicit several biological effects, including cell agglutination, cell activation and mitogenesis. According to the gluten-lectin theory, celiac lesions represent a response to a toxic lectin, putatively wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). In this study we compared the serum antibody levels IgA, IgG and IgM to WGA and to gliadin in children under investigation for celiac disease (CD), as compared to reference children. We found that the levels of IgA and IgG to WGA as well as gliadin were significantly higher in celiac children on a gluten-containing diet, compared to children on gluten-free diet and reference children. These findings lend support to the concept that WGA is a biologically significant component of gluten. Since WGA can mimic the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) at the cellular level, we hypothesize that the crypt hyperplasia seen in celiac children could be due to a mitogenic response induced by WGA.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Comparison between the usefulness of immunological markers and intestinal biopsy in the diagnosis and follow-up of coeliac disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum antibodies to gliadin, several dietary proteins and endomysium were appraised in 27 patients with biopsy proven coeliac disease, both while untreated and 6-8 months after gluten withdrawal, when an intestinal biopsy was repeated. Forty-six healthy volunteers entered the study as controls. Antibodies to gliadin and dietary proteins were assessed by ELISA, antibodies to endomysium by indirect immunofluorescence using monkey oesophagus as antigen. RESULTS: Mean antibody levels to dietary proteins were significantly higher in untreated patients as compared to controls. Their titers decreased after gluten withdrawal, but a significant difference was found, except for casein, for the IgA class only. However, because of their unlinear and unpredictable behaviour, they showed a poor reliability. Antigliadin antibodies showed higher diagnostic accuracy, although they also produced false-positive and false-negative results. Anti-endomysium antibodies, albeit the more expensive, proved the more reliable, due to their 100% specificity. CONCLUSION: To date, anti-endomysium antibodies are the most reliable marker for coeliac disease: a positivity warrants an intestinal biopsy. The actual role of antibodies to gliadin, cheaper than endomysium, is during follow-up when many determinations are needed. Antibodies to dietary proteins, useful in the pre-endomysium era, only have a historical role.},

From time to time, abnormal immunity to foods, either as inappropriately high titers of antibodies or qualitatively altered responses, produce disease.

The prevalence of histologically confirmed CD in Edinburgh and the Lothians in 1979 was 61 per 100,000. The National Health Service Central Records of all 653 subjects registered at that time have been flagged, allowing us to analyse mortality in CD. At a mean of 13.5 years, mortality overall was 1.9-fold that of the general population (115 deaths observed. 61.8 expected; p < 0.0001). For both sexes the early mortality was much greater than expected, but the excess steadily diminished with time from diagnosis. Much of the increased mortality from malignant disease was accounted for by deaths from lymphoproliferative disease and esophageal cancer. Interim re-analysis after a further 9 years shows that the pattern of later deaths is consistent with these trends. Clinical and pathological features of lymphomas in CD are described. In serum samples of 41 patients with normal villus architecture while taking a normal diet, but with minor pathological and/or immunological abnormalities, i.e. potential CD, IgA antiendomysium antibodies were positive in 7 with dermatitis herpetiformis but in only 3 others.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency complicating celiac sprue is usually attributed to the malabsorption of dietary iron or the loss of iron from the intestinal mucosa. There has been little investigation of the role of intestinal loss of blood in patients with this condition. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of occult gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with celiac sprue. METHODS: We tested one 48- or 72-hour stool collection from each of 8 patients with partial villous atrophy and 28 patients with total villous atrophy using a guaiac-impregnated card (Hemoccult). Serving as controls were 18 normal subjects, each studied before and during laxative-induced diarrhea; 17 patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea; 63 patients with microscopic colitis; 23 patients with pancreatic steatorrhea; and 7 patients with treated celiac sprue who had normal intestinal histologic features. All the patients underwent a diagnostic workup that included esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, and barium radiography of the small bowel. RESULTS: Positive Hemoccult tests were infrequent in each of the control groups, occurring in 0 to 8 percent of the subjects, whereas 2 of the 8 patients with partial villous atrophy (25 percent) and 15 of the 28 patients with total villous atrophy (54 percent) had positive tests. When the patients with total villous atrophy were classified according to their subsequent responses to a gluten-free diet, 7 of the 17 who were responsive to gluten withdrawal (41 percent) were Hemoccult-positive, as compared with with 8 of the 11 who did not respond to the diet (73 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Occult gastrointestinal bleeding can be detected in about half of patients with celiac sprue and should be added to the list of factors that can contribute to iron deficiency in patients with this disorder.},

   abstract = {Lymphocytic colitis is a form of microscopic colitis usually characterized by watery diarrhea and often associated with biopsy-defined celiac disease. Two patients with lymphocytic colitis and normal small intestinal biopsies who were administered 40 g of added dietary gluten for four consecutive weeks are presented. Small intestinal biopsies from multiple sites in the proximal small bowel were done after three and four weeks to determine whether pathological changes in latent celiac disease could be induced in these patients with a high gluten-containing diet. In addition, colorectal biopsies were done to determine whether the colitis was sensitive to oral gluten. No alterations in the small intestinal biopsies were detected in either patient and no changes occurred in colitis severity. Although microscopic forms of colitis have been linked to celiac disease, this study indicates that lymphocytic colitis is a heterogeneous clinicopathological disorder that, in some patients, is independent of any gluten-induced intestinal pathological changes.},

   abstract = {Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a relatively rare skin disorder with an estimated incidence of 1:10,000 in the UK. It is characterized by urticarial plaques and blisters on the elbows, buttocks, and knees, although other sites may also be involved. The eruption tends to be persistent: only 10-15% of patients have spontaneous remission over a 25-year study period. The disease is characterized by the presence of IgA deposits in the upper dermis of uninvolved skin and the diagnosis should not be made in the absence of these deposits. Two-thirds of patients have a small intestinal enteropathy with villous atrophy as seen in coeliac disease (CD). However, the remaining third also show evidence of a gluten sensitivity in the intestine, as judged by increased lymphocytic infiltration of the epithelium. Villous atrophy also ensues after gluten challenge in those patients with previous normal villous architecture. The initial treatment of the rash is with one of the following three drugs, dapsone, sulphapyridine or sulphamethoxypyridazine. However, the rash also clears with gluten withdrawal. It must be stressed, however, that the average time to achieve significant reduction in drug requirements is 6 months and it can be over 2 years before drugs are no longer required. On re-introduction of gluten the eruption recurs. Patients with DH have a high incidence of auto-immune disorders, thyroid disease, pernicious anaemia, and insulin-dependent diabetes, and should be screened for those diseases on a yearly basis. As with coeliac disease there is also an increased incidence of lymphoma and a gluten-free diet appears to protect patients from this complication. The mechanism by which gluten causes the skin lesions has still to be elucidated, but current investigations implicate lymphocytes and cytokines in the pathogenesis. The original hypothesis of an antigen-antibody reaction in the skin with complement activation causing the skin lesions, may not be correct.},

Untreated patients had a significantly lower body weight, fat mass, lean tissue mass and BMD at the lumbar spine and total skeleton compared to controls (p < 0.001 for all parameters). Treated patients had also a significantly lower body weight (p < 0.01) fat mass (p < 0.05) and bone mineral density at lumbar spine and total skeleton (p < 0.05) compared with controls, but lean tissue mass was not diminished. However, treated patients had a significantly higher body weight, fat mass and BMD of the total skeleton compared with untreated celiac patients (p < 0.01 for all parameters). Serum alkaline phosphatase levels were increased in untreated patients but serum 250HD was normal. In conclusion, celiac disease causes a global and almost universal reduction of fat mass and BMD. The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that osteopenia does not seem to be completely restored by adequate treatment. Alteration of vitamin D metabolism was not the cause of osteopenia in the majority of patients.},

   abstract = {HISTORY AND FINDINGS: A 45-year-old man with type I diabetes mellitus was admitted to hospital because of colicky abdominal pain and 5-6 watery stools daily. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed nearly total atrophy of the villi in the duodenum and jejunum suggesting coeliac disease. However, gluten-free diet for 2 weeks brought no improvement. Another examination of the biopsy 6 weeks after the first endoscopy revealed extensive collagen deposition in the lamina propria of the small intestine, giving the diagnosis of collagenous sprue. TREATMENT AND COURSE: Parenteral nutrition, lactulose, cisapride, cholestyramine, doxycycline, paromomycin, vancomycin and octreotide failed to affect the loss of fluid from the gut which 12 weeks after admission had increased to 221 daily. However, it was stopped after prednisolone was administered (100mg daily). 7 months after starting the steroid treatment the collagen layer had disappeared and the villous atrophy had partially regressed. Over the next 6 months the prednisolone dosage was decreased to 10 mg daily. Shortly thereafter a perimembranous glomerulonephritis occurred, with proteinuria (up to 60 g/d) and oedema. It regressed to 6 g/d when the steroid dose was increased and cyclosporin, 0.5 g/d, had been added. On maintenance dosage of cyclosporin the histological and clinical remission of the collagenous sprue has now lasted for over 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that steroid administration is an effective treatment of collagenous sprue. The presence of diabetes and other immune-related diseases in this case also suggests that an immunological mechanism may play a causative role in collagenous sprue.},

The two diseases share distinctive pathological changes to the small intestinal mucosa which reverse on withdrawal of dietary gluten. In order to determine the locus primarily associated with DH, and to examine whether there is a common genetic link predisposing to the enteropathy seen in both DH and coeliac disease, HLA-DR, DQ and DP subregion associations were investigated by HLA genotyping in 23 DH patients and 64 healthy controls. We also studied polymorphisms of the TAP2 locus, which is located between the DP and DQ subregions. Genotyping was carried out by PCR of genomic DNA with allelic assignment by sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) hybridization or amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). The strongest associations in the patient group were with HLA DRB1*0301 (91% vs 22% of controls), HLA DQB1*02 (100% vs 32% of controls) and DPB1*0101 (39% and 14%). These associations are similar to those described for CD. 100% of DH patients were positive for the DQA1*0501/DQB1*02 dimer in cis or trans and, by analogy with CD, this is probably responsible for presenting gliadin peptide implicated in the disease process. Homozygosity for DQ2 was significantly increased in the CD patient group compared to the DH patient group (65% versus 39%), and so differences in dosage of HLA class II genotypes between DH and CD may be responsible for the milder gastrointestinal symptoms characteristic of DH.},

The pale-looking patient reported having large and foul-smelling stools once or twice daily. There were large haematomas and swellings on both legs. His general and nutritional state was reduced. "Bleeding of unknown origin" was suspected at this time. INVESTIGATIONS: Haemoglobin concentration was 5.6 g/dl, while iron was normal and ferritin reduced. Quick value was below 5%, activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged to 180 s. Vitamin A and E concentrations were reduced; coumarin derivatives were not demonstrated in blood. Abdominal ultrasonography showed clearly thickened intestinal walls. TREATMENT AND COURSE: Four units of erythrocyte concentrate were immediately administered, together with 2000 IU factors II, VII, X and anti-haemophilic factor B (PPSB), and 10 mg vitamin K intravenously. As intestinal malabsorption was suspected, a vitamin A absorption test was performed: it indicated malabsorption. Upper intestinal endoscopy showed coeliac disease, as did a biopsy. The patient's state quickly improved after he had been given vitamins A, D, E and K and put on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: Coeliac disease can take a clinically unremarkable course for a long time and may finally become manifest through an isolated abnormality, such as bleeding.},

Emphasis on malignant complications has often overshadowed the non-malignant risks, which have received relatively little attention, although some of these can be very troublesome and even life-threatening. This article points out that a large population of unidentified or neglected coeliac patients is at potential risk. The challenge is to identify this group by case-finding or screening programmes in selected populations, so that they can be offered a gluten-free diet and other treatments which will not only improve general health but may also prevent or reduce the development of health problems. The non-malignant risks are outlined and bone and neuropsychiatric disturbances considered in more detail because of recent developments in these areas.},

METHODS: Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to study the stanining of wheat germ agglutinin, which binds to glycoconjugates of the enterocyte, and rhodamine phalloidin, which binds to the F-actin of the cells. RESULTS: In healthy mucosa the wheat germ agglutinin labeling showed a strong and punctate staining of microvilli, which outlined a convoluted surface. Phalloidin-labeled actin formed a three-dimensional cage at the cell membrane. In the crypt-hyperplastic mucosa, both staining patterns were irregular, and the cytoskeleton was disorganized. CONCLUSIONS: Confocal laser scanning microscopy offers the possibility to study the distribution of surface and cytoskeleton markers in thick, structurally intact specimens.},

This is the first case report of this possibly reversible complication of methotrexate therapy. The diagnosis was confirmed by a duodenal mucosal biopsy revealing the characteristic intestinal histopathology of coeliac sprue. After discontinuation of the drug a repeat biopsy was almost normal, and completely normal after reintroduction of a normal diet. One could speculate about the methotrexate related mechanism of the villous atrophy: it might be either a direct toxic effect or a secondary effect of the immunosuppression.},

The article describes the occurrence in elderly persons. Data were collected on symptomatology, laboratory test results, complications, dietary treatment, and progress. A total of 69 coeliacs were registered, giving a crude prevalence of 148/100,000. 13 patients (19%) were 65 years old or older at the time of diagnosis. Mean estimated diagnostic delay in this group was 21.5 years (range 5-40). The symptomatology was uncharacteristic in most patients and not dominated by malabsorption symptoms. Laboratory investigations were generally unhelpful for diagnosis. There was a high frequency of associated disorders, notably malignant diseases. Histology is a sine qua non in the diagnosis of coeliac disease, especially in elderly patients. Wide indications for biopsy are strongly recommended in this age group.},

   abstract = {We sought to prospectively characterize and compare the symptoms of children > or = 5 years of age with recurrent abdominal pain to previously established criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults. For all eligible subjects, a detailed questionnaire concerning characteristics of abdominal pain and defecatory pattern was completed at presentation. In addition, a battery of screening tests was performed and additional evaluation was done at the discretion of their physician. In all, 227 subjects fulfilled the entrance criteria, but 56 were subsequently excluded because of diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease (nine cases), lactose malabsorption (46 cases), or celiac disease (one case). Of the remaining 171 patients, 117 had IBS symptoms. In the IBS subjects, lower abdominal discomfort (p < 0.001), cramping pain (p < 0.0009), and increased flatus (p < 0.0003) were more common, whereas dyspeptic symptoms such as epigastric discomfort (p < 0.003), pain radiating to the chest (p < 0.009), and regurgitation (p < 0.02) were more common in the non-IBS subjects. Our study not only confirms the clinical heterogeneity of children with recurrent abdominal pain but also concomitantly demonstrates that most children with this disorder have symptoms that fulfill the standardized criteria for IBS in adults. The identification of subgroups of children with recurrent abdominal pain can provide a framework for the diagnosis of functional bowel disease as well as establish the need for invasive and expensive tests.},

METHODS: In a randomized trial, we compared the effects of gluten-free diets without oats and with oats (with a goal of 50 to 70 g per day from three sources: two types of wheat-starch flour mixed with an equal amount of oats, muesli containing 60 percent oats, and rolled-oat breakfast cereal). Fifty-two adults with celiac disease in remission were followed for 6 months and 40 with newly diagnosed disease for 12 months. Endoscopy with duodenal biopsy was performed at the beginning and end of the study. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) oat intake in the oat group was 49.9 +/- 14.7 g per day at 6 months for patients in remission and 46.6 +/- 13.3 g per day at 12 months for patients with newly diagnosed disease. The oat and control groups did not differ significantly in nutritional status, symptoms, or laboratory measures. Patients in remission, regardless of diet, did not have worsening architecture of the duodenal villi or increased mononuclear-cell infiltration. All the patients with new diagnoses were in remission at one year, except for one in the control group. Six patients in the oat groups and five in the control group withdrew from the study. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate amounts of oats can be included in a gluten-free diet for most adult patients with celiac disease without adverse effects.},

Thirty CD patients aged 4-16 years and 30 matched controls were examined. They underwent i.v. glucose tolerance test during which glucose disappearance rate (K) and first phase insulin response (FPIR) were measured. Typing for HLA A, B, C, and DR antigens was performed and sera were analyzed for cytoplasmic islet cell antibodies (ICA) on several occasions. Pancreatic isoamylase (PIA) was measured to assess exocrine pancreatic function. In 4/21 CD children, FPIR and K rate were decreased. There was a significant correlation between the two parameters (p < 0.01). The incidence of HLA B8 and DR3 was higher in CD (33% and 60%, respectively) than in healthy individuals (p < 0.001). All patients were found to be ICA negative at the time of the study and at follow-up. There was no correlation between parameters of endocrine (FPIR, K) and exocrine (PIA) pancreatic function. One out of four children with reduced FPIR developed overt DM during the study. In conclusion, the decline of first phase insulin secretion documented in CD patients is unrelated to jejunal morphology or exocrine pancreatic function. This decline may be an expression of a prediabetic phase as observed in one of the subjects who finally developed IDDM. HLA B8 and DR3, which are detected in celiac patients, may indicate a possible common pathogenic mechanism between CD and IDDM.},

METHODS: Forty-three patients with CD were investigated: group 1, newly diagnosed celiacs (n = 19); group 2, treated celiacs responding histologically to a gluten-free diet (n = 16); group 3, refractory celiacs, unresponsive to a gluten-free diet and immunosuppressive therapy (n = 8). Serum was drawn for intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], ionized calcium (Cai), total alkaline phosphatase (AP), and biochemical markers of bone formation: procollagen I carboxyterminal propeptide (PICP) and osteocalcin (Oc). Urinary indices of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline (DPD), pyridinoline (PyD), and hydroxyproline (OHP), were measured in a 2-h fasting urine. In 22 patients, computerized tomographic scan for bone mineral density (BMD) was performed. RESULTS: The prevalence in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, of hypovitaminosis D (< 50 nmol/L) was 58%, 25%, and 88%, and the prevalence of SHPT (> 5.4 pmol/L) was 25%, 19%, and 25%. Bone resorption markers were significantly elevated in all groups, and bone formation indices were elevated in the newly diagnosed celiacs compared with a group of healthy adults. Low BMD (T-score greater than -1 SD unit) was found in 68% of patients assessed; 36% of patients had a T-score greater than -2.5 SD units. CONCLUSIONS: Hypovitaminosis D and SHPT are common in newly diagnosed and refractory celiacs but are less common in those who respond to a gluten-free diet. Newly diagnosed patients have a high bone turnover state with elevation of both bone formation and resorption indices. Those with refractory disease demonstrate a remodeling imbalance with high bone resorption.},

METHODS: Forty untreated and 52 coeliac patients in remission were admitted to the study. The control group included 77 persons.

RESULTS: Concentrations of serum ferritin, vitamin B12, and erythrocyte folate were lower in patients with untreated coeliac disease than in those in remission. Altogether, 15-38% of the untreated patients but only 0-20% of the patients in remission had levels of haemoglobin, serum ferritin, iron, vitamin B12, or erythrocyte folate below the reference values. No difference in anthropometric measurements was found between the two groups of coeliac patients. CONCLUSIONS: Except for some subclinical abnormal values in biochemical analyses in 20-38% of coeliac patients, nutritional status was quite normal in both groups of coeliac patients.},

In this study the phenotypic characteristics of peripheral blood T cells from 14 untreated CoD patients and 14 healthy age- and sex-matched controls were determined with special emphasis on TCR gamma delta + lymphocytes. We also studied samples taken from 15 CoD patients who were on gluten-free diet (GFD). Two- and three-colour flow cytometry analyses were performed using a whole-blood lysing method. There was no significant difference between the percentages of TCR gamma delta + lymphocytes in patients and controls. However, the amount of delta TCS1+ lymphocytes was significantly lowered in untreated patients (0.48 +/- 0.42% in CoD versus 0.86 +/- 0.57% in controls, P < 0.05). The percentage of CD45RO+ T cells, which are a primed population of T cells including memory cells, was significantly raised in the peripheral blood of untreated patients. This phenomenon was most prominent within the TCR gamma delta + population (83.9 +/- 12.2% in CoD versus 65.5 +/- 14.7% in controls, P < 0.01), but the same applies to CD45RO+ TCR alpha beta + and delta TCS1+ T cells. In patients on GFD these changes seem to be at least partly corrected. Antigen-primed CD45RO+ T cells have been shown to accumulate in the jejunal epithelium of patients with untreated CoD. The enhanced 'memory activity' also found in the peripheral blood of untreated CoD patients may result from a continuous antigenic stimulus and this stimulus could be gluten triggered.},

Five of the 25 patients had coeliac disease (CD): they were on a gluten free diet and had normal jejunal morphology. Only two of 15 specimens from control subjects had CD25+ cells in the surface epithelium, while this was seen in 19 out of 20 specimens from IgAd patients (p < 0.0001). A significant increase of CD25+ cells was also noted in the lamina propria of IgAd patients. The median percentage of crypt cells in mitosis (Ki67+ cells) was higher in the specimens from IgAd patients (26%) than in those from controls (13%, p < 0.001). The densities of gamma delta T cell receptor positive cells in the surface epithelium and lamina propria did not differ in the specimens from IgAd patients and those of controls nor was the expression of HLA class II antigens augmented in the surface epithelium. These findings were similar for the IgAd patients whether or not the patient had DQB 0201 allele, a genetic marker which is strongly associated with CD.

   abstract = {Multiple infectious causes of diarrhea are known in patients with HIV/AIDS. Maldigestion and malabsorption have been reported in patients with HIV/AIDS and may be independent of infectious etiologies. Among ambulatory patients with HIV/AIDS, we examined the prevalence of fat malabsorption (steatorrhea). Sixty-one patients with unexplained diarrhea (defined as > 2 stools/d) and/or weight loss despite adequate caloric intake (and without clinical evidence of chronic pancreatitis) were evaluated in our outpatient Gastroenterology-Nutrition Clinic between March 1, 1993, and July 1994. Patients were instructed by a dietitian to follow a > or = 100 g/d fat diet for 24 h before submitting a stool sample for qualitative (or quantitative) fecal fat determination. Forty-five patients, 32 with ongoing diarrhea and 13 without diarrhea, submitted stool samples. Twenty-two of 45 patients (49%) had qualitative or quantitative steatorrhea, 16/32 with diarrhea (50%) and 6/13 patients without diarrhea (46%). Thirty of 32 patients with diarrhea had had extensive microbiologic and/or endoscopic evaluations. Only 9 patients had a detectable intestinal pathogen, 5 patients had cytomegalovirus (4 treated), 4 patients had cryptosporidia (3 treated), and 1 patient had microsporidia. Steatorrhea, as determined by abnormal qualitative fecal fat, is detectable in nearly 50% of patients with HIV/AIDS. Fat malabsorption appears to be a primary defect in these patients independent of detectable pathogens. Assessment of fat malabsorption should be considered in patients with unexplained weight loss or diarrhea before extensive evaluation for opportunistic infections.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A T-cell-mediated immune response may be responsible for the enteropathy seen in coeliac disease (CD), but it is unclear whether this is initiated in the epithelium or the lamina propria. We studied the site and number of cells expressing mRNA encoding the cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in jejunal biopsy specimens from patients with untreated or treated CD and normal controls. METHODS: Tissue sections were hybridized with 35S-labelled DNA oligonucleotide probes specific for each cytokine RNA sequence. Positive cells were counted in the lamina propria and epithelial compartments. RESULTS: For each cytokine significantly greater numbers of positive cells were found in the lamina propria of untreated CD patients. Few positive cells were detected in the epithelium of all three groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the immune response to gliadin appears to occur in the lamina propria and supports cell-mediated immunity in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A is constitutively expressed in human intestinal villi and may account for significant "first-pass" prehepatic metabolism of a number of drugs in the intestine. Celiac disease results in small intestinal atrophy. We hypothesized that this would result in a loss of CYP3A. METHODS: Formalin-fixed jejunal biopsy specimens taken from nine patients with celiac disease at variable times before and after treatment with a gluten-free diet were immunoperoxidase stained after incubation with anti-CYP3A4 rabbit antisera (1:2000 dilution). The amount of immunoreactive CYP3A was determined by two observers who were blinded to the treatment states of the patients. Staining intensity was graded on a numerical scale from 1 to 4+ on the basis of intensity of staining in individual enterocytes, as well as the total number of enterocytes stained. RESULTS: Slides of biopsy specimens from all nine untreated patients with celiac disease were graded 1. Treatment with a gluten-free diet was associated with a significant increase in CYP3A immunoreactive protein in small bowel biopsy specimens (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients with celiac disease have low intestinal CYP3A immunoreactivity and that treatment with a gluten-free diet is associated with an increase in intestinal CYP3A immunoreactive protein. Our findings suggest that intestinal disease and variability in intestinal CYP3A activity might be an unexamined variable that may contribute to interindividual variability in drug disposition.},

The diagnosed was made before 30 months of age in 50% of cases. Average treatment duration was 69.8 +/- 36 months. The randomly selected control group was composed of 48 school age children, of the same age and sex of patients. Total bone mass (TBM) and bone mineral density (BMD) were expressed as Z scores on the basis of normal values established by the authors in Chilean children. Celiac patients had lower TBM and BMD of whole body, than controls (-1.11 +/- 0.94 vs 0.00 +/- 0.85 and -0.59 +/- 0.76 vs 0.06 +/- 0.84, respectively) and at the spine (-0.79 +/- 1.04 vs 0.003 +/- 0.92 and -1.49 +/- 0.99 vs 0.06 +/- 0.87 respectively). A lower TBM was founded at the hip (-0.62 +/- 1.28 vs -0.08 +/- 0.82) without differences in BMD. Celiac patients had a lower bone mass than controls despite early diagnosis and good compliance with the gluten-free diet. These differences could not be atributed entirely to the lower height of celiac patients. These results suggest that celiac patients constitute a risk group for development of osteoporosis later in life. This fact should be taken into consideration in the treatment of this condition.},

ACE activity is present in plasma, urine, and vascular endothelium. High levels of ACE are found in the brush border of human small bowel. The aim of this study was to evaluate ACE activity in human stools and to find a correlation with the intestinal loss of epithelial cells. Fifteen healthy subjects (HS) (8 males, 7 females; age range 6-56 years), 20 patients with celiac disease (CD) (11 males, 9 females; age range 15-53 years), and 18 patients with CD in remission after a gluten-free diet (CD-GFD) (8 males, 10 females; age range 14-54 years) were enrolled in the study. The fecal ACE activity was measured in all groups. Fecal samples were kept at -20 degrees C for a subsequent test. In HS, fecal ACE activity was 21.03 +/- 16.17 nmol/min/100 g (mean +/- SD). In patients with CD with subtotal mucosa atrophy, ACE activity was significantly higher (113 +/- 88.94) than in HS and CD on GFD (36.65 +/- 23.9). We have demonstrated ACE activity in human stools. ACE activity in stools seems to derive from the microvilli of the intestinal mucosa, thus suggesting the potential usefulness of ACE determination as an index of enterocyte damage.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease usually presents in infancy or early childhood with diarrhoea, vomiting and interference with weight gain and growth. Withdrawal of dietary gluten is followed by resolution of the symptoms and signs and restoration of normal weight gain and growth; the characteristic subtotal villous atrophy of the jejunal mucosa also recovers. Later re-introduction of dietary gluten will lead to a return of the jejunal mucosal abnormality in the majority and to clinical relapse in many but not all. The severity and timing of both are variable and 5% of children initially considered on clinical, biopsy and gluten response evidence to have coeliac disease appear to develop permanent tolerance to gluten, although mucosal relapse may occur years after the re-introduction of dietary gluten in a minority, emphasizing the need for long-term follow-up. Although a diagnostic and subsequent follow-up jejunal biopsy are necessary to confirm the diagnosis, anti-gliadin IgA and IgG, anti-reticulum and anti-endomysium antibodies are now almost totally reliable in identifying children who have coeliac disease and are valuable in monitoring the adequacy of gluten withdrawal. Dietary compliance is frequently poor and regular supervision by a paediatric dietitian is needed; indeed, lifelong supervision to ensure gluten withdrawal is essential to reduce the chance of developing later gastrointestinal malignancy.},

If mass screening is to receive serious consideration then it must be shown to be (i) effective, (ii) acceptable, and (iii) worthwhile (cost-effective). At present there is insufficient evidence as to the health benefits from treating screen-detected disease and as to the size of the risks associated with having undetected coeliac disease. It is also unclear whether truly asymptomatic screen-detected coeliacs will accept long-term dietary restriction. To answer these questions randomized trials of screening are needed. On current evidence, mass screening cannot be justified. Efficient case-finding may prove as effective and more acceptable.},

   abstract = {Arthritis has often been alluded to as an extra-intestinal clinical manifestation of coeliac disease, but definitive data regarding its prevalence are still lacking. We therefore evaluated the overall prevalence of articular involvement in 200 consecutive adult coeliac patients attending routine gastroenterology follow-up and in 40 controls, and determined whether the prevalence and pattern of articular involvement varied according to the dietary status. An arthritis was present in 26% of patients and in 7.5% of controls, prevalences ranging from 41% in patients on a regular diet to 21.6% in patients on a gluten-free diet (P < 0.005). Arthritis was peripheral in 19 patients, axial in 15 and an overlap of both in 18 subjects. These data suggest that arthritis is much more common than previous reports have indicated, particularly in patients receiving an appropriate dietary regimen, and support the need for combined gastrointestinal and rheumatological follow-up in coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the natural history of lymphocytic gastritis (LG) and its relation to Helicobacter pylori infection and to coeliac disease using serology, duodenal biopsy and a small intestinal permeability test. METHOD: Twenty two patients diagnosed as having LG between 1984 and 1994 were investigated by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at which gastric and duodenal biopsy specimens were taken for histological assessment and immunohistology. Serum was collected for measurement of anti-H pylori, anti-gliadin and anti-endomysial antibodies. A lactulose/mannitol absorption test was performed within one week of endoscopy. Control groups were studied by histology, serology and permeability tests. RESULTS: Three patients had been recently diagnosed as having LG while 15 still had the condition after a mean of 13.9 (range two to 38) months. LG involved the antrum alone in three patients, antrum and body in seven, body alone in six, and gastric remnant in two. Gastroduodenal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were T cells and predominantly of T suppressor (CD8) type. Duodenal IELs were increased compared to age/sex matched controls with chronic gastritis. Four patients had duodenal villous atrophy. Four patients no longer had LG after a mean of 29.3 (10-70) months but had increased gastroduodenal IELs. H pylori was present in four (22%) of 18 patients with LG but H pylori serology was positive in 11 (61%) of 18. There was no difference in seropositivity when compared with age/sex matched controls with dyspepsia. Eleven of 20 patients with LG tested had abnormal lactulose/mannitol absorption (v none of 22 controls with chronic gastritis). Four patients with LG, all with villous atrophy, were seropositive for IgA endomysial antibody. CONCLUSIONS: The persistence of LG with time, the association with increased duodenal IELs and abnormal small intestinal permeability suggests LG may be a manifestation of a diffuse lymphocytic gastroenteropathy related to sensitivity to gluten or some other agent.},

The restoration of the jejunal mucosa in children with celiac disease proceeds rather slowly and with different speeds this being connected with both possible noncompliance of the strict agliadin diet and different susceptibility to gliadin. Complete restoration of the mucosa occurred in few patients.},

Two patients whose initial presentation was adenocarcinoma of the small bowel, but who were subsequently found to have coeliac disease after Whipple's resection, are described. The diagnosis was made early in the postoperative period in the first patient after close histological examination of the tumour-free mucosal margins. This patient was placed on a gluten-free diet and had an uncomplicated postoperative recovery with rapid weight gain. Diagnosis and dietary intervention in the second patient was very delayed and resulted in the development of severe malabsorption and weight loss. This illustrates the importance of ruling out coeliac disease prior to surgery in patients with small intestinal malignancies.},

All biopsies were processed for light and scanning electron microscopy. Conventional histology showed four different morphological aspects: total and subtotal villous atrophy in patients on unrestricted diet, partial villous atrophy and normal mucosa during gluten-free diet. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that in active celiac disease the severity of the intestinal lesions was related to individual vulnerability to gluten. Our results showed that during dietary treatment the process of mucosal healing was constant and strictly time-dependent. Furthermore, the ultrastructural examination has been relevant in evaluating the evolution of the villous regeneration. In this study a classification regarding the healing process of the small intestinal mucosa correlated with the time of start of dietary therapy is proposed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gliadin amino acid sequence(s) responsible for toxicity in susceptible individuals have not been fully elucidated. Previous in vitro studies have suggested the presence of active sequences in the NH(2)-terminal part of the A-gliadin molecule. In this paper the in vitro activity of A-gliadin synthetic peptides 31-55, 31-43, and 44-55 has been investigated. METHODS: Organ culture of jejunal mucosa from untreated and treated coeliac patients was used. In the first system enterocyte height was used as a measure of peptide toxicity; in the second system evidence of activated mucosal cell-mediated immune response was sought. RESULTS: Peptides 31-55 and 31-43 were active on untreated coeliac mucosa at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and peptide 44-55 only at a concentration of 3 mg/ml. In in vitro-cultured treated coeliac mucosa peptides 31-55 and 31-43 at 1 mg/ml and peptide 44-55 at 3 mg/ml were able to induce enhanced epithelial expression of HLA-DR and 4F2 molecules and the appearance of CD25 positive cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that 31-43 and 44-55 A-gliadin peptides are both active, even if to different extents. In vitro systems remain essential tools to screen material to be subsequently tested in vivo.},

At the initial testing, within one year after onset of IDDM, five were positive and 233 were negative. During follow up a further 11 of the initially antibody negative children became positive (6.7%). Jejunal biopsy was performed at the appearance of the autoantibodies and silent coeliac disease was shown in nine (3.8%). One of these children showed on initial biopsy after the onset of IDDM to have normal jejunal mucosal architecture deteriorating later to a flat lesion. Jejunal immunohistochemical studies of another of the patients positive for reticulin autoantibodies but normal on routine biopsy showed an increased density of intraepithelially located gamma/delta T cells and aberrant HLA-DR expression in the crypts pointing to ongoing mucosal inflammation and potential coeliac disease. This study shows that in IDDM patients, reticulin autoantibody negative subjects become antibody positive, which may be followed by coeliac disease. Repeated serological screening and rebiopsy should be considered to detect late developing clinically silent coeliac disease among patients with IDDM.},

AGA and EMA have proved to be an efficient screening method both in populations with gastrointestinal pathologies and in groups of pauci- or even asymptomatic subjects. The clinical picture of beta-thalassemia has gradually altered over the years owing to improved treatment. However, growth is still affected in a considerable proportion of thalassemic patients. A number of hormonal and other causes, combined in varying ways, contribute to determining this clinical condition. The authors report a case of coeliac disease in an adolescent with thalassemia major characterised by anorexia, arrest of weight gain and low stature. The identification of a new association between coeliac disease and thalassemia major highlights the need to search for this pathology in all thalassemic patients who present scarce growth in stature and weight.},

   abstract = {Sera from 88 patients with untreated coeliac disease (54 children and 34 adults), 127 disease controls and 69 healthy controls were tested for anti-gliadin IgA and IgG and anti-endomysium IgA in order to determine the best serological test or the best combination of tests to pick up all the coeliac patients. Only a combination of anti-gliadin IgG and of anti-endomysium IgA affords a 100% sensitivity for coeliac disease. If anti-gliadin IgA was added to the tests, the specificity of the combination gets higher in case of positive anti-gliadin IgA. It appears therefore that it is possible to detect the atypical cases of coeliac disease by a serological screening. This is of major interest in order to begin early dietary treatment of these patients to avoid the development of malignant disorders. The final diagnosis of coeliac disease must however always rely on the results of a small intestinal biopsy.},

The aims of this study were: 1) To evaluate the nutritional status of asymptomatic patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease, and 2) to compare these findings with those of untreated/symptomatic and treated patients. MATERIAL: We examined 41 patients with celiac disease divided into three groups: a) 8 asymptomatic (diagnosed in a study of first-degree relatives of probands), b) 20 untreated/symptomatic patients, and c) 13 treated patients. Nutrition of patients from groups A and B was assessed at the time of diagnosis. METHODS: Nutritional status was evaluated by: 1) body composition (fat and lean mass) by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and 2) anthropometric measurements. RESULTS: Compared with sex and age matched controls (n = 153), asymptomatic patients presented a moderate but significant reduction of the fat compartment (-29%; p < 0.001), but not of the lean-tissue mass (p = NS). Untreated/symptomatic patients showed a more severe depletion of fat (-46%; p < 0.001) and lean mass (-9.0%; p < 0.05) compared with healthy controls. Although fat mass of treated patients was significantly reduced with respect to controls (-24%; p < 0.003), lean mass was not affected. The anthropometric measurements of fat showed a significant correlation with the evaluation by DEXA (multiple regression analysis r = 0.918). CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic patients in our study with an unequivocal diagnosis of celiac disease established by mucosal biopsy exhibited a modified body composition.},

Patients with a BMD < or = 2 SD below age and sex matched normal subjects, had a significantly lower body mass index (21.3 kg.m-2 compared with 25.2 kg.m-2, p < 0.02 Wilcoxon rank sum test) and lower average daily calcium intake (860 mg/day compared with 1054 mg/day, p < 0.05 Wilcoxon rank sum test) than patients with normal bone mineral density. In postmenopausal women with coeliac disease there was a strong correlation between the age at menopause and BMD at both the lumbar spine (r = 0.681, p < 0.01, Spearman's rank correlation) and femoral neck (r = 0.632, p < 0.01). No overall loss of bone was shown over the 12 months of follow up, and relative to the reference population there was a significant improvement in BMD at the lumbar spine in women (p < 0.025, paired t test) and at the femoral neck in men (p < 0.05, paired t test). There was a significant negative correlation between the annual percentage change in BMD at the lumbar spine and the duration of gluten free diet (r = -0.429, p<0.01, Spearman's rank correlation), with the largest gain in BMD in patients with most recently diagnosed coeliac disease. Osteoporosis was shown in 47% of patients with treated adult coeliac disease. Recognised risk factors for osteoporosis in the general population including low body mass index, dietary calcium intake, and early menopause are particularly important in coeliac disease. Treatment of coeliac disease with a gluten free diet probably protects against further bone loss, and in the early stages is associated with a gain in bone mineral density.},

This study aimed to determine bone mineral density in patients studied in the first year after diagnosis of coeliac disease, and to detect changes in bone mineral density over the subsequent year. METHODS: Lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density was measured in 21 adults with coeliac disease, diagnosed and started on a gluten free diet during the preceding year, with dual energy x ray absorptiometry and repeated after 12 months. RESULTS: Bone mineral density was significantly lower in patients than in paired controls (matched for age and sex), at lumbar spine (0.819 g/cm2 compared with 1.021 g/cm2, p < 0.001 Wilcoxon signed rank test) and femoral neck (0.663 g/cm2 compared with 0.794 g/cm2, p < 0.001). Repeat measurement after 12 months demonstrated that patients had a significant gain in bone mineral density at lumbar spine (16.6%/year), and femoral neck (15.5%/year, p < 0.002, Wilcoxon signed rank test at both sites), whereas no significant change in bone mineral density was detected in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of coeliac disease with a gluten free diet is associated with a significant increase in bone mineral density, although patients still had lower bone mineral density than controls.},

We compared serum lipid parameters in controls and in celiac disease patients. The major differences between celiac disease patients and the control group were a diminution of cholesterol and phospholipids in HDL and LDL in the former. These differences persisted after treatment; in addition, a lower level of cholesterol in VLDL was observed. Plasma LpAI and apo A-I levels were significantly lower (-17 and -15%) in celiac disease patients than in controls. Both levels remained low after gluten-free diet. In Algerian patients, treatment with gluten-free diet did not give any return towards normal lipids concentrations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reported frequencies of celiac disease in selective IgA deficiency in childhood vary widely and this is probably due to the different characteristics of the patients studied and to the different criteria used for intestinal biopsy: all patients or only those with symptoms of malabsorption. Diagnosis of celiac disease is of considerable importance in IgA deficiency because of its increased frequency and also because avoidance of dietary gluten permits elimination of the symptoms and complications of celiac disease. OBJECTIVES: To obtain a more reliable estimate of the incidence of celiac disease in childhood IgA deficiency jejunal biopsies were performed in 65 consecutively diagnosed IgA-deficient children whose parents consented. Some clinical and laboratory parameters including IgA-antigliadin and IgG-antigliadin antibodies were evaluated to predict their usefulness in selecting IgA-deficient patients for intestinal biopsy. METHODS: All IgA-deficient patients had serum IgA levels below 5 mg/dL and salivary IgA below 0.5 mg/dL. Jejunal biopsy was performed using a peroral Watson capsule and IgA-antigliadin and IgG-antigliadin antibodies were performed by an ELISA assay. RESULTS: Biopsy findings of severe villous atrophy permitted diagnosis of celiac disease in 7.7% (5/65 children). IgG-antigliadin antibody levels, elevated in 16 patients including all five celiacs, were the best parameter for predicting celiac disease and gave no false negatives. CONCLUSIONS: The 7.7% frequency of celiac disease observed in these IgA-deficient children is about 20 times higher than in the general Italian population, and the lowest among the studies biopsying all patients; this is probably attributable to the presence of a substantial proportion of healthy children (20/65) and very few (2/65) with autoimmune disorders. The elevated sensitivity and negative-predictive value of IgG-antigliadin antibodies lead us to suggest that positive IgG-antigliadin antibodies can be used to select IgA-deficient children for jejunal biopsy with a very low probability of missing celiac disease while allowing a drastic reduction in the number of biopsies performed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of gluten-free diet on mineral and bone metabolism in women with celiac disease and, using the strontium test, to assess intestinal calcium absorption. METHODS: We studied body mass index, biochemical and bone mineral indices, strontium absorption test, and bone mineral density in 18 women (mean age 36.8 yr, range 18-68 yr) with celiac disease at diagnosis and after 12 months of gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Mean strontium absorption at diagnosis was markedly decreased with respect to control values (13.84 +/- 9.03% vs 22.47 +/- 4.21%, p < 0.0001), and 11 of the 18 patients (61%, subgroup A) had low values. In all patients, mean hemoglobin, serum potassium, magnesium, plasma calcium, urinary calcium, and phosphorus were significantly abnormal at diagnosis, whereas only the subgroup A had significantly reduced body mass index, 25 OH vitamin D, and elevated alkaline phosphatase. This subgroup differed in body mass index (p < 0.003) and calciuria (p < 0.035) with respect to the other patients. Strontium absorption correlated with body mass index, calcemia, and 25 OH vitamin D. After the gluten-free diet, all biochemical variables and strontium absorption normalized (23.23 +/- 5.54%), whereas bone mineral density did not change. CONCLUSIONS: At diagnosis, the patients frequently had intestinal calcium malabsorption, as demonstrated by strontium test, with an early renal compensatory mechanism. After the gluten-free diet, the normalization of calcium absorption and the decrease of mid-molecule parathyroid hormone suggested a normalization of mineral metabolism, although a positive effect on bone mineral density was not evident at that time.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) mucosa is flattened despite epithelial hyperproliferation. AIMS: To establish mechanisms of cell loss in CD. PATIENTS: 14 controls, 17 active CD patients, and 16 maintained with gluten free diet. METHODS: Programmed cell death was examined in small intestinal biopsy specimens by staining fragmented DNA using terminal uridine deoxynucleotidyl nick end labelling (TUNEL), in comparison with haematoxylin and eosin stained adjacent sections. Double staining with anti-CD45 antibodies determined the origin of apoptotic cells. Apoptosis was graded from 1-3 (< 5, 5-20, > 20% respectively). Proliferating cells, immunostained by Ki-67 (MIB-1) antibody, were counted. RESULTS: Apoptotic cells were seen rarely by haematoxylin and eosin but more readily by TUNEL. In controls, 1.4 +/- 0.2% of epithelial cells were apoptotic (mean grade 1.1), mainly located in the upper villus. In active CD, frequent apoptotic cells were distributed throughout the crypt-villus unit (mean grade 2.4), decreasing after treatment to 1.1 (p < 0.001) even when still histologically abnormal. CD45 antibodies rarely stained apoptotic cells in active CD. The number of TUNEL positive cells correlated with proliferating cell number (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Enterocyte apoptosis is greatly increased in untreated CD, correlates with proliferation, and falls to normal with a gluten free diet, before histological improvement. Increased apoptosis may be responsible for villous atrophy in CD.},

To investigate if food peptides can exert direct effects on class II expression, the influence of gliadins, casein, and beta lactoglobulin on an intestinal epithelial cell line (HT-29) was examined in the absence of immune cells. Class II expression was determined by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against the beta chain of all products of the gene subregions DR, DQ, and DP. MHC expression was low in HT-29 cells but could be stimulated by interferon gamma. Tryptin digested gliadin had no effect on class II expression. In the presence of interferon gamma, however, it was able to amplify MHC class II expression to mean (SEM) 150 (4)%. Casein exerted a similar effect (160 (14)%), but undigested gliadin, tryptin digested casein, and beta lactoglobulin had no influence. The observations suggest that within the concert of cytokine mediated interactions between enterocytes and lymphocytes, some dietary peptides could upregulate the presentation of food antigens, leading to a more efficient stimulation of lymphocytes, which in the case of coeliac disease might result in damage to the enterocytes.},

Age of patients at presentation with neurological signs varied from 7 to 67 yr. In one patient, the neurological disability developed before the diagnosis of celiac disease, whereas, in the other three, it occurred from months to 16 yr after the diagnosis had been established. One patient died of rapidly progressive neuromyopathy. The other three patients had combinations of cerebellar and posterior and lateral column abnormalities. All four patients developed neurological complications despite a strict gluten-free diet. In three of four patients, there was no improvement in duodenal histology on this diet. Treatment with vitamin B12, folic acid, or vitamin D failed to reverse the changes. No other nutritional deficiencies were found. Vitamin E levels were normal in two of three patients. One patient had no response to treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. The mechanisms responsible for these neurological complications are poorly understood, although patients whose duodenal histology fails to improve on a gluten-free diet may be at greater risk. There have been no real advances in the understanding of this condition since the original description nearly 30 yr ago.},

This disease is characterized by changes in the mucosal lining of the small intestine. The mucosal lining is damaged by protein fragments of gliadin, which is found in gluten (wheat, rye, barley, oats), and the small intestine is unable to carry out its main functions of digestion and absorption. The treatment for this disease is to discontinue gluten from the diet permanently. Once gluten is removed from the diet, the small intestine begins to heal itself. As the healing process continues, digestion and absorption resume. Celiac Sprue does not go away. A gluten-free diet must be maintained for the rest of one's life.},

Fecal fatty acids were analyzed by the gas chromatographic method. Fecal fat excretion by normal individuals was 1.7 +/- 1.0 (Mean +/- SD) g/day (range, 0.4-4.9 g/day). Steatorrhea was therefore defined as fecal fat excretion that exceeded 5.0 g/day. The patients with CP were divided into three groups: non-steatorrhea (fecal fat < 5.0 g/day), chemical steatorrhea (fecal fat > or = 5 g/day and no appearance of fatty stool), and manifest steatorrhea (evaluated from the appearance of fatty stool). In addition, we investigated the correlation between fecal fat excretion and pancreatic exocrine function, obtained by the pancreozymin-secretin (or secretin) test in 24 controls and 30 CP patients. Fecal fat excretion by CP patients was 9.1 +/- 8.8 g/day, which was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than that of controls. There were 28 (65%) CP patients with steatorrhea. Of these, 15 (35%) showed chemical steatorrhea and 13 (30%) manifest steatorrhea. In CP patients, the fecal mass (250.5 +/- 133.6 g vs control, 125.6 +/- 52.5 g), fecal fat concentration (3.40 +/- 2.16 g% vs control, 1.48 +/- 0.89 g%), and coefficient of fat absorption (77.3 +/- 20.2% vs control, 97.2 +/- 1.7%) all showed significant differences from the controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Faecal fat excretion was reduced by 2.9 g (range, 1.7 to 5.0 g) in group I; 8.8 g (range, 2.9 to 39.9 g) in group II; 10.8 g (range, 2.3 to 21.8 g) in group III; and 4.3 g (range, 3.6 to 5.6 g) in group IV. The pancreatic digestive enzyme preparation was more effective than sodium bicarbonate and agents that raise the pH of the upper small intestine (such as proton-pump inhibitors) in reducing faecal fat excretion. The results indicate that all of the preparations used are effective against mild pancreatic steatorrhoea. If the condition is more advanced, however, a massive dosage of pancreatic digestive enzyme and possibly the combined use of an agent to raise the pH of the upper small intestine are likely to be effective.},

   abstract = {A retrospective and prospective study was carried out on 54 children with gluten intolerance recognized 5-10 years ago. Coeliac disease (CD) was confirmed in 44 (81.5%) patients. The clinical picture in the observed children showed an evolution during the period of analysis. Intestinal symptoms are rare in adolescence (33%) while they are always present in the youngest children (initial diagnosis). At the time of the follow-up analysis, 67% of the patients demonstrated parenteral symptoms, mainly in the osteoarticular system, CNS, skin, mucous membranes and in only 33% children were the intestinal symptoms present. Over one third of the patients demonstrated body weight and height deficiency, 73% of boys and 39% of girls in age of pubescence had no maturity features. Neurological disorders were present in almost two thirds of the cases and about 5% of the children showed an evident mental retardation. Disruption of the gluten-free diet, frequent dietary errors and ineffective cooperation of the parents are the most probable reasons for physical and mental disturbances in the studied children. The obtained therapeutic results call for the creating of multi-disciplinary active care for children with gluten intolerance.},

   abstract = {The role played by extrinsic nerves in colonic motor activity and motor coordination between the small intestine and the colon in the fasting state was investigated in a canine model. To evaluate motor activity before and after celiac and superior mesenteric ganglionectomy (CSMG), seven strain gauge force transducers were implanted in the small and large bowels of five dogs. No significant differences were observed in the frequency, duration, cycle, or migration time of bursts of contractions from the colon (BCC), or in the duration of the quiescent state before and after CSMG. When small intestinal phase III activity reached the ileocecal junction before and after CSMG, a characteristic contractile pattern, namely, small intestinal phase III activity followed by BCC, was observed at the ileocecal junction. Before and after CSMG, 84% and 83% of the small intestinal phase III activity, respectively, was transmitted to the colon as BCC after reaching the ileocecal junction. However, only 19% and 18% of BCC before and after CSMG, respectively, followed small intestinal phase III activity. These results led us to conclude that the extrinsic nerves exert little effect on fasting colonic motor activity and motor transmission from the small intestine to the colon.},

   abstract = {Nutrition and intestinal function are intimately interrelated. The chief purpose of the gut is to digest and absorb nutrients in order to maintain life. Consequently, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease commonly results in malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality. For example, studies have shown that 50-70% of adult patients with Crohn's disease were weight-depleted and 75% of adolescents growth-retarded. On the other hand, chronic malnutrition impairs digestive and absorptive function because food and nutrients are not only the major trophic factors to the gut but also provide the building blocks for digestive enzymes and absorptive cells. For example, recent studies of ours have shown that a weight loss of greater than 30% accompanying a variety of diseases was associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%, villus atrophy and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption. Finally, specific nutrients can induce disease, for example, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, whilst dietary factors such as fibre, resistant starch, short-chain fatty acids, glutamine and fish-oils may prevent gastrointestinal diseases such as diverticulitis, diversion colitis, ulcerative colitis, colonic adenomatosis and colonic carcinoma. The role of dietary antigens in the aetiology of Crohn's disease is controversial, but controlled studies have suggested that elemental diets may be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing a remission in patients with acute Crohn's disease. In conclusion, nutrition has both a supportive and therapeutic role in the management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. With the development of modern techniques of nutritional support, the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic GI disease can be reduced. On the other hand, dietary manipulation may be used to treat to prevent specific GI disorders such as coeliac disease, functional bowel disease, Crohn's disease and colonic neoplasia. The future development of nutria-pharmaceuticals is particularly attractive in view of their low cost and wide safety margins.},

   abstract = {A substantial minority of patients with coeliac disease (estimated at anything between 7 and 30%) fail to respond to treatment with a gluten-free diet. Non-responsiveness may be primary, that is when the patient fails to respond to treatment following initial diagnosis, or secondary, when a patient who has previously had a documented response to gluten exclusion becomes non-responsive to therapy. The commonest cause of non-responsiveness is continued gluten ingestion, either voluntary or inadvertent. Other causes to be considered include intolerances to dietary constituents other than gluten (e.g. milk, soya), pancreatic insufficiency, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and ulcerative jejunitis. There is some evidence that ulcerative jejunitis is, in fact, a manifestation of lymphoma. The most important steps in the management of the non-responsive coeliac patient are (a) to determine whether the patient is indeed coeliac, (b) to exclude lymphoma and (c) to establish the cause of the non-responsiveness. In those coeliac patients with no demonstrable cause for non-responsiveness, a variety of therapeutic stratagems (mostly based on small, uncontrolled studies) have been described; these include elimination diets, dietary supplementation with zinc and copper, and pharmacological therapy in the form of steroids, azathioprine and cyclosporin. In a minority of non-responsive patients, the clinical course is characterized by a rapid decline, and total parenteral nutrition is required. None of the therapies described above has been subjected to rigorous controlled studies. The precise mechanisms of non-responsiveness in coeliac patients need to be unravelled before rational therapeutic approaches can be established.},

EMA was assessed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay using monkey esophageal sections as a substrate in 22 active CD, 17 non-active CD, and 22 non-CD children. EMA titers were correlated with small bowel mucosal pathology. Sensitivity and specificity of EMA were 100%. EMA levels are diet dependent, increasing on a gluten-containing diet and decreasing with gluten withdrawal after 3-12 months. EMA is a reliable marker for the diagnosis of CD, and reflects gluten intake changes and patients' dietary compliance. In our laboratory, EMA is suitable for the diagnosis and follow-up of CD.},

In the present study salivary and serum IgA-AGA were measured by an ELISA test in 10 untreated patients with DH. The results were compared to IgA-AGA levels in nine patients with DH on a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) and in 20 healthy control subjects on an ordinary diet. The mean serum but not salivary IgA-AGA concentrations were significantly higher in the untreated than in the patients with DH on a long-term GFD. When the 10 untreated patients with DH adhered to a GFD for 3 months, the rash disappeared and the mean serum IgA-AGA decreased to normal levels, but no change was found in the mean salivary IgA-AGA concentration. These results show that serum but not salivary IgA-AGA measurements are suitable for monitoring GFD treatment in patients with DH. The discrepancy between the serum and salivary IgA-AGA concentrations suggests that systemic and salivary IgA-AGA responses are controlled separately.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is a permanent gluten intolerance strongly associated with HLA class II antigens and possibly showing milder changes of mucosal architecture. Ten patients with symptoms suggesting celiac disease and serum antiendomysium antibodies with normal mucosal architecture were studied. METHODS: Immunohistochemical detection of mucosal immune activation and HLA typings were performed. RESULTS: Mucosal immune activation, with normal mucosal architecture and normal gamma/delta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes counts, was found on a gluten-containing diet. In 3 of 6 patients, multiple biopsy specimens showed one sample with severe villous atrophy. Clinical and immunomorphologic features were strictly gluten dependent. The mucosal immune activation was elicited in vitro by gliadin. Only 4 patients had the typical HLA typing of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-sensitive celiac-like symptoms may occur in patients with serum antiendomysium antibodies, apparently normal intestinal mucosa, and HLA typing not commonly associated with celiac disease. These patients should undergo multiple biopsies, and signs of immunologic activation should be sought accurately; in the presence of mucosal immune activation, a trial with a gluten-free diet should be encouraged to detect gluten dependency. In vitro immunologic response of small intestinal mucosa to gliadin may support the diagnosis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy.},

   abstract = {A cross sectional study was undertaken to examine the relationship between coeliac disease and bone mineral density. The 135 female coeliac patients registered on the database of the Department of Gastroenterology at Hull Royal Infirmary were approached by letter, advising them of a potential risk of osteoporosis and inviting them to undergo bone densitometry. A total of 81 registered women (60%) attended the Osteoporosis Laboratory, Princess Royal Hospital and underwent dual energy x ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck. Historical data relating to the time of diagnosis and adherence to a gluten free diet were obtained. A control group was selected from the local normal population and was first matched for height, weight, and menopausal status. Postmenopausal patients were then further matched to controls of equivalent menopausal age. In coeliac patients, bone mineral density expressed in g/cm2 as mean (SD) was significantly lower at the lumbar spine (1.076 (0.186)) than in the control group (1.155 (0.143), p < 0.001). This was also the case at the femoral neck (0.887 (0.142) versus 0.965 (0.127), p < 0.001). When the coeliac patients were stratified by menopausal status, it was found that femoral neck bone mineral density was significantly below control values in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Spinal bone mineral density exhibited a significant decrement only in the postmenopausal group. The age at diagnosis of coeliac disease and adherence to a gluten free diet did not influence bone mineral density at either hip or spine. These results confirm coeliac patients' higher risk of osteopenia. Coeliac disease should be added to the list of medical conditions which constitute an indication for bone densitometry in order that the individual risk of osteoporosis related fracture may be determined.},

Compared with controls patients show at diagnosis a significant increase of serum phosphate (P = 0.025) and a decrease of calcitonin levels (P = 0.02), whereas serum calcium is slightly lower and parathyroid hormone higher with serum levels above normal range in 5 of the coeliac patients (20.8%). During the three months of gluten free diet we find a significant increase of calcemia values (ANOVA: P = 0.025) together with a decrease of serum phosphate (ANOVA: P = 0.009) and of parathyroid hormone levels (ANOVA: P = 0.042). No significant change was found in vitamin D metabolites levels. The Authors conclude that coeliac disease affect clearly mineral metabolism. Actually the tendency to hypocalcemia, due to abnormalities of the intestinal mucosa, and the comparative iperphosphatemia, cause in some patients a compensatory increase of PTH levels. This increase seems to be the cause of the osteoporotic lesions described in current literature. Rickets due to the lack of vitamin D does not occur.},

Another interesting group consists of asymptomatic patients with a positive serology for AGA and AEA antibodies, but normal gastrointestinal biopsy with free diet; they develop later in life, mucosal atrophy and normalization after gluten free diet ("latent" coeliac disease). It must be emphasized that classes of antibodies (in association with peroneal biopsy) have been identified in the last years, new clinical presentations of coeliac disease and new associations with other autoimmune pathologies.},

Duodenal biopsy specimens were stained with MI-B1 antibody using an immunoperoxidase method. Positive stained crypt cells were counted and their position within each intact crypt column was noted. These were used to construct proliferation index distribution curves for each cell position from which the crypt growth fraction for each group of patients was calculated. The crypt growth fraction was found to be higher in the untreated CD group (0.57) than in the treated patients (0.39) and the controls (0.44). The mean (SEM) proliferative index for each crypt was significantly higher in the untreated group (42.3 (10.8)%; p < 0.05) than in the treated CD (21.7 (8.5)%) and control (19.7 (7.5)%) groups and correlated closely with the surface:volume index and enterocyte cell height measurements in all three groups. An increased growth fraction may contribute to other changes in crypt cell kinetics to produce the histological changes seen in untreated CD.},

We therefore performed a prospective study to determine the incidence and clinical presentation of celiac disease in Jordanian children. A total of 34 (12 boys and 22 girls) cases were diagnosed over a period of 36 months. Nine cases were clustered in three families. The incidence was calculated to be 1:2,800 live births. The mean age at presentation was 4.6 years (range 0.3-13), but it was 8.4 years at the time of diagnosis. Diarrhea was the main initial symptom in 15 (44%) patients. Other signs and symptoms included recurrent abdominal pain in five patients (14%), short stature in four (12%), abdominal distension in three (9%), constipation in three (9%), pallor and recurrent mouth ulcers in two patients each. At the time of diagnosis, 24 (71%) had hypochromic microcytic anemia, and nine (26%) had rickets. The relatively high incidence of celiac disease may be related to the large wheat consumption in this population (135 kg/head/year), and the late onset could be related to the widespread prevalence of prolonged breast-feeding in Jordan (12 months) and late introduction of cereals (6.2 months) in children with late presentation. The delay in diagnosis might be due to the presence of other diseases clinically resembling celiac disease in our community.},

After 1 year on GFD, no significant difference was found between patients and controls in all the parameters studied except in height and arm muscle area, which, however, were very near to the normal expected. Serum hemoglobin, iron, and zinc values were below the normal range in more than one half of patients at diagnosis and within the normal range in almost all of them after 1 year of GFD. Serum hemoglobin, iron, zinc, triglycerides, proteins, albumin, and calcium values significantly rose during the year of GFD. A year of GFD in celiac children allows a virtually complete return in body mass composition.},

This review outlines fascinating epidemiological aspects and the risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus. While in the Western world the effects of alcohol and tobacco are substantial preconditions, worldwide other factors, such as diet, nutritional deficiencies, environmental exposure and infectious agents (especially papillomavirus and fungi), play a significant role. Chronic irritation of the oesophagus appears to participate in the process of carcinogenesis, particularly in patients with thermal and/or mechanical injury, achalasia, oesophageal diverticulum, chronic lye stricture, radiation therapy, injection sclerotherapy and gastric resection before the appearance of oesophageal tumour. The association of Plummer-Vinson syndrome, coeliac disease, tylosis and scleroderma with oesophageal cancer has also been reviewed.},

Only two years later, when the patient had developed fatty stools, flatulence and weight loss, diagnosis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) was confirmed by small-intestine biopsy. This case report illustrates that in adults GSE can be oligosymptomatic for long periods. In cases of osteomalacia or rare intestinal T-cell lymphoma a detailed history of bowel movements, inspection of stools, quantification of fat excretion in stools and laboratory tests for malabsorption are recommended. Positive antibodies against gliadin, endomysium and reticulin may support the diagnosis of GSE. However, intestinal biopsy is necessary to verify the presence of GSE. In view of the unspecific histological changes, a follow-up biopsy is recommended in oligosymptomatic cases. Serial measurements of antibodies allow supervision of compliance for a diet strictly free of gluten. In addition, lactose containing milk products need to be restricted initially because of secondary lactase deficiency.},

   abstract = {Osteoporosis and magnesium (Mg) deficiency often occur in malabsorption syndromes such as gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE). Mg deficiency is known to impair parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and action in humans and will result in osteopenia and increased skeletal fragility in animal models. We hypothesize that Mg depletion may contribute to the osteoporosis associated with malabsorption. It was our objective to determine Mg status and bone mass in GSE patients who were clinically asymptomatic and on a stable gluten-free diet, as well as their response to Mg therapy. Twenty-three patients with biopsy-proven GSE on a gluten-free diet were assessed for Mg deficiency by determination of the serum Mg, red blood cell (RBC) and lymphocyte free Mg2+, and total lymphocyte Mg. Fourteen subjects completed a 3-month treatment period in which they were given 504-576 mg MgCl2 or Mg lactate daily. Serum PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and osteocalcin were measured at baseline and monthly thereafter. Eight patients who had documented Mg depletion (RBC Mg2+ < 150 microM) underwent bone density measurements of the lumbar spine and proximal femur, and 5 of these patients were followed for 2 years on Mg therapy. The mean serum Mg, calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase concentrations were in the normal range. Most serum calcium values fell below mean normal and the baseline serum PTH was high normal or slightly elevated in 7 of the 14 subjects who completed the 3-month treatment period. No correlation with the serum calcium was noted, however. Mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and osteocalcin concentrations were also normal. Despite only 1 patient having hypomagnesemia, the RBC Mg2+ (153 +/- 6.2 microM; mean +/- SEM) and lymphocyte Mg2+ (182 +/- 5.5 microM) were significantly lower than normal (202 +/- 6.0 microM, p < 0.001, and 198 +/- 6.8 microM, p < 0.05, respectively). Bone densitometry revealed that 4 of 8 patients had osteoporosis of the lumbar spine and 5 of 8 had osteoporosis of the proximal femur (T-scores < or = -2.5). Mg therapy resulted in a significant rise in the mean serum PTH concentration from 44.6 +/- 3.6 pg/ml to 55.9 +/- 5.6 pg/ml (p < 0.05). In the 5 patients given Mg supplements for 2 years, a significant increased in bone mineral density was observed in the femoral neck and total proximal femur. This increase in bone mineral density correlated positively with a rise in RBC Mg2+. This study demonstrates that GSE patients have reduction in intracellular free Mg2+, despite being clinically asymptomatic on a gluten-free diet. Bone mass also appears to be reduced. Mg therapy resulted in a rise in PTH, suggesting that the intracellular Mg deficit was impairing PTH secretion in these patients. The increase in bone density in response to Mg therapy suggests that Mg depletion may be one factor contributing to osteoporosis in GSE.},

The hypothesis of this study was that rapid transit carcinoid diarrhea in association with steatorrhea results in impairment of gastric emptying. METHODS: Fifteen patients with carcinoid diarrhea without prior gastrointestinal resection or whose small bowel resection was limited to < 100 cm of ileum were studied. Gastrointestinal transit was measured scintigraphically with a standardized meal. Percentage of ingested fat excretion was calculated. RESULTS: Mean length of small bowel resected was 33 cm, and mean 24-hour urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid was 120 mg. Fourteen patients had increased daily stool weights, and 10 had increased stool fat excretion (mean, 13%). Transit was accelerated in the small bowel in 14 and in the colon in all patients. The lag time for gastric emptying was prolonged in 2 patients who had no previous resection. Gastric emptying rate was accelerated in 5, normal in 7, and delayed in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ileal and colonic brakes do not seem to delay gastric emptying in patients with carcinoid diarrhea associated with rapid transit and mild to moderate steatorrhea.},

A second biopsy was repeated 8-30 months after beginning a gluten-free diet, along with EmA and AGA determinations and the dietary inquiry. Both EmA and AGA were appraised by indirect immunofluorescence on monkey esophagus and rat kidney, respectively. Intestinal biopsy was graded according to Cooke's criteria. After gluten withdrawal, intestinal mucosa reverted to normal in only nine patients. Both EmA and AGA showed high positive but low negative predictive values on intestinal histologic outcome. The positive predictive value of admission of dietary lapses was 100%, whereas the negative predictive value was 39.1%. Neither serologic markers nor dietary inquiries are to be regarded as reliable predictors of intestinal outcome after a gluten-free diet. Biopsy remains the best means of ascertaining mucosal recovery.},

It was clear that the mucosal lesions observed in children and adults were identical and responded similarly to gluten withdrawal. In fact, in 1970 the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition instituted the practice of a challenge after diagnosis. A relapse of clinical symptoms and of the intestinal lesions after gluten was reintroduced into the diet demonstrated the "permanent" nature of sensitivity to gluten in children with celiac disease. Twenty-five years later, the permanence of the sensitivity of the intestinal mucosa to gluten is again a matter of debate. Several lines of evidence, gathered during recent years, show that celiac disease is not always a lifelong condition. First, the long-term follow-up of children with proven celiac disease shows that 10% to 20% of them become "tolerant" (defined on clinical, biological and histologic grounds) to gluten during adolescence. Second, it has also been shown, in individual cases, that the mucosal lesions typical of the disease may appear during adulthood. Our increasing knowledge of the long-term evolution of the disease suggests that celiac disease develops and, in some cases, fades in a predisposed group of people with intestinal sensitivity to gluten, which is probably a common condition. The factors leading to the appearance or disappearance of the disease, however, are still unknown.},

   abstract = {Epithelial barrier function and ion transport was studied in coeliac sprue using a miniaturised Ussing device for measurements on diagnostic aspiration biopsy specimens from the jejunum of untreated or gluten free nourished sprue patients, or from healthy controls. Pure epithelial resistance (Re) indicating epithelial barrier function was determined by transmural alternating current impedance analysis. It was reduced by 56% in acute sprue mean (SEM) (9 (1) omega.cm2) compared with controls (20(2) omega.cm2). In gluten free nourished sprue patients Re was only partly recovered (15 (1) omega.cm2). Subepithelial resistance (Rsub) was also changed from 28 (1) omega.cm2- in control to 17 (1) omega.cm2 in acute sprue because of the change in mucosal architecture, but was unchanged in gluten free nourished sprue patients (29 (4) omega.cm2). In acute sprue, unidirectional Na+ and Cl- fluxes were increased in both directions as a consequence of the decreased resistance. However, short circuit current (ISC) as well as Na+ and Cl- net fluxes were not significantly different from control. Subsequently, the electrogenic Cl- secretory system was investigated. After maximal stimulation with theophylline and prostaglandin E1, a Cl(-)-dependent increase in ISC was obtained in the sprue mucosa and control jejunum. It showed saturation characteristics and was blockable by serosal bumetanide. When compared with control, neither Km nor Vmax of this electrogenic Cl- secretion was significantly changed in coeliac sprue. In conclusion, a miniaturised Ussing device was used for transport measurements on intestinal biopsy specimens. In acute coeliac disease, the epithelial barrier of the jejunum was seriously disturbed. The active electrogenic Cl- secretory transport system was present in the sprue mucosa, but was not activated in the Ussing chamber in vitro when compared with control jejunum.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of infertility, abortions and perinatal mortality, age at menarche and menopause in coeliac disease. METHOD: This was a case control study in which patients and controls, matched for age and sex, were sent questionnaires about their fertility profile and other obstetric and gynaecological problems. All 80 patients and 70 controls replied, but only 68 pairs could be matched for this study. RESULTS: The mean age of menarche in patients was significantly older (13.6 years) than in controls (12.7 years). The mean ages at menopause in patients and controls were 47.6 and 50.1 years, respectively. The mean number of children born to patients was significantly less at 1.9 (SD +/- 0.9) compared to 2.5 (SD +/- 1.2) in controls. Before diagnosis the mean number of children born to patients was 1.4 and 1.8 in controls. After diagnosis and treatment, patients had 0.5 children (SD +/- 0.9) compared to 0.7 in controls (SD +/- 1.2). It seems likely that the overall difference in fertility is due to relative infertility prior to diagnosis and its correction by a gluten-free diet. Significantly more conceptions amongst women with coeliac disease (15%) ended in miscarriage prior to diagnosis than amongst controls (6%). After diagnosis and treatment the rate of miscarriage was similar. There were 120 live babies and 7 stillbirths to patients compared with 161 live babies and 1 stillbirth to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD are subfertile and have an increased incidence of stillbirths and perinatal deaths.},

METHODS: Eight to 14 jejunal biopsy specimens were obtained from each of 8 treated and 7 untreated coeliac patients and 5 normal controls and cultured for 18 h in organ culture with test peptide (1 mg/ml) or medium alone. Mean enterocyte cell heights (ECH) were compared with paired values for specimens grown in medium alone. RESULTS: A significant reduction in the mean of the ECH values for each of the patient groups was observed with peptide A and FFIII in both treated (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively) and untreated (p = 0.03 and 0.01) coeliac patients when compared with tissue incubated with medium alone. No significant changes in the mean ECH value were noted in any of the patient groups in tissue incubated with peptide B, peptide C, or ovalbumin as compared with those with medium alone. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that peptide A is toxic in vitro to the jejunal mucosa of both treated and untreated coeliac patients, correlating with recent findings that this peptide exacerbates coeliac disease in vivo.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: While gynaecological and obstetric disorders have been reported among women with coeliac sprue, their true prevalence and relationship to the coeliac disease process has not been completely elucidated. Our aims were to determine: (1) the prevalence of gynaecological and obstetric problems in patients with coeliac disease and the influence of strict gluten restriction on their occurrence, (2) the effect of pregnancy on the clinical course of coeliac disease and (3) the clinical features of those patients with onset of coeliac disease during pregnancy and the puerperium. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The gynaecological and obstetric history of 130 coeliac patients and 130 age-matched healthy female controls were compared in a case-control study. RESULTS: In comparison to the controls, untreated coeliac disease patients exhibited significantly later menarche, an earlier menopause, an increased prevalence of secondary amenorrhoea and a greater incidence of spontaneous abortions. Patients who had adhered, in the long term, to a gluten-free diet had gynaecological and obstetric history indistinguishable from controls. Clinical deterioration of coeliac disease was observed in untreated patients during 17% of their pregnancies. In 14% of those untreated patients who were pregnant symptoms related to coeliac disease were manifested for the first time during either pregnancy (n = 7) or the puerperium (n = 4). Nine of these patients had underestimated features suggestive of coeliac disease. CONCLUSION: The early diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease may avoid significant gynaecological and obstetric complications in affected women. Celiac sprue must always be borne in mind among patients who develop diarrhoea and weight loss during pregnancy and/or the puerperium.},

In this study IgM, IgG and IgA rheumatoid factor was measured in 89 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and 22 patients with coeliac disease and compared with 89 normal controls. There was an increased prevalence of elevated IgA rheumatoid factor in the patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (13.5%; p = 0.036) and coeliac disease (18.2%; p = 0.078), while no such increase was found for the IgM or IgG rheumatoid factor isotypes. This selective increase of IgA rheumatoid factor suggests that rheumatoid factor production in patients with gluten sensitivity primarily results from immunological activation in the gut mucosa.},

Protocols have now been tested prospectively by one laboratory. Eighty-eight Tuebingen patients were studied (47 coeliac disease on normal diet, 22 coeliac disease on a gluten-free, and 19 disease controls). Single tests did not produce acceptable levels, but combinations of IgA gliadin antibodies and IgA endomysium antibodies showed 98% sensitivity, 100% specificity and 98% predictive efficiency. Only standardized and refereed methods established by ring testing can serve as a reliable basis for serological coeliac screening.},

   abstract = {Mucosal surfaces covered by a layer of epithelial cells represent the largest and most critical interface between the organism and its environment. The barrier function of mucosal surfaces is performed by the epithelial layer and immune cells present in the mucosal compartment. As recently found, epithelial cells, apart from their participation in absorptive, digestive and secretory processes perform more than a passive barrier function and are directly involved in immune processes. Besides the well known role of epithelial cells in the transfer of polymeric immunoglobulins produced by lamina propria B lymphocytes to the luminal content of mucosals (secretory Igs), these cells were found to perform various other immunological functions, to interact with other cells of the immune system and to induce an efficient inflammatory response to microbial invasion: enzymic processing of dietary antigens, expression of class I and II MHC antigens, presentation of antigens to lymphocytes, expression of adhesive molecules mediating interaction with intraepithelial lymphocytes and components of extracellular matrix, production of cytokines and probable participation in extrathymic T cell development of intraepithelial lymphocytes. All these functions were suggested to influence substantially the mucosal immune system and its response. Under immunopathological conditions, e.g. during infections and inflammatory bowel and celiac diseases, both epithelial cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes participate substantially in inflammatory reactions. Moreover, enterocytes could become a target of mucosal immune factors. Mucosal immunosurveillance function is of crucial importance in various pathological conditions but especially in the case of the most frequent malignity occurring in the intestinal compartment, i.e. colorectal carcinoma. Proper understanding of the differentiation processes and functions of epithelial cells in interaction with other components of the mucosal immune system is therefore highly desirable.},

   abstract = {Gluten-sensitive enteropathy is induced by dietary wheat gliadin and related proteins in genetically susceptible individuals. Most evidence suggests that the mucosal lesion represents an immunologically mediated injury triggered by gluten in the context of a particular assortment of major histocompatibility complex genes. The amino acid residues of gliadin and related proteins responsible for toxicity have not been identified; in vitro systems are available, but definitive conclusions must rely on in vivo jejunal challenges. At a conservative estimate, symptomatic gluten-sensitive enteropathy affects approximately 1 in 1000 individuals in Europe; however, it is now becoming clear that a greater proportion of individuals has clinically silent disease, and probably many others have a minor form of the the enteropathy. In most countries, the clinical presentation has changed over the past few years coming closer to the adult type of the disease, and the age of onset of symptoms is shifting upward. Liver, joint, hematologic, dental, and neurologic symptoms are increasingly being recognized. Several diseases are associated the gluten-sensitive enteropathy, such as IgA deficiency, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and a range of other autoimmune diseases. Tests based on the measurement of antigliadin and antiendomysium antibodies have gained success as noninvasive screening tests; however, the ultimate diagnosis still is based on the finding of a severe histologic lesion of the jejunum while the patient is on a gluten-containing diet and on its disappearance once the gluten is excluded from the diet. A lifelong, strict GFD is mandatory for celiac children. Among other long-term problems, an increased risk of intestinal lymphoma has been reported in patients on a normal gluten-containing diet.},

   abstract = {Under the umbrella of coeliac disease (CD), or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, the concepts of silent, latent and potential CD have recently been introduced. While silent CD is marked by severe damage to the jejunal mucosa in the absence of clinical symptoms, both latent and potential CD are characterized by jejunal mucosa that would be reported as normal by most clinical pathologists in an individual on a gluten-containing diet. As opposed to potential coeliac patients, latent subjects sometimes in their life have had a flat jejunal biopsy which recovered on a gluten-free diet. Latent coeliac patients are often symptomatic; neither high titres of gliadin antibodies nor mucosal changes (including raised intraepithelial lymphocyte counts) are obligate features of latent CD, although the presence of elevated endomysial antibodies is probably the best predictor of progression towards villous atrophy. The term potential CD has been proposed for those subjects who do not have, and have never had, a jejunal biopsy consistent with overt CD, and yet have immunological abnormalities similar to those found in coeliac patients. Good markers of potential CD include the presence of serum endomysial antibodies, a high count of intraepithelial lymphocytes and subtle pathological alteration such as increased density of intraepithelial lymphocytes expressing gamma delta T cell receptor, signs of activated mucosal cell-mediated immunity, coeliac-like intestinal antibody pattern, and positive rectal gluten challenge.},

   abstract = {Adolescents with celiac disease often fail to adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. The value of endomysial antibodies in assessing the dietary compliance of such adolescents has been assessed in 23 patients divided into four groups according to their daily gluten intake. Serum endomysial antibodies were absent in all subjects on a gluten-free diet and consistently present in those ingesting > 2 g/day of gluten. Only one of six and three of six teenagers with celiac disease with an intake of < 0.5 and 0.5-2 g/day, respectively, had endomysial antibodies in their serum, despite the presence in three of six and five of six of significant changes in the mucosal architecture, as shown by computerized morphometry of jejunal biopsies. In conclusion, endomysial antibodies cannot be considered a valid marker for slight dietary transgressions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Immunoglobulin (Ig) A-class anti-endomysium antibodies are superior to other current antibody tests for detecting coeliac disease. We aimed to evaluate the suitability of human oesophagus for the determination of anti-endomysium antibodies. DESIGN: The specificity of monkey and human oesophageal tissue as antigenic substrate were compared using indirect immunofluorescence analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 159 individuals were studied: 56 patients with biopsy-proven coeliac disease (39 with active disease) and 103 controls. The patients' IgA-class anti-endomysium antibodies were compared using unfixed cryostat sections of human and monkey oesophagus. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed with an initial serum sample dilution of 1:5, and if positive, the highest dilution yielding a positive reaction was reported. RESULTS: The anti-endomysium antibody test was positive in 38 out of 39 patients with active coeliac disease using monkey oesophagus (sensitivity 97%) and in all 39 patients with active coeliac disease using human oesophagus (sensitivity 100%). Ten out of 17 coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet had positive anti-endomysium antibodies using monkey oesophagus and 12 using human oesophagus as the antigenic substrate. This test was negative in all 103 controls using both substrates. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that human oesophageal tissue can be used instead of monkey tissue for determining anti-endomysium antibodies. Human tissue is a more sensitive antigenic substrate than monkey oesophagus and can be used to determine low titres of antibodies. Improving the diagnostic sensitivity of the anti-endomysium antibody test would make an important contribution to screening for coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the sugar absorption test (SAT) during follow-up of patients with coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet (GFD) correlates with improvement of the villous architecture of the small intestine. METHODS: The SAT was performed in coeliacs at diagnosis and during follow-up with GFD. For the SAT, a solution of lactulose (L) and mannitol (M) was given to the fasting patient and the L-M ratio calculated in a 5-hour urine sample by gas chromatography: ratios > 0.089 are considered abnormal. The solution was made hyperosmolar by adding sucrose (1560 mmol/l). RESULTS: The L-M ratio was 2-3 times higher at diagnosis than either at 8 months to 2 years gluten free, or beyond 2 years gluten free, consecutively. The L-M ratio (mean, range) was significantly higher in cases of biopsies with (sub)total villous atrophy (VA) (0.388, 0.062-0.804, n = 28), partial VA (0.240, 0.062-0.841, n = 18) and villous irregularity (0.143, 0.017-0.322, n = 29) than in case of normalized histology after GFD (0.085, 0.021-0.230, n = 19). The rate of normalization of functional integrity was slower in adults than in children, demonstrated by a combination of histology and SAT. CONCLUSION: The SAT correlates well with the degree of VA. It is important for daily clinical practice that the simple and non-invasive SAT can be used as an indicator of intestinal damage, thus influencing need for and timing of intestinal biopsies.},

   abstract = {Coeliac sprue is a relatively frequent disease with protean clinical manifestations. Recent studies suggest that gastrointestinal motor abnormalities may explain some symptoms complained of by such patients. We investigated whether coeliac patients have oesophageal motor abnormalities from both a clinical and a physiological point of view. Thirty-six consecutive adult sprue subjects (14 during the florid phase and 22 on gluten-free diet) were studied. A clinical questionnaire on gastrointestinal symptoms (with emphasis on those of oesophageal origin) was administered. Moreover, 18 patients (13 on free and five on gluten-free diet) gave their consent for oesophageal manometry and eight subjects for pH-metry also. Oesophageal clinical symptoms were compared with those of 144 age- and sex-matched controls from a general population sample, and manometry with that of 34 healthy volunteers. Of coeliac patients 50% complained of dysphagia (P < 0.001 vs. controls) and 14% noncardiac chest pain (P = NS vs. controls). Manometric examination showed motor abnormalities in 67% of the subjects examined, consisting of nutcracker oesophagus, hypotonic lower oesophageal sphincter associated with simultaneous contractions, and frequent repetitive (> 3 peaks) contractions. These abnormalities were equally distributed among free and gluten-free diet patients. pH-metry showed only one pathological reflux out of eight subjects studied. We conclude that patients with coeliac sprue may display abnormal oesophageal motility. This confirms previous studies suggesting that gastrointestinal motor abnormalities should probably be added to the clinical spectrum of the disease.},

   abstract = {To evaluate the effects of a gluten free diet on bone mineral density in untreated adult patients with coeliac disease, 63 patients (17-79 years, 35 women) were examined at diagnosis and after one year taking a gluten free diet. Bone mineral density was measured in the forearm using single photo absorptiometry and in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter using dual energy x ray absorptiometry. The values for each patient were compared with those of 25 healthy controls, matched for sex, age, and menopausal state. Before being given a gluten free diet bone mineral density in the total group was reduced at all sites (p < 0.001). Age adjusted bone mineral density was inversely correlated with age. During the first year taking a gluten free diet bone mineral density increased at all sites (p < 0.01). This was seen in patients of all ages and in patients who were without symptoms of malabsorption (weight loss or diarrhoea) before treatment. Low bone mineral density in patients with untreated coeliac disease increases rapidly when treatment with a gluten free diet is followed. These findings emphasise the importance of early diagnosis and treatment in all patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To correlate the radiologic, histopathologic, and clinical findings in patients with celiac disease after treatment with a glutenfree diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pretreatment and follow-up enteroclysis radiographs from 15 adult patients with known celiac disease were reviewed. Diagnosis of celiac disease was made at adult age. Changes in small-bowel morphology were determined by comparing enteroclysis findings before and after treatment with a gluten-free diet and were correlated with histopathologic and clinical findings. RESULTS: Eight of 15 patients (group I) showed increased small-bowel abnormalities. All patients had increased symptoms, and all but one, whose condition had deteriorated, showed stable disease at biopsy. Group II patients (five of 15) showed improvement at follow-up enteroclysis. Biopsy findings showed improvement in small-bowel morphology in four patients and no change in one. Clinically, four patients showed improvement, and one had stable disease. Group III patients (two of 15) showed no change from initial to follow-up enteroclysis. Both showed partial atrophy, which was consistent with biopsy findings. In all patients, clinical symptoms correlated better with enteroclysis results (r = .48; P < .005) than they did with follow-up biopsy results (r = .18). True celiac disease-related malignancies and coexisting tumors occurred in 10 of 15 patients. CONCLUSION: Enteroclysis appears to be more reliable than does biopsy in evaluation of response to a gluten-free diet in adults with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Free radicals have been suspected to play a role in the pathogenicity of alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to determine the status of several antioxidant parameters in these patients and examine the factors that are likely to influence them. Thirty-five subjects (23 males and 12 females, mean age 48 +/- 8 years) with disease proven by endoscopic pancreatography and 14 healthy controls (6 males and 8 females, mean age 44 +/- 7 years) were included in the study. Biochemical antioxidant parameters included: selenium, zinc, and copper levels in plasma; glutathione peroxidase in plasma and erythrocytes; plasma malondialdehyde concentrations assessed by thiobarbituric acid reactants; and serum vitamin E and A levels. Selenium and vitamin E oral intake was assessed by a five-day diet analysis. Hemoglobin (130 +/- 16 vs 143 +/- 15 g/liter), vitamin E (8 +/- 5 vs 16 +/- 9 mg/liter), vitamin A (30 +/- 11 vs 49 +/- 12 micrograms/dl), selenium (54 +/- 20 vs 87 +/- 11 micrograms/liter), and plasma glutathione peroxidase (903 +/- 313 vs 1326 +/- 168 units/liter) were significantly lower in patients than in controls (P < 0.05). In contrast, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and plasma copper levels were significantly higher in patients than in controls. Cholesterol, triglycerides, iron, ferritin, total proteins, zinc, and malondialdehyde were not different. Vitamin E was lower in patients with steatorrhea, while vitamin A was lower in patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus. Dietary intakes were not different between patients and controls. In conclusion, patients with alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis have low blood levels in many antioxidant factors. Dietary intakes of some of them (selenium and vitamin E) are adequate, however. Such deficiencies are secondary to pancreatic insufficiency and probably to increased requirements related to enhanced oxidative stress.},

Twenty-four relatives who had normal results of screening tests were selected at random for biopsy; 35 relatives with at least one abnormal test result were biopsied. Eleven relatives were noted to have villous atrophy at biopsy; the diagnosis of celiac sprue was confirmed by histological improvement after gluten-free diet in six. AGA-G, alpha 1-AT CL, and EmA had sensitivities of 73%, 73%, and 64%, respectively, with very high levels of specificity. Sensitivity was improved by the combination of two serological markers (AGA-G + alpha 1-AT CL = 91%; AGA-G + EmA = 82%; EmA + ARA = 82%). Furthermore, combination of EmA and ARA has shown the best specificity and positive predictive value. AGA-G, alpha 1-AT CL, and EmA are reliable individual markers for the detection of asymptomatic celiac sprue. However, a combination of two of them, including ARA, was more sensitive than the individual tests.},

Several mechanisms have been proposed including vitamin deficiency, vascular inflammation and a direct effect of gluten intolerance. Typical nerve fiber damage due to demyelinization has been suggested. We observed a 65-year old woman with a right peroneal nerve palsy superimposed on a diffuse peripheral neuropathy who was found to have folic acid deficiency which in turn led to the diagnosis of adult celiac disease. Electrophysiological and histological studies demonstrated a predominantly demyelinating peripheral neuropathy which responded first to parenteral folic acid supplementation and second to a gluten-free diet. The mechanisms of peripheral nerve damage in adult celiac disease are briefly discussed and the possible role of folic acid deficiency is emphasized.},

Gastric permeability can now be assessed by a sucrose test, and intestinal permeability measured by a lactulose/mannitol test is increased in untreated celiac patients. The aim of this study was to prospectively compare gastric and intestinal permeability with histological changes of the stomach and small bowel in patients with celiac disease. METHODS: Gastric and intestinal permeability were measured by oral or duodenal (during endoscopy) administration of a triple sugar solution containing 20 g sucrose, 10 g lactulose, and 5 g mannitol in 100 mL water in 43 adult patients with celiac disease (28 without diet) and in 30 healthy controls. Endoscopical biopsy specimens were taken from the antrum and distal duodenum and investigated for intraepithelial lymphocyte counts. RESULTS: Urinary sucrose excretion decreased after duodenal administration (n = 8) as opposed to oral administration and thus measured gastric permeability in celiac disease. Gastric permeability was elevated in 60% of the celiac patients and correlated with antral intraepithelial lymphocyte counts. Intestinal permeability (measured by a lactulose/mannitol test) was also elevated in 69% of the celiac patients and correlated with duodenal intraepithelial counts. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of lymphocytic gastritis in untreated celiac disease associated with elevated gastric permeability. Celiac disease seems to be a general disorder of the gastrointestinal tract associated with disturbed permeability.},

   abstract = {We have developed a dorsal intracranial surgery that is minimally invasive and gives excellent access to either afferent or efferent vagal rootlets to produce selective deafferentations or deefferentations in the rat. We have combined this new unilateral afferent rhizotomy with a contralateral celiac branch cut (to completely deafferent the intestines) and a duodenal catheter placement 4 cm distal to the pylorus. Animals were maintained with 17 h/day access to a nutritionally complete liquid diet. Measures of first meal size, daily intake, and body weight before and after both surgeries indicated that animals with unilateral vagal deafferentiations recovered as fast and completely as sham-operated controls. Intraduodenal oleate (1.2 kcal) infusions reduced the size of the first meal in surgical controls (by 64%; P < 0.01) but not in the deafferented rats. A dual wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase/Fluorogold protocol provides verification of sensory and motor lesions. The selective vagal deafferentation provided by the new surgery offers a useful model for determining gastrointestinal sites of nutrient detection and separating pre- and postabsorptive consequences of a meal.},

   abstract = {Patients with coeliac disease may present with calcium malabsorption but it is unclear whether this results in longterm impairment of bone mineralisation. Dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to study bone mineral density in 34 asymptomatic coeliac disease patients, treated with a gluten free diet for at least two years, and also in 10 newly diagnosed or untreated patients. As expected, untreated patients had low bone mineral density in all regions. In the 29 treated female coeliac disease patients, overall mean values for age adjusted bone mineral density expressed as Z scores were normal although there were many patients with low values, particularly of the lumbar spine and total body. Scores in the postmenopausal patients were significantly worse than in the premenopausal patients and low mean Z scores were found in the five treated male patients. The subjects who had reduced bone mineral density could not be predicted clinically but, despite being asymptomatic, were more likely to have subtotal or partial villous atrophy on small intestinal biopsy (p < 0.0275). In conclusion, although many treated coeliac disease patients have normal bone mineral density, suboptimally treated and newly diagnosed or untreated patients have osteopenia. To reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures, it is recommended that bone mineral density be measured in all treated coeliac disease patients and those with osteopenia have a repeat intestinal biopsy to assess disease activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Small-intestinal organ culture was used as an in vitro model of coeliac disease, studying biopsy specimens from patients with coeliac disease, cow's milk allergy, and controls. METHODS: Organ culture incubations were done using the pure gliadin peptide B3144 (amino acid sequences 3-56 of alpha-type gliadins) and a control peptide from casein (amino acid sequences 152-193 of alpha s1-casein). The importance of using negative controls was stressed by non-specific tissue damage. By reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of organ culture supernatants, 27 specimens were further investigated. RESULTS: There was good retrieval of peptide calibration peaks after culture. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of chromatography runs showed degradation of at least 29% of B3144 and 37% of Cas-P. Normal mucosa (controls and coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet) was able to hydrolyse peptide fractions completely, whereas incubation with damaged mucosa (coeliac disease, cow's milk allergy) left initial peptides. CONCLUSION: It is concluded, using a pure single gliadin peptide, that deficient peptide hydrolysis in coeliac disease was a secondary event.},

SETTING: Hospital based. PATIENT: A 60-year-old Caucasian man presenting with weakness caused by hypokalaemic rhabdomyolysis secondary to coeliac disease. INTERVENTIONS: Following the diagnosis by jejunal biopsy, the patient was treated with both intravenous and oral potassium supplements, and a gluten-free diet. OUTCOME MEASURES: Resolution of weakness and restitution of normal villous architecture following treatment. RESULTS: The patient's myopathy responded to the potassium supplements, his diarrhoea and histological changes resolved while on the gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: Patients with coeliac disease may present with hypokalaemia in association with steatorrhoea. If potassium loss is rapid, rhabdomyolysis may occur. Coeliac disease should be considered a cause of malabsorption-induced hypokalaemic rhabdomyolysis.},

   abstract = {Neoplasms constitute the major complication of coeliac disease, and high-grade T-cell lymphoma of the small intestine (enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma) is the most common neoplasm in this category. HLA genotyping indicates that in patients with enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma have the coeliac disease associated DQA1*0501, DQB1*0201 phenotype, although additional HLA-DR/DQ alleles may represent risk factors for lymphoma development. Molecular biological and immunohistochemical studies have shown that the intestinal mucosa distant from the tumour contains clonal populations of small T cells, often of the same clone as the high-grade T-cell lymphoma. These findings suggest that enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma arises in the setting of coeliac disease and evolves from reactive intraepithelial lymphocytes through a low-grade lymphocytic neoplasm to a high-grade tumour, which is usually the cause of the presenting symptoms. Most cases of chronic ulcerative enteropathy (ulcerative jejunitis) are probably part of the same disease process. If the ulceration occurs at a time when the neoplastic T-cells are of a low grade, morphological recognition of tumour cells in the ulcers may be impossible. Carcinoma of the pharynx and oesophagus, and adenocarcinoma of the small intestine, are increased in frequency in patients with coeliac disease. The increased risk of carcinoma of the oesophagus may be related to vitamin A deficiency. A number of reports have indicated an increased prevalence of various types of chronic hepatitis in patients with coeliac disease, but no coherent view of the cause of this association has emerged. Similarly, patients with coeliac disease have been reported to have various forms of fibrosing lung disease of uncertain causation. In recent years, there have been several reports, mainly from Italy, of a syndrome of epilepsy and bilateral brain calcification occurring in coeliac patients. The pathogenesis of this condition is not known and its prevalence in other communities is uncertain. Splenic atrophy occurs frequently in patients with coeliac disease and is related to the severity of the disease and degree of dietary control. Splenic atrophy predisposes to infection with capsulated bacteria, although mortality studies indicate that infection with these organisms is not a major cause of death in patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth retardation may be the only clinical manifestation of undiagnosed chronic intestinal disease. Therefore we have to consider also this etiology in the differential diagnosis of classical causes of short stature in children with typical clinical and laboratory findings. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 168 patients aged 5.5-17.2 years up to June 1, 1993 on the records of the Paediatric Clinic in Olomouc on account of marked growth retardation (< or = 2 SDS) associated with retarded bone age were eight children where based on screening for antigliadin antibodies the suspicion of coeliac disease was expressed. By introduction of a gluten-free diet the growth rate improved markedly in almost all patients already during the first six months. After a one-year follow-up it increased to 9.0 +/- 1.1 cm from 3.9 +/- 1.3 cm, and concurrently a corresponding progression of ossification occurred. An exception was only a 14-year-old girl who did not comply and did not adhere to the diet. CONCLUSION: In the early diagnosis of oligosymptomatic coeliac disease with a low growth rate as the dominant symptom a key role is played by assessment of antibodies against gliadin. If the results are positive, enterobiopsy is indicated which alone can confirm the diagnosis. Dietetic provisions (a gluten-free diet) improve the growth rate and bone maturation.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a strongly heritable gastrointestinal illness that is an especially important model of the genetically complex multifactorial immune mediated diseases. The HLA component of celiac disease (a specific HLA-DQ heterodimer)is largely established and is relatively uncomplicated, and the environmental component (gluten and related grain storage proteins in the diet) is remarkably well understood. Previous family studies of celiac disease suggested that there is at least one important non-HLA locus. This locus may be a stronger genetic factor than HLA, and it apparently has a recessive mode of inheritance. We used a three step genome screening protocol to identify loci that contribute to celiac disease in the western counties of ireland, a region with the highest prevalence of celiac disease in the world. The most significant of several possible non-HLA loci that we found was on chromosome 6p about 30 cM telomeric from HLA. It has a multipoint maximum lod score of 4.66 (compared with 4.44 for HLA-DQ) and appears to have a recessive mode of inheritance. Our study localizes and provides strong evidence for linkage of at least one non-HLA locus to celiac disease and may serve as a prototype for an efficient approach to screening the human genome for loci that contribute to complex diseases.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is triggered by ingestion of wheat gliadin and is probably immune mediated. There is evidence by light microscopy that expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules is increased in the small intestinal epithelium of patients with untreated coeliac disease and that gliadin can be taken up by small intestinal enterocytes. The pathway by which gliadin is transported to class II MHC proteins has not been demonstrated. Using an immunogold technique and thin frozen sections of jejunal biopsy specimens, gliadin, HLA-DR antigens, and IgA were localised at an ultrastructural level in the jejunal epithelium of patients with both untreated and treated coeliac disease and controls. Cathepsin D was used as a marker for late endosomes or lysosomes. The results show that gliadin is translocated into vacuoles positive for HLA-DR antigens as well as cathepsin D in jejunal enterocytes of patients with untreated coeliac disease. Secretory IgA may have a role in this translocation of gliadin, which is a specific event that occurred only in jejunal enterocytes from patients with untreated coeliac disease but not in a patient maintained on a gluten free diet or in controls. These results support a central role for epithelial cells of the human intestinal mucosa in the transport of gliadin to an HLA-DR positive compartment which precedes antigen presentation of gliadin to antigen sensitive T lymphocytes.},
