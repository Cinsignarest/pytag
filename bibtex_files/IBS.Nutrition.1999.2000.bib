   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Non-adrenergic imidazoline binding sites (IBS) were described as pharmacologically distinct from alpha2-adrenergic receptors. Recently it was shown that the human placenta is the richest source of IBS, however, no function has been assigned to this new putative receptor. As concerns the presence of alpha2-adrenoceptors in the human placenta, it was reported that no alpha2-receptors were detected in human placental membranes with the radiolabelled alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist [3H]rauwolscine or the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist [3H]clonidine. This scientific contradiction has been solved when the authors have recently demonstrated that IBS and alpha2-adrenoceptors coexist in human term placental membranes. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Scientific literature does not provide any information regarding the ontogeny of IBS. The present study intended to determine the density of IBS and alpha2-adrenoceptors in correlation with gestational age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human first and second trimester placentas (6-10 and 14-18 weeks of gestation, respectively) were obtained immediately following the interruption of gestation, third trimester placentas (38-40 weeks) were obtained after normal vaginal delivery. Human placental membrane fractions were prepared and radioligand binding assays were performed in duplicate, using [3H]RX 821002 and [3H]RX 781094 (idazoxan) as radioligands. RESULTS: According to the results of the binding assays, the concentration of alpha2-adrenoceptors decreased with the advancing gestational age. In contrast with this pattern, the density of IBS significantly increased. CONCLUSION: Our present results demonstrated that the density of IBS shows a significantly increasing tendency throughout gestation. The unique position of the placenta between maternal and fetal circulations determines its function as a mediator in transport mechanisms. The increasing expression of IBS in the growing placenta might suggest a role for these sites in the mediation of the transport of nutrients, ions, etc.},

   abstract = {The lining of the gastrointestinal tract is the largest vulnerable surface that faces the external environment. Just as the other large external surface, the skin, is regarded as a sensory organ, so should the intestinal mucosa. In fact, the mucosa has three types of detectors: neurons, endocrine cells, and immune cells. The mucosa is in immediate contact with the intestinal contents so that nutrients can be efficiently absorbed, and, at the same time, it protects against the intrusion of harmful entities, such as toxins and bacteria, that may enter the digestive system with food. Signals are sent locally to control motility, secretion, tissue defense, and vascular perfusion; to other digestive organs, for example, to the stomach, gallbladder, and pancreas; and to the central nervous system, for example to influence feeding behavior. The three detecting systems in the intestine are more extensive than those of any other organ: the enteric nervous system contains on the order of 10(8) neurons, the gastroenteropancreatic endocrine system uses more than 20 identified hormones, and the gut immune system has 70- 80% of the body's immune cells. The gastrointestinal tract has an integrated response to changes in its luminal contents. When this response is maladjusted or is overwhelmed, the consequences can be severe, as in cholera intoxication, or debilitating, as in irritable bowel syndrome. Thus it is essential to obtain a full understanding of the sensory functions of the intestine, of how the body reacts to the information, and of how neural, hormonal, and immune signals interact.},

This has major financial implications for the health care industry. Traditional physicians frequently are unaware of CAM use by their patients, and there are potential interactions between CAM and traditional forms of medical therapy. Many of the medicinal CAM agents have been used for their postulated anti-inflammatory and/or antifibrotic effects. CAM is especially frequently used in patients with chronic diseases. This review discusses CAM use in three types of chronic gastrointestinal diseases--liver disease, irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia, and inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {When clinicians label a child as having a functional disorder, there is often a pejorative connotation that the symptoms are psychological, imagined, or faked. These symptoms range from chronic abdominal pain to recurrent headaches to fatigue. We say the complaints are functional because we are unable to demonstrate any structural or biochemical abnormality causing them. The degree to which we go searching for these abnormalities varies from case to case and often depends on our own clinical experience, insecurities, and demands of the patient's family. Labeling a child as having a functional complaint can put a tremendous burden on the child and family, because if this concept is presented improperly (as implied above), it can suggest that it is their fault there are symptoms and that if they "got their act together" the symptoms would melt away. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined as conditions in which a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms are present in the absence of demonstrable disease. There may indeed be physiologic abnormalities underlying the symptoms, but at the present time we are unable to detect them. We make a diagnosis based on symptoms, not on demonstrable abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory tests. A number of common pediatric diagnoses fall into this category, including infant regurgitation, chronic nonspecific diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia, infant dyschezia, and functional constipation. This paper presents a brief review of our current understanding of each diagnosis and gives suggestions for management.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dyspepsia is poorly characterized in the pediatric population. The goal of the current study was to describe the clinical constellation and natural history of dyspepsia in children and adolescents seen in a pediatric gastroenterology practice. METHODS: A standardized questionnaire was administered by a pediatric gastroenterologist to all subjects 5 or more years of age (and their parents or guardians) treated in a referral pediatric gastroenterology practice for 1 month or more of abdominal pain or discomfort, nausea, or vomiting. Subjects with dyspepsia and dyspepsia subtypes (ulcer-like, dysmotility-like) were identified by using previously defined adult criteria. Evaluation and treatment were performed at the discretion of the attending pediatric gastroenterologist. RESULTS: During a 1-year period, 257 patients were screened with 127 subjects fulfilling criteria for dyspepsia (59% girls, 85% white; median age, 11.7 years; median duration of symptoms, 8 months). Symptoms were ulcer-like in 26% and dysmotility-like (nausea predominance) in 15% of subjects. In those with dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux were noted in 24% and 43%, respectively. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and biopsy were performed in 56 subjects with 21 (38%) having mucosal inflammation (Helicobacter pylori in 5). The remaining 35 subjects (62%) were considered to have functional dyspepsia. Duration of symptoms less than 1 year and vomiting were risk factors for mucosal inflammation. Follow-up at 6 months to 2 years revealed 70% of subjects were either asymptomatic or much improved regardless of the cause of dyspepsia. CONCLUSION: Most children and adolescents with dyspepsia do not have serious disease. In our referral population H. pylori infection was unusual, and no peptic ulceration was found. Most subjects with functional dyspepsia have improvement of symptoms over time.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fructose malabsorption is characterized by the inability to absorb fructose efficiently. As a consequence fructose reaches the colon where it is broken down by bacteria to short fatty acids, CO2 and H2. Bloating, cramps, osmotic diarrhea and other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are the consequences and can be seen in about 50% of fructose malabsorbers. We have previously shown that fructose malabsorption is associated with early signs of mental depression and low serum tryptophan concentrations. It was therefore of interest whether a fructose-reduced diet could not only improve gastrointestinal complaints but also depressive signs seen in fructose malabsorbers. METHODS: Fifty-three adults (12 males, 41 females), who were identified as fructose malabsorbers according to their breath-H2 concentrations, filled out a Beck's depression inventory-questionnaire, and a questionnaire with arbitrary scales for measurement of meteorism, stool frequency and quality of life for a 4-week period before dietary intervention and 4 weeks after dietary change as for fructose- and sorbitol-reduced diet. RESULTS: Depression scores were reduced by 65.2% after 4 weeks of diet (P < 0.0001), and there was a significant reduction of meteorism (P < 0.0001) and stool frequency (P < 0.01). Improvement of signs of depression and of meteorism was more pronounced in females than in males. CONCLUSION: Fructose- and sorbitol-reduced diet in subjects with fructose malabsorption does not only reduce gastrointestinal symptoms but also improves mood and early signs of depression.},

   abstract = {Fructose and lactose malabsorption are characterized by impaired duodenal fructose transport or by the deficiency of mucosal lactase, respectively. As a consequence, the nonabsorbed saccharides reach the colon, where they are broken down by bacteria to short fatty acids, CO2, and H2. Bloating, cramps, osmotic diarrhea, and other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are the consequence and can be seen in about 50% of carbohydrate malabsorbers. We have previously shown that fructose as well as lactose malabsorption were associated with signs of mental depression. It was therefore of interest to investigate possible interactions between fructose and lactose malabsorption and their influence on the development of signs of depression. In all, 111 otherwise healthy volunteers (81 females and 30 males) with gastrointestinal complaints were analyzed by measuring breath H2 concentrations after an oral dose of 50 g lactose and of 50 g fructose one week apart. They were classified as normals, isolated fructose malabsorbers, isolated lactose malabsorbers, and combined fructose/lactose malabsorbers. All patients filled out a Beck's depression inventory-questionnaire. Twenty-five individuals (22.5%) were neither fructose nor lactose malabsorbers (group 1), 69 (62.2%) were only fructose malabsorbers (group 2), 4 (3.6%) were only lactose malabsorbers (group 3), and 13 (11.7%) presented with fructose and lactose malabsorption together (group 4). Isolated fructose malabsorption and combined fructose/lactose malabsorption was significantly associated with a higher Beck's depression score. Further analysis of the data show that this association was strong in females (P < 0.01), but there was no such association between carbohydrate malabsorption and early signs of depression in males. In conclusion, the data confirm that fructose malabsorption may play a role in the development of mental depression in females and additional lactose malabsorption seems to further increase the risk for development of mental depression.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interest in fructooligosaccharides as a health-promoting food component is increasing. Fructooligosaccharides are mainly indigestible and large amounts in the colon may provoke gastrointestinal symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be provoked by large quantities of carbohydrates in the colon. The objective of this study was to determine whether regular consumption of fructooligosaccharides worsens gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS. DESIGN: A multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group comparison was conducted at 24 sites. The study consisted of a 2-wk, single-blind run-in phase and a 12-wk, double-blind comparative phase. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 20 g fructooligosaccharides powder/d (n = 52) or a placebo (n = 46). Efficacy was based on the patients' overall response to treatment at completion of the study and on the severity and duration of individual symptoms (abdominal distension, abdominal rumbling, abnormal flatulence, and abdominal pain). RESULTS: Data from 96 patients (16 men and 80 women) were analyzed. After 4-6 wk of treatment, IBS symptoms improved more in the placebo group than in the fructooligosaccharide group. After completion of the study, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups: symptoms improved in 58% of the fructooligosaccharide group and in 65% of the placebo group and symptoms worsened in 8% of the fructooligosaccharide group and in 13% of the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Although symptoms worsened in patients with IBS at the onset of treatment with 20 g fructooligosaccharides/d, continuous treatment for 12 wk resulted in no worsening of symptoms.},

   abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to provide a clear and balanced account of the role of the various forms of psychotherapy in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It commences with an account of the philosophical basis for psychotherapy, attempting to integrate the concepts of autonomic arousal, repression, conversion and a developmental disorder of thinking and emotional expression. These concepts are used to explain why separation and loss can lead to the development of IBS and how the gut is such an important vehicle for emotional expression. Against this background the role and philosophy of relaxation therapy, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, cognitive behavioural therapy and analytical psychotherapy are discussed. These therapies describe a philosophical approach that is quite different from biomedical treatments in that it attempts to harness the patient's own powers for recovery. For that reason the efficacy of psychotherapies cannot be evaluated by randomized controlled trials. Psychotherapies rely on the relationship between therapist and patient and vary according to whether the locus of responsibility lies mainly with the therapist or mainly with the patient. Different patients may well require different therapies.},

   abstract = {The use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. Probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. There is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. However, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. Currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp. However, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., Bacteroides sp., Bacillus sp., Propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. Some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. Probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including Clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea caused by rotavirus, Shigella, Salmonella, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, Helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. Probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. There are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. Probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.},

In clinical practice, diagnosis is based on positive symptoms known as the Rome criteria and limited diagnostic screen, taking into account warning features suggestive of organic disease. Minimal diagnostic tests are warranted to rule out structural lesions in a cost-effective manner and to convince the patient of the diagnosis of IBS. An initial diagnosis of IBS is safe and rarely needs revision over time. Persistence of symptoms is to be expected and does not justify suspicion of other diagnoses. Only change in the clinical pattern over time justifies additional investigations. Other diagnostic evaluations depend on predominant symptoms, namely constipation, diarrhea, and pain or discomfort. It should be emphasized that although an initial "positive diagnosis" is safe to exclude other diseases with similar symptoms, a common disorder such as IBS may often coexist with other asymptomatic disorders.},

   abstract = {Lactose malabsorption and lactase deficiency are chronic organic pathologic conditions characterized by abdominal pain and distention, flatulence, and the passage of loose, watery stools. Though malabsorption of the sugar lactose is determinable by breath hydrogen test or jejunal biopsy, intolerance can only be confirmed by challenge with lactose-containing food, the response to which may not be immediate. The difficulty of making a positive diagnosis of these conditions has led to a proportion of lactose-intolerant patients being misdiagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which has a remarkably similar symptom complex and for which there is no current pathophysiologic marker. The incidence of the two disorders is approximately equal, but the actual proportion of patients with IBS incorrectly diagnosed in this way varies as a function of the methodology used. Once correct diagnosis is established, introduction of a lactose-free dietary regime relieves symptoms in most patients. Symptom similarity and the resultant incorrect diagnosis of IBS may explain the refractory nature of some patients labeled as IBS who remain largely unaware of the relationship between food intake and symptoms.},

   abstract = {One of the most topical areas of human nutrition is the role of the gut in health and disease. Specifically, this involves interactions between the resident microbiota and dietary ingredients that support their activities. Currently, it is accepted that the gut microflora contains pathogenic, benign and beneficial components. Some microbially induced disease states such as acute gastroenteritis and pseudomembranous colitis have a defined aetiological agent(s). Speculation on the role of microbiota components in disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, bowel cancer, neonatal necrotising enterocolitis and ulcerative colitis are less well defined, but many studies are convincing. It is evident that the gut microflora composition can be altered through diet. Because of their perceived health-promoting status, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are the commonest targets. Probiotics involve the use of live micro-organisms in food; prebiotics are carbohydrates selectively metabolized by desirable moieties of the indigenous flora; synbiotics combine the two approaches. Dietary intervention of the human gut microbiota is feasible and has been proven as efficacious in volunteer trials. The health bonuses of such approaches offer the potential to manage many gut disorders prophylactically. However, it is imperative that the best methodologies available are applied to this area of nutritional sciences. This will undoubtedly involve a genomic application to the research and is already under way through molecular tracking of microbiota changes to diet in controlled human trials.},

   abstract = {Dietary lifestyle is relevant for prevention and treatment of various colorectal conditions. Colorectal disorders have significant morbidity and mortality in a western-style community, particularly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colorectal cancer, haemorrhoids, constipation and diverticular disease. This review addresses how bowel health can be maintained, what foods and dietary lifestyles are associated with risk for disease and what foods are of real value in management. Bowel health is that state where the individual is satisfied with defaecation, the diet does not create undue risk for disease and lumenal contents maintain an intact and functional mucosa. Bowel health depends on a healthy dietary lifestyle, but in particular on an adequate intake of non-digestable dietary polysaccharide. Diet influences biology in part by altering the lumenal environment. Effects such as high butyrate levels, lowered pH, a predominance of 'healthy'over 'unhealthy' bacteria, rapid intestinal transit, high faecal bulk, a non-leaky epithelial barrier, adsorption of dietary carcinogens by fibre, low bile salt concentrations, reduced generation of toxic bile salts or protein derivatives and provision of certain bioactive substances are seen as beneficial. Diet influences future risk for colorectal cancer (vegetables, animal fats, polysaccharides amongst others) and for diverticular disease (fibre). Adequate fibre and resistant starch can improve constipation and anorectal conditions such as fissure and haemorrhoids. The role of diet in managing patients with IBS is complex. Fibre may worsen symptoms in severe cases of IBS, diverticular disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Certain carbohydrates of limited digestibility/absorbability, such as lactose, fructose and sorbitol, can precipitate IBS symptoms. Low fat, high fibre diets may reduce recurrence of colorectal adenomas. Diet has a significant role to play in colorectal disorders.},
