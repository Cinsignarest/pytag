   abstract = {UNLABELLED: OBJECTIVE OF ANALYSIS: The objective of this evidence-based evaluation is to assess the accuracy of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease in subjects with symptoms consistent with this disease. Furthermore the impact of these tests in the diagnostic pathway of the disease and decision making was also evaluated. CELIAC DISEASE: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that develops in genetically predisposed individuals. The immunological response is triggered by ingestion of gluten, a protein that is present in wheat, rye, and barley. The treatment consists of strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Patients with celiac disease may present with a myriad of symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, dermatitis herpetiformis, among others. SEROLOGIC TESTING IN THE DIAGNOSIS CELIAC DISEASE: There are a number of serologic tests used in the diagnosis of celiac disease. Anti-gliadin antibody (AGA)Anti-endomysial antibody (EMA)Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG)Anti-deamidated gliadin peptides antibodies (DGP)Serologic tests are automated with the exception of the EMA test, which is more time-consuming and operator-dependent than the other tests. For each serologic test, both immunoglobulin A (IgA) or G (IgG) can be measured, however, IgA measurement is the standard antibody measured in celiac disease. DIAGNOSIS OF CELIAC DISEASE: According to celiac disease guidelines, the diagnosis of celiac disease is established by small bowel biopsy. Serologic tests are used to initially detect and to support the diagnosis of celiac disease. A small bowel biopsy is indicated in individuals with a positive serologic test. In some cases an endoscopy and small bowel biopsy may be required even with a negative serologic test. The diagnosis of celiac disease must be performed on a gluten-containing diet since the small intestine abnormalities and the serologic antibody levels may resolve or improve on a GFD. Since IgA measurement is the standard for the serologic celiac disease tests, false negatives may occur in IgA-deficient individuals. INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE: The incidence and prevalence of celiac disease in the general population and in subjects with symptoms consistent with or at higher risk of celiac disease based on systematic reviews published in 2004 and 2009 are summarized below. INCIDENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION: ADULTS OR MIXED POPULATION: 1 to 17/100,000/year CHILDREN: 2 to 51/100,000/yearIn one of the studies, a stratified analysis showed that there was a higher incidence of celiac disease in younger children compared to older children, i.e., 51 cases/100,000/year in 0 to 2 year-olds, 33/100,000/year in 2 to 5 year-olds, and 10/100,000/year in children 5 to 15 years old. PREVALENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION: The prevalence of celiac disease reported in population-based studies identified in the 2004 systematic review varied between 0.14% and 1.87% (median: 0.47%, interquartile range: 0.25%, 0.71%). According to the authors of the review, the prevalence did not vary by age group, i.e., adults and children. PREVALENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE IN HIGH RISK SUBJECTS: Type 1 diabetes (adults and children): 1 to 11%AUTOIMMUNE THYROID DISEASE: 2.9 to 3.3%FIRST DEGREE RELATIVES OF PATIENTS WITH CELIAC DISEASE: 2 to 20% PREVALENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE IN SUBJECTS WITH SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH THE DISEASE: The prevalence of celiac disease in subjects with symptoms consistent with the disease varied widely among studies, i.e., 1.5% to 50% in adult studies, and 1.1% to 17% in pediatric studies. Differences in prevalence may be related to the referral pattern as the authors of a systematic review noted that the prevalence tended to be higher in studies whose population originated from tertiary referral centres compared to general practice. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What is the sensitivity and specificity of serologic tests in the diagnosis celiac disease?What is the clinical validity of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease? The clinical validity was defined as the ability of the test to change diagnosis.What is the clinical utility of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease? The clinical utility was defined as the impact of the test on decision making.What is the budget impact of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease?What is the cost-effectiveness of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease? METHODS: LITERATURE SEARCH: A literature search was performed on November 13(th), 2009 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1(st) 2003 and November 13(th) 2010. Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer and, for those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles with unknown eligibility were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist, then a group of epidemiologists until consensus was established. The quality of evidence was assessed as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE methodology. Inclusion Criteria Inclusion CriteriaExclusion CriteriaStudies that evaluated diagnostic accuracy, i.e., both sensitivity and specificity of serology tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease.Study population consisted of untreated patients with symptoms consistent with celiac disease.Studies in which both serologic celiac disease tests and small bowel biopsy (gold standard) were used in all subjects.Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, prospective observational studies, and retrospective cohort studies.At least 20 subjects included in the celiac disease group.English language.Human studies.Studies published from 2000 on.Clearly defined cut-off value for the serology test. If more than one test was evaluated, only those tests for which a cut-off was provided were included.Description of small bowel biopsy procedure clearly outlined (location, number of biopsies per patient), unless if specified that celiac disease diagnosis guidelines were followed.Patients in the treatment group had untreated CD.Studies on screening of the general asymptomatic population.Studies that evaluated rapid diagnostic kits for use either at home or in physician's offices.Studies that evaluated diagnostic modalities other than serologic tests such as capsule endoscopy, push enteroscopy, or genetic testing.Cut-off for serologic tests defined based on controls included in the study.Study population defined based on positive serology or subjects pre-screened by serology tests.Celiac disease status known before study enrolment.Sensitivity or specificity estimates based on repeated testing for the same subject.Non-peer-reviewed literature such as editorials and letters to the editor. POPULATION: The population consisted of adults and children with untreated, undiagnosed celiac disease with symptoms consistent with the disease. SEROLOGIC CELIAC DISEASE TESTS EVALUATED: Anti-gliadin antibody (AGA)Anti-endomysial antibody (EMA)Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG)Anti-deamidated gliadin peptides antibody (DGP)Combinations of some of the serologic tests listed above were evaluated in some studiesBoth IgA and IgG antibodies were evaluated for the serologic tests listed above. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: SensitivitySpecificityPositive and negative likelihood ratiosDiagnostic odds ratio (OR)Area under the sROC curve (AUC)Small bowel biopsy was used as the gold standard in order to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of each serologic test. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) for the different serologic tests were calculated using a bivariate, binomial generalized linear mixed model. Statistical significance for differences in sensitivity and specificity between serologic tests was defined by P values less than 0.05, where "false discovery rate" adjustments were made for multiple hypothesis testing. The bivariate regression analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.; Cary, NC, USA). Using the bivariate model parameters, summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves were produced using Review Manager 5.0.22 (The Nordiac Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2008). The area under the sROC curve (AUC) was estimated by bivariate mixed-efects binary regression modeling framework. Model specification, estimation and prediction are carried out with xtmelogit in Stata release 10 (Statacorp, 2007). Statistical tests for the differences in AUC estimates could not be carried out. The study results were stratified according to patient or disease characteristics such as age, severity of Marsh grade abnormalities, among others, if reported in the studies. The literature indicates that the diagnostic accuracy of serologic tests for celiac disease may be affected in patients with chronic liver disease, therefore, the studies identified through the systematic literature review that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of serologic tests for celiac disease in patients with chronic liver disease were summarized. The effect of the GFD in patiens diagnosed with celiac disease was also summarized if reported in the studies eligible for the analysis. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: PUBLISHED SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS: Five systematic reviews of studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of serologic celiac disease tests were identified through our literature search. Seventeen individual studies identified in adults and children were eligible for this evaluation. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

   abstract = {Because celiac disease is greatly under-diagnosed in the United States, a common assumption is that U.S. doctors and researchers always have considered the condition extremely rare. However, the disorder captured widespread medical attention at the beginning of the twentieth century. Luther Emmett Holt, a leading pediatrician, encouraged three other doctors to investigate the condition. Two helped to associate celiac disease with elite medical institutions. The third linked it to the marketing efforts of the United Fruit Company. Interest in celiac declined after 1965, partly as a result of the decreased concern with nutrition and nutritional disorders.},

   abstract = {The association between celiac disease (CD) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) has been reported in literature. Recent epidemiological studies showed an increased prevalence of CD in patients with PBC and vice versa. The cause of PBC is unknown. However, considerable evidence points to an autoimmune basis. The role of infectious agents, such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), has been proposed to stimulate antibody cross-reaction with mitochondria of the bile duct cells. We report a case of a 36-year-old woman with diagnosis of CD, PBC and H. pylori infection. Strict adherence to gluten-free diet, associated to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) administration and eradication treatment for H. pylori infection, led to a marked improvement of clinical status. Our experience supports the pathogenetic role of increased intestinal permeability in the course of CD and H. pylori infection to induce PBC. Future studies are needed to clarify this link to, and in particular the role played by abnormal intestinal permeability and infectious agents in the pathogenesis of PBC.},

CD is often associated with extraintestinal manifestations. In the past few years, growing evidence has documented the involvement of skin diseases among the extraintestinal manifestations of CD. This association could be related to the impairment of intestinal absorption and motility, other than to immunological and hormonal changes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of two INOVA ELISA kits to detect IgA anti-htTGA and anti-gptTGA in patients with and without CD. METHODS: The study groups were comprised of 49 anti-endomysial antibody (EMA)-positive untreated-CD, and 123 controls (EMA-negative treated CD, EMA-negative chronic diarrhea, autoimmune hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease and healthy people). RESULTS: The agreement between the two ELISAs was statistically significant in all study groups and there was no significant difference between them (92.7% agreement; kappa = 0.70; kappa p = 0.001; McNemar p = 1). All patients with serum reactivity of more than 100 units had histologic diagnosis of CD. In seven of 10 patients with treated-CD who had control biopsies, villous atrophy was still present in four who tested positive by both kits. Two of three celiacs with histologic remission tested positive for both anti-tTGA. CONCLUSIONS: the anti-gptTGA and anti-htTGA determination were equally efficient in identifying patients with untreated-CD with high titers of EMA. Whatever the anti-tTGA ELISA used, the reactivity above 100 units was always related to active CD diagnosed by histologic alterations in intestinal biopsies. The anti-tTGA reactivity by both kits was not only similar in determining histologic activity in the follow-up of CD after a gluten free diet, but also in identifying positive sera from the control groups, regardless if CD has been confirmed by duodenal biopsies.},

   abstract = {AIMS: The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of IgA anti-actin antibodies (IgA-AAA) for celiac disease (CD), to investigate their usefulness as a marker of compliance in CD patients to the gluten-free diet (GFD), and to assess the relationship between their presence in the sera of CD patients and severity of intestinal mucosal damage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 182 patients with CD were studied: 63 patients were untreated; 50 patients were following a strict GFD; and 69 patients were non-compliant with a GFD. IgA-AAA was detected using a homemade enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: IgA-AAA showed a sensitivity of 41.3% and a specificity of 71.4% for a diagnosis of CD. In children, the frequency of IgA-AAA detection was lower in those following a strict GFD (23.1%) compared with untreated patients (39.4%) and those not complying with a GFD (32.5%). In patients following a strict GFD, IgA-AAA detection was significantly less frequent in children than in adults (23.1% vs. 58.3%, respectively; P<0.001). IgA-AAA was found in 17 out of 52 CD patients with total villous atrophy (32.7%), and in one out of 11 patients with subtotal villous atrophy (9%). CONCLUSION: IgA-AAA cannot replace anti-endomysium and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies in the diagnosis algorithm of CD, but it can serve as a reliable marker of severe intestinal mucosal damage in CD patients.},

CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old female presented with papulovesicular rash for 15 years, diarrhea for 8 years, spasms of hands and twitching of face for 4-5 months. She had mild anemia, low vitamin-D3 and serum calcium. On exclusion of other causes of malabsorption, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (immunoglobulin-A & immunoglobulin-G), anti-endomysial antibodies, total immunoglobulin-A levels and skin biopsy were performed, which were normal. Intestinal biopsy revealed subtotal villous atrophy. Patient was prescribed gluten-free diet, to which she responded with alleviation of symptoms. CONCLUSION: Negative serology should not rule out celiac disease; intestinal biopsy should be performed if there is strong clinical suspicion.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An association between Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and celiac disease (CD) is uncommon. The aims of our study were to investigate the etiology of BCS and to search for a particular HLA Ag pattern among patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: BCS diagnosis was based on Doppler ultrasound and CD diagnosis on duodenal biopsy, transglutaminase (TGAb) and gliadin antibodies (GAb). Patients were screened for prothrombotic disorders and seven had a PCR-SSO test for HLA genotypes. Patients were treated with anticoagulants and gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Nine patients were included; mean age 27 years (20-42); sex ratio (F/M) 2; mean follow-up duration 31 months (6-54). All patients had endoscopic and histological features of CD. GAb/TGAb were found in 78 % (n=7). Ag HLA found were HLA DQbeta1(*)02 (n=6) and DQbeta1(*)03 (n=3). Prothrombotic conditions identified were latent myeloproliferative disorder (n=1), protein C deficiency (n=1), probable factor V Leiden (n=1) and oral contraceptive use (n=1). No prothrombotic state could be identified in the five other patients. CONCLUSION: The BCS-CD association is relatively frequent in our country. Underlying prothrombotic conditions were absent in more than 50 % of cases, suggesting CD plays a role in the occurrence of thrombosis. HLA alleles found are strongly associated with CD, without any particular pattern for the BCS-CD association.},

CASE REPORT: A 41-year-old woman, followed up for celiac disease resistant to gluten-free diet, developed rapidly spastic paraparesis, cerebellar syndrome, horizontal diplopia and decline of visual acuity. The diagnosis of neurological complications of celiac disease was established and the patient was treated with methylprednisolone, followed by oral prednisone. For 9 years, the patient's neurological status remained stabilized with a prednisone dose at 20mg per day. The patient relapsed when progressive reduction of prednisone dose was attempted; neurological and gastrointestinal signs worsening at 15mg per day; increasing the dose to 30mg improved the clinical status. DISCUSSION: The mechanism of onset of neurological disease remains unknown. Immunological, nutritional, toxic or metabolic factors could be involved. The positive response to corticosteroids observed in this patient suggest an immunological mechanism.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the small intestine precipitated by the ingestion of gluten, a component of wheat protein, in genetically susceptible persons. Classically, the disease manifests with diarrhea, weight loss and anemia. There are very few reports of osteomalacia as the presenting symptom, and even fewer of osteomalacia as the only symptom of celiac disease at presentation. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report we describe a 40 year-old patient who presented with 6 months history of progressively worsening and disabling osteomalacia as the only presentation of a celiac disease. With adherence to a gluten-free diet and calcium-vitamin D supplementation, the patient's condition improved remarkably within three months and she was able to walk pain free. CONCLUSION: Celiac disease frequently is under diagnosed or misdiagnosed which results in unnecessary morbidity such as disabling osteomalacia. Therefore, early diagnosis of celiac disease is important because the symptoms completely resolve with adequate treatment.},

   abstract = {AIM: to determine the frequency of development of osteopenia/ostoporosis (OP) vitamin D deficiency, some population risk factors, and the effects of alpha-calcidol and calcitriol on bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with gluten-sensitivity celiac disease (GSCD). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Densitometry of the lumbar vertebra and femoral neck (FN) was carried out in 47 patients with GSCD. Their sera were tested for 25OHD3, 1,25(OH)2D3, total alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), type 1 collagen type C-telopeptides (CrossLaps) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha), as well as urinary creatinine and calcium. RESULTS: The T score below -1 was found in 37 (78.7%) of the patients. BMD reduced to the level of osteopenia in 51.1% of the patients; OP was detected in 27.7%. Lower BMD was noted in 19 (95%) of the 20 menopausal women and in 15 (68.2%) of the 22 females with preserved menstrual function (p = 0.047). The mean value of 250 HD3 was 47.8 +/- 5.0 in patients with OP patients and 85.6 +/- 7.1 ng/l in those with normal BMD (p < 0.001). The latter had no decreased level of vitamin D, suggesting its deficiency, but 11 (30%) osteopenic patients were found to have vitamin D deficiency (25OHD3 < 30 ng/l). Impaired calcitriol synthesis (69.9 +/- 24.0 ng/l) was observed only in patients with OP; the level of calcitriol was 85.6 +/- 31.2 ng/ml in those with normal BMD. Decreased BMD was accompanied by elevated PTH levels in 25 (67%) patients with GSCD. There were increases in the bone resorption marker CrossLaps and in the level of TNF-alpha in 28 (76%) and 8 (22%) osteopenic patients, respectively. A more significant BMD reduction was seen in the presence of antibodies to gliadin and tissue transglutaminase. A significant correlation was found between the titer of immunoglobulin A antibodies to gliadin and TNF-alpha (rho = -0.57; p = 0.035), CrossLaps (rho = -0.58; p = 0.035), Tscores in the vertebral column and FN (rho = -0.62; p = 0.030) and (rho = -0 37; p = 0.06), respectively. CONCLUSION: The risk for OP in patients with GSCD is affected by menopause and the clinical features of the disease: secondary hyperparathyroidism due to impaired calcium and vitamin D absorption, by the activity of immunological inflammation and the compliance with a gluten-free diet. The immunological activity of inflammation is closely related to the activation of bone resorption and enhances a BMT reduction in patients with celiac disease. The use of vitamin D preparations (alpha-calcidol and calcitriol) in combination with calcium salts lowers BMD in patients with celiac disease just within the first 6 months.},

The pseudocereal seeds and pseudocereal-containing gluten-free breads were evaluated in terms of their protein, fat, total starch, dietary fibre, ash and mineral content as well as their fatty acid composition. The pseudocereal containing gluten-free breads showed significantly higher levels of protein, fat, fibre and minerals than the control bread. The attributes of these breads conform to the expert's nutritional recommendations for the gluten-free diet and gluten-free foods.

A number of recent studies have utilized d-xylose absorption as an investigative tool to study small intestinal function in a variety of clinical settings. Thus, the aim of this experimental study was to evaluate the intestinal absorption of D-xylose in an antigen-specific gut inflammatory reaction rat model. Animals of the experimental group were inoculated with peanut protein extract before their exposure to a challenge diet containing exclusively peanut seeds to induce the gut inflammatory reaction caused by peanut allergy. Our results show that systemic inoculation with peanut protein extract renders significantly higher antibody titres (5.085 +/- 0.126 units) (P < 0.0001) than control rats (0.905 +/- 0.053 units) and that the antibody titres correlate positively to an inflammatory alteration of the gut morphology (P < 0.0001). Animals pertaining to the experimental group showed an intestinal absorption of D-xylose lower than control rats (P < 0.0001). We also observed that D-xylose absorption correlates negatively with IgG titres and positively with morphometric parameters (Pearson correlation). In conclusion, the use of serum D-xylose test was useful to identify the presence of small intestinal malabsorption in our antigen specific gut inflammatory reaction rat model.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Large multicentre studies have provided further evidence of the role of environmental and nonhuman leucocyte antigen genetic factors in coeliac disease. Siblings of coeliac patients carry a high risk, but those found to have negative coeliac serology are very unlikely to develop the disease. Advances in the efficacy of serological antibody testing potentiate the possibility of future accurate screening programmes in the community. Adherence to a gluten-free diet remains paramount as the recognition of coeliac related complications increases. SUMMARY: Despite the encouraging progress that has taken place in our genetic and immunological knowledge of coeliac disease, early introduction of a gluten-free diet remains the cornerstone of treatment. Alternatives, however, aimed at altering the toxicity of cereal proteins are now looking more promising.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin A (IgA) autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) are commonly used for screening and diagnosing of celiac disease (CD). Seroreactivity for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) and bacterial antigens have also been detected in CD patients. The aim of this study was to examine prospectively serologic responses to microbial targets in adult CD patients at the time of diagnosis and during a gluten-free diet (GFD). Further, we wanted to evaluate whether these serologic specificities could provide new tools for the follow-up of CD patients. METHODS: Data on 55 adult biopsy-proven CD patients were available for follow-up study. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on all patients. Sera from patients were tested for antibodies to tTG and ASCA and additionally analyzed with IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to Pseudomonas fluorescens-associated sequence, I2, and to a Bacteroides caccae TonB-linked outer membrane protein, OmpW. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis, 91% of CD cases were positive for tTG and 49% for ASCA; positive seroreactivity to I2 was found in 86% and to OmpW in 60% of CD patients at the time of diagnosis. The frequency of seropositivity and serum levels of these antibodies decreased during GFD. Moreover, we found that the decline in the serum levels was significant in all of these markers (p < 0.005). Interestingly, we also found that serum levels of ASCA correlated with the grade of mucosal morphology (p = 0.021), as the ASCA serum levels declined in accordance with mucosal healing. CONCLUSIONS: Commensal enteric bacteria seem to play a role in the small intestinal mucosal damage in CD. This was proven by the serological responses to different microbial antigens shown in this study. Serum levels of ASCA, anti-I2, and anti-OmpW antibodies decreased significantly during GFD, indicating that these serologic markers are gluten dependent in CD patients. These specificities could provide new tools in the follow-up of CD patients.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of isolated short stature as a clinical presentation of celiac disease in Saudi Arab children and whether some of the routine laboratory tests performed to determine the cause of short stature could suggest the diagnosis of celiac disease. A total of 91 children with short stature were included in the study. Extensive endocrine and biochemical assessments, including total protein, serum albumin, calcium phosphate and alkaline phosphatase assays; renal function tests; coagulation profile; anti-endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody, growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, free-thyroxin (FT4) assays; stool tests for giardiasis; bone age; and endoscopic intestinal biopsies, were done for all children. Ten of the 91 children had positive intestinal biopsies in the form of total villous atrophy, an increase in crypt height, and an increase in intra-epithelial lymphocyte (IEL) numbers up to >40 IEL/100 EC (Type 3C) according to the Oberhuber classification, confirming the diagnosis of celiac disease. Five children had mild villous atrophy according to this classification (Type 3A), and they were considered to have potential celiac disease. Seventy-six children had normal intestinal biopsies. Therefore, the prevalence of celiac disease among Saudi children with short stature was 10.9%, and 4.3% of the children were diagnosed as having potential celiac disease. After confirming the diagnosis of celiac disease, all children were kept on a gluten-free diet and all of them showed improvement in their growth rate. We concluded that celiac disease is a very important cause of short stature in children without gastrointestinal complaints in Saudi Arabia. We highly recommend anti-tissue transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibody screening tests, and a small bowel biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease irrespective of the results of the antibody assays, in children with short stature in Saudi Arabia. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, children should be kept on a gluten-free diet so they can catch up their growth early before they develop permanent short stature.},

CASE REPORT: A 26-year-old woman presented with a suddenly developed weakness of all four limbs and a severe diarrhea. Authors emphasize coeliac crisis, which is a presenting feature of coeliac disease, characterized by acute diarrhea with life-threatening acid base and electrolyte abnormalities. The patient improved with correction of hypokalemia and gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: A severe acute diarrhea with metabolic and systemic complications, the so-called coeliac crisis, is a possible presenting clinical feature of a previously undiagnosed adult celiac disease.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the current implementation of the 1990 ESPGHAN criteria for the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) in Italy to form a foundation for their revision. From September 2006 to March 2007 a nationwide questionnaire concerning current diagnostic methods was sent by mail to 54 Italian centres for the diagnosis of CD, which were distributed across the entire national territory. The questionnaire investigated the tests performed, diagnostic criteria currently used, and the management of some special cases in each centre. Eighty percent of the centres use anti-tissue transglutaminase to diagnose CD and anti-endomysium antibodies to confirm the results. Fifty-five percent still use anti-gliadin antibodies. A total of 87.5% of centres perform HLA typing, especially in first-degree relatives and in unclear diagnosis. Regarding histology, 67.5% of centres consider an infiltrative lesion consistent with diagnosis of CD. The majority of centres (85%) use the 1990 ESPGHAN criteria for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, but 80% do not perform a second biopsy in asymptomatic cases or a gluten challenge in children younger than 2 years of age. Furthermore, most centres (72.5%) do not prescribe a gluten-free diet to asymptomatic patients with positive serology and normal bowel architecture (ie, potential cases), but they do program a careful follow-up. In conclusion, ESPGHAN criteria are widely followed by Italian CD centres. However, their revision may be useful, but it should be evidence based. Large, multicentre studies are greatly needed.},

   abstract = {We sought to analyze the long-term growth in children with celiac disease (CD) as well as the association of height and weight SD score at the end of 4 years with the demographic and clinical presentation at initial admission. Thirty-four children with CD were enrolled in the study and followed for at least 4 years. Patients were divided into three groups (Group 1: patients <or=5 years old, Group 2: patients 5-10 years old, and Group 3: patients >10 years, at the time of diagnosis). Patients' charts were reviewed for demographic and clinical features at initial admission. Anthropometric measurements at initial admission, at 6th months, and 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years were recorded. Gluten-free diet led to rapid increase in weight SD and height SD score in patients <or=5 years old at the time of diagnosis (Group 1). Increment in height SD score was the highest in patients 5-10 years old (Group 2) at the end of 4 years. A negative correlation was found between age at the time of diagnosis and weight and height SD score at the end of 4 years (r = -0.503, P = 0.03 and r = -0.554, P = 0.01). Multiple regression analysis revealed that height SD score at the end of the 4 years was associated with age at the time of diagnosis. The other factors had no effect on the weight and height SD score at the end of 4 years. Early diagnosis and good adhesion to a gluten-free diet are essential for long-term growth in CD. Celiac societies and the mass media must expand an effort to educate the community regarding the symptoms of the disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is now recognized as a common disorder among Middle Eastern (ME) and North African (NA) populations. The aim of this review is to assess the available data regarding CD in the ME and NA and to compare this information with that of Western countries. A literature review was performed using the electronic databases PubMed and Medline (1950-2008) as search engines, and "celiac disease" was used as a Mesh term. The search was limited to ME and NA countries. The prevalence of CD in ME and NA countries among low risk populations is similar to that of Western countries, but is higher in high risk populations such as those with type 1 diabetes. It is underestimated because of lack of clinical suspicion and lack of patient awareness. Clinical presentations in term of gastrointestinal, hematologic, skeletal, and liver manifestations are similar between both populations except for a high prevalence of short stature in some ME and NA countries. Few studies have addressed atypical or silent CD. As in the West, diagnosis is initially made by serological tests and is confirmed by small intestinal biopsies. Gluten-free diet is the main mode of treatment with a higher apparent adherence rate than in the West. Most disease complications result from malabsorption. The disease is strongly associated with HLA DQ2 and to a lesser extent with HLA DQ8 alleles. In conclusion, CD prevalence is underestimated, with little data available about its malignant complications. Disease parameters in the ME and NA are otherwise similar to those in Western countries.},

   abstract = {AIM: Involvement of many organs and apparatus such as heart, central and peripheral nervous systems have been reported in celiac disease. Autonomic neuropathy has frequently been reported both in untreated and in gluten free diet (GFD) adult patients and, to our knowledge, has never been investigated in celiac children. The aim of the study was to evaluate autonomic function in children with celiac disease. METHODS: Fifteen children with untreated celiac disease were enrolled. Fifteen healthy children served as controls. None of the patients was diabetic. Central or peripheral neurological diseases, were absent. In all participants, at recruitment and after 24 months of GFD, serum anti-tTG and AEA levels, inflammatory markers, IgG, IgM and IgA anti-ganglioside antibodies, were performed. Heart rate variability indexes were employed to evaluate autonomic system balance. RESULTS: Our results indicate that also children with celiac disease may exhibit an imbalance of the neurovegetative system with a prevailing sympathetic tone, persisting on a GFD. All presented symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, vomiting, meteorism, regurgitation in whom autonomic dysfunction could be involved, but these symptoms disappeared on gluten free diet. This tend to exclude the prevailing sympathetic tone as a main factor underlying symptoms of celiac disease. CONCLUSION: Children affected by celiac disease exhibit an enhanced sympathetic tone, persisting after 24 months of GFD whereas gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms disappear. The pathogenesis of this phenomenon still remains unclear.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a small intestine enteropathy caused by permanent intolerance to wheat gluten. Gluten intake by patients with coeliac disease provokes a strong reaction by intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), which normalises on a gluten-free diet. AIM: To investigate whether impaired extrathymic T cell maturation and/or secondary T cell receptor (TCR) gene recombination in IELs are features of coeliac disease which could contribute to the failure of establishing tolerance to gluten. METHODS: Expression levels of the four splice-forms of recombination activating gene-1 (RAG1) mRNA and preT alpha-chain (preTalpha) mRNA were determined in IEL-subsets of children with coeliac disease and controls. Frequencies of RAG1 expressing IELs were determined by immunomorphometry. RESULTS: In controls, the RAG1-1A/2 splice-form selectively expressed outside the thymus, was dominant and expressed in both mature (TCR(+)) and immature (CD2(+)CD7(+)TCR(-)) IELs ( approximately 8 mRNA copies/18S rRNA U). PreTalpha was expressed almost exclusively in CD2(+)CD7(+)TCR(-) IELs ( approximately 40 mRNA copies/18S rRNA U). By contrast, RAG1 and preTalpha mRNA levels were low in patients with coeliac disease compared to controls, both with active disease and with inactive, symptom-free disease on a gluten-free diet (p values <0.01 for mature and <0.05 for immature IELs). Similarly, the frequencies of RAG1+ IELs were significantly lower in patients with coeliac disease compared to controls (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with coeliac disease appear to have an impaired capacity for extrathymic TCR gene rearrangement. This is an inherent feature, which probably plays a pivotal role in the failure to efficiently downregulate the T cell response to gluten.},

Recently, a patient with an association of type 1 DM and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) was reported in the medical literature. A 10.5-year-old boy was brought to our clinic with complaints of polydipsia, polyuria and weight loss and was diagnosed as diabetic ketoacidosis due to autoimmune type 1 DM. Insulin therapy was started. Elevated thyroid antibodies associated with diffuse goiter and hypothyroidism led to the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD), and elevated antiendomysial antibodies and abnormal intestinal biopsy findings led to the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). L-thyroxine therapy and gluten-free diet were initiated accordingly. At the third-year of follow-up, acute attacks of fever, abdominal pain and chest pain developed. Laboratory investigations, which were normal between the attacks, revealed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, white blood cell count and pleural effusion on chest X-ray during the attacks. Molecular analysis for FMF revealed compound heterozygous M694I and V726A. The patient responded well to colchicine therapy started at a dose of 1.5 mg/day. We present the second patient with type 1 DM associated with FMF who also had ATD and CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: AGA IgA II and AGA IgG II have recently been suggested as reliable tools for celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. We compared their utility for diagnosis and monitoring CD in children with that of tTG IgA, an established CD marker. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 161 CD and 129 control children in whom CD was histologically confirmed or ruled out. We followed 37 children with CD on a gluten-free diet for 12-84 months. In fasting sera, we measured AGA IgA II, AGA IgG II, and tTG IgA using ELISAs. RESULTS: The best sensitivity (92.5%), specificity (97.6%), positive predictive value (98%), and negative predictive value (91.2%) were obtained using tTG IgA. AGA IgG II correctly identified 3 of 3 children with CD with total IgA deficiency who had negative AGA IgA II and tTG IgA results. In children <2 years old without total IgA deficiency, AGA IgG II and tTG IgA performed equally well (sensitivity 96.4% and specificity 100%). AGA IgA II, AGA IgG II, and tTG IgA concentrations diminished significantly (P < 0.0001) after 1 year of a gluten-free diet, reaching values below the cutoff in 87%, 70%, and 51% of cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The best available index for diagnosing CD in children was tTG IgA. In infants <2 years old, AGA IgG II performed as well as tTG IgA in cases without total IgA deficiency and allowed detection of CD when total IgA was <0.06 g/L. Gluten-free diet monitoring can be achieved using any of the studied serum markers.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of serum IgA antibodies against actin filaments (AAA) in patients with celiac disease (CD) is strongly associated with mucosal damage and severe degrees of villous atrophy.The aims of the present study were (1) to verify the effectiveness of IgA-AAA in newly diagnosed CD patients in a clinical setting (2) to compare the immunofluorescence assay with ELISA assay; (3) to compare the correlation of our IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG-Ab) class with mucosal intestinal lesions. METHODS: 90 patients underwent endoscopy and multiple biopsies for suspected CD on the basis of symptoms, in presence of positive tTG-Ab tests. Twenty biopsied and 25 not-biopsied subjects with negative tTG-Ab were tested as control groups. IgA-AAA assays were performed by indirect immunofluorescence using rat epithelial intestinal cells, and by ELISA with a commercial kit. tTG-Ab assay was a radio-binding assay. Intestinal specimens were collected by upper endoscopy and the histological study was done according to the Marsh's classification modified by Oberhuber (M/O). Auto-antibodies assays and histological evaluation have been performed blindly by skilled operators. RESULTS: CD diagnosis was confirmed in 82 patients (type I M/O in 2 patients, IIIA in 18 patients, IIIB in 29 patients and IIIC in 33 patients). Two patients with type 1 lesion in presence of positive tTG-Ab and abdominal complaints, started a gluten free diet. The rate of IgA-AAA positivity (sensitivity) by IFI and ELISA in histologically proven celiac disease patients, were 5.5% and 25% patients in IIIA, 27.5% and 34.4% patients in IIIB, 78.8% and 75% in IIIC patients, respectively.Patients with normal or nearly normal mucosa, regardless of tTG-Ab status, presented negative IgA-AAA IFI assay. On the other hand, 1 patient with normal mucosa but positive tTG-Ab, also presented positive IgA-AAA ELISA. All healthy non biopsied controls had negative IgA-AAA. tTG-Ab serum concentration was significantly correlated with more severe intestinal lesion (IIIB, IIIC M/O). CONCLUSIONS: IgA-AAA may be undetectable in presence of severe mucosal damage. Histology is still necessary to diagnose celiac disease and IgA-AAA cannot be included in usual screening tests, because it has little to offer if compared to the well-established tTG-Ab.IgA-AAA could be an adjunctive, very useful tool to support the diagnosis of CD in case of suboptimal histology, when the biopsy is to be avoided for clinical reasons, or in case of negative parents' consensus.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To verify whether subjects with celiac disease (CD) have a different locus of control (LoC) compared with healthy subjects, and to evaluate the relationship between LoC and compliance with a prescribed gluten-free diet (GFD) and quality of life (QoL). STUDY DESIGN: We studied 156 subjects on a GFD (mean age, 10 years) and 353 healthy controls (mean age, 12 years). All subjects completed tests on the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale; the subjects with CD also completed a questionnaire to measure compliance with dietary treatment and the disease's impact on QoL. RESULTS: There was no difference in LoC values between patients with CD and controls. Subjects with CD with good dietary compliance had a more internal LoC compared with those who were not compliant (P = .01). Patients who reported a satisfactory QoL had a more internal LoC compared with those who reported negative affects on QoL due to CD (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the usefulness of the LoC concept for identifying those patients who might be at risk for dietary transgression. Given the enhanced, psychological, and social well being that can result from adherence to a GFD, educational and psychological support can help internalize the LoC in those patients at risk for dietary transgression.},

Aim of our work is to study in eight patients with type 1 diabetes associated with celiac disease their daily experience and the constraints that this pathological association imposes. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved eight patients with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease known for at least 1 year. All patients were given a thorough interrogation specifying the regular monitoring of the two diseases and the quality of the observance of the diabetic dietary and gluten-free diet, as well as an assessment of impact of diabetes. RESULTS: the caloric intake in relation to the recommendations is very insufficient. Taking snack is not respected. There is also the consumption of certain foods containing gluten masked and regular consumption of sucrose by our patients despite a long-term evolution of diabetes (19 +/- 6 years) and celiac disease (11 +/- 7.8 years). Half of patients have degenerative complications of diabetes. CONCLUSION: In light of these results, a frequent evaluation of nutrition education in these patients and a psychological care seems necessary.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder caused by a permanent sensitivity to gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Accurate diagnosis of CD at an early stage and its treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD) are important for optimum treatment and prognosis. Recently, by employing a noninvasive metabonomic approach, we have shown that CD has a well-defined metabonomic signature. Here we address potential CD patients, defined as subjects who do not have, and have never had, a jejunal biopsy consistent with clear CD, and yet have immunological abnormalities similar to those found in celiac patients. Sixty-one overt CD patients at diagnosis, 29 patients with potential CD, and 51 control subjects were examined by (1)H NMR of their serum and urine: out of 29 potential CD patients, 24 were classified as CD and 5 as control subjects. Potential CD largely shares the metabonomic signature of overt CD. Most metabolites found to be significantly different between control and CD subjects were also altered in potential CD. Our results demonstrate that metabolic alterations may precede the development of small intestinal villous atrophy and provide a further rationale for early institution of GFD in patients with potential CD, as recently suggested by prospective clinical studies.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial disorder involving genetic and environmental factors, thus, having great potential impact on metabolism. This study aims at defining the metabolic signature of CD through Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) of urine and serum samples of CD patients. Thirty-four CD patients at diagnosis and 34 healthy controls were examined by (1)H NMR of their serum and urine. A CD patients' subgroup was also examined after a gluten-free diet (GFD). Projection to Latent Structures provided data reduction and clustering, and Support Vector Machines provided pattern recognition and classification. The classification accuracy of CD and healthy control groups was 79.7-83.4% for serum and 69.3% for urine. Sera of CD patients were characterized by lower levels (P < 0.01) of several metabolites such as amino acids, lipids, pyruvate and choline, and by higher levels of glucose and 3-hydroxybutyric acid, while urines showed altered levels (P < 0.05) of, among others, indoxyl sulfate, meta-[hydroxyphenyl]propionic acid and phenylacetylglycine. After 12 months of GFD, all but one of the patients were classified as healthy by the same statistical analysis. NMR thus reveals a characteristic metabolic signature of celiac disease. Altered serum levels of glucose and ketonic bodies suggest alterations of energy metabolism, while the urine data point to alterations of gut microbiota. Metabolomics may thus provide further hints on the biochemistry of the disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac sprue is a T-cell-mediated enteropathy elicited in genetically susceptible individuals by dietary gluten proteins. To initiate and propagate inflammation, proteolytically resistant gluten peptides must be translocated across the small intestinal epithelium and presented to DQ2-restricted T cells, but the effectors enabling this translocation under normal and inflammatory conditions are not well understood. We demonstrate that a fluorescently labeled antigenic 33-mer gluten peptide is translocated intact across a T84 cultured epithelial cell monolayer and that preincubation of the monolayer with media from gluten-stimulated, celiac patient-derived intestinal T cells enhances the apical-to-basolateral flux of this peptide in a dose-dependent, saturable manner. The permeability-enhancing activity of activated T-cell media is inhibited by blocking antibodies against either interferon-gamma or its receptor and is recapitulated using recombinant interferon-gamma. At saturating levels of interferon-gamma, activated T-cell media does not further increase transepithelial peptide flux, indicating the primacy of interferon-gamma as an effector of increased epithelial permeability during inflammation. Reducing the assay temperature to 4 degrees C reverses the effect of interferon-gamma but does not reduce basal peptide flux occurring in the absence of interferon-gamma, suggesting active transcellular transport of intact peptides is increased during inflammation. A panel of disease-relevant gluten peptides exhibited an inverse correlation between size and transepithelial flux but no apparent sequence constraints. Anti-interferon-gamma therapy may mitigate the vicious cycle of gluten-induced interferon-gamma secretion and interferon-gamma-mediated enhancement of gluten peptide flux but is unlikely to prevent translocation of gluten peptides in the absence of inflammatory conditions.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cases of venous thrombosis associated with celiac disease have been rarely published. We report a case of celiac disease associated with deep venous thrombosis in the left leg. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 44-year-old man was admitted to the hospital due to diarrhea, which was present for three months. The diarrhea was present 5-6 times a day and was neither mucous nor bloody. Microscopic examination of feces was normal. No pathogenic microorganisms were isolated in culture. Esophagogastroduodenal endoscopy showed bulbar and post-bulbar mucosal granularity. Jejunal biopsy revealed flattening of mucosa and cellular infiltration of lamina propria with plasma cells and lymphocytes. The IgA anti-gliadin antibodies and IgA anti-endomisium antibodies were positive. The diagnosis of celiac disease was made and gluten-free diet was started. On the seventh day of hospitalization, a marked swelling, erythema and pain developed in the left leg. Doppler ultrasonographic examination revealed an acute thrombotic process in the left proximal venous system. Investigations for the causes of thrombotic status were negative. The long term outcome is favorable with gluten-free diet and warfarin treatment. DISCUSSION: It should be kept in mind that there is a tendency toward thromboembolic events in patients with celiac disease, especially during an acute phase of the disease (Ref. 5).

   abstract = {A dietary interview performed by expert personnel is considered to be the most appropriate tool to check whether patients with coeliac disease follow a strict gluten-free diet. However, we currently have no straightforward and non-subjective method for performing such a dietary interview. We therefore developed a fast questionnaire based on four simple questions with a five-level score (0-IV). To verify whether our questionnaire is an efficient tool, we applied it to 168 coeliac patients (126 females and 42 males; mean age 42.4 (SD 12.9) years) on a gluten-free diet (median 82, 25th-75th percentile 50-108, range 15-389 months). The score we obtained was compared with the persistence of both villous atrophy and endomysial antibodies while on a gluten-free diet. A comparison with survival of the patients was also performed. Patients were interviewed over the phone by non-expert personnel. The questionnaire was completed in less than 1 min. The lowest results were significantly more frequent among the patients with a persistence of both villous atrophy and positive endomysial antibodies. Death risk was also significantly correlated with the lowest score results. We conclude that our questionnaire is a reliable and simple method of verifying compliance with a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Although the prevalence rates of celiac disease tend to be very similar in different Western populations, mortality rates for this disease vary widely. In this Review we focus on the papers that have addressed this issue so far. We evaluated mortality rates in different forms of celiac disease, such as symptomatic celiac disease, unrecognized celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis and refractory celiac disease. We also evaluated the role of possible protective factors, such as adherence to a gluten-free diet, early diagnosis and severity of clinical presentation. Finally, we noticed that the mortality rate for celiac disease seems to be higher in Southern than in Northern Europe and seems to correlate with 'national' gluten consumption. To explain these differences, we propose a hypothesis that links mortality rates to the amount of gluten consumed not only after but also before the diagnosis of celiac disease.},

Buckwheat is a major ingredient in the daily diet of the celiac patients due to its gluten-free composition.

In gluten-free formulations, instead of wheat flour, 40% BWF, 30% rice flour and 30% corn starch in the first formulation and 60% BWF, 20% rice flour and 20% corn starch in the second formulation were handled. BWF substitution at a 60% level increased the ash and fat contents of tarhana samples, but affected the lightness value of the samples negatively. Potassium, magnesium and phosphorus contents of the gluten-free tarhana increased significantly (P <0.05) with increasing amount of BWF in the formulation. Sensory evaluation showed that BWF addition resulted in changes in consistency, taste, sourness and grittiness. Tarhana containing 40% BWF received the highest taste and overall acceptability scores.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder induced by the intake of gluten proteins involving primarily the gastrointestinal tract. Myelodysplastic syndromes are clonal hematologic disorders, expanded from myeloid stem cells of uncertain pathogenesis. Anaemia is a common finding in patients with celiac disease. Frequently it is secondary to malabsorption of iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 and usually disappears completely with a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet and supplement of deficient factors. To the best of our knowledge, in medical literature only two cases of myelodysplastic syndrome associated with celiac disease have been described. Here we describe the case of a patient affected by adult celiac disease who went into remission following a gluten free diet. Later a macrocytic anaemia without vitamin B12 or folate deficiency appeared. Hematologic tests showed findings consistent with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts. The association of celiac disease with myelodysplastic syndromes seems not to be casual. It raises the hypothesis of a primitive immunological disorder in both diseases.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy characterised by chronic inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa and the presence of typical autoantibodies. Coeliac disease may be a risk factor for renal disease. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is reported in the majority of these cases. Only one adult patient had been reported with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and coeliac disease. Here, we report a case in a 12-year-old girl with coeliac disease who presented with severe anaemia and later developed nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsy of the patient was consistent with MPGN type 1, which has not been previously reported in children with coeliac disease. A gluten-free diet was started. After 6 months of this diet, her nephrotic syndrome resolved completely. This case is presented to draw attention to the rare association of coeliac disease and MPGN type 1.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Low bone mineral density (BMD) is common in children and adolescents with celiac disease. Strict gluten-free diet (GFD) improves bone mineralization, even in 1 year. The effect of occasional gluten intake is not known. The aims of this study were to compare BMD and prevalence of low BMD in children and adolescents on strict and not strict GFD. METHODS: We measured BMD in 55 children and adolescents (strict GFD) with negative endomysium antibodies (EMA) in the last 2 years and in 19 (not strict GFD) with positive EMA at the time of the study. Lumbar, left hip and total body BMD were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Four-day weighted dietary protocols were obtained by means of a self-completed questionnaire of total food and beverage intake. Energy and calcium intake were calculated using nutrition data software. EMA, tissue transglutaminase antibodies, serum calcium, phosphate, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, intact parathormone, albumin, urea and creatinine levels were determined in all patients. RESULTS: BMD in patients on strict GFD was significantly higher than in patients on not strict GFD (lumbar p=0.01; total body p=0.005). There were significantly more patients with total body BMD below -1.0 in not strictly compliant group (71% compared to 38%; p=0.03). Calcium intake and vitamin D levels were below recommendations in both groups. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents on not strict GFD are at increased risk for low BMD. We therefore recommend that BMD should be evaluated in patients with positive EMA. In addition, patients on strict GFD are at risk for low BMD because of low calcium intake or vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, strict GFD with recommended calcium intake and vitamin D supplementation during winter and spring should be encouraged in all children and adolescents with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A gluten-free camp allows children with celiac disease (CD) to enjoy a camp experience without concern and preoccupation with foods they eat or the stigma of their underlying disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of gluten-free camp on quality-of-life indicators for children and adolescents with CD. METHODS: Children aged 7 to 17 years with CD were administered a 14-question survey at the beginning and the end of a 7-day gluten-free camp. Surveys used a Likert scale to examine general well-being, emotional outlook, and self-perception for the week before each survey. Differences between the time points were compared. Data were analyzed by paired t test. RESULTS: Of the 104 campers who attended camp, 77 (21 male) completed the survey at both time points. Most (70%) had been on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for <4 years. All seemed to benefit from camp, no longer feeling different from other kids or feeling frustrated with a restricted diet. A more beneficial impact was found for campers who were on a GFD for <4 years. Overall, campers reported an improvement in 11 of 14 questions, statistically significant (P < .05) for 8 of those 11 questions. Improvement was observed in each of the 3 categories of questions: well-being, self-perception, and emotional outlook. CONCLUSIONS: Children who had CD and attended a week-long gluten-free camp demonstrated improvement in well-being, self-perception, and emotional outlook. The positive effects of camp were more apparent among campers who had been on a GFD for <4 years compared with those who had been on a GFD for > or =4 years, suggesting an adaptation to CD with time. A gluten-free camp that provides an environment of unrestricted foods can at least temporarily alleviate stress and anxiety around food and social interactions. Durability of these observations on return to daily life requires additional study.},

   abstract = {Two adaptive homeostatic mechanisms normally preserve mucosal integrity: (i) immune exclusion mediated by secretory antibodies to inhibit penetration of potentially dangerous microorganisms and proteins, and (ii) immunosuppression to counteract hypersensitivity against innocuous antigens. The latter mechanism is called 'oral tolerance' when induced via the gut. Similar mechanisms are suppressive against commensal bacteria. Such two-layered anti-inflammatory defense explains why persistent allergy to dietary proteins is not more common, with the exception of gluten intolerance (celiac disease) where abrogation of mucosal homeostasis is overt. Thus, mucosally induced tolerance is generally a robust adaptive mechanism in view of the fact that a ton of food may pass annually through the gut of an adult - regularly giving rise to uptake of intact dietary antigens in the nanogram range after a meal. However, the immunoregulatory network and the epithelial barrier are poorly developed in the neonatal period, which therefore is critical with regard to priming for allergy. Notably, the postnatal development of mucosal immune homeostasis depends on appropriate microbial colonization. In this process, antigen-presenting cells are 'decision makers', linking innate and adaptive immunity. Their microbe-sensing function is influenced by both microbial products and dietary constituents, including vitamin A and lipids such as polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aberrant signaling via the p21/mitogen-activated proteins (MAP) kinase pathway has been described in lymphocytes of patients with various autoimmune diseases. There is little published data about the intracellular mediators and signals that regulate expression and activity of transcription factors and their effect on celiac disease induction and progression. AIM: To investigate the possible involvement of MAP kinase pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in celiac disease and its correlation with disease activity. METHODS: Expression of the total and activated forms of two MAP kinases [extracellular response kinase (ERK) and c-Jun amino terminal kinase (JNK)] were studied by Western blots in PBMC of 17 untreated and 19 treated celiac patients, and 17 controls. Seven of these untreated celiac patients were studies before and after 6 months of gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Phosphorylated ERK of active celiac disease patients was significantly lower compared with controls (P < 0.01) and was increased towards normal after 6 month of gluten-free diet (P < 0.01). Phosphorylated JNK was increased significantly in the untreated celiac group (P < 0.01) and normalized towards the control level after 6 months of gluten-free diet (P < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant MAP-kinase pathway activity is associated with active celiac disease (CD). Further studies should examine the potential role of this aberration in pathogenesis of CD.},

Most studies in this field are focused on patients under primary neurological care. To exclude such an observation bias, patients with biopsy proven celiac disease were screened for neurological disease. A total of 72 patients with biopsy proven celiac disease (CD) (mean age 51 +/- 15 years, mean disease duration 8 +/- 11 years) were recruited through advertisements. All participants adhered to a gluten-free diet. Patients were interviewed following a standard questionnaire and examined clinically for neurological symptoms. Medical history revealed neurological disorders such as migraine (28%), carpal tunnel syndrome (20%), vestibular dysfunction (8%), seizures (6%), and myelitis (3%). Interestingly, 35% of patients with CD reported of a history of psychiatric disease including depression, personality changes, or even psychosis. Physical examination yielded stance and gait problems in about one third of patients that could be attributed to afferent ataxia in 26%, vestibular dysfunction in 6%, and cerebellar ataxia in 6%. Other motor features such as basal ganglia symptoms, pyramidal tract signs, tics, and myoclonus were infrequent. 35% of patients with CD showed deep sensory loss and reduced ankle reflexes in 14%. Gait disturbances in CD do not only result from cerebellar ataxia but also from proprioceptive or vestibular impairment. Neurological problems may even develop despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet.},

There are several endocrine disorders that are associated with CD. In many of these cases, CD does not present with the typical gastrointestinal symptoms.

Human caseins were not recognized by IgA, whereas IgA reactivity of G2 and G3 was higher to bovine milk caseins. Immunoreactivity of G1 to yogurt caseins was lower and comparable to controls, with no effects due to mTG treatment. However, mTG treatment increased reactivity of G3 to wheat and maize prolamins.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relation of adenosine deaminase (ADA), a cytoplasmic enzyme involved in the catabolism of purine bases, as an index of altered immune response, with adult CD patients. ADA has been shown to increase in several inflammatory conditions, but there is no literature data indicating an alteration in CD. Serum levels of ADA were investigated in newly diagnosed 20 CD patients. ADA levels were compared in patients with CD and in healthy controls. Correlation analysis was also performed between ADA and other serum markers of CD (anti-gliadin and anti-endomysial antibodies) Mean serum ADA levels were significantly elevated in CD patients compared with control group. ROC curve analysis suggested that the optimum ADA level cut-off point for CD was 12.27 U/l. At a cut-off value of 12.27 U/l, the sensitivity was 80% and specificity was 100%. There was no statistically significant correlation between ADA and anti-gliadin and anti-endomisium antibodies. Serum ADA levels elevated significantly in CD patients, suggesting a partial role in activated T-cell response in the disease pathophysiology. ADA can be used as a supportive diagnostic marker in patients with CD.},

   abstract = {There are common findings between Behcet's disease (BD) and celiac disease (CD); however, association in the same patient is a rarity. We relate the third case in the literature of this overlap in a 40-year-old woman with history of obstipation since her childhood. She also presented asymmetric polyarthralgia, loss of weight, anemia, oral recurrent aphthas (>3/year) and genital ulcerations, inflammatory lower back pain, bowel bleeding and abdominal colic. Afterwards, she presented episodes of erythema nodosum, superficial thrombophlebitis, pseudofolliculitis and aseptic meningitis, thus fulfilling criteria for BD. Due to persistence of the digestive complaints, a gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed. The biopsy showed chronic duodenitis with intraepithelial lymphocytosis, crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy. Endomysial antibody was positive. She fulfilled the diagnosis criteria for CD; a gluten-free diet was applied with clinical improvement. Ascertaining whether pathogenic mechanisms are common in these two conditions requires further investigation.},

   abstract = {Inflammation is a stereotypical physiological response to infections and tissue injury; it initiates pathogen killing as well as tissue repair processes and helps to restore homeostasis at infected or damaged sites. Acute inflammatory reactions are usually self-limiting and resolve rapidly, due to the involvement of negative feedback mechanisms. Thus, regulated inflammatory responses are essential to remain healthy and maintain homeostasis. However, inflammatory responses that fail to regulate themselves can become chronic and contribute to the perpetuation and progression of disease. Characteristics typical of chronic inflammatory responses underlying the pathophysiology of several disorders include loss of barrier function, responsiveness to a normally benign stimulus, infiltration of inflammatory cells into compartments where they are not normally found in such high numbers, and overproduction of oxidants, cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids and matrix metalloproteinases. The levels of these mediators amplify the inflammatory response, are destructive and contribute to the clinical symptoms. Various dietary components including long chain omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidant vitamins, plant flavonoids, prebiotics and probiotics have the potential to modulate predisposition to chronic inflammatory conditions and may have a role in their therapy. These components act through a variety of mechanisms including decreasing inflammatory mediator production through effects on cell signaling and gene expression (omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, plant flavonoids), reducing the production of damaging oxidants (vitamin E and other antioxidants), and promoting gut barrier function and anti-inflammatory responses (prebiotics and probiotics). However, in general really strong evidence of benefit to human health through anti-inflammatory actions is lacking for most of these dietary components. Thus, further studies addressing efficacy in humans linked to studies providing greater understanding of the mechanisms of action involved are required.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration correlates with increased cardiovascular risk. A great prevalence of celiac disease (CD) was reported among patients with low HDL-C concentration, and gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment seems to normalize lipid profile. We evaluated blood lipids and body composition in 26 CD patients with low HDL-C level (<1.0 mmol/L) at diagnosis and after GFD. STUDY: A case-control study. METHODS: The diagnosis was based on histologic evidence of subtotal or total duodenal villous atrophy. Patients were studied before and after GFD treatment (14.2+/-1.4 mo) with biopsy-proven return to normal of the duodenal mucosa. HDL-C was enzymatically assessed after precipitation of very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein with heparin-magnesium. Apolipoprotein (Apo)-AI level was assessed by immunoturbidimetric assay; triglycerides by an enzymatic colorimetric method. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Body composition improved after GFD, with increasing body weight (P<0.05) essentially owing to increased fat mass (FM) (P<0.01), rather than fat-free mass (P=0.064). Total cholesterol and HDL-C were lower in untreated compared with treated patients (P<0.001 and P<0.0001). Apo-AI level increased significantly after GFD (1.20+/-0.22 vs. 1.46+/-0.17 g/L; P<0.0001). Apo-AI, sex, and FM were all significant determinants of HDL-C level; a positive correlation (R=0.68; P<0.0001) was found between increase in HDL-C level and in FM after GFD treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Restoration of lipid profile in CD patients after GFD treatment may be explained by an increase in both Apo-AI secretion by intestinal cells and body fat stores.},

Dermatitis herpetiformis is often misdiagnosed and to date no guidelines for the management of dermatitis herpetiformis have been published in Literature. The present guidelines have been prepared for dermatologists by the Group for Cutaneous Immunopathology of the Italian Society of Dermatology and Venereology. They reflect the best data available at the time of preparation and the clinical experience of the authors and the members of the Italian Group for Cutaneous Immunopathology. The diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis is established clinically, histologically, immunopathologically and serologically. A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the treatment of choice for patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. Dapsone and/or other drugs should be used during the period until the GFD is effective. In conclusion, the present guidelines provide evidence-based guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis.},

   abstract = {In celiac disease (CD), gluten, the disease-inducing toxic component in wheat, induces the secretion of IgA-class autoantibodies which target tissue transglutaminase (tTG). These autoantibodies are produced in the small-intestinal mucosa, and, during gluten consumption, they can also be detected in patients' serum but disappear slowly from the circulation on a gluten-free diet. Interestingly, after adoption of a gluten-free diet the serum autoantibodies disappear from the circulation more rapidly than the small-intestinal mucosal autoantibody deposits. The finding of IgA deposits on extracellular tTG in the liver, kidney, lymph nodes and muscles of patients with CD indicates that tTG is accessible to the gut-derived autoantibodies. Although the specific autoantibody response directed against tTG is very characteristic in celiac patients, their role in the immunopathology of the celiac mucosal lesion is a matter of debate. Here we report a brief summary of anti-tTG antibody effects demonstrating that these antibodies are functional and not mere bystanders in the disease pathogenesis. In fact, they inhibit intestinal epithelial cell differentiation, induce intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, increase epithelial permeability and activate monocytes and disturb angiogenesis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a permanent intolerance to the gliadin fraction of wheat gluten and to similar barley and rye proteins that occurs in genetically susceptible subjects. After ingestion, degraded gluten proteins reach the small intestine and trigger an inappropriate T cell-mediated immune response, which can result in intestinal mucosal inflammation and extraintestinal manifestations. To date, no pharmacological treatment is available to gluten-intolerant patients, and a strict, life-long gluten-free diet is the only safe and efficient treatment available. Inevitably, this may produce considerable psychological, emotional, and economic stress. Therefore, the scientific community is very interested in establishing alternative or adjunctive treatments. Attractive and novel forms of therapy include strategies to eliminate detrimental gluten peptides from the celiac diet so that the immunogenic effect of the gluten epitopes can be neutralized, as well as strategies to block the gluten-induced inflammatory response. In the present paper, we review recent developments in the use of enzymes as additives or as processing aids in the food biotechnology industry to detoxify gluten.},

   abstract = {AIM: In the last few years we noted an increasing number of children with celiac disease with negative serum anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) a useful serologic test to monitor compliance to gluten-free diet. The aim of this study was to verify diagnostic accuracy of AGA and compare clinical characteristics of AGA-negative with AGA-positive celiac children. METHODS: The authors analyzed serum of AGA-negative celiac children with 3 Elisa kits, and compared clinical and anthropometric data of AGA-negative with AGA-positive celiac children. Celiac disease was diagnosed with small bowel biopsy, and total IgA were determined. Children with IgA-deficiency were excluded. RESULTS: When retested with two other commercial kits, serum values of AGA-negative children were confirmed in all but one. In the last 14 years a diagnosis of celiac disease was performed in 166 children, in 56 of them (33.7%) antigliadin antibodies were negative. Preva-lence of AGA-negative celiac children increased significantly in the last years (from 23% before 2002 to 39.8% after 2002, P=0.04). AGA-negative children were significantly older (7.8 years vs. 3.7 years, P=0.0007) they complained more frequently of abdominal pain (55%, vs. 25,4% P=0.04) and less frequently of anaemia (8% vs. 24.5% P=0.012) and were less likely to have a classical celiac triad (5.3 vs. 22%, P=0.004) than AGA-positive children. CONCLUSION: Serum AGA seem no longer useful for monitoring compliance to gluten-free diet. In children where AGA are negative at diagnosis, when the child eats a normal amount of gluten, they are going to remain negative even after poor compliance.},

AIMS: We evaluated the bread wheat line C173 for its effects on the in vitro-grown duodenal mucosa of CD patients. METHODS: In vitro-grown duodenal mucosa biopsies of 19 CD patients on a gluten-free diet were exposed to peptic/tryptic-digested prolamins from bread wheat line C173 lacking gliadin-glutenin subunits, analyzed for morphology, cytokine and anti-tTG antibody production, and compared with mucosa biopsies exposed to prolamins from wild-type cv. San Pastore. RESULTS: Duodenal mucosa biopsies exposed to prolamins from C173 and San Pastore released higher amounts of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-10 and anti-tTG antibodies in the culture medium than untreated controls. The line C173 differed from cv. San Pastore as it did not produce negative effects on enterocyte height, suggesting that manipulating prolamin composition can affect innate immune responses of CD mucosa to wheat gluten. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that this gliadin-deficient wheat has a lower direct toxicity but activates an immunologic reaction of the duodenal mucosa like that of the common wheat species.},

AIMS: we assessed colonoscopic findings in unselected patients with coeliac disease, since there are no studies available also considering morphological aspects, and there is literature suggestion of increased prevalence of colorectal tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: colonoscopies with multiple biopsies were retrospectively analyzed in 42 coeliac disease patients on gluten-free diet above age 40; 16 had clinical or laboratory features of iron deficiency anaemia. Mucosal biopsies were evaluated for the presence of intraepithelial lymphocytes and of mucosal eosinophils, in addition to conventional histologic assessment, and compared with those obtained in 15 controls. RESULTS: macroscopic abnormalities (polyps, diverticula, inflammatory changes) were found in 26% of patients. Microscopic abnormalities (lymphocytic colitis, melanosis coli, rectal histiocytosis) were found in 36% of patients. None of these findings was found in controls. Coeliac disease patients had significantly higher eosinophil score than controls in the right colon, whereas this was not significantly different between groups in the left colon. CONCLUSIONS: colonoscopic findings in coeliac disease on gluten-free diet may reveal significant findings, even in patients without iron deficiency anaemia. There is the need of further studies in larger cohorts of patients to establish whether colonoscopy in these patients may be clinically useful.},

STUDY DESIGN: This longitudinal, retrospective study (duration of follow-up, 8.9 +/- 4.0 years) was conducted at the Pediatric Department, University of Bologna, Italy. One hundred thirty-five consecutive patients diagnosed between June 1990 and December 2004 and followed on a gluten-free diet were examined. Inclusion criteria were good dietary compliance and duration of follow-up for at least 3 years. RESULTS: Of 101 patients who never showed positive antithyroid titers during the follow-up, 86 remained euthyroid; 15 showed high thyroid-stimulating hormone values at diagnosis that normalized in 11 cases after 12 to 18 months of gluten withdrawal. Of 31 patients with persistently positive antibody titers, 23 (74%) remained consistently euthyroid during the follow-up and 8 (26%) had a subclinical hypothyroidism. The prevalence of cases with positive antibodies was similar in children with growth retardation or gastroenterological symptoms at diagnosis and different durations of gluten exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of antithyroid antibodies in children with celiac disease has a low predictive value for the development of thyroid hypofunction during the indicated surveillance period. Longer follow-up is needed.},

   abstract = {An aberrant immune response triggered by dietary gluten is the main driving force underlying celiac disease (CD), but other biologic pathways that are dysregulated also participate in disease development. Genetic variation within these pathways might influence expression, contributing to susceptibility to CD. We have investigated the implication of ubiquitin D (UBD), a member of the ubiquitin-proteasome system that is strongly upregulated in the intestinal mucosa of active CD. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of intestinal biopsy sample pairs (at diagnosis vs treated) from 30 CD patients confirmed overexpression of UBD in active disease tissue (fold change = 8.3; p = 0.0022). In silico prediction tools identified rs11724 as a putative regulatory single nucleotide polymorphism and association analysis of 468 CD patients and 459 controls revealed that the minor rs11724*C allele was more frequent among patients (minor allele frequency = 0.44 vs 0.39; odds ratio [OR] = 1.23; p = 0.028) and suggested a dominant allele effect (OR = 1.49; p = 0.0045). Correlation of the rs11724 genotype and UBD mRNA levels (OR = 0.76; p = 0.0021) further supports its implication in disease development.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a complex, immune-mediated intolerance to gliadin that develops in genetically susceptible individuals. Although the main driving force of the disease is an aberrant autoimmune response, several other pathogenic mechanisms, many still unidentified, are also involved. In order to describe at a network level the alterations provoked by a gliadin insult on the intestinal mucosa of patients, we compared the expression profiles of biopsies from 9 active and 9 treated patients (long-term effects of gliadin), and of 10 biopsies from gluten-free diet treated patients that were incubated in vitro with or without gliadin (acute effects) and integrated significantly altered transcripts into potentially pathogenic biological processes. Using information on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways and Gene Ontology terms represented among the differentially expressed genes, we observed important dysfunction in several complex networks, including those related to cell-cell communication, intracellular signaling, ubiquitin-proteasome system, cell cycle/apoptosis and extracellular matrix. The reconstruction of the role of these biological networks in the development of the intestinal lesion in CD provides a comprehensive picture of key events that contribute to the disease, and could point towards novel functional candidates that might be potential therapeutic targets or responsible for genetic susceptibility.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Celiac disease (CD) is an enteric disease caused by dietary gluten in individuals with genetic predisposition. One of the clinical manifestations of CD is the peripheral arthritis that may simulate RA. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of anti-gliadin (aGL), anti-tissue transglutaminase (aTGT) and ultra purified anti-gliadin (AGLU) antibodies in patients with RA. METHODS: Cross-sectional study. We included consecutive patients diagnosed as RA (ACR). Demographic and clinical data was registered by direct interview and serum levels of aGL, aTGT y aGLU were determined using ELISA. RESULTS: Eighty-five RA patients were included; 87% were women. Mean age was 44+/-12 years, mean disease duration 12 +/-9 years. aGL IgG antibodies were positive in 16 patients, IgA aGL antibodies in 29 patients, aGLU in 14 patients and only one patient had aTGT. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that CD may be the correct diagnosis in a patient with polyarthritis, even if the patient meets the ACR criteria for RA. In other words, CD should be considered among the differential diagnoses in a patient with poly-arthritis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is the only treatable autoimmune disease, provided that a correct diagnosis is achieved and a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet is implemented. The current diagnostic algorithm for celiac disease includes initial screening serological tests, followed by a confirmatory small intestinal biopsy showing the autoimmune insult typical of celiac disease. The biopsy, considered the diagnostic gold standard, has been recently questioned as a reliable and conclusive test for every case. Indeed, the wide variability of celiac disease-related findings suggests that it is difficult to conceptualize the diagnostic process into rigid algorithms that do not always cover the clinical complexity of this disease. Instead we find clinically useful the shifting to a quantitative approach that can be defined as the "4 out of 5" rule: the diagnosis of celiac disease is confirmed if at least 4 of the following 5 criteria are satisfied: typical symptoms of celiac disease; positivity of serum celiac disease immunoglobulin, A class autoantibodies at high titer; human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or DQ8 genotypes; celiac enteropathy at the small bowel biopsy; and response to the gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Whether diet may influence autoimmunity has been the subject of many unsolved debates. Interestingly, growing evidence indicates a large overlap between the mechanisms controlling tolerance to dietary antigens and autoimmunity. To discuss these links, we will focus on two model human diseases. The first one is IPEX syndrome due to mutations in the X-linked foxp3 gene. Studies of this disease underscore the role of regulatory FOXP3+ T cells in controlling the reactivity against self antigens and the response to dietary proteins in humans. The second is celiac disease, a complex poly-genic disease where exposure to dietary wheat proteins can trigger an autoimmune-like attack of the intestine frequently associated with the onset of extra-digestive autoimmune disorders. In the later disease, recent work shed light on the mechanisms that drive the intestinal inflammatory response to gluten and suggests impairment of immunoregulatory mechanisms that control intestinal tolerance and autoimmunity. Yet the exact role of gluten in the pathogenesis of extra-intestinal autoimmunity has not been elucidated. Interestingly, recent work indicates that dietary factors, including vitamin A and breast milk feeding, can protect against the development of harmful responses to dietary proteins. It is unclear whether this protection can apply to the prevention of autoimmunity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess dietary compliance to Gluten Free Diet (GFD), to identify barriers to compliance and to study the impact of diet on the psychosocial behavior of children with celiac disease. METHODS: Children diagnosed with celiac disease and followed up for more than 6 months, were assessed for dietary compliance. After this assessment, patients were subjected to an interview, consisting of self administered questionnaire, by the investigator who was blinded to initial results of initial assessment. Psychosocial parameters were assessed by standard Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) containing 35 items. Dietary compliant and non-compliant groups were compared for assessed factors affecting the dietary compliance. Cases were also compared to healthy controls for psychosocial parameters. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were assessed for dietary compliance: 53(75%) were found to be dietary compliant, 13(18%) dietary non-compliant while 4 had doubtful dietary compliance. Final analysis was done for 64 patients who had complete assessment; 4 patients with doubtful dietary compliance and 2 patients who had incomplete assessment, were excluded. Dietary compliance was higher in younger children (>80%) compared to adolescents (44%); in children with higher maternal education; in parents having better knowledge and understanding of disease. Compliance was better in nuclear families; with less number of siblings (68.3% of compliant had <2 siblings compared to 23% in non-compliant); in families with higher per capita income. Dietary compliance was also better in children who presented with typical symptoms of celiac disease (72% of dietary compliant presented with loose motion as presenting symptom compared to only 15% in non-compliant). Celiac children had problems related to adjustment such as difficulty in maintaining diet at school, restaurants, trips, etc.45% patients complained that their teachers don't understand the nature of their disease. Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) score was above cut-off in 4 children of dietary non-compliant group. Few individual PSC items such as complaints of aches and pains; is irritable, angry; does not listen to the rules, blames other for mistakes; teases others; refuses to share, were more common in celiac children than control. CONCLUSIONS: Noncompliance to gluten free dietary regimen is seen in 18 % of cases. Dietary noncompliance is more common in the adolescent age group, in joint families and those who have more number of siblings. Dietary restrictions have impact on child's social activities and thus psychosocial parameters (PSC score) are better in the dietary compliant group.},

AIM: To investigate body mass index (BMI) and effect of GFD on BMI of celiac disease patients in the United States where obesity is a systematic problem. METHODS: BMI at diagnosis and after 2.8 years (mean) on a GFD were compared with national data. RESULTS: Among our patients (n=369, 67.2% female), 17.3% were underweight, 60.7% normal, 15.2% overweight, and 6.8% obese. All patients were followed by a dietitian. Compared with national data, females had lower BMI (21.9 vs. 24.2, P<0.0001) and fewer were overweight (11% vs. 21%, P<0.0001); more males had a normal BMI (59.5% vs. 34%, P<0.0001) and fewer were underweight (9.1% vs. 26.7%, P<0.0001). Factors associated with low BMI were female sex, Marsh IIIb/c histology, and presentation with diarrhea. On GFD, 66% of those who were underweight gained weight, whereas 54% of overweight and 47% of obese patients lost weight. CONCLUSIONS: A GFD had a beneficial impact on BMI, underweight patients gained weight and overweight/obese patients lost weight. The improvement in BMI adds to the impetus to diagnose celiac disease. Expert dietary counseling may be a major factor in the beneficial effects we noted.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: High prevalence of coeliac disease (CD) has been reported among patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We evaluated the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of screening for CD by rapid test of anti-transglutaminase antibodies in the cardiology outpatients' clinic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We screened the blood samples of 104 patients with DCM, 44 of their first-degree relatives, 63 diseased controls and 101 healthy controls for the presence of anti-transglutaminase antibodies in a drop of whole blood using a rapid assay. This test was compared to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the anti-endomysium antibody test. RESULTS: Our rapid test was positive in three (2.9%) DCM patients, in one (2%) relative and in one (1%) healthy control. These subjects were positive at both control assays. Two DCM patients had iron-deficient anaemia. The healthy relative was asymptomatic, while the healthy control experienced extreme asthenia. The relative refused intestinal biopsy, while the others showed histological evidence of CD. During the gluten-free diet, the patient with the worst left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) underwent heart transplant, and LVEF values improved in the other two. Anaemia and tiredness resolved in all patients. CONCLUSION: Early detection of CD in a cardiological setting allows prompt treatment with a gluten-free diet of gluten-dependent complaints with potential benefits for the course of DCM.},

   abstract = {1. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid with a local anti-inflammatory effect. Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated disease caused by gluten ingestion in intolerant patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of budesonide in malabsorptive coeliac patients and its effect in an in vitro gliadin challenge. 2. Twenty coeliac patients with malabsorption were enrolled in the present study and were randomly assigned to one of two 4 week treatments: (i) a gluten-free diet alone; or (ii) a gluten-free diet plus 6 mg budesonide daily. At the end of 4 weeks treatment, all patients underwent clinical evaluation, laboratory tests and self-evaluation of well-being using a visual analogue scale. Intestinal biopsies from five coeliac patients (selected randomly) and four non-coeliac disease controls who underwent upper endoscopy for intestinal bleeding were challenged with gliadin (0.5 mg/mL) and budesonide (10-30 microg/mL) for 3 and 24 h. Biopsies were tested by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence for known markers of inflammation. 3. Treatment of patients with 6 mg budesonide daily for 4 weeks resulted in increased bodyweight, a decreased number of evacuations and decreased stool weight compared with patients on a gluten-free diet alone for 4 weeks. Well-being scores were higher in patients treated with both a gluten-free diet and budesonide compared with those receiving a gluten-free diet alone. 4. In vitro studies showed that budesonide reduced epithelial tyrosine phosphorylation and expression of histocompatibility leucocyte antigen complex DR (HLA-DR) elicited by gliadin-derived peptides. In addition, the expression of cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 in the lamina propria was reduced in patients treated with both gliadin and budesonide compared with patients treated with gliadin alone. Budesonide alone decreased HLA-DR in crypt enterocytes, as well as ICAM-1 and COX-2 expression in the lamina propria of biopsy specimen of coeliac patients. Budesonide had no effect in control samples. 5. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that budesonide shows efficacy in the treatment of symptoms in adult coeliac patients with overt malabsorption. The mechanism underlying the effects of budesonide in reducing symptoms was elucidated by in vitro studies involving a gliadin challenge.},

   abstract = {Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) was identified as the humoral autoantigen in coeliac disease, but whether it can also serve as T cell autoantigen is still unknown. We aimed, therefore, to firstly explore the presence of TG2-specific T cells in peripheral blood of ten adult patients (four active, i.e. carrying both serological and histological features of the disease; four treated, i.e. with proven mucosal recovery and disappearance of specific antibodies after an adequate period of gluten free diet; and two potential coeliacs, i.e. carrying the serological stigmata of the disease, but not the intestinal lesions), and four healthy controls (two carrying the HLA-DQ2 haplotype of susceptibility to the disease), and secondly to carry out a detailed in vitro characterization of the isolated antigen-specific T cells. T cell lines were first established by means of weekly stimulation with human recombinant TG2 followed by generation of T cell clones through distribution of T cells on plates at one cell/well limiting dilution and further rounds of stimulation. Antigen specificity and HLA-DQ2 restriction were both assessed by evaluating the proliferative response to TG2 in the absence and presence of human sera blocking HLA-DQ2 molecules, after exclusion of impurities in the antigen preparation. Immune phenotyping of T cell clones was performed by flow cytometry, and the expression of IL-1a, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TGF-beta, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha was determined by ELISA assay on the supernatants of these clones. A total of 91 T cell clones were isolated from the three HLA-DQ2-positive, active patients, but none from the other patients and controls. The immune phenotyping showed that the majority of them (85.7 percent) were CD3/CD4+ and only a small percentage (14.3 percent) were CD3/CD8+, all carried the TCR alphabeta, and had a memory phenotype. The cytokine profile showed high levels of IFN-gamma and IL-6 that, together with the absence of IL-4, placed these T cell clones in the T helper type 1-like category. Further in vitro analysis was carried out on 32/91 CD4+ clones and showed a specific and dose-dependent proliferative response towards TG2 and an HLA-DQ2 restriction. Finally, when incubating duodenal mucosal specimens of treated patients with the supernatant of TG2-specific T cell clones, characteristic disease lesions were found, indicating a role for TG2-specific cellular immune response in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Celiac disease is an abnormal T cell-mediated immune response against dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. The aim of our prospective study was to evaluate the frequency of Celiac disease in patients with lymphoma and to determine the usefulness of the anti-gliadin and anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) for diagnosis of Celiac disease in this patient group. METHODS: We studied 119 patients with previously or newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 60 patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma who presented at the hematology and medical oncology divisions of Dicle University Hospital in Turkey between December 2002 and January 2006. Serological screening for Celiac disease was performed in all patients by searching for serum anti-gliadin immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G, and EMA immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G. RESULTS: In the Hodgkin's lymphoma group, anti-gliadin immunoglobulin A was detected in 9 (15%) patients (3 male, 6 female), and antigliadin immunoglobulin G was detected in 21 (35%) patients (15 male, 6 female). In the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma group, antigliadin immunoglobulin A was detected in 6 (5%) patients (2 M male 4 female), and anti-gliadin immunoglobulin G was detected in 30 (25.2%) patients (18 male, 12 female). EMA immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G were not detected in the Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our report is the first to describe the frequency of Celiac disease in patients with lymphoma in the southeast region of Turkey. In our study, there was no evidence that Celiac disease is a pre-malignant condition for lymphoma. Serological screening for Celiac disease in lymphoma patients does not seem to be necessary.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To identify specific gut bacteria associated with coeliac disease (CD) at diagnosis and after treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD) in a paediatric population. METHODS: 30 and 18 faecal samples from untreated and treated CD patients and 25 and 8 biopsy samples from untreated and treated CD patients, respectively, were analysed. In addition, 30 faecal and 8 biopsy samples from control children were evaluated for comparative purposes. Gut bacterial groups were quantified by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Bacteroides and Clostridium leptum groups were more abundant in faeces and biopsies of CD patients than in controls regardless of the stage of the disease. E coli and Staphylococcus counts were also higher in faeces and biopsies of non-treated CD patients than in those of controls, but their levels were normalised after treatment with a GFD. Bifidobacterium levels were lower in faeces of both groups of CD patients and in biopsies of untreated CD patients compared to controls. Similar bacterial groups were related to CD in biopsies and faeces, indicating that faecal microbiota partly reflects that of the small intestine in CD patients, and could constitute a convenient biological index of this disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Duodenal and faecal microbiota is unbalanced in children with untreated CD and only partially restored after long-term treatment with a GFD, constituting a novel factor linked to this disorder.},

AIM: To study the expression of IgE- and IgA-reactive antigens during wheat seed maturation and in different wheat cultivars. METHODS: Summer wheat was grown in a glasshouse and seeds were harvested at defined maturation stages. Mature seeds were obtained from 13 different defined cultivars. Protein extracts were prepared from different maturation stages and cultivars with a standardized procedure based on seed weight and analysed by IgE and IgA immunoblotting using sera from clinically defined patients suffering from wheat allergy or coeliac disease. RESULTS: With a few exceptions the expression of IgE- and IgA-reactive wheat antigens increased during wheat seed maturation. Wheat cultivars could be identified in which the expression of certain IgE- and IgA-reactive components was strongly reduced or not detectable. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of IgE- and IgA-reactive antigens depends on wheat seed maturation and varies in different wheat cultivars.},

Distinguishing between medical diagnosis, self-diagnosis, and scientific self-diagnosis, we examine patients' varied paths to diagnosis and their attempts to legitimize symptoms as celiac disease. Web-based direct-access testing (DAT) permits patients to bypass physician requisition for testing in their diagnostic quest. While such laboratories do not diagnose disease per se, they provide the consumer with the scientific information necessary to self-diagnose. This scientific self-diagnosis grants individuals greater legitimacy for their claims of an illness identity than self-diagnosis alone, but less legitimacy than medical diagnosis. We examine the implications of scientific self-diagnosis for the social construction of diagnosis and professional and lay ways of knowing.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest the involvement of both the adaptive and the innate immune system in celiac disease (CD). However, little is known about the immune phenotype of children with CD and its alteration upon dietary intervention. AIMS: We characterized the prevalence of major interacting members of the adaptive and innate immune system in peripheral blood of newly diagnosed children with CD and tested its alteration with the improvement of clinical signs after the introduction of gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Peripheral blood was taken from ten children with biopsy-proven CD at the time of diagnosis and after the resolution of clinical symptoms following GFD. As controls, 15 children with functional abdominal pain were enrolled. The prevalence of the cells of adaptive and innate immunity was measured with labeled antibodies against surface markers and intracellular FoxP3 using a flow cytometer. RESULTS: Patients with CD were found to have lower T helper, Th1 and natural killer (NK), NKT and invariant NKT cell prevalence and with higher prevalence of activated CD4(+) cells, myeloid dendritic cells (DC) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR-4 positive DCs and monocytes compared to controls. After resolution of symptoms on GFD, the majority of these changes normalized, although the prevalence of NK and NKT cell, DC and TLR-2 expressing DCs and monocytes remained abnormal. CONCLUSIONS: The immune phenotype in childhood CD indicates the implication of both adaptive and innate immune system. The normalization of immune abnormalities occurs on GFD, but the kinetics of this process probably differs among different cell types.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Marsh classification is a semiquantitative method for the diagnosis and monitoring of changes in duodenal biopsies in celiac disease. We have explored the possibility that quantitative changes in villous area and crypt length (morphometry) may provide better information on changes in duodenal morphology, particularly after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. METHODS: We measured villous height, apical and basal villous widths, and crypt length in 57 adults with celiac disease and 83 control subjects. Villous area was calculated as a trapezoid approximation. Serial changes in villous area and crypt length were determined at regular intervals for up to 4 years after the introduction of a gluten-free diet. Morphometric changes were also correlated with Marsh grade, self-reported adherence to a gluten-free diet, and changes in celiac serology. RESULTS: The gluten-free diet resulted in a progressive increase in villous area and a progressive decrease in crypt length. Morphometric improvement reached a plateau after 6-12 months with mean villous area attaining a value approximately half that of control subjects. Morphometric data were more sensitive than Marsh grade. Improvement in morphometric indices was significantly associated with the disappearance of anti-endomysial IgA antibody but not with dietary compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Morphometry is a sensitive way to document changes in duodenal biopsies in celiac disease. In adults treated with a gluten-free diet, it is uncommon for villous area to return to values observed in control subjects, but morphometric improvement is associated with the disappearance of anti-endomysial IgA antibody.},

   abstract = {The development of sensitive and specific serological assays for celiac disease has led to a revision of the prevalence of this disease in many countries. In the Asia-Pacific region, prevalence has been determined in only a minority of countries but those with prevalence rates of 1:50-1:500 adults include Australia, Iran, Israel, New Zealand, Syria and Turkey. In contrast, celiac disease appears to be extremely rare in Japan and may be rare in China. In India, prevalence rates are high in the northern states but much lower in the southern states. In individual countries, important determinants of prevalence include the per capita consumption of wheat and the frequency of a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type genetically defined as HLA-DQB1*02 (*0201 or *0202) and serologically defined as HLA-DQ2. These determinants predict low prevalence rates for celiac disease in the Pacific Islands, South-East Asia and eastern China but higher rates in countries west of India and China. There is also the potential for a rising incidence of celiac disease if traditional rice-based diets are replaced by Western-style diets with a higher content of wheat products.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy, characterized by an inappropriate T-cell-mediated immune response to the ingestion of certain dietary cereal proteins in genetically susceptible individuals. This disorder presents environmental, genetic, and immunological components. CD presents a prevalence of up to 1% in populations of European ancestry, yet a high percentage of cases remain underdiagnosed. The diagnosis and treatment should be made early since untreated disease causes growth retardation and atypical symptoms, like infertility or neurological disorders. The diagnostic criteria for CD, which requires endoscopy with small bowel biopsy, have been changing over the last few decades, especially due to the advent of serological tests with higher sensitivity and specificity. The use of serological markers can be very useful to rule out clinical suspicious cases and also to help monitor the patients, after adherence to a gluten-free diet. Since the current treatment consists of a life-long gluten-free diet, which leads to significant clinical and histological improvement, the standardization of an assay to assess in an unequivocal way gluten in gluten-free foodstuff is of major importance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We analysed whether the quantification of autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase could be used to predict mucosal destruction and disease severity in patients with gluten sensitivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy patients with coeliac disease (CD), comprising 52 children with severe malabsorption (group I), 59 children with mild symptoms (group II), 59 adults (group III), 134 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and 131 disease controls, were studied. Serial serum samples of patients in groups I and II on a gluten-free diet were also included. Serum levels of antibodies against recombinant tissue transglutaminase were determined with ELISA using standard curves for quantification of antibodies. RESULTS: Immunoglobulin (Ig)A antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (IgA-TGA) were detected in all of the patients with CD and in 95% of the DH patients. The IgA-TGA and IgG-TGA levels were higher in group I (P < 0.001). The IgG-TGA levels and positivity rate in group I (100%) were higher than in group II (81%), group III (73%), and the DH group (67%). Elevated IgA-TGA and IgG-TGA levels in combination predicted a more severe small intestinal atrophy (P < 0.0001) with a specificity of 99% for Marsh IIIb-IIIc (flat) lesions. The kinetics of the IgA-TGA decrease during diet differed between groups I and II. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of IgA-TGA and IgG-TGA antibodies were associated with the grade of mucosal villous atrophy and a more severe clinical presentation. The combined measurement of IgA-TGA and IgG-TGA enables a noninvasive prediction of small intestinal villous atrophy with high accuracy, and may reduce the need for a biopsy in patients with suspected CD.},

   abstract = {In this work a multiresidual LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the simultaneous detection of free and bound fumonisins is described, which allowed for a very low LOD and a very good recovery for all the analytes. The method was applied to the determination of free and bound fumonisins in several gluten-free products from the Italian market. Free fumonisins were found to occur in 90% of the samples: the overall median value was below the EU legal limit for foods for human consumption (800 microg/kg). Nonetheless, fumonisins occurred in several samples at concentrations above the legal limit, reaching also very strong contamination levels (maximum concentration level: 3310 microg/kg). Anyway, considering the limited diet of people suffering of the celiac disease or allergic to other wheat proteins, the incidence of fumonisin contamination may be envisaged as problematic. Furthermore, bound fumonisins were found to be present in all the analysed samples at similar or even higher amounts than the free forms. In many cases the sum of free and bound fumonisins exceeded the EU legal limit for total fumonisins also for those samples characterized by a low contamination of free fumonisins, thus opening a new important task to be addressed for the risk assessment in this field.},

   abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A case of acute celiac artery compression syndrome after spinal fusion in a patient with Scheuermann kyphosis is reported. OBJECTIVE: To describe the unusual complication of acute celiac artery compression after surgical kyphosis correction, to outline diagnostic methods, and to review the pertinent literature. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Chronic celiac artery compression syndrome is well described, yet there is only 1 reported case of acute celiac artery compression after surgical correction of kyphosis. There have been no previous reports of this complication leading to foregut ischemic necrosis after correction of Scheuermann kyphosis. METHODS: Case report and literature review. RESULTS: After an anterior release and posterior spinal fusion for a 106 degrees kyphotic deformity performed under 1 anesthetic, our patient developed a perforated gastric antrum on postoperative day 5, evolving to ischemic necrosis of the stomach, gallbladder, and spleen discovered on postoperative day 7. Abdominal angiography indicated that his celiac artery had been occluded at its origin. After this event, the patient required a prolonged intensive care hospital stay and required a Roux-en-Y gastro-jejeunostomy reconstruction. He is now doing well at 1-year follow-up with independent ambulation and a regular diet. CONCLUSION: Acute celiac artery compression after surgical kyphosis correction is a rare but potentially serious adverse event. Spinal deformity surgeons and intensivists should be aware of this entity, and should have a high index of suspicion for it if sepsis of unknown origin, an acute abdomen, or elevated liver enzymes are encountered after surgery after correction of a kyphotic deformity.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured GAD antibodies (GADAs), insulinoma-associated protein 2 antigens (IA-2As), and insulin autoantibodies (IAAs) in 188 young Italian patients with celiac disease (66 male [35.1%]). Mean age at celiac disease diagnosis was 5.4 years (0.5-17.1), and mean celiac disease duration was 4.2 years (0-28.8). Celiac disease was diagnosed by jejunal biopsy after positivity for endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibody was confirmed. RESULTS: GADAs were positive in seven patients (3.7%), and IA-2As were positive in two patients. IAAs were negative in all cases. Metabolic evaluation was normal, and no patients developed diabetes during follow-up. There was no significant association among beta-cell autoimmunity and sex, age, pubertal stage, family history, or coexistence of other autoimmune disorders; compliance to a gluten-free diet was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed a low prevalence of beta-cell autoimmunity and do not support a precocious screening for beta-cell autoimmunity in young celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Refractory sprue (RS) is a rare malabsorption syndrome defined by persisting small bowel villous atrophy despite a strict gluten-free diet. The clinical picture and long-term outcome of RS is highly variable and is not well described. AIM: To define underlying and accompanying diseases and clinical outcome in consecutive patients with RS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and histological data from patients with RS at our department were analyzed retrospectively. RS was defined as villous atrophy and malabsorption despite a strict gluten-free diet persisting without improvement for more than 6 months or requiring earlier therapeutic intervention. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with RS were identified (23 RS type I, nine RS type II). Follow-up period was 55 (12-372) months. Two patients progressed from RS type I into type II. Thrombembolic events occurred in nine cases, and additional autoimmune diseases were found in 17 patients. Overt intestinal T-cell lymphoma developed in four patients with RS type II. Three patients with RS type II died during the observation period owing to intestinal T-cell lymphoma and four with RS type I owing to infectious complications. Five-year cumulative survival was 90% (95% confidence interval 76-100) in patients with RS type I and higher than in patients with RS type II (53%, 12-94%; P<0.05). CONCLUSION: RS comprises a very heterogenous group of patients with long-term survival seen even in single patients with RS type II. Overall, survival is shorter in RS type II in comparison with RS type I. Patients with RS type I, however, show similar rates of disease-related complications as well as substantial mortality.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory enteropathy caused by cellular immunity to dietary gluten. More than 90% of patients carry HLA-DQ2 encoded by HLA-DQA1*05 and DQB1*02, and gluten-specific CD4(+) T cells from intestinal biopsies of these patients are HLA-DQ2-restricted, produce Th1 cytokines and preferentially recognize gluten peptides deamidated by tissue transglutaminase. We generated mice lacking murine MHC class II genes that are transgenic for human CD4 and the autoimmunity and celiac disease-associated HLA-DR3-DQ2 haplotype. Immunization with the alpha-gliadin 17-mer that incorporates the overlapping DQ2-alpha-I and DQ2-alpha-II epitopes immunodominant in human celiac disease generates peptide-specific HLA-DQ2-restricted CD4(+) T cells. When exposed to dietary gluten, naive or gliadin-primed mice do not develop pathology. Coincident introduction of dietary gluten and intestinal inflammation resulted in low-penetrance enteropathy and tissue transglutaminase-specific IgA. Two further strains of transgenic mice expressing HLA-DR3-DQ2 and human CD4, one with a NOD background and another TCR transgenic having over 90% of CD4(+) T cells specific for the DQ2-alpha-II epitope with a Th1 phenotype, were also healthy when consuming gluten. These humanized mouse models indicate that gluten ingestion can be tolerated without intestinal pathology even when HLA-DQ2-restricted CD4(+) T cell immunity to gluten is established, thereby implicating additional factors in controlling the penetrance of celiac disease.},

The nature of CD pathogenesis remains unclear, but recent evidence indicates that both innate and adaptive immune responses are necessary for the phenotypic expression and pathologic changes characteristic of CD. Extensive studies of molecules produced by immune cells in the gut of CD patients have led to identification of two cytokines, namely interleukin (IL)-15 and IL-21, which are thought to play a major role in orchestrating the mucosal inflammatory response in CD. Here we review the current knowledge of the expression and function of IL-15 and IL-21 in CD.},

   abstract = {Diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota and host's health, particularly in patients suffering from food-related diseases. Coeliac disease (CD) is a permanent intolerance to cereal gluten proteins and the only therapy for the patients is to adhere to a life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). In the present preliminary study, the effects of a GFD on the composition and immune function of the gut microbiota were analysed in ten healthy subjects (mean age 30.3 years) over 1 month. Faecal microbiota was analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The ability of faecal bacteria to stimulate cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was determined by ELISA. No significant differences in dietary intake were found before and after the GFD except for reductions (P = 0.001) in polysaccharides. Bifidobacterium, Clostridium lituseburense and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii proportions decreased (P = 0.007, P = 0.031 and P = 0.009, respectively) as a result of the GFD analysed by FISH. Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium longum counts decreased (P = 0.020, P = 0.001 and P = 0.017, respectively), while Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli counts increased (P = 0.005 and P = 0.003) after the GFD assessed by qPCR. TNF-alpha, interferon-gamma, IL-10 and IL-8 production by PBMC stimulated with faecal samples was also reduced (P = 0.021, P = 0.037, P = 0.002 and P = 0.007, respectively) after the diet. Therefore, the GFD led to reductions in beneficial gut bacteria populations and the ability of faecal samples to stimulate the host's immunity. Thus, the GFD may constitute an environmental variable to be considered in treated CD patients for its possible effects on gut health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a chronic intestinal inflammatory disorder due to an aberrant immune response to dietary gluten proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. Mucosal immune response through IgA secretion constitutes a first line of defence responsible for neutralizing noxious antigens and pathogens. The aim of this study was the characterization of the relationships between immunoglobulin-coated bacteria and bacterial composition of faeces of coeliac disease (CD) patients, untreated and treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD) and healthy controls. RESULTS: IgA-coated faecal bacterial levels were significantly lower in both untreated and treated CD patients than in healthy controls. IgG and IgM-coated bacterial levels were also significantly lower in treated CD patients than in untreated CD patients and controls. Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria ratio was significantly reduced in both CD patients compared to controls. Bifidobacterium, Clostridium histolyticum, C. lituseburense and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii group proportions were less abundant (P < 0.050) in untreated CD patients than in healthy controls. Bacteroides-Prevotella group proportions were more abundant (P < 0.050) in untreated CD patients than in controls. Levels of IgA coating the Bacteroides-Prevotella group were significantly reduced (P < 0.050) in both CD patients in comparison with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: In CD patients, reduced IgA-coated bacteria is associated with intestinal dysbiosis, which altogether provide new insights into the possible relationships between the gut microbiota and the host defences in this disorder.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic intestinal disease caused by intolerance to dietary wheat gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. There are a number of important open questions that impede the full explanation of the pathogenesis of this disease. We analyzed protein expression pattern in gut biopsies of CD subjects. Patients were selected and grouped according to histological inflammatory degree. Groups consisted of nine individuals with CD: three patients had a Marsh 0, three a Marsh I-II, and three a Marsh III. All CD patients showed a human leukocyte antigen DQ2/8 variant. Controls were three individuals with an excluded CD diagnosis. For the first time, galectin-10 expression was found related to the histological grade (P = 0.0092) and with the number of eosinophils in the lesion (P = 0.0040). Results suggest galectin-10 is a novel marker for evaluating CD tissue damage and eosinophils as a possible target for therapeutic approaches. Moreover, our data provide insights into alterations associated with CD tissue damage and pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent intolerance to wheat prolamins and related proteins displayed by genetically susceptible individuals. Blocking or modulation of CD-specific T cell response by altered prolamin peptides are currently considered as a potential alternative to the only effective therapy of CD based on a life-long gluten-free diet. Two prolamin peptides, the 9-mer ASRVAPGQQ and the 10-mer GTVGVAPGQQ sequences, were identified by mass spectrometry in the peptic/tryptic digest of prolamins (PTP) from durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) cv. Adamello, and investigated for their ability to preclude the stimulation of CD-specific mucosal T cells by gluten proteins. METHODS: Gluten-specific polyclonal intestinal T cell lines from five CD children (mean age 5 years) were exposed to 50 microg/ml of a deamidated PTP from whole flour of common wheat (T. aestivum) cv. San Pastore, and tested for proliferation and production of interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). The same experiment was performed in the presence of 20 microg/ml of the 9-mer or the 10-mer peptide. RESULTS: T cells exposed to PTP showed a threefold increase in proliferation and INF-gamma production, and a significant (P <or= 0.05) reduction in IL-10 secretion as compared with control cells incubated with the culture medium. Addition of either the 9-mer or the 10-mer peptide to PTP downregulated T cell proliferation and INF-gamma production, and caused a significant (P <or= 0.05) increase in IL-10 secretion. CONCLUSIONS: The T cell reactivity elicited by PTP is precluded by both the 9-mer and the 10-mer sequence, suggesting that over-expression of these proteolytically stable peptides may result in a wheat flour with reduced toxicity for CD patients.},

An informatic tool (ALIM V 1.0) developed by the authors, was used for the formulation of these foods. The obtained products were pancakes, scons, precooked pizza and bread which were analyzed in their chemical composition (protein, fat, fiber, moisture, ash and carbohydrates). Water activity (aw), acceptability and texture parameters (hardness, gumminess, chewiness, adhesiveness and cohesiveness) were also determined. Commercial products (C) were taken as reference and were performed the same analysis to formulated products (F). Significant differences were found in protein, fat moisture, ash and fiber content and in most of the texture parameters studied in both food groups (p<0.05). In pancakes and scones (F) was observed an increase of protein of 88 and 198% respectively, while prepizza and bread (F) showed lower contents (8 and 22%) respect to their commercial pairs, however all products (F) have Chemical Scores higher to 100. The aw of products (F) and (C), gave values similar to the data cited on bibliography for analogous products. The formulations more acceptable (values over 80%) were scones and pancakes. Overall, the formulated products provide good quality proteins, have good textural characteristics and adequate percentages of acceptability to be used in the feeding of celiac patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The possible autoimmune involvement of the pituitary gland in patients with celiac disease (CD) has been suggested but demonstrated in only a few patients on gluten-free diet. We aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical meaning of anti-pituitary antibodies (APA) in children and adolescents with the newly diagnosed CD. METHODS: A total of 119 patients with CD (0.9-15.8 years old) attending the inpatient clinic of University Hospital were recruited for the cross-sectional study. Their height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were recorded, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and APA were assayed. APA was also determined in 98 sex- and age-matched controls. RESULTS: APA were detected in 50 patients (42.0%), 15 of them with high titer (30%) and 35 with low titer (70%), and in 2 control subjects at low titer (2%) (P<0.001). IGF-1 was higher in patients with negative than with low titer (P=0.02) or high titer APA (P=0.03). Height was more reduced in high-titer APA patients than in the negative ones (P<0.01). Height was positively correlated with IGF-1 (P<0.01) and negatively with chronological age (P=0.001). IGF-1 was positively correlated with BMI (P<0.001). For height prediction the regression analysis showed the rank order 1 for chronological age and 2 for IGF-1. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper we have shown a remarkable prevalence of positive APA in newly diagnosed CD patients. High APA titers are associated with height impairment, likely mediated by a reduction of IGF-1, thus suggesting that autoimmune pituitary process could induce a linear-growth impairment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Radix Astragali, a traditional Chinese medicine, on endothelium-dependent and non-dependent vasodilation in food-induced obese SD rats. METHODS: Fifteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups. The control group (n=5) was fed with normal chow; The obese group (n=5) was fed with high fat chow; The Astragali group (n=5) was fed with high fat chow and Astragali in drinking water. At the end of six weeks, all rats were killed and heart blood samples were taken to assess serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and free fat acid. The thoracic aortas rings were harvested and equilibrated in Krebs-Henseleit solution. To measure the endothelium-dependent relaxation, the aortas rings were constricted in response to norepinephrine. After a stable contraction plateau was reached, cumulative dose-response for relaxation to Acetylcholine (10(-8)-10(-4) mol/L) were obtained in each rings. Identical experiments were conducted with 10(-8)-10(-4) mol/L sodium nitroprusside as the endothelium independent vasorelaxting agent. Responses to vasodlilators were expressed as percentage relaxation in all preconstricted state. RESULTS: The ratio of celiac fat and body weight in the obese rats was higher than in the controls. The levels of serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and free fat acid were elevated in the Obese Group compared with the Control Group. The Astragali Group had lower triglyceride and free fat acid levels than the Obese Group. Compared with the rats with high-fat diet, the rats fed with Astragali lost about 32% of celiac fat. Acetylcholine (10(-8)-10(-4) mol/L) caused a concentration-dependent relaxation in all preconstricted aortic rings. Compared to the control group, maximal endothelium dependent relaxation in the obese group was impaired (P<0.05). In the Astragali group, the relaxation to acetylcholine was intermediate between control and obese group (P<0.05). Sodium nitroprusside (10(-8)-10(-4) mol/L) induced potent relaxation (endothelium independent relaxation) in all rat aortic rings that did not differ statistically between groups. CONCLUSION: Astragalus has salutary effects on impaired endothelial dysfunction in the context of obesity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND GOALS: In the clinical management of celiac disease, new noninvasive tools for evaluation of intestinal damage are needed for diagnosis and for follow-up of diet effects. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) are potentially useful for this purpose as these are small cytosolic proteins present in enterocytes and sensitive markers for intestinal mucosal damage. First, the distribution and microscopic localization of FABP in the healthy human intestine was examined. Second, levels of circulating FABP were measured in patients with celiac disease before and after introducing a gluten-free diet (GFD) and in healthy controls. STUDY: The distribution and microscopic localization of FABP in normal human intestinal tissue was assessed using surgical intestinal specimens of 39 patients. Circulating levels of intestinal (I)-FABP and liver (L)-FABP were determined in 26 healthy volunteers and 13 patients with biopsy proven celiac disease. Ten of these patients were reevaluated within 1 year after starting GFD. RESULTS: I-FABP and L-FABP are predominantly present in the small intestine, mainly the jejunum. Moreover, FABP are expressed in cells on the upper part of the villi, the initial site of destruction in celiac disease. Circulating levels of FABP are significantly elevated in untreated patients with biopsy proven celiac disease compared with healthy controls (I-FABP: 784.7 pg/mL vs. 172.7 pg/mL, P<0.001; L-FABP: 48.4 ng/mL vs. 10.4 ng/mL, P<0.001). In response to GFD, these concentrations normalize. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot study strongly suggest that FABP can be used as a noninvasive method for assessment of intestinal damage in celiac disease. Besides an additional role in the diagnosis of celiac disease, FABP potentially enable noninvasive monitoring of the GFD effects.},

For this condition, immunosuppressants represent the treatment. However, when these are stopped, AIH generally relapses. AIM: To determine in CD children liver test abnormality frequency, the effect of GFD alone, or plus prolonged immunosuppressants on AIH course. METHODS: Coeliac disease patients with abnormal transaminases were selected; if transaminases <5 x UNL (upper normal limits), GFD alone was administered; if >5 x UNL, liver examinations and biopsy were performed. In AIH, immunosuppressants were administered (5 years). Treatment was stopped only if patients remained in remission during the entire maintenance period and normalized liver histology. RESULTS: A total of 140 out of 350 CD children had hypertransaminaemia: 133 cryptogenic disease, 7 AIH. GFD normalized only cryptogenic hepatitis. During treatment, all AIH persistently normalized clinical and biochemical parameters; after withdrawal, six patients maintained a sustained remission (follow-up range: 12-63 months), while one relapsed. CONCLUSIONS: In CD children with AIH, only GFD plus immunosuppressants determines a high remission rate. When clinical remission is reached, a prolonged immunosuppressive regimen induces a high sustained remission rate after treatment withdrawal, indicating that this regimen may prevent early relapse.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: As shown by R5 antibody-based sandwich and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), selected lactobacilli and fungal proteases, routinely used in bakeries, degraded gluten to <10 ppm during sourdough fermentation. The resulting flour was mainly a mixture of water-/salt-soluble low-size peptides and free amino acids. Gliadin and glutenin fractions extracted from the pepsin-trypsin (PT) digest of the fermented wheat flour induced the expression of interferon (IFN)-gamma at the level comparable with the negative control. After fermentation, the wheat flour was spray dried and used for making sweet baked goods. Eight patients with CD in remission were enrolled for the clinical challenge, and they daily consumed 200 g of sweet baked goods equivalent to 10 g of native gluten. Hematology, serology (total serum IgA, IgG and IgA antigluten, endomysial and tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies), and intestinal permeability analyses were carried out over time. One patient interrupted the trial after 15 days and another after 30 days only due to difficulties in the compliance of the daily consumption. All of the other patients showed normal values of hematology, serology, and intestinal permeability during 60 days of challenge. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a wheat flour-fermented product, having gluten completely degraded, is not toxic for patients with CD. Nevertheless, these foods should not be recommended for patients with celiac disease until a formal trial has been done.},

   abstract = {This study aimed at investigating the fecal microbiotas of children with celiac disease (CD) before (U-CD) and after (T-CD) they were fed a gluten-free diet and of healthy children (HC). Brothers or sisters of T-CD were enrolled as HC. Each group consisted of seven children. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis with V3 universal primers revealed a unique profile for each fecal sample. PCR-DGGE analysis with group- or genus-specific 16S rRNA gene primers showed that the Lactobacillus community of U-CD changed significantly, while the diversity of the Lactobacillus community of T-CD was quite comparable to that of HC. Compared to HC, the ratio of cultivable lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacterium to Bacteroides and enterobacteria was lower in T-CD and even lower in U-CD. The percentages of strains identified as lactobacilli differed as follows: HC (ca. 38%) > T-CD (ca. 17%) > U-CD (ca. 10%). Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus rossiae, and Lactobacillus pentosus were identified only in fecal samples from T-CD and HC. Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus gasseri were identified only in several fecal samples from HC. Compared to HC, the composition of Bifidobacterium species of T-CD varied, and it varied even more for U-CD. Forty-seven volatile organic compounds (VOCs) belonging to different chemical classes were identified using gas-chromatography mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction analysis. The median concentrations varied markedly for HC, T-CD, and U-CD. Overall, the r(2) values for VOC data for brothers and sisters were equal to or lower than those for unrelated HC and T-CD. This study shows the effect of CD pathology on the fecal microbiotas of children.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small bowel induced in genetically susceptible people by the irritant gluten and possibly other environmental cofactors. The disorder is characterised by a diverse clinical heterogeneity that ranges from asymptomatic to severely symptomatic, and it manifests with frank malabsorption, an increased morbidity attributable to the frequent association with autoimmune disorders and increased mortality resulting from the emergence of T-cell clonal proliferations that predispose the patient to enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma. Our understanding of the molecular basis for this disorder has improved and enabled the identification of targets for new therapies, although a strict gluten-free diet remains the mainstay of safe and effective treatment. In this Seminar we critically reassess the clinical and diagnostic aspects of this disease and new perspectives in its pathogenesis and treatment.},

   abstract = {Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1, expressed on gut endothelial cells, in conjunction with integrin alpha(4)beta(7), expressed on lymphocytes, is critical in lymphocyte homing to the gut. The mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1/integrin alpha(4)beta(7) pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation by recruiting lymphocytes into inflamed gut. We explored the duodenal expression of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 and the peripheral T-cell expression of integrin alpha(4)beta(7) in patients with celiac disease. Duodenal biopsies and a peripheral blood sample were collected from 15 celiac patients, before and after 12 months of gluten-free diet, and from 12 control subjects. Treated celiac biopsies were cultured with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin and/or an anti-interferon alpha neutralizing antibody. Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 was determined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting. Integrin beta(7)-positive T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 expression was significantly higher in active celiac disease than in normal mucosa. After gluten-free diet, a dramatic reduction of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 was also observed. No difference was seen between patients with celiac disease after treatment and controls. Ex vivo peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin challenge induced a marked increase of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 expression. Blocking interferon alpha inhibited the peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin-induced mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 overexpression. The percentage of circulating beta(7)-positive T cells was significantly lower in untreated celiac disease in comparison to controls but normalized after gluten-free diet. Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 is strongly up-regulated in active celiac disease dependent on interferon alpha and is associated with peripheral depletion of integrin alpha(4)beta(7)-expressing T cells. We conclude that mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 may represent an important determinant for the generation of mucosal damage in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cognate interaction between CD40 on antigen-presenting cells and CD40 ligand (CD40L) on T cells is a crucial costimulatory signal in T-cell activation. In this study, we investigated CD40-CD40L expression in the duodenum of uncomplicated and refractory celiac disease patients, and explored the ex vivo effects of CD40L blockade on cytokine production and the T-helper cell type 1-specific transcription factor T-bet. METHODS: CD40L and colocalization of CD40 with the dendritic cell markers CD11c and CD123 were investigated by confocal microscopy on tissue sections of duodenal biopsy samples obtained from 14 uncomplicated celiac patients before and after 12 months of gluten-free diet, 5 refractory celiac patients, and 12 controls. CD40 was also analyzed by flow cytometry on single cell suspension of mucosal biopsies. Treated celiac biopsies were stimulated with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin (PT-gliadin) with or without an anti-CD40L-neutralizing antibody. Interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-17 were measured by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). T-bet, CD40, and CD40L were determined by immunoblotting. RESULTS: CD40 and CD40L expression was higher in uncomplicated untreated and refractory celiac patients than in controls; the expression returned to normal after gluten-free diet in uncomplicated patients. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that most CD40(+) cells were dendritic cells. The addition of the anti-CD40L antibody to treated celiac biopsies significantly inhibited the PT-gliadin-induced production of IFN-gamma and IL-17, and mucosal T-bet. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the CD40-CD40L pathway has a key role in celiac disease. Disruption of CD40-CD40L interaction may offer a therapeutic alternative in refractory celiac disease.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Several studies have demonstrated a higher prevalence of celiac disease (CD) among females with Turner syndrome when compared to the general population. Nevertheless, there is no record in literature concerning this investigation among Brazilian patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of CD among a group of Brazilian patients with Turner syndrome. METHODS: Fifty-six females with Turner syndrome and on gluten-containing diet were screened for CD utilizing immunoglobulin A antiendomysium (IgA-EMA) and immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase (IgA-tTG) antibody assays. Additionally, they were genotyped for CD human leukocyte antigen (CD-HLA) predisposing alleles. Patients showing positivity in serological testing were offered to perform small intestine biopsy for histological confirmation. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis of Turner syndrome was 5.5 +/- 4.4 years; mean age at screening for CD was 17.0 +/- 9.3 years (from 10 months of age to 52 years). Two girls were positive for IgA-EMA and IgA-tTG, presented predisposing HLA-DQ2 alleles and both had the diagnosis of CD confirmed by jejunal biopsy. CONCLUSION: The 3.6% prevalence of biopsy-proven CD among this group of females with Turner syndrome is 10 times higher than the one among females from the general population of the same geographical area. This result provides additional support to an association between these two disorders and restates that girls and women with Turner syndrome represent a high risk population for developing CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Childhood susceptibility to diseases linked with immune dysfunction affects over a quarter of the pediatric population in some countries. While this alone is a significant health issue, the actual impact of immune-related diseases extends over a lifetime and involves additional secondary conditions. Some comorbidities are well known (e.g., allergic rhinitis and asthma). However, no systematic approach has been used to identify life-long patterns of immune-based disease where the primary condition arises in childhood. Such information is useful for both disease prevention and treatment approaches. DATA SOURCES: Recent primary research papers as well as review articles were obtained from PubMed, Chem Abstracts, Biosis and from the personal files of the authors. Search words used were: the diseases and conditions shown Figs. 1 and 2 in conjunction with comorbid, comorbidities, pediatric, childhood, adult, immune, immune dysfunction, allergy, autoimmune, inflammatory, infectious, health risks, environment, risk factors. RESULTS: Childhood diseases such as asthma, type-1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, respiratory infections /rhinitis, recurrent otitis media, pediatric celiac, juvenile arthritis and Kawasaki disease are examples of significant childhood health problems where immune dysfunction plays a significant role. Each of these pediatric diseases is associated with increased risk of several secondary conditions, many of which appear only later in life. To illustrate, four prototypes of immune-related disease patterns (i.e., allergy, autoimmunity, inflammation and infectious disease) are shown as tools for: 1) enhanced disease prevention; 2) improved management of immune-based pediatric diseases; and 3) better recognition of underlying pediatric immune dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of immune-related disease patterns beginning in childhood provides the framework for examining the underlying immune dysfunctions that can contribute to additional diseases in later life. Many pediatric diseases associated with dysfunctional immune responses have been linked with an elevated risk of other diseases or conditions as the child ages. Diseases within a pattern may be interlinked based on underlying immune dysfunctions and/or current therapeutic approaches for managing the entryway diseases. It may be beneficial to consider treatment options for the earliest presenting diseases that will concomitantly reduce the risk of immune-linked secondary conditions. Additionally, improved disease prevention is possible with more relevant and age-specific immune safety testing.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The detection of auto antibodies directed against tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG antibodies) has a well-established role in the diagnosis of coeliac disease, but the value of these antibodies in long-term follow-up is controversial. AIMS: To determine if serial anti-tTG antibody measurements could confirm adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and identify patients at risk of disease complications. METHODS: In a 54-month cohort follow-up study, 182 adult patients were assessed. Data recorded included self-assessment of GFD adherence; anti-tTG antibody concentration and serum ferritin, vitamin B12 and folate. Where available, bone mineral density (BMD) and duodenal histology data were retrieved. RESULTS: Persistently elevated anti-tTG antibody levels were significantly associated with abnormal duodenal histology (P < 0.001), low ferritin (P < 0.01) and poor adherence to the GFD (P < 0.001). The specificity was >85% while the sensitivity was 39-60%. Anti-tTG antibody concentrations fell rapidly following successful initiation of a GFD, and maintenance of normalization identified those who continued to be adherent to the diet. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports a strategy of using anti-tTG antibody concentrations to monitor newly diagnosed and established patients with coeliac disease, and to target dietetic intervention to reduce the risk of complication.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between celiac disease (CD) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is well known. Up to now, CD prevalence in children and adolescents with T1DM in Serbia has not been reported. The aim of the present study was to determine CD prevalence and its clinical manifestations in patients with T1DM. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-one patients (70 girls, 51 boys; mean age, 10.8 years) with T1DM (mean duration of diabetes, 3.4 years) and 125 control group participants (75 girls, 50 boys; mean age, 10.4 years) were tested for CD on tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG). In seven serologically positive T1DM patients endoscopic small bowel biopsies were taken and examined on histopathology. In all patients with CD and T1DM age, duration of T1DM, height for age, body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin and clinical symptoms were noted. RESULTS: Nine patients with T1DM were positive on IgA tTG antibodies. In seven of them small bowel biopsy was performed, and all were proven to have CD on histopathology. The prevalence of biopsy-proven CD in children and adolescents with T1DM was significantly higher in the study group compared to controls (5.79%. vs 0.8%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The significantly higher prevalence of CD in children with type 1 diabetes, in accordance with the large volume of data published in the literature, underlines the need for yearly screening of CD in patients with diabetes in order to promptly start a gluten-free diet when appropriate.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies on coeliac disease (CD)-related quality of life (QOL) have been limited by their use of a 'generic' rather than coeliac disease-specific assessment instruments. AIM: To develop and psychometrically validate a new coeliac disease-specific instrument, the CD-QOL. METHODS: Through a series of focus groups, we elicited items from patients that related to the specific nature of their disease and its impact on their basic needs. Through expert review, cognitive debriefing with patients and pilot testing, a scale was developed, refined and administered to 387 patients on a gluten-free diet from both community-based support groups and a tertiary care referral centre. Finally, a formal validation study was conducted to assess the psychometric properties of the CD-QOL. RESULTS: The final CD-QOL has 20 items across four clinically relevant subscales (Limitations, Dysphoria, Health Concerns, and Inadequate Treatment). The CD-QOL has high internal consistency, reliability, and psychometric validation indicates both convergent and discriminate validity. CONCLUSIONS: The CD-QOL is a reliable and valid measure of coeliac disease related QOL. As a new disease-specific instrument, it is likely to be a useful tool for evaluating patients with this disorder.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relative effects of clinical and psychosocial variables on outcome in celiac disease (CD) has not previously been reported. In adult patients with (CD), we studied the relationships among demographics, psychosocial factors, and disease activity with health-related quality of life (HRQOL), health care utilization, and symptoms. METHODS: Among 101 adults newly referred to a tertiary care center with biopsy-proven CD we assessed: (a) demographic factors and diet status; (b) disease measures (Marsh score, tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG) level, weight change and additional blood studies); and (c) Psychosocial status (psychological distress, life stress, abuse history, and coping). Multivariate analyses were performed to predict HRQOL, daily function, self-reported health, number of physician visits, and GI symptoms (pain and diarrhea). RESULTS: Impaired HRQOL and daily function was associated with psychological distress and poorer coping. Self-report of poorer health was associated with poorer coping, longer symptom duration, lower education, and greater weight loss. More physician visits were associated with poorer coping, abnormal tTG levels, and milder Marsh classification. Greater pain scores were seen in those with higher psychological distress and greater weight loss. Finally, diarrhea was associated with greater psychological distress and poorer coping. CONCLUSIONS: In patients presenting to a CD referral center, psychosocial factors more strongly affect health status and GI symptoms than disease measures.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a T-cell mediated chronic inflammatory disorder of the gut that is induced by dietary exposure to gluten proteins. CD4+ T cells of the intestinal lesion recognize gluten peptides in the context of HLA-DQ2.5 or HLA-DQ8 and the gluten derived peptides become better T-cell antigens after deamidation catalyzed by the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2). In this study we aimed to identify the preferred peptide substrates of TG2 in a heterogeneous proteolytic digest of whole wheat gluten. METHODS: A method was established to enrich for preferred TG2 substrates in a complex gluten peptide mixture by tagging with 5-biotinamido-pentylamine. Tagged peptides were isolated and then identified by nano-liquid chromatography online-coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, database searching and final manual data validation. RESULTS: We identified 31 different peptides as preferred substrates of TG2. Strikingly, the majority of these peptides were harboring known gluten T-cell epitopes. Five TG2 peptide substrates that were predicted to bind to HLA-DQ2.5 did not contain previously characterized sequences of T-cell epitopes. Two of these peptides elicited T-cell responses when tested for recognition by intestinal T-cell lines of celiac disease patients, and thus they contain novel candidate T-cell epitopes. We also found that the intact 9mer core sequences of the respective epitopes were not present in all peptide substrates. Interestingly, those epitopes that were represented by intact forms were frequently recognized by T cells in celiac disease patients, whereas those that were present in truncated versions were infrequently recognized. CONCLUSION: TG2 as well as gastrointestinal proteolysis play important roles in the selection of gluten T-cell epitopes in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease develops in genetically predisposed individuals as the result of an inappropriate intestinal immune response to dietary gluten proteins. T cells present in the intestine of celiac patients recognize gluten peptides in the context of HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 molecules. Notably, T-cell recognition is increased after these peptides have been deamidated by the enzyme transglutaminase 2. Several T-cell epitopes of gluten exist, and most of these epitopes derive from the alcohol-soluble gliadin fraction. For some of these epitopes, specific T cells can be isolated from intestinal biopsies from nearly all patients, whereas for others, T-cell reactivity could be demonstrated in only a few patients. One reason for this observation could be that the rate of transglutaminase 2 (TG2)-mediated deamidation significantly differs between these peptides, resulting in different amounts of epitopes generated in vivo. In this study, we established a quantitative, mass spectrometry-based approach to measure the kinetics of TG2-mediated deamidation of gliadin-derived, DQ2-restricted epitopes. Our results demonstrate large variations in the degree of deamidation between different peptides and also between individual glutamine residues within each peptide. In general, alpha-gliadin derived epitopes that are frequently recognized by patient T cells showed a significant higher level of deamidation compared to the majority of epitopes from gamma-gliadin that are less frequently recognized. The degree of deamidation of individual residues within a peptide also seems to influence whether some epitopes are better recognized in context of DO2 or DQ8. Thus, the rate of deamidation by TG2 appears to be a factor of importance for the T-cell response to gluten in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {The term oral (or mucosal) tolerance has been classically defined as the suppression of T- and B-cell responses to an antigen by prior administration of the antigen by the oral route. In recent years, it has become clear that both innate and acquired regulatory immune responses are essential for the development of oral tolerance. As such, mucosal microenvironmental factors such as transforming growth factor- beta, prostaglandins but also dietary vitamin A create conditioning of an adaptive regulatory T-cell response that suppresses subsequent antigen-specific responses. Particular resident subsets of antigen presenting dendritic cells are pivotal to convey conditioning signals next to the presentation of antigen. This review discusses the primary mechanisms of adaptive regulatory T-cell induction to ingested soluble protein antigen. However, we also discuss the limitations of our knowledge with respect to understanding the very common food hypersensitivity Celiac disease caused by an aberrant adaptive immune response to the food protein gluten.},

There is little known about what happens to these immunologic and structural abnormalities in patients on a gluten-free diet and their correlation with small-bowel biopsy changes. Adult patients previously diagnosed with celiac disease and on a gluten-free diet for greater than 1 year were considered for the study. All patients underwent the following: measurement of EMA and TTG antibodies, serum zonulin levels, intestinal permeability (IP) testing with lactulose/mannitol ratios, food diary analysis for gluten ingestion and small- bowel biopsy. A total of 21 patients on a gluten-free diet for a mean of 9.7 years completed the study. There were ten patients who had normalization of intestinal biopsies, IP and TTG, and EM antibodies. Six patients had Marsh type 2 or 3 lesions and all had either abnormal IP (5/6) or TTG antibody (4/6). In patients with Marsh type 3 lesions, there was a correlation between IP and zonulin levels. A subgroup of patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet has complete normalization of intestinal biopsies, intestinal permeability defects, and antibody levels. Patients with Marsh type 3 lesions have abnormal TTG antibodies and intestinal permeability with zonulin levels that correlate with IP. These abnormalities may be due to continued gluten ingestion. Further study is needed to determine the clinical utility of TTG antibodies and IP testing in following patients with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {GOALS: To determine whether personality traits and psychological characteristics are related to gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence in an adult population diagnosed with celiac disease (CD). BACKGROUND: Little research has examined psychological correlates of adherence to the GFD. STUDY: One hundred fifty-seven adults with biopsy-confirmed CD on the GFD for >3 months completed measures of personality and self-reported GFD adherence, provided a blood sample, and participated in an evaluation of GFD adherence conducted by an expert dietician at a clinical care center in a major teaching hospital in Boston, MA. RESULTS: An expert evaluation of GFD adherence remained the "gold standard" for measuring GFD adherence when compared with self-report and serology. Logistic regression results indicated that the following were independently associated with GFD adherence: conscientiousness (B=-0.04, SE=0.01, P<0.00), values (B=-0.10, SE=0.05, P<0.05), other food intolerances [odds ratio=0.28, 95% confidence interval=0.10-0.78], and CD symptoms (B=0.05, SE=0.02, P<0.03). A model accounting for these associations effectively predicted whether a participant was adherent or nonadherent on the basis of psychological and demographic/disease-specific factors. Successful prediction rates of GFD adherence for the final model were 75.8% for those rated to be adherent with the GFD and 54.5% for those rated to be nonadherent with the GFD. CONCLUSIONS: The model of psychological and demographic/disease-specific characteristics developed can be used to identify patients who may be at risk for poor dietary adherence to provide additional support, education, and encouragement to individuals with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac sprue is a life-long disease characterized by an intestinal inflammatory response to dietary gluten. A gluten-free diet is an effective treatment for most patients, but accidental ingestion of gluten is common, leading to incomplete recovery or relapse. Food-grade proteases capable of detoxifying moderate quantities of dietary gluten could mitigate this problem. METHODS: We evaluated the gluten detoxification properties of two food-grade enzymes, aspergillopepsin (ASP) from Aspergillus niger and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) from Aspergillus oryzae. The ability of each enzyme to hydrolyze gluten was tested against synthetic gluten peptides, a recombinant gluten protein, and simulated gastric digests of whole gluten and whole-wheat bread. Reaction products were analyzed by mass spectrometry, HPLC, ELISA with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an immunodominant gluten epitope, and a T cell proliferation assay. RESULTS: ASP markedly enhanced gluten digestion relative to pepsin, and cleaved recombinant alpha2-gliadin at multiple sites in a non-specific manner. When used alone, neither ASP nor DPPIV efficiently cleaved synthetic immunotoxic gluten peptides. This lack of specificity for gluten was especially evident in the presence of casein, a competing dietary protein. However, supplementation of ASP with DPPIV enabled detoxification of moderate amounts of gluten in the presence of excess casein and in whole-wheat bread. ASP was also effective at enhancing the gluten-detoxifying efficacy of cysteine endoprotease EP-B2 under simulated gastric conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical studies are warranted to evaluate whether a fixed dose ratio combination of ASP and DPPIV can provide near-term relief for celiac patients suffering from inadvertent gluten exposure. Due to its markedly greater hydrolytic activity against gluten than endogenous pepsin, food-grade ASP may also augment the activity of therapeutically relevant doses of glutenases such as EP-B2 and certain prolyl endopeptidases.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Neurological manifestations of celiac disease are various. An association with ischemic stroke is not common and has not been well documented. We report two cases. OBSERVATIONS: The first patient had experienced several transient ischemic strokes in the past 2 years and then had an acute ischemic stroke involving the territory of the right posterior cerebral artery. Investigations revealed celiac disease with no other recognizable etiology. The clinical course was marked by persistent visual aftereffects, but no new vascular event. The second patient had been followed since 1998 for celiac disease confirmed by pathology and serology tests. She was on a gluten-free diet. The patient had an ischemic stroke involving the territory of the left middle cerebral artery. Apart from a positive serology for celiac disease and iron deficiency anemia, the etiological work-up was negative. DISCUSSION: The mechanisms of vascular involvement in celiac disease are controversial. The most widely incriminated factor is autoimmune central nervous system vasculitis, in which tissue transglutaminase, the main auto-antigen contributing to maintaining the integrity of endothelium tissue, plays a major role. Other mechanisms are still debated, mainly vitamin deficiency. CONCLUSION: Being a potentially treatable cause of ischemic stroke, celiac disease must be considered as a potential etiology of stroke of unknown cause, particularly in young patients, and even without gastrointestinal manifestations.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine characterized by malabsorption after ingestion of gluten in individuals with a certain genetic background. Clinical presentation can vary from full-blown malabsorption to subtle and atypical symptoms. Diagnosis currently relies on clinicopathologic studies including mucosal biopsy, serologic tests, and the effects of a diet free of gluten on the symptoms. Mucosal pathologic features are also variable, ranging from mild abnormalities, including intraepithelial lymphocytosis, to completely flat mucosa. Since patients with minimal histologic lesion of intraepithelial lymphocytosis often present with normal serologic findings, biopsy diagnosis becomes more important for identifying such individuals. Classification of mucosal pathology in gluten-sensitive enteropathy has been a subject of controversy among pathologists and needs to be revised according to the current understanding of the disease. OBJECTIVES: To highlight the variations in clinical and pathologic presentation of gluten-sensitive enteropathy, to emphasize the importance of small-intestinal biopsy evaluation in the diagnosis, and to propose a new classification of mucosal pathology in gluten-sensitive enteropathy, in an effort to overcome the problems related to the classification systems currently available. DATA SOURCES: A review of the literature on clinicopathologic features and the morphologic spectrum of gluten-sensitive enteropathy is presented. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that there are many entities in the differential diagnosis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy, because of the varied clinicopathologic spectrum of the disease, diagnosis depends on good clinicopathologic communication. The classification that is presented in this review is a simple and practical approach to improve clinicopathologic correlation in gluten-sensitive enteropathy.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To identify risk as well as protective factors related to compliance with the gluten-free diet in a cohort of teenagers with celiac disease (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred four patients with CD (European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition criteria) older than or equal to 13 years and residents of Campania (southern Italy) were enrolled in the study. Patients underwent clinical examination and blood sampling, and were interviewed about school performance, social relationships, family integration, smoking habit, and compliance with a gluten-free diet. Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were assayed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: One hundred fifty of 204 (73.5%) reported no dietary transgressions, and 54 of 204 (26.5%) reported occasional or frequent transgressions. During the previous month 29 of 54 (53.7%) poor compliers ate from 0.001 to 1 g of gluten per day, 14 (25.9%) from 1 to 5 g, and 11 (20.4%) more than 5 g. The daily intake of gluten was significantly related to anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (chi2 = 38.872, P = 0.000). Height was below the third percentile in 19 of 204 (9.3%), and weight was above the 97th percentile in 20 of 204 (9.8%). Diet compliance did not seem to influence the weight and height. One hundred eleven of 150 good compliers (74%) and 31 of 54 (57.4%) poor compliers were asymptomatic. Most patients reported good family relationships (88.7%), social relationships (91.2%), and school integration (88.2%). Alternatively, 54% of patients reported some limitation in their social life. Compliance was good in patients who reported excellent school integration (83%) and social relationships (81%). CONCLUSION: Optimal school integration significantly contributes to the likelihood of good compliance. A better understanding within the school environment about CD-related issues could improve motivation to adhere to a gluten-free diet.},

BACKGROUND: As FC is regarded as a marker of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, we hypothesized that it might be increased in untreated CD. STUDY: The study included 29 newly diagnosed patients with CD (mean age: 6.6+/-0.6 y) and sex and age-matched 10 healthy children. All of the children with CD admitted to the hospital were classical form who has chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive. The degree of mucosal damage was graded according to the modified Marsh criteria. FC concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method on admission and after 1 year of GFD. RESULTS: Mean FC concentration of children with CD on admission and of healthy children were 13.40+/-8.5 and 4.3+/-3.3 mg/L, respectively (P=0.004). FC concentration under GFD was 4.6+/-2.7 mg/L and there was a significant statistical difference between untreated patients and those under GFD for 1 year (P=0.001). There was no statistical difference between FC concentration of those under GFD and healthy children (P=0.8). Mean FC concentrations of children with total-villous atrophy and partial-villous atrophy were significantly different (13.8+/-9.3 mg/L vs. 3.7+/-1.8 mg/L, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: It was found that FC concentration is increased in childhood CD, related to the severity of histopathologic findings and responsive to GFD. The pathogenetic mechanism by which FC is increased in CD should be investigated in further studies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is a relationship between nonresponsiveness to hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine and certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes. In healthy population, 4-10% vaccine recipients fail to produce protective levels of antibodies to the HBV vaccine after standard immunization depending upon age and the presence of various underlying diseases. Celiac disease (CD) is an HLA-associated immunological disease. It has been suggested that certain HLA haplotypes which are linked to CD are associated with nonresponse to HBV vaccine as well. The aim of this study is to assess the response to HBV vaccine prospectively in a group of CD and to explore the potential link between CD and HBV vaccine nonresponse by studying shared HLA haplotypes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-three previously diagnosed celiac patients who were on a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) and 54 healthy children were evaluated serologically for anti-HBs status. Celiac children who were anti-HBs negative at baseline were fully vaccinated prospectively, and reevaluated for the response to HBV vaccine. To estimate the role of HLA type in HBV vaccine response in celiac patients, a subgroup of both patients and control participants had HLA genotypes performed. RESULTS: At enrollment, 27 (67.5%) children with CD and 48 (85.2%) healthy children were anti-HBs positive, and the difference between patients and controls was statistically significant (P<0.05). However, failure to respond to HBV vaccine was only 3.6% (response rate 96.4%) in prospectively vaccinated celiac patients. There was no relationship between HLA type and vaccine nonresponse in our study group. CONCLUSION: The response to HBV vaccine in celiac children who were compliant to GFD is not different from a healthy population. CD may be one of the immune diseases associated with a high rate of HBV vaccine nonresponse but it might not be permanent and treatment with GFD and compliance to the treatment may ameliorate the immune response to HBV vaccine in celiac children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. We previously reported that in 30% (20/66) of adult celiac patients with current or persistent diarrhea the underlying cause was exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Of these 20 patients, 19 initially improved on pancreatic supplementation. To date, there are no published longitudinal studies. METHODS: The 20 patients who had initially received therapy for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency were prospectively followed-up for 4 years. Gastrointestinal symptoms, dietary adherence, celiac antibody status, and dose of enzyme supplementation were recorded. Fecal elastase-1 (Fel-1) was repeated to reassess exocrine pancreatic function. RESULTS: In the study, 19/20 patients were reviewed, as one had died (mean age 59.7 years, 7 males). The mean duration of celiac disease was 13.2 years. Eleven out of nineteen were still taking enzyme supplementation at a mean dose of 45,000 units of lipase per day. Only 1/11 reported no symptomatic benefit and 8/19 patients had discontinued supplementation because their diarrhea had improved. In the whole group there was a significant increase in Fel-1 levels over time, with median values of 90 mug/g at 0 months, 212 mug/g at 6 months, and 365 mug/g at follow-up (45-66 months)(p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Fecal elastase-1 is useful in identifying exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in adult celiac patients with diarrhea. Our longitudinal data suggests that pancreatic enzyme supplementation could be discontinued in a substantial proportion of patients as symptoms improve.},

   abstract = {Recent population studies show that coeliac disease affects around 1 in 100 people. The estimated ratio of diagnosed to undiagnosed individuals is 1:8, and the average delay in diagnosis is reported to be 11 years. The contemporary coeliac patient is diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 60, has normal or even high BMI, and subtle symptoms. Patients are often identified in screening groups which would include those with type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, or a first-degree relative with coeliac disease. The presence of relevant symptoms is not essential for a diagnosis of coeliac disease. Additionally, positive serological testing alone is not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. Endomysial antibody (EMA) and tissue transglutaminase (TTG) have a combined sensitivity and specificity of > 90% when used in combination in selected populations. However, false positives occur in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune disease. Conversely antibody-negative disease accounts for around 9% of cases. IgA deficiency is a cause of false negatives and levels should be checked at the same time as EMA and TTG. Patients must consume a gluten-containing diet for six weeks before serological testing and biopsy if necessary. All those with positive serological tests, and those for whom clinical suspicion is high even if seronegative, should be referred to a gastroenterologist for a duodenal biopsy to confirm or exclude coeliac disease. Diagnosis requires the demonstration of villous atrophy in the small bowel which improves when gluten is withdrawn.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate GH/IGF-I axis and other pituitary functions in adult patients with coeliac disease. For this purpose, twenty-eight adult coeliac patients [20M, 8F:19-74 years; body mass index (BMI): 18.5-28 kg/m (2)] were recruited. Basal thyroid, adrenal and gonadal function, serum IGF-I and PRL, and routine parameters were evaluated. Dynamic GH secretion was carried out by GHRH plus arginine test. In 20 patients, antipituitary antibodies (APA) were also evaluated. Seven out of 28 patients, independently from disease onset and the gluten-free diet (GFD), showed an impaired GH secretion (25%). All were males, 2 with severe growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and 5 with partial GHD. In patients with GHD, as compared to coeliac patients with normal GH secretion, HOMA (2.1+/-1.2 vs. 0.9+/-0.4) and QUICKI (0.35+/-0.03 vs. 0.39+/-0.02) levels were significantly higher and lower, respectively, while IGF-I levels were slightly lower (17.7+/-3.7 vs. 24.7+/-6.3, p=NS). APA were negative in all 20 patients studied. In conclusion, a significant number of adult coeliac patients show an impaired GH secretion, this alteration being predominant in males and independent from disease onset and diet regimen. Given the absence of APAs, the cause of this pituitary dysfunction remains unclear even if a previous autoimmune involvement in some cases cannot be excluded.},

The aim was to measure positive anti-transglutaminase antibody levels in children with infectious diseases and to compare immunological and biological characteristics of the anti-transglutaminase antibodies derived from these children with that from coeliac patients. Two hundred and twenty-two children suffering from infectious diseases were enrolled prospectively along with seven biopsy-proven coeliacs. Serum samples were tested for anti-transglutaminase antibodies and anti-endomysium antibodies; positive samples were tested for coeliac-related human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/8 and anti-viral antibodies. Purified anti-transglutaminase antibodies from the two study groups were tested for urea-dependent avidity, and their ability to induce cytoskeletal rearrangement and to modulate cell-cycle in Caco-2 cells, using phalloidin staining and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays, respectively. Nine of 222 children (4%) tested positive to anti-transglutaminase, one of whom also tested positive for anti-endomysium antibodies. This patient was positive for HLA-DQ2 and was diagnosed as coeliac following intestinal biopsy. Of the eight remaining children, two were positive for HLA-DQ8. Levels of anti-transglutaminase returned to normal in all subjects, despite a gluten-containing diet. Purified anti-transglutaminase of the two study groups induced actin rearrangements and cell-cycle progression. During an infectious disease, anti-transglutaminase antibodies can be produced temporarily and independently of gluten. The infection-triggered anti-transglutaminase antibodies have the same biological properties as that of the coeliacs, with the same in-vivo potential for damage.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study enrolled 100 subjects, including 50 children with CD on a gluten-free diet and a control group of 50 healthy children. Statistical analysis to compare groups was performed using one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: A significant increase in fat consumption was observed in children with CD as compared to healthy children. The daily fat intake was 72.5 +/- 37.2 g per 100 g of food in the CD group and 52.9 +/- 35.4 g per 100 g of food in the control group (p < 0.008). A significant difference in fat intake was found between celiac and healthy females (10.21 +/- 3.15 g/100 g in the celiac group vs 7.46 +/- 2.91 g/100 g in the control group), p = 0.004. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a significantly higher fat consumption in patients with CD on GFD as compared to controls. This increase was more pronounced in females and during the puberal age. Based on these interesting preliminary results we estimate that further investigations are necessary, such as a randomized multicentre study on the long-term effects of GFD with particular attention to the imbalance in daily fat intake.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease, which covers Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease are both inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract. In both diseases an antigen activates several inflammatory pathways, which cause extensive damage to the intestinal mucosa and lead to increased permeability of the intestinal epithelium. The causative antigen in inflammatory bowel disease is the microflora in the intestinal lumen, facilitated by an impaired innate immune system that is unable to halt the invasion of microbes into the lamina propria. These provoke T helper 1 and T helper 17 responses in Crohn's disease and a T helper 2 response in ulcerative colitis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and interleukins produced in these processes lead to impairment of tight junctions and increased permeability of the intestinal epithelial lining. In celiac disease, inflammation is caused by dietary gluten, a peptide present in wheat, barley and rye. In genetically predisposed people, gliadin peptides (derivatives of gluten) are presented on the Human Leukocyte Antigen DQ2 or DQ-8 molecules of antigen-presenting cells to T helper cells. This provokes a T helper 1 response, which leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequent damage to, and increased permeability of the intestinal epithelium. We describe the details and overlaps in the pathomechanism and genetics of inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease, and discuss potential drug targets for intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The co-morbidity of cystic fibrosis (CF) and celiac disease (CD) has been reported sporadically since the 1960s. To our knowledge, this is the first time a systematic screening is performed in a large cohort of CF patients. METHODS: Transglutaminase-IgA (TGA), endomysium-IgA (EMA) and total IgA in serum were measured in 790 CF patients (48% females, 86% with pancreatic insufficiency). Six patients were diagnosed with CD prior to the study, all receiving a gluten-free diet. Patients with elevated TGA (>50 Units/mL) and a positive EMA test were offered a gastroscopy obtaining mucosal biopsies from the duodenum. RESULTS: Four new cases of CD were diagnosed. Two additional patients had positive serological tests, but normal biopsies. In total, 10 cases of CD (1.2%, 1:83) indicate a prevalence rate about three times higher than the general prevalence of CD in Norway and Sweden. No CD patients were detected in the Danish CF cohort. Patients diagnosed with untreated CD reported symptoms typical of both CF and CD (poor weight gain, loose and/or fatty stools, fatigue, irritability, abdominal pain). They improved after introduction of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic screening for CD in a Scandinavian cohort of CF patients revealed a higher prevalence of CD than in the general population. Clinical signs of CD are difficult to differentiate from CF with malabsorption, and patients may go undiagnosed for a long time. In a population where CD is common we recommend screening for CD in patients with CF.},

   abstract = {Adult celiac disease is a chronic intestinal disorder that has been estimated to affect up to 1-2% of the population in some nations. Awareness of the disease has increased, but still it remains markedly underdiagnosed. Celiac disease is a pathologically defined condition with several characteristic clinical scenarios that should lead the clinician to suspect its presence. Critical to diagnosis is a documented responsiveness to a gluten-free diet. After diagnosis and treatment, symptoms and biopsy-proven changes may recur and appear refractory to a gluten-free diet. Recurrent symptoms are most often due to poor diet compliance, a ubiquitous and unrecognized gluten source, an initially incorrect diagnosis, or an associated disease or complication of celiac disease. Some patients with persistent symptoms and biopsy-proven changes may not have celiac disease at all, instead suffering from a sprue-like intestinal disease, so-called unclassified sprue, which is a specific entity that does not appear to respond to a gluten-free diet. Some of these patients eventually prove to have an underlying malignant cause, particularly lymphoma. The risk of developing lymphoma and other malignancies is increased in celiac disease, especially if initially diagnosed in the elderly, or late in the clinical course of the disease. However, recent studies suggest that the risk of gastric and colon cancer is low. This has led to the hypothesis that untreated celiac disease may be protective, possibly due to impaired absorption and more rapid excretion of fat or fat-soluble agents, including hydrocarbons and other putative cocarcinogens, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.},

This small intestinal mucosal disorder is gluten-dependent and causes nutrient malabsorption, often with diarrhea and weight loss. Diagnosis depends on detection of typical biopsy changes in the proximal small bowel along with an unequivocal response to a gluten-free diet. Recurrent changes usually result from poor adherence to the gluten-free diet, sometimes intentional, or from consumption of unsuspected gluten sources. In others, the original diagnosis may not be correct (e.g., duodenal involvement with Crohn's disease) or another cause for symptoms may have supervened (e.g., collagenous colitis, functional bowel disease). Rarely, a complication may occur (e.g., collagenous sprue, lymphoma). In some, the gluten-dependent nature of the small bowel disorder was not initially documented and biopsy changes continued despite a gluten-free diet. These have a sprue-like intestinal disorder, also labeled unclassified sprue. This represents a small, but likely, heterogeneous group, and in these, intractable symptoms may be present and, in some, lymphoma is eventually diagnosed.},

Pathologically, a severe to variably severe "flattened" mucosal biopsy lesion with distinctive sub-epithelial deposits in the lamina propria region is detected. Histochemical stains and ultrastructural studies have confirmed that these deposits contain collagens. Often, an initial diagnosis of celiac disease is considered but no continued response to treatment with a gluten-free diet occurs. Recent reports indicate an intimate relationship between collagenous sprue and celiac disease, sometimes with concomitant T-cell enteropathy. In addition, permanent disappearance of these deposits after resection of a localized colon cancer suggested that this disorder could actually represent a paraneoplastic morphologic marker of an occult malignancy. Studies showing either gastric or colonic involvement (or both) with this unusual collagenous inflammatory mucosal process may also reflect a far more extensive and heterogeneous process than previously appreciated.},

A 40-year-old competitive strongman with celiac disease responded to a gluten-free diet, but developed profound and generalized motor weakness with acetylcholine receptor antibody positive myasthenia gravis, a disorder reported to occur in about 1 in 5000. This possible relationship between myasthenia gravis and celiac disease was further explored in serological studies. Frozen stored serum samples from 23 acetylcholine receptor antibody positive myasthenia gravis patients with no intestinal symptoms were used to screen for celiac disease. Both endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies were examined. One of 23 (or, about 4.3%) was positive for both IgA-endomysial and IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Endoscopic studies subsequently showed duodenal mucosal scalloping and biopsies confirmed the histopathological changes of celiac disease. Celiac disease and myasthenia gravis may occur together more often than is currently appreciated. The presence of motor weakness in celiac disease may be a clue to occult myasthenia gravis, even in the absence of intestinal symptoms.},

His clinical course was refractory to a strict gluten-free diet and steroid therapy. Postmortem studies led to definition of unrecognized collagenous sprue that caused ulceration and small intestinal perforation. Although PCR showed identical monoclonal T-cell populations in antemortem duodenal biopsies and postmortem jejunum, careful pathological evaluation demonstrated no frank lymphoma. Rarely, overt or even cryptic T-cell lymphoma may complicate collagenous sprue, however, small intestinal ulcers and perforation may also develop independently. The dramatic findings here may reflect an underlying or early molecular event in the eventual clinical appearance of overt T-cell lymphoma.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coeliac disease is a common small intestinal inflammatory disorder that results from a breach of intestinal tolerance to dietary gluten proteins, driven by gluten-reactive effector T cells. We aimed to assess the pathogenic role of gluten-reactive T cells and to generate a model of gluten-induced enteropathy. METHODS: CD4+CD25- T cell fractions were adoptively transferred into lymphopenic mice, leading to "baseline" small intestinal inflammation. RESULTS: Rag1-/- recipients of gliadin-presensitised CD4+CD45RBlowCD25- T cells, but not CD4+CD45RBhigh naive T cells, gained less weight and suffered from more severe duodenitis when challenged with oral gluten than recipients on gluten-free diet, or recipients of control (ovalbumin)-presensitised T cells. This was accompanied by deterioration of mucosal histological features characteristic of coeliac disease, and increased Th1/Th17 cell polarisation in the duodenum and the periphery. Interestingly, reintroduction of a gluten-free diet led to weight gain, improvement of histological duodenitis, and a decrease in duodenal interferon gamma and interleukin 17 transcripts. Moreover, B cell-competent nude recipients of gliadin-presensitised CD4+CD45RBlowCD25- T cells produced high levels of serum anti-gliadin immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG1/IgG2c only when challenged with oral gluten. CONCLUSIONS: CD4+ T cell immunity to gluten leads to a breach of oral gluten tolerance and small intestinal pathology in lymphopenic mice, similar to human coeliac disease. This model will be useful for the study of coeliac disease pathogenesis, and also for testing novel non-dietary therapies for coeliac disease.},

Celiac disease (CD), a food gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is considered a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease and is generally associated with an overall increased risk of cancer in CD patients. We observed a higher percentage of circulating CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells and an increased Foxp3 expression in CD4+CD25+ T cells from untreated than from treated CD patients. In co-culture, CD4+CD25+ T cells from both treated and untreated CD patients significantly suppressed the proliferation of autologous CD4+CD25(-) T cells similarly to values in healthy subjects. Our study suggests that Treg proportion and Foxp3 expression in circulating CD4+CD25+ T cells could justify the increased global risk of malignancy in CD population and support the efficacy of lifelong gluten-free diet in the reduction of the cancer risk.},

Using transcription factor analysis, we investigated whether T-bet and pSTAT1 expressions are up-regulated in the peripheral blood of CD patients and correlate with disease activity. Using flow cytometry, we analysed T-bet, pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 expression in CD4(+), CD8(+) T cells, CD19(+) B cells and monocytes from peripheral blood of 15 untreated and 15 treated CD patients and 30 controls, and longitudinally in five coeliac patients before and after dietary treatment. We evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), interferon (FN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-10 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures. T-bet expression in CD4(+), CD8(+) T cells, CD19(+) B cells and monocytes and IFN-gamma production by PBMC was higher in untreated than in treated CD patients and controls. pSTAT1 expression was higher in CD4(+)T cells, B cells and monocytes from untreated than from treated CD patients and controls. pSTAT3 was increased only in monocytes from untreated patients compared with CD-treated patients and controls. The data obtained from the longitudinal evaluation of transcription factors confirmed these results. Flow cytometric analysis of pSTAT1 and T-bet protein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells could be useful and sensible markers in the follow-up of CD patients to evaluate disease activity and response to dietary treatment.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disorder characterized by intestinal inflammation and mucosal atrophy triggered by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Although, most patients improve with a gluten-free diet, a small percentage (2-5%) develops refractoriness or pre- and malignant complications. Malignancies are the most serious complications of CD, including gastrointestinal carcinomas and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly Enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma, a rare high-grade T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the small intestine, almost exclusively observed in CD patients. The molecular basis behind cancer development in CD is not known. To really understand CD-cancer biology it is important to known all of its genetic and genomic alterations. Carcinogenesis involves the acquisition of multiple genetic changes that create a background of genetic instability which accelerate the accumulation of subsequent mutations. Two major modes of genome destabilization have been recognized: microsatellite instability and chromosome instability (CIN). A review of genetic abnormalities reported in CD, refractory sprue or CD-associated tumors, suggests that a CIN phenotype is implied in malignant transformation in CD. Moreover, our recent findings showing that a group of untreated CD patients exhibits genomic instability at nucleotide level, affecting specific microsatellite loci, provides evidence of molecular alterations in non-malignant CD cells. In conclusion, most genetic studies, point to the role of chronic inflammation in the induction of genomic instability and malignant emergence in at-risk individuals.},

Recently gluten entheropathy was considered as a rare clinical problem in adults. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that can coexist with other diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 1 (DMID), thyroid gland diseases. The aim of our study was evaluation of the frequency of coexistence of celiac disease with DMID using the level of anti tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA- tTG) and mucosal biopsy from the distal part of the duodenum. An attempt was made to estimate the influence of celiac disease on the intensity of clinical symptoms and metabolic balance in patients with DMID. Our study included 109 patients with DMID, aged 18-52 years. The frequency of the incidence of celiac disease in DMID patients was 9.71%. Gastric symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain were more frequent in patients with villous atrophy in the intestine. Hyperglycemia and problems with glucose balance in the serum were observed. Introduction of the gluten free diet led to improvement quality of life, less frequent hypoglycemic episodes and disappearance of diarrhea, increase of serum iron and decrease of IgA-tTG level in the serum. It is necessary to measure the level of IgA- tTG in patients with DMID. Diagnosis of celiac disease in patients with DMID and its treatment with gluten free diet causes the clinical, histological and biochemical improvement in these patients.},

Because the disease may be under diagnosed in Cuba, we studied the presence of the disease in a group of apparently healthy adult. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: It was to assess for the first time, the presence of silent CD in a cohort of healthy Cuban adults individuals and to evaluate the tools for diagnosis of CD in this group. METHODS: A total of 200 healthy Cuban adult from Havana City were evaluated. Tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) were determined by one-step immunochromatographic assay and by commercial ELISA kit. CD specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification, using sequence-specific primers. In the subject positive for tTGA, the CD was confirmed by intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: From the 200 studied individuals, only one subject was identified as positive by both assays, being submitted to duodenal biopsy. Morphological changes consistent with CD were found and also supported by HLA-DQ2 (HLA-DQA1*0501-DQB1*02). In the follow-up after one year, histological recovery was assessed by a second intestinal biopsy and the serological marker became negative. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the existence of silent CD among healthy adult in Cuba and highlights the importance of mass screening for this disease among them. The one-step immunochromatographic assay is a good tool for this purpose.},

Some of the reported response to celiac diets in children with autism may be related to amelioration of nutritional deficiency resulting from undiagnosed gluten sensitivity and consequent malabsorption. A case is presented of a 5-year-old boy diagnosed with severe autism at a specialty clinic for autistic spectrum disorders. After initial investigation suggested underlying celiac disease and varied nutrient deficiencies, a gluten-free diet was instituted along with dietary and supplemental measures to secure nutritional sufficiency. The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms rapidly resolved, and signs and symptoms suggestive of autism progressively abated. This case is an example of a common malabsorption syndrome associated with central nervous system dysfunction and suggests that in some contexts, nutritional deficiency may be a determinant of developmental delay. It is recommended that all children with neurodevelopmental problems be assessed for nutritional deficiency and malabsorption syndromes.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent gastrointestinal disorder characterized by the intolerance to a group of proteins called gluten present in wheat, rye, barley, and possibly oats. The only therapy is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. The standard method for gluten determination in foods produced for CD patients is the R5-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as proposed by the recent Codex Alimentarius Draft Revised Standard. This test is based on the determination of prolamins, the alcohol-soluble proteins of gluten, and is available as a sandwich ELISA for intact proteins and as a competitive ELISA for gluten-derived peptides. While the suitability of the sandwich ELISA including a wheat prolamin (gliadin) reference for calibration has been shown by various studies and a ring test, the competitive ELISA still lacks a convenient reference for the quantitation of gluten peptides in fermented cereal foods (e.g., sourdough products, starch syrup, malt extracts, beer). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to prepare a suitable reference for the quantitation of partially hydrolyzed gluten in fermented wheat, rye, and barley products. The prolamin fractions from barley (hordein) and rye (secalin) were isolated from corresponding flours by means of a modified preparative Osborne fractionation. The prolamin fraction from wheat was obtained as reference gliadin from the Prolamin Working Group. The prolamin fractions were successively digested by pepsin and trypsin or pepsin and chymotrypsin procedures, which have been used for CD-specific toxicity tests on cereal storage proteins for many years. The protein/peptide content (N x 5.7) of the prolamin fractions and digests, which was the basis for the calculation of the gluten content by means of ELISA, varied between 67.1% and 96.0%. The prolamin fractions and enzymatic digests were then tested for their response in both sandwich and competitive assays. Intact prolamins responded similarly in both ELISA showing no important differences between the cereals. In the case of digested proteins, however, the sandwich ELISA was considerably less sensitive than the competitive ELISA. The former provided approximately 40% and the latter 70% of the signal intensity obtained with the intact prolamins. Thus, the combination of the competitive ELISA and the enzymatic digests of prolamin fractions as reference was considered to be an adequate system for the analysis of partially hydrolyzed gluten. The limit of detection using a peptic-tryptic hordein digest as reference was 2.3 microg prolamin equivalent per milliliter, and the limit of quantitation was 6.7 microg prolamin equivalent per milliliter. This system was applied for the determination of gluten equivalents in five commercial beverages based on fermented cereals.},

MATERIAL AND METHOD: 15 children under gluten-free diet were selected and, because of the recurrence of the dyspeptic syndrome, an upper digestive endoscopy associated with histopathologic exam was performed. Considering the histopathologic result we made two groups: first group (8 children with celiac disease and Helicobacter pylori infection) and second group (7 children with celiac disease without Helicobacter pylori infection, but associated with gastritis lesions). RESULTS: The main symptom was diffuse abdominal pain in both groups. The endoscopic antrum aspects were congestive with striped aspect (first group--12.5%, second group--42.9%) and congestive with nodulation (first group--25%, second group--14.3%). The histopathologic diagnosis were: moderate active chronic pangastritis (first group--25%, second group--14.3%) moderate active chronic gastritis (first group--25%,second group--14.3%), lymphocytic gastritis (first group--12.5%, second group--14.3%). CONCLUSION: The histopathologic exam remains the gold standard for celiac disease, gastritis lesions and Helicobacter pylori infection.},

Australian (and New Zealand) clinicians and scientists have made considerable contributions to our current understanding of these diseases over the last 50 years, including pathogenesis (such as the 'butyrate hypothesis', 'endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress', and the identification of the peptide sequences that incite celiac disease), true population epidemiology (albeit in New Zealand), precise clinical observation, new investigative tools, innovative new potential therapies, influential clinical drug trials (such as triple antibiotics for Crohn's disease), and a dietary approach with efficacy for functional gut symptoms (the low FODMAP diet). Underpinning the success has been clinical excellence and adaptation of clinicians to the changing landscape of disease severity and therapeutic options. The future is indeed bright if such trends continue.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten proteins from wheat and similar proteins from barley and rye. The inflammatory reaction is controlled by T cells that recognize gluten peptides in the context of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules. The only available treatment for the disease is a lifelong gluten-exclusion diet. We have used RNAi to down-regulate the expression of gliadins in bread wheat. A set of hairpin constructs were designed and expressed in the endosperm of bread wheat. The expression of gliadins was strongly down-regulated in the transgenic lines. Total gluten protein was extracted from transgenic lines and tested for ability to stimulate four different T-cell clones derived from the intestinal lesion of CD patients and specific for the DQ2-alpha-II, DQ2-gamma-VII, DQ8-alpha-I, and DQ8-gamma-I epitopes. For five of the transgenic lines, there was a 1.5-2 log reduction in the amount of the DQ2-alpha-II and DQ2-gamma-VII epitopes and at least 1 log reduction in the amount of the DQ8-alpha-I and DQ8-gamma-I epitopes. Furthermore, transgenic lines were also tested with two T-cell lines that are reactive with omega-gliadin epitopes. The total gluten extracts were unable to elicit T-cell responses for three of the transgenic wheat lines, and there were reduced responses for six of the transgenic lines. This work shows that the down-regulation of gliadins by RNAi can be used to obtain wheat lines with very low levels of toxicity for CD patients.},

Should this correlation be proven, any dentistry's screening would then be important to diagnose early celiac sprue pathogenesis. A literature survey was accomplished by using the Medline database (Entrez PubMed). The survey, which covered the period from the year 1972 to 2009, provided 382 published articles. Of these, 29 articles were selected according to inclusionary/exclusionary criteria, and consequently qualified for the final review analysis. Manual searching through the reference lists of the selected articles allowed the obtainment of others 17 articles. Findings gathered through this literature's review corroborate the significance of a causal relationship between some oral signs and CD. There are enough evidence making the correlation between CD and oral defects scientifically sustainable. This recognition should lead dentists to play more significant roles in screening for CD, as otherwise, if not properly diagnosed and not treated with a gluten-free diet, may eventually cause some malignancies.},

   abstract = {Protein deficiency is one of the biggest public health problems in the world, accounting for about 30-40% of hospital admissions in developing countries. Nutritional deficiencies lead to alterations in the peripheral nervous system and in the digestive system. Most studies have focused on the effects of protein-deficient diets on the enteric neurons, but not on sympathetic ganglia, which supply extrinsic sympathetic input to the digestive system. Hence, in this study, we investigated whether a protein-restricted diet would affect the quantitative structure of rat coeliac ganglion neurons. Five male Wistar rats (undernourished group) were given a pre- and postnatal hypoproteinic diet receiving 5% casein, whereas the nourished group (n = 5) was fed with 20% casein (normoproteinic diet). Blood tests were carried out on the animals, e.g., glucose, leptin, and triglyceride plasma concentrations. The main structural findings in this study were that a protein-deficient diet (5% casein) caused coeliac ganglion (78%) and coeliac ganglion neurons (24%) to atrophy and led to neuron loss (63%). Therefore, the fall in the total number of coeliac ganglion neurons in protein-restricted rats contrasts strongly with no neuron losses previously described for the enteric neurons of animals subjected to similar protein-restriction diets. Discrepancies between our figures and the data for enteric neurons (using very similar protein-restriction protocols) may be attributable to the counting method used. In light of this, further systematic investigations comparing 2-D and 3-D quantitative methods are warranted to provide even more advanced data on the effects that a protein-deficient diet may exert on sympathetic neurons.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Intussusception (IS) is rare in adults. However, the more frequent use of cross-sectional imaging has resulted in an increase in its detection. Because of the reported association with celiac disease, we determined the prevalence of IS among a cohort with celiac disease. METHODS: An anonymized prospectively maintained celiac disease database and radiological database were reviewed. RESULTS: Of a total of 880 patients, 14 (age 47 +/- 17.5 years; 50% female) had IS that was detected by CT in 10, capsule endoscopy in three, and barium studies in two. The reason for evaluation was abdominal pain in 78% (11/14), whereas in the remainder (3/14) were incidental. IS was the initial manifestation of celiac disease in 57% (8/14). Two patients were found to have lead-point intussusceptions and both had small-bowel adenocarcinoma, and 10/14 had severe villous atrophy (subtotal or total). Among those with established celiac disease, IS was detected early, within 3 years of diagnosis. Follow-up was available for 11 patients, 9 of who adhered strictly to a gluten-free diet, and six had no recurrence. Among all the patients diagnosed with IS on radiologic studies at our institution, 45 were considered to have idiopathic IS. Only two of these patients had evaluation for celiac disease. CONCLUSION: IS occurs in celiac disease. It may be the initial presentation and is associated with abdominal pain. Adenocarcinoma needs to be excluded. The majority of patients do not have recurrent symptoms after adherence to a gluten-free diet. Celiac disease should be considered more frequently when IS is encountered.},

Although hematologic abnormalities have been attributed to copper deficiency in patients with celiac disease, myeloneuropathy due to copper deficiency has not been well described in patients with celiac disease. CASE REPORT: A 69-year-old woman was evaluated for a 5-year history of progressive gait unsteadiness and weight loss. She had no other gastrointestinal symptoms. Her neurologic examination revealed a sensory ataxia, and electrodiagnostic testing confirmed a myeloneuropathy. She had decreased serum copper levels and markedly elevated gliadin and tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Subsequent duodenal biopsy showed findings consistent with celiac disease. The patient was diagnosed with copper deficiency myeloneuropathy due to celiac disease. Adoption of a gluten-free diet along with copper supplementation resulted in significant clinical improvement, including improvement on electrodiagnostic testing. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease should be considered in patients found to have copper deficiency, even in patients without gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, the authors suggest that some cases of ataxia associated with celiac disease are likely due to copper deficiency myeloneuropathy.},

Tissue transglutaminase was assessed immunohistochemically (clone CUB 7402) in duodenal biopsy specimens from 22 untreated CD patients, ten normal controls (NC) with unremarkable duodenal mucosa, and nine disease nonceliac controls (DC). In 15 CD patients duodenal biopsy specimens were repeatedly assessed after these patients had been prescribed gluten-free diet. Positive pixel count algorithm of ImageScope was used for quantitative evaluation of immunohistochemistry. Tissue transglutaminase expression in superficial epithelium differed significantly between the three groups (p < 0.001). It was increased in DC in relation to NC (p < 0.001) and in CD--in relation to NC (p < 0.001) and DC (p = 0.003). In CD and DC, cryptal epithelium was stained more intensively than in NC (p < 0.001), but there was no difference between CD and DC (p = 0.507). The same pattern was seen in lamina propria. A significant decrease in tTG expression in all the compartments was seen in repeatedly assessed samples. Untreated CD is associated with tTG overexpression, which is reversible. Tissue transglutaminase up-regulation does not seem to be specific for CD and can appear in other pathological conditions.},

Fermentation of wheat flour with sourdough lactobacilli and fungal proteases decreases the concentration of gluten. We evaluated the safety of daily administration of baked goods made from this hydrolyzed form of wheat flour to patients with CD. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to consumption of 200 g per day of natural flour baked goods (NFBG) (80,127 ppm gluten; n = 6), extensively hydrolyzed flour baked goods (S1BG) (2480 ppm residual gluten; n = 2), or fully hydrolyzed baked goods (S2BG) (8 ppm residual gluten; n = 5) for 60 days. RESULTS: Two of the 6 patients who consumed NFBG discontinued the challenge because of symptoms; all had increased levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies and small bowel deterioration. The 2 patients who ate the S1BG goods had no clinical complaints but developed subtotal atrophy. The 5 patients who ate the S2BG had no clinical complaints; their levels of anti-tTG antibodies did not increase, and their Marsh grades of small intestinal mucosa did not change. CONCLUSIONS: A 60-day diet of baked goods made from hydrolyzed wheat flour, manufactured with sourdough lactobacilli and fungal proteases, was not toxic to patients with CD. A combined analysis of serologic, morphometric, and immunohistochemical parameters is the most accurate method to assess new therapies for this disorder.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is a genetically driven immunological intolerance to dietary gluten with a wide range of clinical presentations. The aim of this study was to investigate the heritability of the phenotype in CD and the influence on the phenotype of different genes associated with the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seven families with at least 2 siblings with CD were collected. The patients were grouped in symptom grades on the basis of the clinical presentation, the age at diagnosis, and sex. Stratification analyses of the human leucocyte antigen-DQA1 and human leucocyte antigen-DQB1 genotypes, the CTLA4 +49A/G polymorphism, the CTLA4 haplotype MH30*G:-1147*T:+49*A:CT60*G:CT61*A, and the 5q31-33 loci were done. RESULTS: The heritability of the phenotype was estimated to be 0.45. Significant association and linkage was found between the clinical presentation and the CTLA4 +49A/G polymorphism but not for the other genotypes. No correlation was found between genotypes and age at diagnosis or sex. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the heritability is determiner of the phenotype in CD. The CTLA4 +49A/G polymorphism is correlated to the clinical presentation: the AA genotype is associated with clinically silent disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Improved endoscopic screening with targeted biopsies might enhance diagnostic yield in celiac disease. Confocal endomicroscopy (CEM) allows high-resolution in vivo histological analysis. We compared the endomicroscopic findings during ongoing endoscopy with the histological findings graded according to the Marsh classification. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with celiac disease and six patients with celiac disease that was refractory on a gluten-free diet were examined using CEM. The duodenal mucosa was evaluated by CEM and by conventional histological analysis in respect of villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs > 40 / 100 enterocytes). The CEM results were assessed as to sensitivity, specificity, and interobserver variability. A Marsh classification score determined by CEM was compared to that obtained by histology. Thirty patients undergoing routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were used as controls. RESULTS: Conventional histology showed villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia in 23 and increased numbers of IELs in 27 of the 30 patients with celiac disease. With CEM, villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased IELs were respectively identified in 17, 12, and 22 of the 30 patients. The agreement of the findings on CEM with those of conventional histology was good in relation to villous atrophy (sensitivity 74 %) and increased numbers of IELs (sensitivity 81 %), but inadequate in relation to crypt hyperplasia (sensitivity 52 %). The kappa values for determination of interobserver variability were 0.90 for villous atrophy, 1.00 for crypt hyperplasia, and 0.84 for IEL detection. In the 30 control patients, normal duodenal architecture was found by both histology and endomicroscopy, indicating an overall specificity of 100 %. CONCLUSION: The assessment of duodenal histology by CEM in patients with celiac disease is sensitive and specific in determining increased numbers of IELs and villous atrophy, but insufficient in respect of crypt hyperplasia. For routine use of CEM in patients with celiac disease, the technique would need to be improved.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of vitamin supplements on homocysteine levels in patients with celiac disease. METHODS: Vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, and fasting plasma homocysteine levels were measured in 51 consecutive adults with celiac disease [median (range) age 56 (18-63) years; 40% men, 26 (51%) had villous atrophy, and 25 (49%) used B-vitamin supplements] and 50 healthy control individuals matched for age and sex. Finally, the C677T polymorphism of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) was evaluated in 46 patients with celiac disease and all control individuals. RESULTS: Patients with celiac disease and using vitamin supplements had higher serum vitamin B6 (P = 0.003), folate (P < 0.001), and vitamin B12 (P = 0.012) levels than patients who did not or healthy controls (P = 0.035, P < 0.001, P = 0.007, for vitamin B6, folate, and vitamin B12, respectively). Lower plasma homocysteine levels were found in patients using vitamin supplements than in patients who did not (P = 0.001) or healthy controls (P = 0.003). However, vitamin B6 and folate, not vitamin B12, were significantly and independently associated with homocysteine levels. Twenty-four (48%) of 50 controls and 23 (50%) of 46 patients with celiac disease carried the MTHFR thermolabile variant T-allele (P = 0.89). CONCLUSION: Homocysteine levels are dependent on Marsh classification and the regular use of B-vitamin supplements is effective in reduction of homocysteine levels in patients with celiac disease and should be considered in disease management.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is a common disorder. Due to the protean manifestations of the disease and the often mild but indolent course, the diagnosis is often missed. The method to diagnose this in principle reversible disease after the introduction of a gluten-free diet has attracted the attention of several scientific disciplines to find the simplest and most patient-friendly test. This has resulted in a noticeable impact on the clinical practice next to a general increased awareness of its existence, its pathogenesis, its course and recent evidence of increased mortality. Amendments made in the diagnostic criteria of coeliac disease over the last half century have simplified the diagnosis. However, the aspect most relevant to the specialist in internal medicine is related to its grave consequences when the disease fails to respond to a gluten-free diet. These refractory cases may culminate in severe complications with sombre endings and malignancy. Fortunately, current technology can offer the specialist in internal medicine more facilities to diagnose the cause of the complicated cases in order to attempt to intervene in the course of disease and hopefully save these patients. We review the available tools that now exist and their indications that can be practiced in a modern clinical setting for the diagnosis of the complicated forms of this disease.},

The commonest type of neuropathy seen in the context of gluten sensitivity is sensorimotor axonal. We report 17 patients with sensory ganglionopathy associated with gluten sensitivity. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational case series of 17 patients with sensory ganglionopathy and gluten sensitivity. All patients had been followed up for a number of years in dedicated gluten sensitivity/neurology and neuropathy clinics. RESULTS: Out of a total of 409 patients with different types of peripheral neuropathies, 53 (13%) had clinical and neurophysiologic evidence of sensory ganglionopathy. Out of these 53 patients, 17 (32%) had serologic evidence of gluten sensitivity. The mean age of those with gluten sensitivity was 67 years and the mean age at onset was 58 years. Seven of those with serologic evidence of gluten sensitivity had enteropathy on biopsy. Fifteen patients went on a gluten-free diet, resulting in stabilization of the neuropathy in 11. The remaining 4 had poor adherence to the diet and progressed, as did the 2 patients who did not opt for dietary treatment. Autopsy tissue from 3 patients demonstrated inflammation in the dorsal root ganglia with degeneration of the posterior columns of the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS: Sensory ganglionopathy can be a manifestation of gluten sensitivity and may respond to a strict gluten-free diet.},

This disorder is characterised by abnormal immunological responsiveness to ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Coeliac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is only one aspect of a range of possible manifestations of gluten sensitivity. Although neurological manifestations in patients with established coeliac disease have been reported since 1966, it was not until 30 years later that, in some individuals, gluten sensitivity was shown to manifest solely with neurological dysfunction. Furthermore, the concept of extraintestinal presentations without enteropathy has only recently become accepted. In this Personal View, we review the range of neurological manifestations of gluten sensitivity and discuss recent advances in the diagnosis and understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurological dysfunction related to gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is increasingly diagnosed in adult patients who present with atypical symptoms or who are asymptomatic and detected by case screening. Its treatment, a gluten-free diet, can have a considerable impact on daily living. Understanding the factors associated with non-adherence is important in terms of supporting patients with their condition. AIM: To investigate factors associated with adherence to a gluten-free diet in adults with coeliac disease. METHODS: A literature search of multiple electronic databases using a pre-determined search string for literature between 1980 and November 2007 identified a possible 611 hits. After checking for relevance, 38 studies were included in this review. RESULTS: Rates for strict adherence range from 42% to 91% depending on definition and method of assessment and are the lowest among ethnic minorities and those diagnosed in childhood. Adherence is most strongly associated with cognitive, emotional and socio-cultural influences, membership of an advocacy group and regular dietetic follow-up. Screen and symptom-detected coeliac patients do not differ in their adherence to a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: The existing evidence for factors associated with non-adherence to a gluten-free diet is of variable quality. Further and more rigorous research is needed to characterize those individuals most likely to be non-adherent to assist them better with their treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with coeliac disease living on a gluten-free diet show vitamin deficiency and reduced subjective health status. AIM: To study the biochemical and clinical effects of B vitamin supplementation in adults with longstanding coeliac disease. METHODS: In a double blind placebo controlled multicentre trial, 65 coeliac patients (61% women) aged 45-64 years on a strict gluten-free diet for several years were randomized to a daily dose of 0.8 mg folic acid,0.5 mg cyanocobalamin and 3 mg pyridoxine or placebo for 6 months. The outcome measures were psychological general well-being (PGWB) and the plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) level, marker of B vitamin status. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients (88%) completed the trial. The tHcy level was baseline median 11.7 micromol/L (7.4-23.0), significantly higher than in matched population controls [10.2 micromol/L (6.7-22.6) (P < 0.01)]. Following vitamin supplementation, tHcy dropped a median of 34% (P < 0.001), accompanied by significant improvement in well-being (P < 0.01), notably Anxiety (P < 0.05) and Depressed Mood (P < 0.05) for patients with poor well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with longstanding coeliac disease taking extra B vitamins for 6 months showed normalized tHcy and significant improvement in general well-being, suggesting that B vitamins should be considered in people advised to follow a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-15 contributes to the immunopathogenesis of Celiac disease (CD). However, it is not clear how IL-15 affects APC that shape adaptive immune responses to the dietary antigen, gliadin. Using PBMC from healthy individuals, we show that monocytes differentiated with IL-15 (IL15-DC) produced IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-15, IL-23, TNFalpha and CCL20 in response to pepsin-trypsin digested gliadin (PTG) and activated contact-dependent Th17 and Th1 responses from autologous CD4(+) T cells. Lower concentrations of IL-15 augmented IFNgamma responses to PTG in PBMC from CD patients compared to controls. Thus, IL-15 supports Th17 and Th1 responses to a dietary antigen that is normally well-tolerated in healthy individuals by generating IL15-DC. These potentially pathogenic immune responses may result in CD patients and not healthy individuals as a consequence of IL-15 hypersensitivity. Therefore, genetic and/or environmental factors that control IL-15 expression and responsiveness in the intestine likely participate in the pathogenesis of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The frequency of diagnosis of celiac disease has increased since the introduction of serologic testing. The number of patients in whom extraintestinal symptoms reflect the initial manifestation is rising. Common symptoms are changes in blood counts, which can arise from changes in all cell lineages. Among these, iron deficiency anemia is very common, but also thrombocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been reported to manifest themselves within the framework of celiac disease. CASE REPORT: The authors report on a patient with malnutrition, macrocytic anemia, and pronounced thrombocytopenia. Based on changes of peripheral blood smear and endoscopic result, celiac disease was suspected that could be confirmed by histology of duodenal biopsies. The thrombocytopenia was reversible after initiation of gluten-free diet and folic acid substitution. In addition, clinical symptoms resolved and hematologic reconstitution could be observed. CONCLUSION: Similar deficiencies have almost exclusively been observed in patients with increased folic acid requirements during pregnancy or intensive care. Celiac disease must be taken into consideration, if changes in blood counts occur associated with gastrointestinal symptoms.},

   abstract = {AIM: To compare anxiety and depression levels in adult patients with celiac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD) with controls. METHODS: The levels of anxiety, depression and of a probable anxiety or depressive disorder were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale in 441 adult patients with CD recruited by the German Celiac Society, in 235 age- and sex-matched patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in remission or with slight disease activity, and in 441 adult persons of a representative German general population sample (GP). Potential demographic (age, sex, social class, family status) and disease-related (latency to diagnosis, duration of GFD, compliance with GFD, thyroid disease) predictors of anxiety and depression in CD were tested for by regression analyses. RESULTS: The level of anxiety in CD patients was predicted (R(2) = 0.07) by female gender (P = 0.01). Female sex (OR = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.3-9.4, P = 0.01) was associated with a probable anxiety disorder. Living alone (OR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.2-0.9, P = 0.05) was associated with a reduced risk of an anxiety disorder. The level of depression and a probable depressive disorder were not predicted by any of the demographic and medical variables tested for. The levels of anxiety in patients with CD (6.6 +/- 3.4) and with IBD (6.9 +/- 3.7) were higher than those of persons in the GP (4.6 +/- 3.3) (both P < 0.001). The levels of depression in persons with CD (4.2 +/- 3.4), IBD (4.6 +/- 3.4) and of the GP (4.2 +/- 3.8) did not differ (P = 0.3). The prevalence of a probable anxiety disorder in persons with CD (16.8%) and IBD (14.0%) was higher than that of the GP (5.7%) (P < 0.001). The prevalence of a probable depressive disorder did not differ significantly between the three groups (P = 0.1). CONCLUSION: Anxiety in adult German female celiacs on a GFD is higher than in persons of the GP. Female celiacs on a GFD should be screened for anxiety.},

Coeliac disease results from complex interactions between the innate immune system, an adaptive T and B cell response and the mucosal barrier where inflammation is ultimately manifested. Genetic variants within the HLA region are well established, while variants outside of the HLA region have recently been identified. These variants are beginning to enhance our understanding of the immunology of the condition. This review focuses on the immunological pathogenesis of coeliac disease with special reference to the influence of genetic susceptibility on disease development.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a T cell mediated-inflammatory enteropathy caused by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals carrying HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. The immunogenic gliadin epitopes, containing multiple glutamine and proline residues, are largely resistant to degradation by gastric and intestinal proteases. Salivary microorganisms however exhibit glutamine endoprotease activity, discovered towards glutamine- and proline-rich salivary proteins. The aim was to explore if gliadins can serve as substrates for oral microbial enzymes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Proteolytic activity in suspended dental plaque was studied towards a) gliadin-derived paranitroanilide(pNA)-linked synthetic enzyme substrates b) a mixture of natural gliadins and c) synthetic highly immunogenic gliadin peptides (33-mer of alpha2-gliadin and 26-mer of gamma-gliadin). In addition, gliadin zymography was conducted to obtain the approximate molecular weights and pH activity profiles of the gliadin-degrading oral enzymes and liquid iso-electric focusing was performed to establish overall enzyme iso-electric points. Plaque bacteria efficiently hydrolyzed Z-YPQ-pNA, Z-QQP-pNA, Z-PPF-pNA and Z-PFP-pNA, with Z-YPQ-pNA being most rapidly cleaved. Gliadin immunogenic domains were extensively degraded in the presence of oral bacteria. Gliadin zymography revealed that prominent enzymes exhibit molecular weights >70 kD and are active over a broad pH range from 3 to 10. Liquid iso-electric focusing indicated that most gliadin-degrading enzymes are acidic in nature with iso-electric points between 2.5 and 4.0. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first reported evidence for gluten-degrading microorganisms associated with the upper gastro-intestinal tract. Such microorganisms may play a hitherto unappreciated role in the digestion of dietary gluten and thus protection from celiac disease in subjects at risk.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD), with a 1% worldwide prevalence, is an enteropathy caused by an autoimmune reaction to gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, which codify for histocompatibility molecules HLA DQ-2/DQ-8. From the anatomical point of view, CD is characterized by intestinal villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, intraepithelial lymphocytosis (IELs) and leukocyte infiltration of the lamina propriety. Patients achieve a complete clinical and endoscopic remission with a gluten free diet. However, symptoms and anatomical alterations recur when this protein is reintroduced in the diet. The pathogenic mechanisms in this disease are not yet well understood, but it is clear that genetic, environmental and immunological factors play a role. The latter are the focus of this review, since this is the only autoimmune disease whose precipitating factor for immunological tissue damage is known.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is frequently diagnosed after a long delay resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. AIMS: To define the parameters which have the highest impact on the cost-effectiveness of mass screening for coeliac disease. METHODS: A Markov model examined a coeliac disease screening programme of the healthy young-adult general population compared with a no-screening strategy. The main outcome measures were quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Effects of variables were examined using sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The screening strategy resulted in a gain of 0.0027 QALYs. The ICER of screening vs. no-screening strategy was US$48,960/QALYs. The variables with the largest impact on cost effectiveness were: the time delay from symptom onset to diagnosis, the utility of adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and the prevalence of coeliac disease. Screening would be cost-effective if the time delay to diagnosis is longer than 6 years and utility of GFD adherence is greater than 0.978. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that mass screening for coeliac disease of the young-adult general population is associated with improved QALYs and is a cost effectiveness strategy. Shortening of the time-delay to diagnosis by heightened awareness of health-care professionals may be a valid alternative to screening.},

   abstract = {The causes of iron deficiency vary significantly during different stages of life, and according to gender and socioeconomic circumstances. Although dietary iron is important, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is mostly attributed to blood loss and may be the presenting clinical feature of occult bleeding from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract heralding underlying malignancy. Conventional GI diagnostic workup fails to establish the cause of iron deficiency in about one third of patients. However, abnormal iron absorption caused by hereditary iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) or acquired disease is increasingly recognized as an important cause of unexplained iron deficiency. The recent availability of convenient, non-invasive screening methods to identify celiac disease, autoimmune atrophic gastritis and Helicobacter pylori infection has greatly facilitated the recognition of patients with these entities. Cure of previously refractory IDA by H pylori eradication provides strong evidence supporting a cause-and-effect relation. The intriguing recent observations of H pylori antibodies directed against epitopes on gastric mucosal cells in atrophic gastritis imply an autoimmune mechanism triggered by H pylori and directed against gastric parietal cells by means of antigenic mimicry. Improved understanding of the role of abnormal iron absorption in IDA has important implications for current concepts related to the pathogenesis and management of IDA.},

   abstract = {AIM: The aim of the study was to assess the evolution of bone mineral density (BMD) in children with celiac disease and to evaluate the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Altogether, 44 children (31 girls and 13 boys) were followed-up. BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine (Hologic QDR 4500). Results are expressed as absolute values for BMD, and as Z scores for chronological age (BMD/CA) and bone age (BMD/BA). Patients were divided into two groups according to whether they followed a diet without (n=34) or with (n=10) gluten for at least 1 year. All patients were clinically free of symptoms at the end of the follow-up. RESULTS: At inclusion, 26 patients (59%) were delayed in bone age, 17 children (38%) had a BMD/CA< or =1 S.D. and six (13.6%) had a BMD/CA< or =2 S.D., whereas nine children (20%) had a BMD/BA< or =1 S.D. and three (6.8%) had a BMD/BA< or =2 S.D. During the follow-up, the BMD increase was greater in the GFD group, as determined by the BMD/CA/year (+0.05+/-0.3 vs -0.34+/-0.4 S.D.; P<0.01) and BMD/BA/year (-0.02+/-0.4 vs -0.4+/-0.6 S.D.; P<0.05). The gain in BMD/BA was smaller in the GFD group because of their need to catch up in bone maturation. CONCLUSION: Celiac children not following a GFD show delays in both bone maturation and mineralization. This prospective study confirms the importance of maintaining a GFD in children with celiac disease until the end of skeletal mineralization even in asymptomatic patients following a non-restricted diet.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In coeliac disease (CD) there is a gluten-induced small bowel enteropathy leading to malabsorption of various nutrients, vitamins and trace elements. Low levels of serum zinc have been reported in adults with untreated CD. In the present study we related the serum concentration of zinc to the morphology of the small bowel mucosa in 58 children, all under 4 years of age and under investigation for coeliac disease. The mean serum concentration of zinc (mean +/- SD; mumol/L) was significantly lower in children with untreated CD (9.7 +/- 2.0) (n = 11) compared to non-coeliac children without enteropathy (15.1 +/- 2.3) (n = 16) (p < 0.001), coeliac children on a gluten-free diet without enteropathy (14.2 +/- 1.6) (n = 14) (p < 0.001), coeliac children on gluten challenge with enteropathy (14.1 +/- 2.1) (n = 12) (p < 0.001) and coeliac children on gluten challenge without enteropathy (13.8 +/- 1.9) (n = 6) (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Serum zinc concentration is decreased in untreated coeliac children with enteropathy and normalizes on gluten-free diet. A low serum zinc value in a child being investigated for possible CD on clinical grounds can thus be used as a complementary marker for enteropathy indicating further investigation with small bowel biopsy. The hypothetical role of zinc in the pathogenesis of CD is discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: PreventCD (www.preventcd.com) is a European multicentre study, which studies the influence of infant nutrition, and that of genetic, immunologic and environmental factors, on the risk of developing coeliac disease (CD). The hypothesis is that it is possible to induce tolerance to gluten by introducing small quantities of gluten to infants, preferably while they are still being breast-fed, and that this might also reduce the risk for related autoimmune disorders. AIM: To describe the design of this ongoing European CD research project. METHODS: PreventCD encompasses two study designs and two study populations: (i) a European multicentre study: a prospective, double-blind, randomized dietary-intervention study among infants from families with high risk of CD, and (ii) a Swedish population-based CD screening study among 12-year-olds from the general population, divided into two birth cohorts that differ with respect to infant feeding practices. DISCUSSION: PreventCD is expected to elucidate some of the genetic and immunological mechanisms involved in the process of immune intolerance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease is treated with a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). The aim of our study was to investigate whether the dietary (nondietary) compliance is associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of coeliac patients. METHODS: Patients from our hospital, known with coeliac disease for more than 10 years, were invited to participate in a study on possible gluten tolerance. HRQoL was assessed by the Short Form-36 health survey, symptoms by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and dietary compliance by a food frequency questionnaire. HRQoL of coeliac patients was compared with that of the general population. RESULTS: Fifty-three biopsy-confirmed coeliac patients were divided into three groups according to gluten consumption: GFD (n = 33), gluten transgression (<10 g gluten/day; n = 8) and normal gluten-containing diet (>10 g gluten/day; n = 12). Compared with the general population, coeliac patients scored significantly worse on general health perception but significantly better on bodily pain and limitations due to physical problems. The results of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and the Short Form-36 health survey were similar in all three dietary groups. CONCLUSION: Although adhering to the GFD is strictly important to prevent future complications, patients who stop following GFD do exist and patients with partial or nonadherence report similar HRQoL compared with patients with strict adherence in this group of adult coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disease of the small intestine caused by intolerance to gluten. Removal of gluten from the diet results in a return to normal health for the majority of patients. A significant proportion of patients do not respond to a gluten-free diet and are considered to be suffering from refractory coeliac disease (RCD). Two types of RCD are now recognized: type 1 RCD is characterized by a polyclonal population of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) with a normal immunophenotype, and type 2 RCD shows monoclonal IELs with an aberrant immunoprofile. Patients with RCD have a high risk of complications such as ulcerative jejunitis (UJ) and enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma (ETTL). RCD2 may represent an early stage in the development of overt lymphoma. The diagnosis of RCD, therefore, has important implications, but remains a challenging area. In this paper we review the latest developments in RCD, including the diagnostic approach and a discussion of the key clinical, histological, immunohistochemical and molecular features of RCD and its complications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Breath diagnostics, the measurement of volatile chemicals in human breath, is currently receiving attention as a technique for the detection of disease which, being non-invasive in nature, is particularly suited to screening for pre-symptomatic disease in healthy populations. A disorder in which more effective screening would be beneficial is celiac disease (CD), an under-diagnosed autoimmune disease of the small intestine characterized by nutritional malabsorption, which presents with diverse, and sometimes serious, symptoms. We aimed to determine whether breath analyses could be used to screen for the presence of CD. METHODS: Based on our hypotheses that malabsorption of dietary carbohydrates would lead to over production of alcohol fermentation products in the large intestine, we investigated levels of alcohols in the breath of 10 patients with CD compared to that in 10 healthy controls using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). RESULTS: No differences were found in the breath levels of methanol, propanol, butanol, heptanol or hexanol investigated using chemical ionization of breath air with H3O+ and/or NO+ precursor ions. In one patient, diagnosed within days of our study and not currently in receipt of any therapeutic intervention, a relatively high production of three product ions was detected compared to all other study patients. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that breath alcohol levels are unlikely to be of diagnostic use in CD, although further investigation of those recently diagnosed with the disorder may be warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a relatively common condition which is usually managed by placing patients on a gluten free diet. Follow up biopsies to confirm histological recovery are controversial with a considerable variation in practice observed. AIM: To determine the length of time to histopathological recovery in a group of coeliac disease patients and its associations with clinicopathological data. DESIGN AND METHODS: All patients attending a specialist coeliac disease clinic prior to March 2009 were entered onto a database which recorded various clinicopathological data. The histopathology reports for all duodenal biopsies were reviewed and each biopsy was given a histopathological disease score based on a modified Marsh grade. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-four patients underwent index and at least one subsequent biopsy. Two-hundred and twenty-seven (80%) showed histopathological improvement and 100 (35%) returned to normal (median recovery time 1.9 years, inter-quartile range 1.0-4.8 years). Patients with less severe disease at diagnosis were more likely to show a better response (r = 0.281, P < 0.0001). Older patients demonstrated a shorter time to histopathological recovery (r = -0.200, P = 0.001). Compliance with a gluten free diet was correlated with the best biopsy score (r = -0.134, P = 0.040) and degree of histological recovery (r = 0.161, P = 0.014). CONCLUSION: Current guidelines for the timing of repeat biopsy after commencing a gluten free diet are unclear, although 4-6 months has been recommended. This study shows that time to histological recovery is longer than traditionally thought and may need to take into account the patient's age at diagnosis, the initial disease score and the level of compliance with a gluten free diet.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Lactose stimulates proliferation and colonization of acidophilic bacteria, which due to fermentation processes lower colonic pH and simplified absorption of some microelements from the intestine. However, the common problem in children is intolerance of this carbohydrate. Treatment, quite simple, is based on partial or total elimination of lactose from diet. Some substitutional products with equivalent nutritional value should be introduced to prevent deficiencies symptoms during lactose-free diet. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY: Determination of milk and dairy products consumption and their connection with lactose malabsorption or lactose intolerance in children above 5 years of age in selected disorders of the alimentary tract: food allergy, celiac disease, secondary enteropathy, functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and deficiency of body weight and height. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The number of 301 patients above 5 years of age (135 boys and 166 girls; mean age 11.5 years) were included into the study. Milk and dairy products consumption habits, lactose intolerance symptoms, hydrogen breath test, activity of lactase and villous atrophy were investigated. RESULTS: Decreased sweet milk consumption from, 33.33% in children with food allergy to 55.38% in children with functional indigestion was observed, in spite of gastrointestinal complaints after ingestion of milk. The biggest lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance frequency was observed in children with decreased sweet milk consumption due to complaints after ingestion of milk and in children who didn't drink milk. There were no statistically significant difference between frequency of lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance symptoms in children with different dairy products consumption habits. There were no statistically significant difference between frequency of hypolactasia in children with different sweet milk or dairy products consumption habits. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent (33-55%) decreased sweet milk consumption in children in spite of clinical symptoms after ingestion of milk was observed. The biggest lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance symptoms frequency was observed in children who didn't drink milk and in children with decreased consumption of sweet milk due to complaints after ingestion of milk. There were no statistically significant difference between frequency of lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance in children with different dairy products consumption habits.},

However, the role of hBDs in various diseases to which bacterial infection add severity, as it is in celiac disease (CD), is not yet clear. We analyzed the expression of the hBD1, hBD2, hBD3 and hBD4 genes in patients with CD during the active phase and after remission following a gluten-free diet to determine their role in development and relapse of CD. METHODS: We studied 21 unrelated adults with CD (confirmed by anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and intestinal biopsy); 14 were evaluated at diagnosis, before diet modification, and seven after 2 years of a gluten-free diet. Thirty-six unrelated adults served as controls. We analyzed the mRNA expression of hBD1, 2, 3 and 4 on biopsy samples of duodenum obtained from all patients during endoscopy for diagnostic purposes. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction with TaqMan probes and obtained gene expression data using the delta-Ct method. RESULTS: hBD1 mRNA was significantly lower in patients with active CD compared with patients on diet modification, whereas the mRNA levels of the other three defensins did not differ significantly between the two subgroups. Interestingly, the gluten-free diet restored only partially hBD1 expression as compared to a normal group of celiac-free subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reinforce the evidence that hBD1 expression is greatly reduced in the duodenum of patients with active CD. It also strengthens the concept that reduced activity of immune peptides may predispose individuals to bacterial proliferation that contributes to the pathogenesis of CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an immune mediated enteropathy with an increasing prevalence worldwide. It is estimated that 1% of general population in Europe is suffering from this ailment. The clinically silent form affects the majority of patients. Hence, diarrhea, nutritional deficiencies and weight loss are symptoms which are not very often seen. Nonspecific complaints like headaches and joint pain have the potential to delay the diagnosis. The high risk groups have been identified to be those patients suffering from autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, Sjogren's syndrome and the first degree relatives of CD patients. Those patients should be screened for CD. The association of CD with several autoimmune ailments has various explanations ranging from common genotypes to systemic immune reactions triggered by food antigens. CD is, nevertheless, an autoimmune disorder triggered by an environmental antigen (gluten) but, as opposed to other autoimmune disorders in which the pathogenic process is self-sustained, the removal of gluten from diet results in relatively fast resolution of histological and serological markers.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune condition. Previously it was considered to be a rare childhood disorder, but is actually considered a relatively common condition, present at any age, which may have multiple complications and manifestations. Hematological disorders of the disease are not uncommon. Among these disorders, the most frequently reported are anemias as a result of iron deficiency, often associated with folate and/or B12 deficiency. Anemias caused by hemolysis are very rarely reported in celiac patients. An 11-year-old girl with a previous uneventful medical history presented with severe hemolytic anemia. Hemolysis was Coombs negative, accompanied by inappropriate low reticulocyte count, despite exaggerated bone marrow hyperplasia of the erythroid precursors which showed normal maturation. Serology for recent infections, including Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus and mycoplasma, were all negative. Levels of serum IgA, IgG and IgM, were all within normal ranges for age. Screening for anti-DNA, antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, antimicrosomal, antithyroglobulin, and antimitochondrial antibodies and lupus anticoagulants, was negative. She was also negative for human immunodeficiency virus. Conventional therapy with corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin failed. CD was serendipitously discovered upon screening for anti-tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies. The disease was confirmed by biopsy of the small intestine mucosa. The patient recovered with gluten-free diet. A unique case of CD is presented. CD should be serologically screened in each patient with Coombs negative "immune" hemolytic anemia, particularly if accompanied by "reticulocytopenia". A new hemolytic mechanism and very speculative explanation for "reticulocytopenia" are discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac crisis is a life-threatening syndrome in which patients with celiac disease have profuse diarrhea and severe metabolic disturbances. Celiac crisis is rare among adults and not well documented. To improve awareness of this condition and to facilitate diagnosis, we reviewed cases of celiac crisis to identify presenting features, formulate diagnostic criteria, and develop treatment strategies. METHODS: Cases of biopsy-proven celiac disease were reviewed. Celiac crisis was defined as acute onset or rapid progression of gastrointestinal symptoms that could be attributed to celiac disease and required hospitalization and/or parenteral nutrition, along with signs or symptoms of dehydration or malnutrition. RESULTS: Twelve patients met preset criteria for celiac crisis; 11 developed celiac crisis before they were diagnosed with celiac disease. Eleven patients had increased titres of transglutaminase antibodies and 1 had immunoglobulin A deficiency. Results of biopsy analyses of duodenum samples from all patients were consistent with a Marsh 3 score (33% with total villous atrophy). Patients presented with severe dehydration, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte disturbances. All patients required hospitalization and intravenous fluids, 6 required corticosteroids, and 5 required parenteral nutrition. All patients eventually had a full response to a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac crisis has a high morbidity and, although rarely described, occurs in adults and often has a clear precipitating factor. Patients who present with severe unexplained diarrhea and malabsorption should be tested for celiac disease; treatment with systemic steroids or oral budesonide should be considered. Nutritional support often is required in the short term but most patients ultimately respond to gluten avoidance.},

An association of CS with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type 1 is rare, with only two prior cases reported. Here we describe a 45-year-old man with no prior medical history who presented initially with microhaematuria, subnephrotic proteinuria and hypocomplementaemia. A renal biopsy revealed MPGN type 1 with negative serologic workup for secondary causes. The patient was treated conservatively with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Several months later, he developed daily non-bloody diarrhoea and was found to have worsening hypoalbuminaemia, hypophosphataemia and severe iron deficiency anaemia. A diagnosis of CS was established based on elevated tTGA (IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase) antibody and positive IgA antiendomysial antibody titres. Proteinuria resolved completely following the initiation of a gluten-free diet, without the use of immunosuppressive therapy and despite tapering of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. This case illustrates that CS-associated MPGN may precede overt clinical evidence of coeliac disease and may respond to gluten-free diet, without resort to immunosuppressive therapy.},

The disease is common in Europe and the United States, but only sporadic reports are found in East Asia including China. Is CD really rare in China? We examined 62 patients by capsule endoscopy for chronic diarrhea from June 2003 to March 2008. Four patients with chronic diarrhea and weight loss were diagnosed to have CD. Under the capsule endoscopy, we observed that the villi of the proximal small bowel became short, and that the mucous membrane became atrophied in these four patients. Duodenal biopsies were performed during gastroscopy and the pathological changes of mucosa were confirmed to be Marsh 3 stage of CD. A gluten free diet significantly improved the conditions of the four patients. We suspect that in China, especially in the northern area where wheat is the main food, CD might not be uncommon, and its under-diagnosis could be caused by its clinical manifestations that could be easily covered by the symptoms from other clinical situations, particularly when it came to subclinical patients without obvious symptom or to patients with extraintestinal symptoms as the initial manifestations.},

A symptom frequently reported, but difficult to make objective, is fatigue. The Daily Fatigue Impact Scale (D-FIS) questionnaire consisting of 8 items, each scored on a 0 to 4 point scale, with lower scores reflecting greater fatigue, was employed to measure fatigue in celiac patients. GOALS: To assess the influence of fatigue on perception of health in celiac disease patients determined as their quality of life. STUDY: Prospective, cross-sectional study in celiac disease patients diagnosed by serology and histology. Instruments used were the D-FIS to measure fatigue and the generic EuroQol5D to measure quality of life. An additional question on the frequency of problems due to fatigue, scored on a 7-point Likert scale, was used to evaluate the importance of fatigue. RESULTS (IN MEDIANS): In all, 51 patients were included (13 untreated and 38 treated with a gluten-free diet). D-FIS score was significantly worse in untreated celiacs (16.0 vs. 3.0, P<0.001). Scores on the frequency scale of fatigue-related problems were also worse in untreated celiacs (2.0 vs. 6.0, P<0.001). Fatigue and quality-of-life scores were inversely correlated (r=-0.6, P<0.001). Fatigue severity was also greater in patients with worse quality of life (13.0 vs. 2.0, P<0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed fatigue to be an independent determinant of quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue is a major concern in untreated celiac disease patients, which impacts their quality of life.},

METHODS: A retrospective study of a series of duodenal biopsies from 114 children with celiac disease diagnosed over a period of 6 years (from January 1999 to December 2004). The diagnosis was confirmed by histological results, serological studies and clinical response to gluten free diet. RESULTS: The average age of patients was of 6.2 years (range 6 months-15 years). Sex ratio was 0.71. Symptoms were dominated by chronic diarrhea (48%), weight loss (50%) and anemia (20.1%). Histological findings showed an intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Marsh type 1) in 12.2% of cases, type 2 was present in 1.7% of cases and type 3 (villous atrophy) in 86% of cases. A treatment with a gluten-free diet was indicated for all patients, only the cases who haven't presented a clinical amelioration (11 cases) have beneficed a control biopsie; a villous atrophy was persistent in 80% of this patients. CONCLUSION: Histological features in duodenal biopsies for the diagnosis and the follow-up of patients with coeliac disease. This allows an appropriate treatment and prevents further complications.},

Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) is a separate form of DAH of unknown origin, associated in some cases with celiac disease.

We present a case of a 9-year-old girl diagnosed with IPH, which was confirmed by the presence of many hemosiderin-laden macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage obtained by bronchofiberoscopy. Therapy with glucocorticoids was initiated with a partial and transient response. Azathioprine and a gluten-free diet were subsequently introduced. However, the girl still suffers from recurrent episodes of hemoptysis, dyspnea and anemia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conventional laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (DP) is now regarded as a safe, effective treatment modality; however, pancreatic transections are mostly believed to be somewhere between the body and tail of the pancreas. Laparoscopic DP, with its division at the pancreatic neck (subtotal pancreatectomy [STP]), is more challenging because there are major vascular structures, such as the celiac axis, coronary vein, and superior mesenteric vein-splenic vein-portal vein (SMV-SV-PV) confluence around the pancreatic neck portion to be dissected. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients underwent laparoscopic STP with pancreatic division at the level of SMV-SV-PV confluence for benign and borderline pancreatic disease. RESULTS: Three patients were male and 7 were female, with a median age of 60 years (range, 28-73). All patients had benign or borderline malignant tumors in the body near the neck of the pancreas, with a median tumor size of 3 cm (range, 1-9.2). The operation time was a median of 287.5 minutes (range, 160-480). The intraopeative bleeding was a median of 300 mL (range, 100-700). Spleen preservation was carried out in 8 patients. Compared with open DP with the division of the pancreatic neck, a more frequent rate of spleen preservation (P = 0.004), longer operation time (P = 0.006), and early postoperative recovery presented by early intake of a soft diet (P = 0.001) and earlier discharge (P = 0.03) were significantly more frequent in the laparoscopic STP group. In a comparative study with laparoscopic DP, the longer segment of resected pancreas (P < 0.001), smaller amount of blood loss (P = 0.019), and high rate of spleen preservation (P = 0.019) were also noted in the laparoscopic STP group. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic DP with division of the pancreatic neck is considered feasible and safe.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is caused by uncontrolled CD4 T-cell responses directed to wheat-derived gluten peptides bound to the disease predisposing HLA-DQ molecules. The only available treatment is a life-long gluten-free diet which is complicated by the widespread use of wheat-derived gluten in the food industry. As the binding of gluten-derived peptides is a prerequisite for the induction of the inflammatory T-cell response, blockers that would prevent gluten peptide binding to the HLA-DQ molecules might be used as an alternative to the gluten-free diet. In the present study we have analyzed the binding properties of a set of previously identified natural ligands for HLA-DQ2, the primary disease predisposing allele. An in silico method, Epibase, ranked these peptides and the top one, a peptide with a nine amino acid core FVAEYEPVL, was measured among these peptides as the peptide with the highest binding affinity for HLA-DQ2. In a stepwise approach we subsequently tested the impact of N-terminal extensions and systematic single amino acid substitutions within the core of this peptide which revealed that an N-terminal extension with the tripeptide sequence ADA increased binding affinity 5- to 6-fold. In addition the substitution analysis indicated which amino acids were most preferred at anchor residues in the lead peptide, generally leading to an increase of binding affinity with a factor of 2. Next we tested which combinations of such preferred amino acids yielded the best results. The combined results indicate that a peptide with sequence ADAYDYESEELFAA (core in bold) had superior binding properties. This peptide was chosen as a lead peptide for further optimization with non-natural amino acids at the p1 position, since molecular modeling indicated that none of the natural amino acids is able to optimally occupy the p1 pocket. A set of 8 non-proteinogenic amino acids was designed, synthesized and incorporated in the lead peptide (and in two control peptides) and tested for binding to HLA-DQ2. The results indicate that the effect of the incorporation of these non-proteinogenic amino acids depended on the peptide in which they were incorporated and that the maximum increase in binding affinity obtained was approximately 2-fold. Altogether lead sequences were obtained that have a binding affinity for HLA-DQ2 that is 100- to 200-fold higher compared to that of the gluten-derived peptide that has the highest affinity for HLA-DQ2. Such peptides are candidate lead peptides for further optimization. Our results, however, also indicate that in order to obtain further significant increases in binding affinity alternative approaches will have to be explored.},

Elevated levels of anti-endomysium or anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies in a patient with normal intestinal villi are indicative of a developing celiac disease.

   abstract = {During the past 20 years the diagnosis of coeliac disease has improved significantly. However, at the same time the true prevalence of the condition has doubled, involving more than 2% of the population in some countries. Due to mild or atypical symptoms, the diagnosis remains a challenge for the health care system. Highly sensitive and specific serum endomysial and transglutaminase-2 antibody tests are helpful in identifying patients for diagnostic endoscopy and small-bowel biopsy. The diagnosis of the disease is still based on the demonstration of gluten-induced small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia. However, coeliac disease may manifest itself before the development of the overt small-intestinal lesion. Positive endomysial and transglutaminase antibodies in patients with normal small-bowel mucosal villous architecture may indicate early stage coeliac disease. Currently, the only effective treatment for the condition is a life-long strict gluten-free diet. Long-term regular follow-up of patients is recommended in order to maintain good adherence to the diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: We have shown earlier that consumption of moderate amount of oats improve intakes of vitamin B(1), fiber, magnesium and iron in celiac patients using gluten-free diet (GFD). The objective of this study was to clarify the effect of high amount of both kilned and unkilned oats on food and nutrient intakes in celiac patients in remission. Kilning as an industrial heating process is performed to preserve the main properties of oats and to lengthen its useableness. Kilning may, however, change the protein structure of oats and therefore influence on the intake of nutrients. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study group consisted of 13 men and 18 women with celiac disease in remission. The patients who were earlier using moderate amount of oats as part of their GFD were randomized to consume kilned or unkilned oats. After 6 months, the patients changed the treatment groups. The goal of daily intake of oats was 100 g. Food records and frequency questionnaire were used to follow nutrient intakes. RESULTS: Type of oats did not affect the amount of oats used. In the group using kilned oats, the intake of vitamin B1 and magnesium and in the group of unkilned oats that of magnesium and zinc increased significantly during the first 6 months (P<or=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: :Large amounts of oats, both kilned and unkilned in GFD, can increase intakes of nutrients in celiac patients in remission. Oats improve the nutritional value of GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adverse pregnancy outcomes have been associated with maternal celiac disease (CD). In this study, we investigate the effect of treated and untreated maternal CD on infant birthweight and preterm birth. METHODS: A population-based cohort study consisted of all singleton live births in Denmark between 1 January 1979 and 31 December 2004 was used. A total of 1,504,342 babies were born to 836,241 mothers during the study period. Of those, 1105 babies were born to women with diagnosed CD and 346 were born to women with undiagnosed CD. Women with diagnosed CD were considered as treated with a gluten free diet while women with undiagnosed CD were considered as untreated. The outcome measures were: birthweight, small for gestational age (SGA: birthweight <10th centile), very small for gestational age (VSGA: birthweight <5th centile) and preterm birth. We compared these measures in treated and untreated women with those of a reference group (no history of CD). RESULTS: Women with untreated CD delivered smaller babies [difference = -98 g (95% CI: -130, -67)], with a higher risk of SGA infants [OR = 1.31 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.63)], VSGA infants [OR = 1.54 (95% CI: 1.17, 2.03)] and preterm birth [OR = 1.33 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.72)] compared with women without CD. Women with treated CD had no increased risk of reduced mean birthweight, risk of delivering SGA and VSGA infants or preterm birth compared with women without CD. CONCLUSION: Untreated maternal CD increases the risk of reduced birthweight, the risk of delivering SGA and VSGA infants and preterm birth. Diagnosis and presumed treatment of maternal CD with a gluten-free diet appeared to result in a birthweight and preterm birth rate similar to those in women without CD.},

We compared the offspring of men without CD (n = 1 472 352) and offspring of those with CD [untreated (n = 138) and treated (n = 473)]. There was no significant association between untreated CD in the father and birthweight (adjusted mean difference = -3 g; [95% CI -46, 40]) or preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.86, [95% CI 0.53, 1.37]) (compared with no CD).

A 28-year-old woman presented with diarrhea, oral ulcers, and refractory uveitis of 2.5-years duration. She was treated with prednisone, mydriatic drops, and infliximab with no response. She was referred to our hospital at which point her previous diagnosis of uveitis was confirmed; she was also diagnosed with right-sided sacro-iliitis. The patient did not have arthritis or any skin conditions. Three tests for fecal parasites and a fecal leukocyte were negative. Endoscopy revealed atrophic appearance of the duodenal mucosa. Biopsy showed atrophy of the duodenal villi with intra-epithelial lymphocytes, hyperplasia of the crypts, and chronic inflammatory infiltrate. The search for antiendomysial antibody was >1/1,280. The patient was started on a gluten-free diet and after 3 months demonstrated significant improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and uveitis, as well as a reduction of antiendomysial antibodies (1/80). After 6 months, there was complete remission of gastrointestinal symptoms and total control of uveitis. The antiendomysial antibody was negative at that time. Clinical uveitis as a manifestation of celiac disease has been described in only two cases in the literature. This case study is the third to demonstrate that uveitis is a clinical symptom that can be addressed in patients with celiac disease.},

A 21-year-old woman and 11-year-old brother who had been diagnosed as PS at the age of 18 and 8, respectively, were admitted to our hospital with the complaints of chronic diarrhea while using exogenous pancreas enzymes. Diarrhea was present in both for a long time and attributed to existing PS. Endoscopic and laboratory examinations revealed celiac disease (CD). After gluten-free diet, their symptoms were resolved. Detailed family investigation revealed that parents and the sister of the siblings were free of both PS and CD. To our knowledge, there has been no previous report of the presence of these 2 disorders, PS and CD, in the same patient. CD should be screened and treated appropriately in cases with PS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunity to food antigens (gliadin, cow's milk proteins) is in the centre of the attention of modern medicine focused on the prevention of diseases, prevention which is based on the use of appropriate restriction diet. Detection of the enhanced levels of the immune reactions to antigen(s) present in food is from this point of view of great importance because there are reports that some of health disturbances, like celiac disease (CD) and some premalignant conditions, like monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), were vanished after the appropriate restriction diets. It is well known that gliadin is toxic to small bowel mucosa of relatively small population of genetically predisposed individuals, who under this toxic action develop celiac disease (CD). As the quantity of immunogenic gliadin could vary between different wheat species, the first aim of this work was to determine the percentage of immunogenic gliadin in ten bread wheat cultivars and in three commercially grown durum wheat cultivars. The second part of the study was initiated by results of previous publication, reporting that sera of some of multiple myeloma (MM) patients showed the presence of elevated levels of anti-gliadin IgA, without the enhanced levels of anti-gliadin IgG antibodies, determined with commercial ELISA test. It was designed to assess is it possible to reveal is there any hidden, especially anti-gliadin IgG immunoreactivity, in serum of mentioned group of patients. For this purpose we tested MM patients sera, as well as celiac disease (CD) patients sera for the immunoreaction with the native gliadin isolated from wheat species used for bread and pasta making in corresponding geographic region. RESULTS: Gliadin was isolated from wheat flour by two step 60% ehanolic extraction. Its content was determined by commercial R5 Mendez Elisa using PWG gliadin as the standard. Results obtained showed that immunogenic gliadin content varies between 50.4 and 65.4 mg/g in bread wheat cultivars and between 20 and 25.6 mg/g in durum wheat cultivars. Anti-gliadin IgA and IgG immunoreactivity of patients' sera in (IU/ml) was firstly determined by commercial diagnostic Binding Site ELISA test, and then additionally by non-commercial ELISA tests, using standardized ethanol wheat extracts -gliadin as the antigen. In both patients groups IgA immunoreactivity to gliadin from different cultivars was almost homogenous and in correlation with results from commercial test (except for one patient with IgA(lambda) myeloma, they were more then five times higher). But, results for IgG immunoreactivity were more frequently inhomogeneous, and especially for few MM patients, they were more then five times higher and did not correlate with results obtained using Binding Site test. CONCLUSION: Results obtained showed different content of immunogenic gliadin epitopes in various species of wheat. They also point for new effort to elucidate is there a need to develop new standard antigen, the representative mixture of gliadin isolated from local wheat species used for bread production in corresponding geographic region for ELISA diagnostic tests.},

The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Celiac disease in patients with IBS fulfilling ROME III criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who fulfilled ROME III criteria for irritable bowel syndrome were screened for Celiac disease using the Biocard(TM) Celiac Disease Stick test, and patients who tested positive had their serum samples analyzed for antigliadin IgA and IgG, and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies. Patients with detectable antibody levels underwent endoscopic duodenal biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of Celiac disease. RESULTS: Two of 100 patients who were diagnosed as having irritable bowel syndrome as per the Roma III criteria were found to have elevated levels of serum antigliadin IgA and IgG, and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies, with histological evidence of Celiac disease on examination of duodenal biopsy. Both patients were started on a gluten-free diet, showing significant improvement in their symptoms on follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is a common finding among patients labeled as IBS. Celiac disease must be considered in differential diagnosis of IBS especially in the therapy refractory group.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is caused by dietary gluten, triggering a chronic inflammation of the small intestine in genetically predisposed individuals. Recently, a risk locus on chromosome 2q11-q12, harbouring interleukin 18 receptor accessory protein (IL18RAP) and three other genes, was suggested for coeliac disease. IL18 has been shown to play an important role in T helper type 1 activity in coeliac disease, making this locus a highly interesting candidate. In this study, two previously indicated risk variants at the IL18RAP locus (rs13015714 and rs917997) were tested for genetic association in 1638 cases with coeliac disease and 1385 control individuals from the Finnish, Hungarian and Italian populations. The protein expression level of IL18RAP was also compared between risk allele carriers and non-carriers by Western blotting. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis was performed to study IL18RAP protein expression in small intestinal biopsies of untreated and treated coeliac patients and controls. We confirmed genetic association and dose effects of variants at the 2q12.1 locus with coeliac disease in the Hungarian population. The GA haplotype of the markers rs13015714 and rs917997 showed the strongest association (P = 0.0001, odds ratio = 1.475, 95% confidence interval 1.21-1.80). Two putative isoforms of IL18RAP were detected and the ratios and total levels of these isoforms may contribute to the aetiology of coeliac disease. Our study supports IL18RAP as a novel predisposing gene for coeliac disease and highlights the need for further functional studies on this relatively unknown gene in coeliac disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a chronic inflammation of the small intestine, arising in genetically predisposed individuals as a result of ingestion of dietary gluten. The only confirmed and functionally characterised genetic risk factors for celiac disease are the DQ2 or DQ8 heterodimers at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II locus (CELIAC1). These genes are necessary but alone not sufficient for disease onset. Genome-wide linkage scans have suggested chromosome 5q31-q33 (CELIAC2) as an important risk locus for celiac disease. This region has also been associated to other inflammatory disorders, although as yet, no clear gene associations have been found. In the current study, 11 celiac disease candidate loci were screened for genetic linkage in the Hungarian population. As the CELIAC2 locus showed the strongest evidence for linkage, this locus was selected for follow-up. Seventeen candidate genes were selected from the CELIAC2 locus, and genotyped using 48 haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in large Finnish and Hungarian family materials. A subset of these, 40 tagging SNPs in 15 genes, were genotyped in an independent set of Finnish and Hungarian cases and controls. We confirmed linkage of this region with celiac disease and report strong linkage in both the Finnish and Hungarian populations. The association analysis showed modest associations throughout the whole region. These association findings were not replicated in the case-control datasets. Our study strongly supports the role of the CELIAC2 locus in celiac disease, but it also highlights the need for a more powerful study design in the region, to locate the true disease risk variants.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of celiac disease may be problematic in that small-bowel villous atrophy sometimes occurs in conjunction with other enteropathies, develops gradually and may be patchy. Furthermore, as the often compromised quality of biopsy specimens renders diagnosis difficult, new diagnostic tools are warranted. GOALS: As the celiac disease-specific autoantibodies are found deposited at their production site, in the small-bowel mucosa, they may be useful in diagnostics, especially in problematic cases. We therefore systematically assessed the occurrence of celiac-specific autoantibody deposits in a large cohort of celiac patients, and established how IgA deposits decline after initiation of a gluten-free diet. METHODS: Transglutaminase-2 specific mucosal IgA autoantibody deposits were determined from small-bowel mucosal biopsies in 261 untreated, 71 short-term (1 y), and 105 long-term (2 to 41 y) treated celiac disease patients and in 78 nonceliac controls. The presence of the deposits was compared with celiac serology, mucosal villous morphology and density of intraepithelial lymphocytes. RESULTS: All untreated celiac disease patients had mucosal autoantibody deposits and their intensity was moderate or strong in 90% of cases. In contrast, 18% of the controls had weak depositions. During a gluten-free diet the intensity of the deposits diminished, but was still faintly positive in 56% of long-term treated celiac patients. The efficiency of the test in determining mucosal autoantibody deposits was superior to serology and inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: Mucosal transglutaminase-2 specific autoantibody deposits proved to be accurate gluten-dependent markers of celiac disease and would thus be of value in the diagnostics and dietary monitoring of this disorder.},

Small-bowel villous atrophy occurs in other enteropathies and non-responsive patients are often seronegative. We investigated whether small-bowel mucosal transglutaminase-2 specific autoantibody deposits distinguish non-responsive coeliac disease from other enteropathies. METHODS: Small-bowel mucosal autoantibody deposits were determined in 27 non-responsive, 28 responsive coeliac patients and 10 controls with other enteropathies. Of the non-responsive coeliac patients six were adhering poorly and 21 strictly to the diet; six of the 21 had enteropathy-associated lymphoma, five refractory coeliac disease and 10 otherwise persistent villous atrophy. The presence of mucosal autoantibody deposits was compared to serology, villous morphology, densities of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and markers of refractory coeliac disease. RESULTS: Twenty out of 21 well-adhering, all six poorly adhering non-responsive and all 28 untreated responsive coeliac patients had small-bowel mucosal autoantibody deposits present, while controls with other enteropathies were negative. Small-bowel mucosal autoantibody deposits were more accurate in detecting coeliac disease than serology or IEL densities. Refractory coeliac markers revealed only cases with the most severe condition. CONCLUSIONS: Small-bowel mucosal autoantibody deposits differentiate coeliac disease from other enteropathies, enabling the design of appropriate therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A gluten-free diet omitting wheat, rye, and barley is the only effective treatment for coeliac disease. The necessity of excluding oats from the diet has remained controversial. We studied the toxicity of oats in children with coeliac disease during a 2-year follow-up by investigating jejunal transglutaminase 2 (TG2)-targeted IgA-class autoantibody deposits, a potentially more sensitive disease marker than serum antibodies or conventional histology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three coeliac children in remission were randomized to undergo oat or gluten challenge with wheat, rye, barley, and oats. When jejunal histological relapse was evident after gluten challenge, patients excluded wheat, rye, and barley but continued with oats. Mucosal morphology and TG2-targeted autoantibody deposits were studied in jejunal biopsies taken at baseline and after 6 and 24 months. Furthermore, serum IgA-class TG2 antibodies were measured. RESULTS: At baseline, serum TG2 antibodies were negative in all 23 patients, but 7 of them had minor mucosal deposits. In the oats group, there was no significant change in the intensity of the deposits within 2 years. In contrast, during the gluten challenge, the intensity of the deposits clearly increased and decreased again when wheat, rye, and barley were excluded but consumption of oats was continued; this was in line with serum autoantibodies. The intensity of the mucosal deposits correlated well with both villous morphology and serum autoantibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of oats does not induce TG2 autoantibody production at mucosal level in children with coeliac disease. Measurement of small-intestinal mucosal autoantibody deposits is suitable for monitoring treatment in coeliac patients.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Celiac disease is a multisystem auto-immune disorder and may start at any age in genetically predisposed individuals. OBJECTIVE: To identify associations, complications, and cause of death in Brazilian patients. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-seven patients were studied: 23 adolescents and 134 adults, 79.6% females, 20.4% males, 75.8% at the time of diagnosis and 24.2% on a gluten-free diet, follow-up between 1 and 40 years. The diagnosis of celiac disease was based on histologic findings and the presence of serologic auto-antibodies markers for celiac disease. Specific tests were done according to clinical suspicion of associations. Bone mineral density was determined by dual energy x-rays in 53 patients upon diagnosis. The data regarding associations, complications, and causes of death were obtained by interviews and from the patient's charts. RESULTS: Associations: atopy (22.3%), depression (17.2%), thyroid disorder (15.9%), dermatitis herpetiformis (11.5%), diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 (4.5%) and tumors (4.5%). COMPLICATIONS: Anemia and osteopenia/osteoporosis in all groups; increased number of spontaneous abortion. Four patients (4.5%) died (one from lymphoma, one with diabetes type 1, one from acute meningitis and one due to suicide). CONCLUSIONS: This experience is similar to those described in the world literature. Celiac disease presents the same characteristics independently of the geographic region. We recommend periodic evaluations, from childhood, independent of the duration of the diet. The key is to establish an interval between evaluations.},

METHODS: Three hundred individuals, 206 females (68.7%) and 94 males (31.3%), were submitted to a rapid and easy immunoglobulin-A-class fingertip whole blood point-of-care test in the doctor's office in order to make immediate clinical decisions: 13 healthy controls, 6 with CD suspicion, 46 treated celiacs, 84 relatives of the celiac patients, 69 patients with dyspepsia, 64 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 8 with Crohn's disease and 9 with other causes of diarrhea. RESULTS: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsies was performed in patients with CD suspicion and in individuals with positive test outcome: in 83.3% (5/6) of the patients with CD suspicion, in 100% of the patients that admitted gluten-free diet transgressions (6/6), in 3.8% of first-degree relatives (3/79) and in 2.9% of patients with dyspepsia (2/69). In all these individuals duodenal biopsies confirmed CD (Marsh's histological classification). The studied test showed good correlation with serologic antibodies, endoscopic and histological findings. CONCLUSION: The point-of-care test was as reliable as conventional serological tests in detecting CD cases and in CD diet monitoring.},

OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of ASCA positivity in patients with Crohn's disease and celiac disease in relation to healthy individuals. METHODS: A total of 145 individuals were studied: 36 with Crohn's disease and 52 with celiac disease, that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for both affections, and 57 healthy individuals for control. The celiac patients were divided as follow: group CeD I at diagnosis (n = 34), group CeD II with gluten-free diet compliance (n = 13) and group CeD III with transgressions to the diet (n = 5). ASCA IgA and IgG were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: With statistical significance, ASCA IgA were positive in Crohn's disease, celiac disease at diagnosis and celiac disease with diet transgressions; ASCA IgG in Crohn's disease and in all groups with celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of ASCA in patients with celiac disease allows to suggest that ASCA is not a specific marker for Crohn's disease, but was associated with the inflammation of the small intestine. The increased levels of positive ASCA may be due to genetic factors and increased intestinal permeability.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To establish whether children who are endomysial antibody (EmA) positive and have normal small-bowel mucosal villous morphology are truly gluten-sensitive and may benefit from early treatment with a gluten-free diet. STUDY DESIGN: Children who were EmA positive with normal small-bowel mucosal villi were compared with children who were seropositive with villous atrophy by using several markers of untreated celiac disease. Thereafter, children with normal villous structure either continued on a normal diet or were placed on a gluten-free diet and re-investigated after 1 year. Seventeen children who were seronegative served as control subjects for baseline investigations. RESULTS: Normal villous morphology was noted in 17 children who were EmA positive, and villous atrophy was noted in 42 children who were EmA positive. These children were comparable in all measured variables regardless of the degree of enteropathy, but differed significantly from the seronegative control subjects. During the dietary intervention, in children who were EmA positive with normal villi, the disease was exacerbated in children who continued gluten consumption, whereas in all children who started the gluten-free diet, both the gastrointestinal symptoms and abnormal antibodies disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: The study provided evidence that children who are EmA positive have a celiac-type disorder and benefit from early treatment despite normal mucosal structure, indicating that the diagnostic criteria for celiac disease should be re-evaluated.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of coeliac disease requires small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia. However, patients with endomysial antibodies but structurally normal villi may suffer from a disorder similar to those with villous atrophy. The aim of this study was to evaluate gastrointestinal symptoms, quality of life and bone mineral density in patients with mild enteropathy, and the effect of a gluten-free diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective trial was carried out in 73 adults having endomysial antibodies with normal villous morphology (Marsh I-II; mild enteropathy) or villous atrophy (Marsh III). Gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life were surveyed by means of structured questionnaires and bone mineral density by means of X-ray absorptiometry. Altogether, 110 subjects served as non-coeliac controls. RESULTS: At baseline, patients with mild enteropathy evinced more gastrointestinal symptoms than non-coeliac controls, but there were no significant differences in quality of life between the groups. After 1 year on a gluten-free diet, indigestion and depression were significantly alleviated in the mild enteropathy group. Osteoporosis or osteopenia was detected in 58% of subjects in the mild enteropathy group and there was a trend towards improved bone mineral density after the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Endomysial antibody-positive patients with normal villous structure may suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms and have poor bone health. Furthermore, they benefit from a gluten-free diet similar to those with overt villous atrophy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The diagnostic criteria for celiac disease require small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia (Marsh III). However, mucosal damage develops gradually and patients may evince clinical symptoms before histologic changes appear. Endomysial antibodies are specific in predicting forthcoming villous atrophy. We hypothesized that patients with mild enteropathy but positive endomysial antibodies benefit from a gluten-free diet (GFD) similarly to patients with more severe enteropathy. METHODS: Small-bowel endoscopy together with clinical evaluations was performed in all together 70 consecutive adults with positive endomysial antibodies. Of these, 23 had only mild enteropathy (Marsh I-II) and they were randomized either to continue on a gluten-containing diet or start a GFD. After 1 year, clinical, serologic, and histologic evaluations were repeated. A total of 47 participants had small-bowel mucosal lesions compatible with celiac disease (Marsh III), and these served as disease controls. RESULTS: In the gluten-containing diet group (Marsh I-II) the small-bowel mucosal villous architecture deteriorated in all participants, and the symptoms and abnormal antibody titers persisted. In contrast, in the GFD group (Marsh I-II) the symptoms were alleviated, antibody titers decreased, and mucosal inflammation diminished equally to celiac controls (Marsh III). When the trial was completed, all participants chose to continue on a life-long GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with endomysial antibodies benefit from a GFD regardless of the degree of enteropathy. The diagnostic criteria for celiac disease need re-evaluation: endomysial antibody positivity without atrophy belongs to the spectrum of genetic gluten intolerance, and warrants dietary treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small bowel induced in genetically susceptible subjects by gluten ingestion. Diarrhoea, weight loss and malabsorption represent the major clinical presentation of the disease. Here we examined the possible alteration in the expression and localization of water channels [AQPs (aquaporins)] and some solute transporters in duodenal mucosa of celiac disease patients. Duodenal biopsies from untreated celiacs, treated celiacs, healthy controls and disease controls were considered in the present study. The expressions of some AQPs and transporter mRNAs in human duodenal biopsies were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (reverse transcription PCR) and real-time RT-PCR. The localization of AQPs 3, 7 and 10 and of SGLT1 (Na+/glucose co-transporter 1), PEPT1 (H+/oligopeptide transporter 1) and NHE3 (Na+/H+ exchanger 3) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: AQPs 3, 7, 10 and 11, SGLT, PEPT and NHE, CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) and NKCC (Na-K-2Cl co-transporter) mRNAs were expressed in duodenal biopsies of healthy controls, treated celiac patients and disease controls. The expression of transcripts was virtually absent in duodenal biopsies of untreated celiac disease patients except for CFTR and NKCC. In healthy controls, immunohistochemistry revealed a labelling in the apical membrane of surface epithelial cells of the duodenum. The immunolabelling was heavily reduced or absent in untreated celiac patients, while it was normal in patients consuming a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the main routes for water and solute absorption are deficient in celiac disease and may play a role in the onset of malabsorption symptoms.},

   abstract = {Various mechanisms detect the presence of dietary triacylglycerols (TAG) in the digestive tract and link TAG ingestion to the regulation of energy homeostasis. We here propose a novel sensing mechanism with the potential to encode dietary TAG-derived energy by translating enterocyte fatty acid oxidation (FAO) into vagal afferent signals controlling eating. Peripheral FAO has long been implicated in the control of eating (141). The prevailing view was that mercaptoacetate (MA) and other FAO inhibitors stimulate eating by modulating vagal afferent signaling from the liver. This concept has been challenged because hepatic parenchymal vagal afferent innervation is scarce and because experimentally induced changes in hepatic FAO often fail to affect eating. Nevertheless, intraperitoneally administered MA acts in the abdomen to stimulate eating because this effect was blocked by subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (21), a surgical technique that eliminates all vagal afferents from the upper gut. These and other data support a role of the small intestine rather than the liver as a FAO sensor that can influence eating. After intrajejunal infusions, MA also stimulated eating in rats through vagal afferent signaling, and after infusion into the superior mesenteric artery, MA increased the activity of celiac vagal afferent fibers originating in the proximal small intestine. Also, pharmacological interference with TAG synthesis targeting the small intestine induced a metabolic profile indicative of increased FAO and inhibited eating in rats on a high-fat diet but not on chow. Finally, cell culture studies indicate that enterocytes oxidize fatty acids, which can be modified pharmacologically. Thus enterocytes may sense dietary TAG-derived fatty acids via FAO and influence eating through changes in intestinal vagal afferent activity. Further studies are necessary to identify the link between enterocyte FAO and vagal afferents and to examine the specificity and potential physiological relevance of such a mechanism.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Expected benefits of gluten-free diet (GFD) in coeliac patients include healing of small intestinal mucosa, but it remains unclear to what extent this benefit is achieved in adults. AIM: To assess factors affecting histological outcome of GFD in a large cohort of adult coeliac patients. METHODS: We extracted information on 465 consecutive coeliac patients studied before and during GFD. RESULTS: Duodenal biopsies at diagnosis were classified as Marsh I in 11, II in 25 and III in 429 cases. After a median 16 months GFD, 38 (8%) patients had histological 'normalization', 300 (65%) had 'remission' with persistent intraepithelial lymphocytosis, 121(26%) had 'no change' and 6 (1%) had 'deterioration'. Coeliac disease related serology was negative in 83% of patients with Marsh III lesion during GFD. Male gender and adherence to GFD were independently associated with histological 'normalization' and 'remission'. Persistence of intraepithelial lymphocytosis was not associated with human lymphocyte antigen gene dose or with Helicobacter pylori infection. CONCLUSIONS: Complete normalization of duodenal lesions is exceptionally rare in adult coeliac patients despite adherence to GFD, symptoms disappearance and negative CD related serology. Control biopsies are mandatory to identify lack of response to gluten-free diet.},

This study evaluates the influence of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on bacterial adhesion and their contribution in the gliadins-induced inflammatory response. The adhesion of potential probiotic (Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 and Bifidobacterium bifidum CECT 7365), commensal (Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis) and pathogenic (Salmonella enterica CECT 443 and Listeria monocytogenes CECT 935) bacteria to mucin and Caco-2 cell cultures was determined. Gliadins were subjected to in vitro digestion (pepsin/pancreatin-bile), with/out GAGs, and the presence or not of cell suspensions of B. longum (10(8) CFU/ml). B. longum, E. coli, and L. monocytogenes, markedly interact with the high-sulphur-containing fraction of GAGs. The GAGs reduced the gliadins-mediated production of interleukin-1beta, but not tumour necrosis factor-alpha. The results suggest that GAGs may ameliorate gliadin-induced inflammatory response, though they also slightly interfere with the action of B. longum.},

Presence of more than two autoimmune diseases in one patient is known as multiple autoimmune syndrome (MAS). We report the case of an 11 years old girl who presented with history of swelling in front of the neck along with constipation, anorexia, weight gain and increasing pallor over a period of six months. Additionally she had an episodic history of joint pains and abdominal pain with no specific relation to diet, time, other gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptom. Hypothyroid goiter (Autoimmune thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroidits) was diagnosed by raised thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), low T4 and presence of thyroid specific antibodies in blood. Patient was discharged on tablet Levothyroxine to which she responded well with reduction in size of the swelling and relief of the symptoms except for the joint pains and abdominal pain. To evaluate the persistent symptoms she was investigated further for other autoimmune diseases and was diagnosed to be having systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Coeliac disease also. The final diagnosis was multiple autoimmune syndrome (Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Coeliac disease and SLE).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The only treatment for coeliac disease is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. Several studies have reported nutritional deficiencies in individuals on a gluten-free diet. The present study aimed to determine whether the nutritional profile of gluten-free diet could be improved through the use of alternative grains. METHODS: A retrospective review of diet history records by a celiac specialist dietitian were used to establish a 'standard' gluten-free dietary pattern. An 'alternative' gluten-free dietary pattern was developed that substituted naturally gluten-free grains or gluten-free products made from 'alternative' flours (oats, high fibre gluten-free bread and quinoa) in the standard pattern. A paired t-test was performed to identify statistical significance between the 'alternative' and standard gluten-free dietary pattern. RESULTS: Analysis of standard pattern indicated that 38% of meals and snacks contained no grain or starch choice. Of those meals that contained a grain or starch component, rice was the grain chosen 44% of the time. The inclusion of alternative grains or grain products provided a higher nutrient profile compared to the standard gluten-free dietary pattern (P = 0.002). Several nutrients; protein (20.6 g versus 11 g), iron (18.4 mg versus 1.4 mg), calcium (182 mg versus 0 mg) and fibre (12.7 g versus 5 g) were significantly increased by changing the grain or starch component in the dietary pattern. The B vitamin content (riboflavin, niacin and folate) was improved, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.125). DISCUSSION: The inclusion of alternative grain-based products increased the nutrient profile of the gluten-free dietary pattern significantly.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although the incidence of celiac disease (CD) is increasing, studies have been hampered by the lack of validated outcome measures. We sought to create a disease-specific Celiac Symptom Index (CSI) to reliably assess relevant symptoms. METHODS: A 36-item questionnaire was created after design by an expert committee and review/revision by patient focus groups. The survey, covering domains of CD-related symptoms and general health, was initially administered to 154 individuals with biopsy-proven CD; immunoglobulin (Ig)A tissue transglutaminase titers were determined, and gluten-free diet adherence was evaluated by a dietitian. The questionnaire was then revised to exclude questions with poor test characteristics and administered to a second, independent group of 52 individuals, to ensure validity. RESULTS: The subscales of "specific symptoms" and "general health" had excellent psychometric qualities that consisted of 11 and 5 items, respectively. The additive score based on these items was correlated with current general health, as measured by a visual analog scale and short form 36 general health subscale (P < or = .001 for both), as well as degree of adherence to the gluten-free diet (P = .008), lending external validity to the CSI. The resulting 16 questions make up the first CD-specific symptom index. CONCLUSIONS: The CSI allows for disease-specific monitoring of symptoms as an independent outcome measure or as part of a surrogate for disease activity in individuals with CD. The CSI might be an important tool for future clinical CD research.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is an increasingly prevalent disorder. To monitor response to treatment in clinical and research settings, it is essential to accurately measure gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence in a standardized manner. The aim of this study was to develop a valid and reliable Celiac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT). METHODS: Items and domains believed to be essential for successful GFD adherence were used to develop an 85-item survey with input from patient focus groups. The survey was administered to 200 individuals with biopsy-proven celiac disease who underwent standardized dietician evaluation (SDE) and serologic testing. RESULTS: Of the initial 85 items, 41 were correlated highly with the SDE (P < .01). Responses for all 200 participants for the 41 items were entered into a single database. Computer-generated randomization produced a derivation cohort of 120 subjects and a validation cohort of 80. By using the derivation cohort, a 7-item questionnaire was developed using logistic regression. The additive score based on these items was correlated highly with the SDE in both the derivation and validation cohorts (P < .001) and performed significantly better than immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase titers in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis with areas under the curve of 0.830 and 0.652, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The CDAT is a clinically relevant, easily administered, 7-item instrument that allows for standardized evaluation of GFD adherence and is superior to tissue transglutaminase serology. The CDAT may be useful in both research and clinical settings.},

The phenotyping of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) is of clinical relevance in the diagnosis of the disease given the characteristic features of elevated CD3+ IELs (alphabeta and gammadelta TcR) and the decrease in CD3- IELs. IEL biomarkers are also useful in the assessment of the response to the gluten-free diet and, importantly, in the diagnosis of the severe complications of celiac disease: refractory celiac disease and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Novel applications of flow cytometry for the detection of anti-transglutaminase antibodies (a validated biomarker of celiac disease) and of gluten (the triggering antigen of the autoimmune process) are also discussed. The assessment of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers by flow cytometry in celiac disease is performed routinely in a growing number of centers and it is an example of the versatility of this technique and its applicability to the research and clinical study of solid tissues.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition affecting genetically susceptible individuals, characterized by inflammatory damage to the small intestine following ingestion of wheat gluten or barley and rye products. The only life-long treatment is strict gluten-free diet which is difficult personally and socially, affects quality of life, not widely available, more expensive, with lower palatability, resulting in low compliance. No doubt, there is therefore an urgent need for alternative therapeutic modalities. Based on the increasing knowledge on the sequential pathophysiological events driving the intestinal inflammatory cascade, new attractive and potential therapies were starting to immerge: selecting, changing, degrading, manipulating or binding the dietary toxic environmental factors, decreasing intestinal permeability toward gluten or blocking the deamination of gluten by inhibiting tissue transglutaminase or the HLA-DQ presenting groove by carefully designed false peptide, shifting the typical Th1 to Th2 inflammatory reaction or antagonizing major proinflammatory cytokines, enhancing regulatory immune function or developing preventive vaccines, blocking adhesion molecule, inducing gluten oral or intranasal tolerance or applying epithelial repairing mitogens to oppose the mucosal destruction. Safety, effectiveness, cost and affordability are prime issues to consider. Some modalities have shown promising results in vitro. Future will show who will win the race.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Celiac disease (CD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) are distinct disorders with specific clinico-pathological characteristics. Recent reports suggest an association between the 2. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of EE among children diagnosed with CD in our institution in the last 8 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Princess Margaret Hospital in Western Australia is the state's only pediatric referral center and the Department of Anatomic Pathology handles almost all of the pediatric gastrointestinal biopsy specimens. All of the children who had histological confirmation of CD between January 2000 and November 2007 were identified. Among this cohort, those who had concurrent esophageal biopsies performed were obtained and those with histology consistent with EE identified. The slides of all of these cases were reviewed. Case notes of children with CD and EE were reviewed for demographic details, symptoms, endoscopic findings, and follow-up data. RESULTS: Among the total of 250 children diagnosed with CD during the study period, 121 had concurrent esophageal biopsies. Ten children had histological findings consistent with EE, although only 7 had endoscopic findings suggestive of EE. Median eosinophil count in these esophageal biopsies was 52 per high power field (range 23-80). Four children had follow-up endoscopies and all 4 demonstrated recovery of duodenal mucosa but persistent esophageal eosinophilia on gluten-free diet. In 3 children resolution of EE occurred after specific treatment of EE. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of EE in this cohort of children with CD is at least 4%. This is likely to be an underestimation because only 121 of 250 children had concurrent esophageal biopsies. Coexistent EE should be kept in mind in children undergoing endoscopy for suspected CD, and esophageal biopsies should be obtained, irrespective of whether esophageal mucosa appears normal or abnormal at endoscopy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recently, several publications in adults have shown an increased incidence of non-Helicobacter pylori (HP), non-non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) peptic disease (PD). There are only a few case reports linking celiac disease (CD) to PD. We therefore aimed to review our experience of CD presenting with PD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all the endoscopies performed for children and young adults diagnosed with CD between 1 January, 2004 and 31 October, 2008. The diagnosis of CD was based on accepted guidelines. Patients with a doubtful diagnosis of CD were excluded. RESULTS: We had 240 patients with the diagnosis of CD. We had 29 (12.0%) patients [15 males (52%), 14 females (48%)] for whom the diagnosis of PD was ascertained. The age range was 1-50 years (mean 16.9 +/- 12.1 years). Twenty-three of the 29 patients (79%) were HP-negative. Duodenal PD was noted in 22 patients (76%) and 16 (73%) were HP-negative. Gastric PD was noted in eight patients (28%) and 7 (87%) were HP-negative. The PD group was significantly older at diagnosis (p < 0.001) compared to the whole CD group. CONCLUSIONS: PD is not uncommon in the presentation of CD. It is more likely to be found in the second decade of life. CD should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with non-HP PD and we suggest routine CD serology and small bowel biopsy in patients with unexplained PD.},

   abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that untreated coeliac disease is associated with lower total cholesterol than in the general population while the effect of treatment with a gluten-free diet on the cholesterol profile of clinically apparent coeliac disease is not known. We measured the cholesterol profile at diagnosis, and compared this with Health Survey for England figures, and again following 12 months treatment with a gluten-free diet in 100 consecutive adults with coeliac disease attending the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK. The mean total cholesterol was 4.84 (SD 1.2) mmol/l in adults (mean age 51 (SD 16) years) newly diagnosed with coeliac disease. At diagnosis of coeliac disease, men had 21% lower and women had 9% lower mean total cholesterol in comparison to the general population (difference in age-adjusted mean total cholesterol -1.09 mmol/l (95% CI -0.97, - 1.21); -0.46 mmol/l (95% CI -0.24, -0.68), respectively). There was no change in mean total cholesterol following treatment. However, there was a small but statistically significant increase of 0.12 mmol/l (95% CI 0.05, 0.18) in the mean HDL-cholesterol. Total cholesterol was lower at diagnosis in coeliac patients than in the general population and did not increase with 1 year of a gluten-free diet while HDL-cholesterol increased following treatment. Any increase in risk of IHD or stroke in people with coeliac disease is unlikely due to an adverse cholesterol profile either before diagnosis or after treatment with a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an autoimmune-mediated disorder with both innate and adaptive immune components. The disease is triggered by dietary gluten, which provokes the development of a massive immune reaction leading to the destruction of the small-intestinal mucosal morphology and intestinal dysfunction. Besides the typical small-bowel symptoms extraintestinal manifestations may also arise in a subset of coeliac disease patients. In addition, gluten evokes the production of antibodies mainly targeting deamidated gluten peptides or transglutaminase 2. Although coeliac disease has traditionally been regarded as a T cell-mediated disorder, this review discusses the role of the gluten-induced disease-specific anti-transglutaminase 2-autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of the disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease comprises intolerance against dietary gluten present in wheat, rye and barley, and it belongs to the most common food-related life-long disorders in Western countries. Nowadays celiac disease is conceived as an autoimmune-mediated systemic disorder commonly presenting as enteropathy in genetically susceptible individuals. The most obvious feature distinguishing celiac disease from other small-intestinal enteropathies is the presence of autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2 (TG2) during a gluten-containing diet. The gluten-derived gliadin peptides and the self, TG2, have established and well-accepted role in celiac disease pathogenesis. TG2 is known to deamidate, and crosslink gluten-derived gliadin peptides to itself, thereby favoring disease progression. The celiac disease-specific TG2-targeted autoantibodies are deposited in the small-bowel mucosa as well as in other tissues, and interestingly, extraintestinal manifestations of the disease involving these particular tissues have been reported. As the TG2-targeted autoantibodies have experimentally been shown to modulate the function of different cell types in vitro similarly to what has been reported to occur in untreated celiac disease, they could constitute an important contribution to disease progression. In this review we discuss the role of TG2, the autoantigen and the autoantibodies targeted against it in the pathogenesis of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {In celiac disease, gluten ingestion provokes small-bowel mucosal injury and production of IgA autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2 (TG2). It has been suggested that in celiac patients IgA could mediate the transepithelial passage of gluten peptides in a mechanism involving the transferrin receptor. As IgA1 with galactose-deficient O-linked glycans has elevated affinity for the transferrin receptor, we assessed whether total serum IgA1 and IgA1 anti-TG2 autoantibodies in celiac patients are aberrantly glycosylated. We report that males with celiac disease have higher total serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 than non-celiac males. Furthermore, O-glycans of the disease-specific TG2 IgA1 autoantibodies in celiac patients exhibited elevated galactose deficiency. A gluten-free diet had no effect on the total serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1, whereas the amount of galactose-deficient anti-TG2 IgA1 decreased. Thus, the undergalactosylated IgA1 molecules are not pathognomonic for celiac disease, but galactose deficiency in IgA1 could be an aggravating factor.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To establish the prevalence of headache in children with celiac disease (CD), the response to a gluten-free diet, and the prevalence of CD in children affected by headache. METHODS: This hospital-based study included 2 steps. In the retrospective part, 354 children with CD answered a questionnaire investigating the presence of headache before and after the gluten-free diet. The same questionnaire was administered to 200 healthy children matched for sex and age. In the prospective part, 79 children affected by headache were screened for CD by antitransglutaminase IgA. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by duodenal biopsy; before starting a gluten-free diet patients underwent a brain positron emission tomography study. After 6 months of follow-up children were reevaluated for the presence of headache. RESULTS: Overall, 88 patients with CD complained of headaches before the diagnosis of CD as compared with 16 in the control group (24.8% vs 8%, P < 0.001). After the institution of a gluten-free diet, the headaches significantly improved in 68 children (77.3%), of whom 24 (27.3%) were headache-free during the study period. Four of 79 (5%) headache patients were found to have CD compared with 0.6% of the general population (P = 0.005). The brain positron emission tomography studies did not show any anomalies. During the follow-up, headaches improved in all 4 children with CD. CONCLUSIONS: We recorded -- in our geographical area -- a high frequency of headaches in patients with CD and vice versa with a beneficial effect of a gluten-free diet. Screening for CD could be advised in the diagnostic work-up of patients with headache.},

   abstract = {AIM: The aim of this article was to review and conduct a meta-analysis of the paediatric literature on the neurology of coeliac disease. METHOD: We conducted a review of paediatric studies published in English assessing neurological illness in coeliac disease identified through a MEDLINE search (1950-2009). Calculation of computed relative risk, odds ratio, and risk difference was performed using the fixed effect method if applicable. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were analysed (11 772 participants). The meta-analysis showed that (1) the relative risk of epilepsy in individuals with coeliac disease, and of coeliac disease in individuals with epilepsy, compared with the general population, was 2.1 and 1.7, respectively, and the risk difference was close to zero, indicating that it was probably a chance association; and (2) the relative risk of headache in individuals with the disease compared with comparison groups was 3.2. In two studies, cerebellar ataxia was documented in 2.7 to 5.4% of participants; in two further studies, the risk of cerebellar dysfunction was zero. Two studies found an association between coeliac disease and peripheral neuropathy. Brain white matter lesions were recorded in two other studies. An association between autism and coeliac disease is disputed. Interpretation Children with coeliac disease are at risk of developing neurological complications, but the risk is lower than in adulthood. The discrepancy might be due to short disease duration, early elimination of gluten from the diet, stricter adherence to diet, or different susceptibility to immune-mediated disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: An aberrant immunophenotype and monoclonality of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are frequently found in refractory coeliac disease (RCD). However, the utility of continual monitoring of IEL immunophenotype and clonality in the surveillance of RCD remains to be studied. DESIGN: The diagnostic and follow-up biopsies from 33 patients with CD, 7 with suspected RCD, 41 with RCD and 20 with enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL) (including 11 evolved from RCD) were investigated by CD3epsilon/CD8 double immunohistochemistry and PCR-based clonality analysis of the rearranged T cell receptor (TCR) genes. RESULTS: An aberrant immunophenotype (CD3epsilon(+)CD8(-) IELs > or =40%) and monoclonality were detected occasionally in CD biopsies, either transiently in patients with CD not compliant with a gluten-free diet or in those who subsequently developed suspected RCD, RCD or EATL. In contrast, the aberrant immunophenotype and monoclonality were found in 30 of 41 (73%) and 24 of 37 (65%) biopsies, respectively, at the time of RCD diagnosis. Among the patients with RCD who did not show these abnormalities in their diagnostic biopsies, 8 of 10 (80%) and 5 of 11 (45%) cases gained an aberrant immunophenotype and monoclonality, respectively, during follow-up. Irrespective of whether detected in diagnostic or follow-up biopsies, persistence of both abnormalities was characteristic of RCD. Importantly, the presence of concurrent persistent monoclonality and aberrant immunophenotype, especially > or =80% CD3epsilon(+)CD8(-) IELs, was a strong predictor of EATL development in patients with RCD (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Continual monitoring of both immunophenotype and clonality of IELs is more important than snapshot analysis for RCD diagnosis and follow-up, and could provide a useful tool for surveillance of patients at risk of EATL.},

   abstract = {Bone loss, described in individual groups of patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1D), autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) or celiac disease (CD) is usually viewed as a complication of these diseases. There is increasing evidence that alterations in the immune system may directly affect bone mass. Clustering of autoimmune diseases in the same individual might predispose to higher risk of osteopenia due to imbalance in immune regulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate bone involvement in clusters of the most common autoimmune diseases (T1D, ATD and CD) in children. The study was performed at a tertiary care center for the care of pediatric diabetes. One-hundred-two patients with T1D alone or associated with ATD and/or CD were studied; 13 patients had cluster of three autoimmune diseases. Amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS) was measured by phalangeal quantitative ultrasound and expressed as standard deviation score (SDS). AD-SoS SDS < -2 was considered indicative of osteopenia. Osteopenia was equally distributed among children with T1D alone (8.1%), T1D associated with ATD (7.7%) or CD (10.3%), while it was 53.8% in patients presenting with three autoimmune diseases. Poor compliance to gluten-free diet increased osteopenia to 18.8% in patients with T1D and CD and 80% in patients with three autoimmune disorders. No difference among groups was found with regard to gluco-metabolic control, calcium metabolism, thyroid function. In conclusion bone impairment in multiple autoimmune diseases might be considered not only a complication due to endocrine or nutritional mechanisms, but also a consequence of an immunoregulatory imbalance. Alterations of homeostatic mechanisms might explain an imbalance of osteoclast activity leading to osteopenia.},

   abstract = {At present times, Continuous Glucose Monitoring is a recommended method to detect glucemia fluctuations in patients who have diabetes, due to the fine correlation between interstitial glucose and capillary glucemia. The objective of this project is obtain a glucose register during a 48 hour period in a group of Type I diabetes patients who have an irregular metabolic control and to evaluate effectiveness of treatment employed, as well as evaluating compliance of the therapeutic norms established for each patient. At the same time, the authors plan to test the usefulness of a graphical register for diabetic education. After applying an anesthetic cream in the lateral umbilical zone, a subcutaneous catheter connected to a GLUCODAY, Menarini Diagnostics glucose sensor is inserted which, by means of a continuous sequence taking measures in interstitial liquid, registers a value every three minutes for as long as this connection is maintained. After a maximum 48 hour period, data are transferred to a computer and by means of the corresponding computer program, a graphic register for each patient is produced. Informed consent has been obtained from each patient. There were 23 patients in this study group, each diagnosed to have Type I diabetes; eight of these patients, two girls and six boys, were pre-puberty aged while 15, six girls and nine boys, were adolescents. Two of the pre-puberty patients had pathological antecedents, in one case celiac and the other thyroid disease. Two of the puberty aged patients had a history of chronic lymphocytic thyroid disease under opo-therapeutic treatment. Individual analysis of each case permits health professionals to detect a series of facts: it is difficult to comply with glucemic objectives in this group of adolescents having diabetes, with insulin treatment installed and researchers detect postprandial hyper-glucemia which do not appear when using capillary glucemias carried out by habitual methods. Study observations manifest a lack of compliance in indicated agreed upon schedules and researchers detect dietary transgressions. Continuous Glucose Monitoring makes it possible to obtain a graphic which can include those incidences which have occurred, facilitate commenting on the errors detected with adolescent patients and permit proposing a series of therapeutic modifications based on concrete, real data. Continuous Glucose Monitoring promises to be a useful tool to educate patients about diabetes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antibody serology is an important tool in the investigation of celiac disease (CD), but does not always correlate with mucosal appearance in the small intestine. Patients with positive CD serology but normal mucosa (Marsh 0) are at increased risk of future CD. In this study we describe a model for identifying and characterizing individuals with normal mucosa but positive CD serology. Such individuals are sometimes referred to as having latent CD. METHODS: The records of ten Swedish pathology departments were used to identify individuals with biopsies indicating normal duodenal/jejunal mucosa. Using the national personal identification number, these data were linked with CD serology data (antigliadin, antiendomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies); and we thereby identified 3,736 individuals with normal mucosa but positive CD serology. Two independent reviewers then manually reviewed their biopsy reports to estimate comorbidity. We also randomly selected 112 individuals for validation through patient chart review. RESULTS: The majority of the 3,736 individuals were females (62%). Children (0-15 years) made up 21.4%. The median number of biopsy specimen was 3. Our review of biopsy reports found that other gastrointestinal comorbidity was rare (inflammatory bowel disease: 0.4%; helicobacter pylori infection: 0.2%). Some 22% individuals selected for patient chart review had a relative with CD. The most common symptoms among these individuals were diarrhea (46%) and abdominal pain (45%), while 26% had anemia. Although 27% of the individuals selected for validation had been informed about gluten-free diet, only 13% were adhering to a gluten-free diet at the end of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Individuals with positive CD serology but normal mucosa often have CD-like symptoms and a family history of CD.},

   abstract = {This study was aimed at monitoring and controlling of body weight in children with diagnosis of celiac disease when established and after introducing gluten-free diet. Prospective clinical study included 42 children with celiac disease whose body weight was measured before introducing gluten-free diet, and after the period of six and 18 months of introducing gluten-free diet. The children were divided into three age groups. The first group consisted of 16 children, 8 females and 8 males in the age from 6 to 18 months, the second group consisted of 14 children, 8 females and 6 males ranging from the age of 20 to 111 months and the third group consisted of 12 children, 6 females and 6 males ranging from the age of 115 to 204 months. The measured body weight was compared with the centile tables of children of the same age. After introducing gluten-free diet the body weight was significantly higher at first, especially at the second control examination in comparison to the centile table of children of the same age and gender When comparing the results at the time of establishing the diagnosis and at the first and second control examination of the body weight of children the results showed no difference concerning gender and the age of children. In conclusion it can be said that is very important to diagnose celiac disease as soon as possible because the introduction of gluten-free diet prevents the pathological conditions mucosal lesion of small intestine and the physical retardation of children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis (AS) is caused mainly due to the increase in the serum lipid, thrombosis, and injuries of the endothelial cells. During aviation, the incremental load of positive acceleration that leads to dramatic stress reactions and hemodynamic changes may predispose pilots to functional disorders and even pathological changes of organs. However, much less is known on the correlation between aviation and AS pathogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 32 rabbits were randomly divided into 4 groups with 8 rabbits in each group. The control group was given a high cholesterol diet but no acceleration exposure, whereas the other 3 experimental groups were treated with a high cholesterol diet and acceleration exposure for 4, 8, and 12 weeks, respectively. In each group, samples of celiac vein blood and the aorta were collected after the last exposure for the measurement of endogenous CO and HO-1 activities, as well as the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). As compared with the control group, the endocardial CO content and the HO-1 activity in aortic endothelial cells were significantly elevated at the 4th, 8th, and 12th weekend, respectively (P < 0.05 or <0.01). And these measures tended upward as the exposure time was prolonged. Levels of TC and LDL-C in the experimental groups were significantly higher than those in the control group, presenting an upward tendency. Levels of TG were found significantly increased in the 8-week-exposure group, but significantly declined in the 12-week-exposure group (still higher than those in the control group). Levels of the HDL-C were increased in the 4-week-exposure group, declined in the 8-week-exposure group, and once more increased in the 12-week-exposure group, without significant differences with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Positive acceleration exposure may lead to a significant increase of endogenous CO content and HO-1 activity and a metabolic disorder of serum lipid in high-cholesterol diet-fed rabbits, which implicates that the acceleration exposure might accelerate the progression of AS.},

   abstract = {There has been growing recognition of a changing clinical presentation of celiac disease (CD), with the manifestation of milder symptoms. Serologic testing is widely used to screen patients with suspected CD and populations at risk. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the clinical presentation of CD in childhood, assess the diagnostic value of serologic tests, and investigate the impact of IgA deficiency on diagnostic accuracy. We evaluated 206 consecutive children with suspected CD on the basis of clinical symptoms and positive serology results. Ninety-four (46%) had biopsy-proven CD. The median age at diagnosis of CD was 6.8 years; 15% of the children were <2 years of age. There was a higher incidence of CD in girls (p = 0.003). Iron deficiency and intestinal complaints were more frequent in children with CD than those without CD (61% vs. 33%, p = 0.0001 and 71% vs. 55%, p = 0.02, respectively), while failure to thrive was less common (35% vs. 53%, p = 0.02). The sensitivity of IgA tissue transglutaminase (IgA-tTG) was 0.98 when including all children and 1.00 after excluding children with selective IgA deficiency. The specificity of IgA-tTG was 0.73 using the recommended cut-off value of 20 IU, and this improved to 0.94 when using a higher cut-off value of 100 IU. All children with CD and relative IgA deficiency (IgA levels that are measurable but below the age reference [n = 8]) had elevated IgA-tTG. In conclusion, CD is frequently diagnosed in school-age children with relatively mild symptoms. The absence of intestinal symptoms does not preclude the diagnosis of CD; many children with CD do not report intestinal symptoms. While the sensitivity of IgA-tTG is excellent, its specificity is insufficient for the diagnostic confirmation of a disease requiring life-long dietary restrictions. Children with negative IgA-tTG and decreased but measurable IgA values are unlikely to have CD.},

   abstract = {The selective CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant is a novel weight control agent. Although CB1 receptors and binding sites are present in both the rodent central and peripheral nervous systems, including the afferent vagus nerve, the role of gut afferents in mediating anorexia following CB1R blockade is still debated. In the present study we examined rimonabant-induced anorexia in male C57BL/6J mice with subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (VGX) as well as in male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to either subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA) alone or in combination with a complete celiac-superior mesenteric ganglionectomy (CGX). Irrespective of the operational procedure, rimonabant (10mg/kg) effectively reduced standard chow as well as palatable diet (ensure) intake. In conclusion, the data clearly demonstrate that neither vagal gut afferents, nor gut afferents traveling via the sympathetic nervous system, are required for rimonabant to inhibit food intake leading to the hypothesis that centrally located CB1 receptors are the prime mediators of rimonabant-induced anorexia.},

The pathologic lesion consists of subepithelial collagen deposition associated with variable alterations in villous architecture. The small bowel biopsies of 12 cases were reviewed. Clinical details, celiac serology, and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement study results, when available, were collated. There were 8 females and 4 males (age ranged from 41 to 84 y) who presented with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. Small intestinal biopsies showed subepithelial collagen deposition with varying degrees of villous atrophy and varying numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Four patients had previous biopsies showing enteropathic changes without collagen deposition. Seven cases were associated with collagenous colitis and 1 also had features of lymphocytic colitis. Three patients also had collagen deposition in gastric biopsies. One case was associated with lymphocytic gastritis. Celiac disease (CD, gluten-sensitive enteropathy) was documented in 4 patients. Five patients made a clinical improvement with combinations of a gluten-free diet and immunosuppressive therapy. Two patients died of complications of malnutrition and 1 of another illness. Clonal T-cell populations were identified in 5 of 6 cases tested. Four of these patients improved clinically after treatment but 1 has died. Collagenous sprue evolved on a background of CD in 4 cases. There was no history of CD in others and these cases may be the result of a biologic insult other than gluten sensitivity. None has developed clinical evidence of lymphoma to date.},

In 19 patients, endoscopy videos were reported as normal in ten (53%) case, as having mild changes in three (16%) cases, and as having moderate-severe changes in six (31%) cases. Two (11%) had acute ulcers. No small bowel tumors were seen. Endoscopy demonstrated concordance with histological changes in 14 of the 18 patients with histology available (78% concordance). The kappa statistic suggested a substantial degree of concordance between histology and endoscopic findings. Endoscopy with distal duodenal biopsies is superior to VCE in detecting proximal, nonresponsive celiac disease, but more distal lesions may be missed such that the strength of VCE lies in its ability to visualize the entire small bowel.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is an inflammatory disease of the upper small intestine and results from gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals, and is the only life-long nutrient-induced enteropathy. The only treatment is a strict gluten-free diet and the longer the individual fails to adhere to this diet, the greater the chance of developing malnutrition and other complications. The existence of reliable gluten free food is crucial to the well-being of the population. Here we report on a microfluorimeter device for the in situ detection of gliadin in foodstuffs, which could be used for a rapid control of raw materials in food processing, as well as for process control of gliadin contamination. The microfluorimeter is based on a reflector that is used inside a microfluidic chip, exploiting various strategically placed reflective or totally metallised mirrors for efficient collection of the fluorescent light emitted in a large solid angle. The chip is capable of executing five assays in parallel and has been demonstrated to possess detection sensitivity applicable to fluoroimmunoassays. Various immunoassay formats exploiting fluorescence detection, using enzyme/fluorophore labels were developed and compared in terms of sensitivity, ease of assay, assay time and compatibility with buffer used to extract gliadin from raw and cooked foodstuffs, with the best performance observed with an indirect competition assay using a fluorophore-labelled anti-mouse antibody. This assay was exploited within the microfluorimeter device, and a very low detection limit of 4.1 ng/mL was obtained. The system was observed to be highly reproducible, with an RSD of 5.9%, for a concentration of 50 ng/mL of gliadin applied to each of the five channels of the microfluorimeter. Biofunctionalised disposable strips incorporated into the microfluorimeter were subjected to accelerated Arrhenius thermal stability studies and it was demonstrated that strips pre-coated with gliadin could be stored for approximately 2 years at 4 degrees C, with no discernable loss in sensitivity or detectability of the assay. Finally, the microfluorimeter was applied to the analysis of commercial gluten-free food samples, and an excellent correlation with routine ELISA measurements was obtained. The developed microfluorimeter should find widespread application for on-site execution of fluoroimmunoassays.},

It has been suggested that the determination of antiendomysial antibody (AEA) and tissue transglutaminase (t-TG) should be performed by doctors in the first-contact medical facilities. In diagnosed patients, and especially in paediatric practice, it the values of autoantibodies regarding the adherence to a gluten-free diet should be monitored. After reaching the adulthood, patients should be entrusted to the care of gastroenterologists. Biopsy of duodenum samples remains the golden standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease. Every histological examination of a duodenum sample must be completed by histological grading in accordance to Marsh-Oberhuber. Histochemical investigation should be an inseparable part of the malabsorption diagnostics in biopsy. In controversial biopsies, such as a biopsy with minimal or mild pathological changes, application of antibodies to the intraepithelial lymphocytes is recommended. It is also useful to perform electron-microscopy of duodenum samples as well, when repeated biopsies are negative, but the patient's troubles persist (Ref. 32).},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is diagnosed in children as well as adults. For long now, this has not been a rare diagnosis. Publications by local authors have warned, as early as 1990s, that this disease is extremely under-diagnosed, as confirmed by current clinical practice. Despite this, it is evident that the prevalence ofthis disease in Slovakia and the Czech Republic is high. Currently, it is assumed that the traditional symptomatic form of the disease represents just a fraction of the overall prevalence. As a consequence to the gradual introduction of the disease screening and the efforts of the medical community to diagnose the disease in its early stages, the disease is now thought of in a surgery of a first-contact physician as well as in a specialist surgery. Continually increasing number of diagnosed patients leads to increasing demands related to their needs. Strict gluten-free diet is the only available causal therapy. Gluten-free products are marked with a universally recognised international symbol--crossed-out grain spike--or are labelled "gluten-free". Some specialized family-run businesses focusing on their production have all foodstuffs labelled. However, this labelling is rather lacking on the products sold in high street stores. Based on the increasing incidence of celiac disease in the population, or rather improved diagnostic methods and increased awareness within the medical community of this diagnosis, the authors review the possibility of labelling all food products. This would be a universally recognised symbol, or a clear warning that the product contains gluten. It is recommended that a proposal is submitted to improve legislation related to labelling of gluten-containing products. It is recommended that the products labelled as "gluten-free" contain no gluten. It is proposed that the production of gluten-free food products is submitted to accreditation with well-defined methodology including strict control.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Coeliac disease is common in type 1 diabetes. It is managed with a gluten-free diet, characterised by foods low in AGEs. We hypothesised that this diet would lead to lower plasma AGEs and be associated with reduced albuminuria. METHODS: From a single paediatric clinic, we recruited 21 children with type 1 diabetes and biopsy-proven coeliac disease, and 38 individuals with diabetes alone. The groups were matched for age, sex, duration of disease and metabolic control. Participants completed a detailed clinical and dietary history. Blood samples were taken for HbA(1c), coeliac serology, thyroid function, serum IgA levels and plasma AGEs, and urine samples were obtained for estimation of the albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR). RESULTS: All the individuals with coeliac disease were asymptomatic, with negative transglutaminase antibodies. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age (14 years), sex (29% male), duration of diabetes (7 years), mean HbA(1c) (8.3%), lipid levels or treatment regimens. However, children with diabetes and coeliac disease had twofold lower levels of urinary ACR than with those diabetes alone (p = 0.04). This was associated with lower levels of circulating AGEs (p = 0.03). These associations were independent of metabolic control, diabetes management and other potentially confounding variables, such as household exposure to cigarette smoke. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Adherence to a gluten-free diet may provide additional benefits for individuals with coeliac disease, and potentially those with type 1 diabetes.},

Celiac disease occurs in adults and children at rates approaching 1% of population in Europe and USA. Clinical features observed in celiac disease are extremely various and anaemia, oral aphthous stomatis, amenorrhea or articular symptoms may be the only presenting manifestations. Diagnosis relies on the evidence of histological villous atrophy in proximal small bowel and the presence of specific serum antibodies. Treatment relies on eviction of gluten (wheat, barley, rye) from diet. Gluten free diet allows prevention of malignant complications such as small bowel adenocarcinoma and lymphoma, and osteopenia. The main cause of resistance to gluten free diet is its poor observance. If not the case, serious complications of celiac disease, such as clonal refractory celiac sprue and intestinal T-cell lymphoma should be suspected. Current therapeutic challenges concern alternative to gluten free diet and new efficient treatments of lymphomatous complications.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an enteropathy related to autoimmune diseases induced by gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Its prevalence is of 1% in Europe and United States. Its clinical presentation is extremely various and diagnosis relies on the detection of specific serum antibodies and on the demonstration of intestinal villous atrophy. Treatment relies on a life-long gluten free diet which prevents bone, autoimmune and malignant complications. The keystone of its pathogenesis is the interaction of gliadin peptides with HLA DQ2/8 molecules, the main genetic risk factor, which induces the activation of CD4+ T-cells in the lamina propria. Yet, complementary mechanisms are necessary to provoke the loss of tolerance to gluten which involves the cytokine IL-15 responsible of the activation/expansion of intraepithelial lymphocytes, a hallmark of the origin of the severe lymphomatous complications. The burden of the gluten-free diet leads to a strong demand for alternative treatments. Numerous strategies have been identified to prevent the recognition of gliadin peptides by the immune system. Their efficiency and safety remained to be evaluated, the most attainable strategy today being oral therapy by enzymes able to eliminate gluten immunogenicity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The enteropathy associated with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is poorly characterized, and its possible relationships with well-defined causes of enteropathy, such as celiac sprue (CS), remain debated. We aimed to assess the clinical and histopathological features of the enteropathy associated with CVID. METHODS: The medical files of 50 CVID patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were analyzed retrospectively. Histological, phenotypic, and molecular analysis of intestinal endoscopic specimens was centrally performed. RESULTS: Chronic diarrhea was the most frequent gastrointestinal symptom (92%), and biological evidence of malabsorption was observed in 54% of patients. Chronic gastritis associated or not with pernicious anemia and microscopic colitis were the most frequently observed histopathological features in gastric and colonic mucosa, respectively. Small-bowel biopsies available in 41 patients showed moderate increase in intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes in 31 patients (75.6%) and villous atrophy in 21 patients (51%). Distinctive features from CS were a profound depletion in plasma cells and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia. Presence of peripheral blood CD8+ hyperlymphocytosis was predictive of intestinal intraepithelial hyperlymphocytosis. Intravenous (i.v.) immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy had no effect on enteropathy-related symptoms. Gluten-free diet improved only two out of 12 patients with villous atrophy, whereas all patients (7/7) responded to steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Several distinctive features differentiate CVID enteropathy from other causes of enteropathy including CS. Replacement i.v. Ig therapy is insufficient to improve gastrointestinal symptoms. Steroids are effective in reducing inflammation and restoring mucosal architecture.},

Although considered a primary gastrointestinal disease, CD is now known to have widespread systemic manifestations. We attempted to define the nature and role of systemic cytokine levels in the pathophysiology of CD. Multiplex cytokine assays were performed on four different groups of adult patients; patients with active CD (ACD), patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) with positive TTG IgA antibodies, patients on a GFD with negative antibodies, and those with refractory CD (RCD). The results were compared with values in healthy adult controls. Patients with active CD and those on GFD with positive antibodies had significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8, and also T(h)-2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10, compared with normal controls and patients on GFD without antibodies. Interestingly patients on GFD for less than 1 year had significantly higher levels of both proinflammatory cytokines and T(h)2 cytokines compared with the patients on GFD for more than 1 year. In addition, a statistically significant correlation between levels of TTG IgA titers and serum levels of T(h)-2 cytokines IL-4 (p < 0.001), IL-10 (p < 0.001) and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1alpha (p < 0.001), IL-1beta (p < 0.005), and IL-8 (p < 0.05) was observed.},

BACKGROUND: Low iron stores have been found to be a risk factor for RLS with serum ferritin levels less than 45-50 ng/mL associated with increased severity of RLS. It has become routine clinical practice to test serum ferritin in the initial assessment of RLS. CD is a common genetic disorder that can cause iron deficiency. METHODS: Consecutive case series of four patients with RLS and serum ferritin below 25 ng/mL, who had positive screening tests for celiac disease. RESULTS: We report four patients who had serum ferritin < 12 ng/mL and positive screening tests for CD. All had CD confirmed by duodenal biopsy and response to a gluten-free diet. RLS symptoms improved in all four, with two able to discontinue RLS medication and two responding without medication. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with RLS and low serum ferritin who do not have an obvious cause for iron deficiency, we suggest looking for CD by simple, inexpensive serologic testing. Diagnosis and treatment of CD is likely to improve the outcome for RLS, as well as identify individuals who are at risk for the significant long-term complications of CD.},

This prompted us to consider malabsorption due to CD. The diagnosis of CD was confirmed by serologic tests (IgA transglutaminase and IgG antigliadin antibodies) and biopsy of the duodenum. In all patients gluten free diet not only provided drug free control of seizures but also helped correct other features of malabsorption like hypocalcaemia and anaemia as the primary pathology behind these symptoms was corrected. We wish to highlight that hypocalcaemia of CD which may present as intractable seizures can be treated only by treating CD with gluten free diet and not by oral vitamin D and Calcium alone.},

METHODS: Anti-deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) and anti-tTG IgA and IgG were measured in the sera of celiac patients (both untreated and treated). The correlations were determined by Spearman's rank correlation test. RESULTS: In celiac patients, we found a very significant correlation between the production of DGP IgA and IgG (r = 0.75), indicating a simultaneous and ongoing production of these two isotypes reminiscent of oral vaccination studies. However, there was far less association between the production of tTG IgA and tTG IgG in celiac patients (r = 0.52). While tTG IgA was significantly correlated with DGP IgA (r = 0.80) and DGP IgG (r = 0.67), there was a weak correlation between production of anti-tTG IgG and the production of anti-DGP IgA (r = 0.38) and anti-DGP IgG (r = 0.43). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that the production of anti-tTG IgA is directly correlated to the production of anti-DGP IgG and IgA, whereas anti-tTG IgG is only weakly correlated. This result therefore supports the hapten-carrier theory that in well-established celiac patients anti-tTG IgA is produced by a set of B cells that are reacting against the complex of tTG-DGP in the absence of a tTG-specific T cell.},

   abstract = {AIM: To assess: (1) frequency and clinical relevance of gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE) detected by serology in a mass screening program; (2) sensitivity of antitransglutaminase (tTGA) and antiendomysium antibodies (EmA); and (3) adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) and follow-up. METHODS: One thousand, eight hundred and sixty-eight subjects recruited from an occupational health department underwent analysis for tTGA and EmA and, if positive, duodenal biopsy, DQ2/DQ8 genotyping, clinical feature recording, blood tests, and densitometry were performed. Since > 98% of individuals had tTGA < 2 U/mL, this value was established as the cut-off limit of normality and was considered positive when confirmed twice in the same sample. Adherence to a GFD and follow up were registered. RESULTS: Twenty-six (1.39%) subjects had positive tTGA and/or EmA, and 21 underwent biopsy: six Marsh III (one IIIa, four IIIb, one IIIc), nine Marsh I and six Marsh 0 (frequency of GSE 1:125). The sensitivity of EmA for GSE was 46.6% (11.1% for Marsh I, 100% for Marsh III), while for tTGA, it was 93.3% (88.8% for Marsh I, 100% for Marsh III). All 15 patients with abnormal histology had clinical features related to GSE. Marsh I and III subjects had more abdominal pain than Marsh 0 (P = 0.029), and a similar trend was observed for distension and diarrhea. No differences in the percentage of osteopenia were found between Marsh I and III (P = 0.608). Adherence to follow-up was 69.2%. Of 15 GSE patients, 66.7% followed a GFD with 80% responding to it. CONCLUSION: GSE in the general population is frequent and clinically relevant, irrespective of histological severity. tTGA is the marker of choice. Mass screening programs are useful in identifying patients who can benefit from GFD and follow-up.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively determine mural perfusion dynamics in patients with untreated celiac disease by using dynamic contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to compare these dynamics with those in a control population and in patients with celiac disease treated with a gluten-free diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent from all participants were obtained. Sixty consecutive patients with untreated celiac disease, 45 patients with celiac disease treated with a gluten-free diet for at least 1 year, and 30 control subjects were enrolled in this study. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging was performed by using a 1.5-T MR unit. For each MR imaging examination, maximum enhancement, slope of enhancement, and time-signal intensity curves were calculated at the level of the descending duodenal wall. Duodenal wall thickness was also evaluated. Statistical evaluation was performed by using one-way analysis of variance, and the results were confirmed by using the Bartlett test for equal variances and complemented by using Bonferroni multiple comparison, linear correlation, and the Student t test for paired data. RESULTS: Mean maximum enhancement of the duodenal wall was significantly higher in patients with untreated celiac disease (229.1 +/- 46.4 [standard deviation]) than in patients with treated celiac disease (109.8 +/- 27.8) and control subjects (94.7 +/- 17.9) (P < .001 for each comparison). All 60 untreated patients showed a curve characterized by fast enhancement and washout (type 4), while all 45 treated patients and the 30 control subjects showed a curve characterized by slow constant enhancement (type 2). Mean duodenal wall thickness was not significantly different between untreated patients (2.2 mm +/- 0.4), treated patients (2.0 mm +/- 0.3), and control subjects (2.0 mm +/- 0.4) (one-way analysis of variance, P = .4177; Bartlett test, P = .6951). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that dynamic evaluation of the bowel wall by using contrast-enhanced MR imaging can be an effective and reproducible way to show the inflammation state in celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Nutrition studies have provided unambiguous evidence that a number of human health maladies including chronic coronary artery, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer and age- and lifestyle-related diseases are associated with the diet. Several favorable and a few deleterious natural dietary ingredients have been identified that predispose human populations to various genetic and epigenetic based disorders. Media dissemination of this information has greatly raised public awareness of the beneficial effects due to increased consumption of fruit, vegetables and whole grain cereals-foods rich in phytonutrients, protein and fiber. However, the presence of intrinsically low levels of the beneficial phytonutrients in the available genotypes of crop plants is not always at par with the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for different phytonutrients (nutraceuticals). Molecular engineering of crop plants has offered a number of tools to markedly enhance intracellular concentrations of some of the beneficial nutrients, levels that, in some cases, are closer to the RDA threshold. This review brings together literature on various strategies utilized for bioengineering both major and minor crops to increase the levels of desirable phytonutrients while also decreasing the concentrations of deleterious metabolites. Some of these include increases in: protein level in potato; lysine in corn and rice; methionine in alfalfa; carotenoids (beta-carotene, phytoene, lycopene, zeaxanthin and lutein) in rice, potato, canola, tomato; choline in tomato; folates in rice, corn, tomato and lettuce; vitamin C in corn and lettuce; polyphenolics such as flavonol, isoflavone, resveratrol, chlorogenic acid and other flavonoids in tomato; anthocyanin levels in tomato and potato; alpha-tocopherol in soybean, oil seed, lettuce and potato; iron and zinc in transgenic rice. Also, molecular engineering has succeeded in considerably reducing the levels of the offending protein glutelin in rice, offering proof of concept and a new beginning for the development of super-low glutelin cereals for celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Based on clinical, histopathological and serological similarities to human celiac disease (CD), we recently established the rhesus macaque model of gluten sensitivity. In this study, we further characterized this condition based on presence of anti-tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2) antibodies, increased intestinal permeability and transepithelial transport of a proteolytically resistant, immunotoxic, 33-residue peptide from alpha(2)-gliadin in the distal duodenum of gluten-sensitive macaques. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Six rhesus macaques were selected for study from a pool of 500, including two healthy controls and four gluten-sensitive animals with elevated anti-gliadin or anti-TG2 antibodies as well as history of non-infectious chronic diarrhea. Pediatric endoscope-guided pinch biopsies were collected from each animal's distal duodenum following administration of a gluten-containing diet (GD) and again after remission by gluten-free diet (GFD). Control biopsies always showed normal villous architecture, whereas gluten-sensitive animals on GD exhibited histopathology ranging from mild lymphocytic infiltration to villous atrophy, typical of human CD. Immunofluorescent microscopic analysis of biopsies revealed IgG+ and IgA+ plasma-like cells producing antibodies that colocalized with TG2 in gluten-sensitive macaques only. Following instillation in vivo, the Cy-3-labeled 33-residue gluten peptide colocalized with the brush border protein villin in all animals. In a substantially enteropathic macaque with "leaky" duodenum, the peptide penetrated beneath the epithelium into the lamina propria. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The rhesus macaque model of gluten sensitivity not only resembles the histopathology of CD but it also may provide a model for studying intestinal permeability in states of epithelial integrity and disrepair.},

CD is an immune-mediated enteropathy, with alterations seen in the small bowel architecture on exposure to ingested gluten. Those who fail to respond to a strict gluten-free diet are termed to have refractory coeliac disease (RCD). This is associated with serious complications such as enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). We present the case of a 71-year-old female investigated for weight loss and a palpable intraabdominal mass. Abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan showed multiple necrotic mesenteric lymph nodes. At operation, multiple cavitating mesenteric lymph nodes, containing milky fluid, were found. An incidental EATL was found at the terminal ileum, which was resected. The patient subsequently tested positive for CD. This is the second case report to document an association between CMLNS and EATL. This paper highlights the varied presentation of CD. In this case, the diagnosis of CD was made retrospectively after the complications were dealt with. This paper is followed by a review of relevant literature.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) is a genetically determined gluten-sensitive enteropathy resulting in nutrient malabsorption, with an increasing incidence world-wide. Clinical presentation in early childhood may include classic malabsorption symptoms, whereas older CD children often present extra-intestinal symptoms including short stature and pubertal delay. A gluten-free diet (GFD) generally leads to a rapid catch-up in growth and to normalization of the pituitary function. The pathogenesis of CD-associated short stature is still unclear. Besides the involvement of the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-I axis, a role for ghrelin was recently proposed. Furthermore, some CD patients do not show catch-up growth during GFD, despite reversion to seronegativity for CD markers including antiendomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. These subjects show GH deficiency and could potentially benefit from recombinant human GH therapy. This review deals with the management of short stature and the evaluation of growth axis function in CD children.},

   abstract = {Symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhea are often associated with the ingestion of lactose, fructose or gluten containing nutrients. The prevalence of lactose intolerance, fructose malabsorption and celiac sprue is quite high. If the symptoms are interpreted in the right way, the diagnosis and the treatment are easy. The ingestion of lactose or fructose containing food leads only to unpleasant symptoms, but in gluten sensitive patients an inflammation and destruction of the small intestinal mucosa develops. The consequences are an impaired absorption of macro- and micronutrients with their specific symptoms. The patients with lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption can avoid the symptoms if they stick to a low lactose or fructose containing diet. On the other hand, patients with celiac sprue need a life-long gluten-free diet to heal the mucosa, to ameliorate the symptoms and to avoid relapses.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis (AT) in Sardinian children with celiac disease (CD) and the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on thyroid function. STUDY DESIGN: Children with biopsy-proven CD (n = 324; female:male 2:1; mean age, 6.6 years) followed from 1 to 15 years, were retrospectively evaluated for AT at onset of CD and during GFD. Serum thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies (AbTPO, AbTG), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and thyroid ultrasonography were considered. Age-matched Sardinian schoolchildren (n = 8040), previously evaluated for antithyroid antibodies and thyroid function, were used as controls. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with CD (10.5%) developed AT (female:male 4,5:1; mean age, 10.5 years), 11 at onset of CD and 23 during GFD, with a higher prevalence than controls (P = 2.9(-13)). Twenty-eight patients were euthyroid and 6 hypothyroid. AbTPO and/or AbTG persisted elevated for 2 to 9 years despite the GFD in 9 of 11 patients with AT at onset of CD. CONCLUSIONS: AT is strongly associated with CD in Sardinian children, has an age of onset of 10.5 years, and appears to be gluten-independent. In children with CD with AT, the female:male bias reported in adult AT is present before puberty.},

The effects of the presence of hydrocolloids and the substitution of the flour basis by flour or proteins from different sources were studied. The added ingredients were (1) hydrocolloids (carboxymethylcellulose [CMC], guar gum, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose [HPMC], and xanthan gum), and (2) substitutes (buckwheat flour, whole egg powder, and whey proteins). The bread quality parameters measured were specific volume, dry matter of bread, crust color, crumb hardness, and gas cell size distribution. Specific volume was increased by guar gum and HPMC. Breads with guar gum had color characteristics similar to French bread. Hardness decreased with the addition of hydrocolloids, especially HPMC and guar. Breads with guar gum had the most heterogeneous cell size distribution, and guar gum was therefore selected for further formulations. Bread prepared with buckwheat flour had improved quality: an increased specific volume, a softer texture, color characteristics, and gas-cell size distribution similar to French bread. Bread with 1.9% guar gum (w/w, total flour basis) and 5% buckwheat flour (of all flours and substitutes) mimicked French bread quality attributes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported an association between coeliac disease and autoimmune liver disease, but there is little information on the prevalence of coeliac disease in certain autoimmune liver diseases, particularly from non-European, non-American countries. AIMS: To investigate prevalence of coeliac disease in autoimmune liver disease in Iran and to summarize previous literature. METHODS: We investigated prevalence of coeliac disease among 100 autoimmune liver disease patients and compared it with the prevalence in healthy individuals. We also performed an extensive search of the English literature in PubMed Database. RESULTS: We found substantially elevated prevalence of coeliac disease in patients with overlap syndrome (10-15%) compared to the general population (0.1-1%). To a lesser extent, the prevalence was high in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (2-4%). In our systematic review, prevalence of coeliac disease in autoimmune hepatitis in the majority of studies was 4% or more; several studies also reported such prevalence in primary biliary cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: Since coeliac disease is common among patients with autoimmune liver disease, screening autoimmune liver disease patients for coeliac disease is indicated. Although the magnitude of benefit from a gluten-free diet in reversing autoimmune liver disease in patients with coeliac disease is controversial, it may reduce the risk of further complications of coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Up to 8% of patients with gluten sensitivity (GS) develop neurological symptoms such as ataxia, dementia, seizures or peripheral neuropathy. The underlying immunological mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. We here report the case of a 68-year-old male patient suffering from progressive ataxia and dementia associated with chronic diarrhea and both elevated IgG and IgA antigliadin-antibodies. At autopsy, frequent argyrophilic glial and neuronal inclusions within the basal nucleus of Meynert were considered as the structural correlative for the cognitive decline. Significant neuronal loss in the cerebellar cortex and the inferior olives was accompanied by infiltrating CD8(+)/perforin(+)/granzyme B(+) cells as well as reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation. These CD8(+) cytotoxic T and NK cells are likely to act as effector cells responsible for neuronal cell death in patients with gluten sensitivity and neurological disease and might therefore at least partly be responsible for cerebellar symptoms in gluten ataxia. In conclusion, our results, showing an absence of B- or plasma cells but multiple CD8(+) as well as granzyme B and perforin expressing cells in ataxia-associated brain areas, suggest that there are also prominent cytotoxic effects in neuropathogenesis of GS.},

We investigated RLS prevalence in celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune disease characterized by several features such as malabsorption-related iron deficiency anemia and peripheral neuropathy. We screened a population of 100 adult CD patients for CD features, iron metabolism, clinical and neurological conditions, and enrolled 100 age- and sex-matched controls in the general population. RLS was ascertained in CD patients and controls by both the presence of the four essential International RLS Study Group diagnostic criteria and neurological examination. The International RLS Study Group rating scale was used to measure RLS severity. We found a 31% prevalence of RLS in the CD population that was significantly higher than the prevalence in the control population (4%; P < 0.001). The average severity of RLS in CD population was moderate (17 +/- 6.5). In the CD population, no significant correlation was found between RLS and either gluten-free diet or iron metabolism, despite hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in CD patients with RLS than without RLS (P = 0.003). We found no correlation between RLS and other possible causes of secondary RLS, including signs of peripheral neuropathy, pregnancy, end-stage renal disease, and pharmacological treatments.Our study broadens the spectrum of neurological disorders associated with CD and indicates that RLS should be sought for in all patients with CD.},

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of celiac disease in a group of 12 to 36 month-old children using immunoglobulin antibodies against gliadin (IgG and IgA-AGA), against endomysium (IgA-EMA), and against human tissue transglutaminase (IgA-tTG) as screening method. METHODS: A total of 214 children (114 boys), aged 12 to 36 months, on gluten-containing diet, were admitted to the study. IgG and IgA-AGA, IgA-tTG and IgA-EMA tests were performed in all sera. Biopsy was obtained from all children showing positive result in one or more of the serologic tests, excluding those in which IgG-AGA had been the only positive result. In those cases, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) HLA genotyping for the identification of celiac disease predisposing alleles was applied. HLA genotyping was also performed to confirm the diagnosis in children identified as celiac by means of positive serologic testing and compatible biopsy results. RESULTS: Normal results were obtained in 131 children. Ten children out of 68 identified as positive exclusively on the IgG-AGA test disclosed the presence of celiac disease predisposing alleles on PCR and underwent jejunal biopsy with normal results. All serologic tests were positive in four children. A fifth child showed positive IgG and IgA-AGA and IgA-tTG results but disclosed a negative IgA-EMA test. Jejunal biopsy of these five children revealed characteristic lesions of celiac disease. CONCLUSION: A prevalence of 2.3% was found among symptomatic 12- to 36-month-old children that had not been previously diagnosed as celiac.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is evidence of gut barrier and immune system dysfunction in some patients with type 1 diabetes, possibly linked with exposure to dietary wheat polypeptides (WP). However, questions arise regarding the frequency of abnormal immune responses to wheat and their nature, and it remains unclear whether such responses are diabetes specific. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In type 1 diabetic patients and healthy control subjects, the immune response of peripheral CD3(+) T-cells to WPs, ovalbumin, gliadin, alpha-gliadin 33-mer peptide, tetanus toxoid, and phytohemagglutinin was measured using a carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) proliferation assay. T-helper cell type 1 (Th1), Th2, and Th17 cytokines were analyzed in WP-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) supernatants, and HLA was analyzed by PCR. RESULTS: Of 42 patients, 20 displayed increased CD3(+) T-cell proliferation to WPs and were classified as responders; proliferative responses to other dietary antigens were less pronounced. WP-stimulated PBMNCs from patients showed a mixed proinflammatory cytokine response with large amounts of IFN-gamma, IL-17A, and increased TNF. HLA-DQ2, the major celiac disease risk gene, was not significantly different. Nearly all responders carried the diabetes risk gene HLA-DR4. Anti-DR antibodies blocked the WP response and inhibited secretion of Th1 and Th17 cytokines. High amounts of WP-stimulated IL-6 were not blocked. CONCLUSIONS: T-cell reactivity to WPs was frequently present in type 1 diabetic patients and associated with HLA-DR4 but not HLA-DQ2. The presence of an HLA-DR-restricted Th1 and Th17 response to WPs in a subset of patients indicates a diabetes-related inflammatory state in the gut immune tissues associated with defective oral tolerance and possibly gut barrier dysfunction.},

   abstract = {The increasing demand for high quality gluten-free (GF) bread, clean labels and natural products is raising the need for new approaches in GF bread-making. Sourdough is the foremost fermentation used for baking purposes and it has been proven to be ideal for improving the texture, palatability, aroma, shelf life and nutritional value of wheat and rye breads. These characteristic features derive from the complex metabolic activities of the sourdough-resident lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, e.g. acidification, production of exopolysaccharides, proteolytic- amylolytic- and phytase activity, and production of antimicrobial substances. These effects have been extensively studied and well described for traditional baking, whereas little is known about the role of sourdough in GF baking. Yet, the microbiological and qualitative characterisation of local GF fermented products indicate an overlap with the microbiota of wheat/rye fermentation and suggest that the positive metabolic activities of the sourdough microbiota are still retained during fermentation of GF crops. Thus, the use of sourdough in GF baking may be the new frontier for improving the quality, safety and acceptability of GF bread.},

Polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cell membrane are vulnerable to lipid peroxidation and early destruction if vitamin E is not readily available, potentially leading to neurological sequelae. Inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and malabsorption of nutrients such as vitamin E and carnitine may contribute to neurological abnormalities. The goal of this investigation was to characterize symptoms and metabolic anomalies of a subset of children with verbal apraxia who may respond to nutritional interventions. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A total of 187 children with verbal apraxia received vitamin E + polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation. A celiac panel, fat-soluble vitamin test, and carnitine level were obtained in patients having blood analyzed. RESULTS: A common clinical phenotype of male predominance, autism, sensory issues, low muscle tone, coordination difficulties, food allergy, and GI symptoms emerged. In all, 181 families (97%) reported dramatic improvements in a number of areas including speech, imitation, coordination, eye contact, behavior, sensory issues, and development of pain sensation. Plasma vitamin E levels varied in children tested; however, pretreatment levels did not reflect clinical response. Low carnitine (20/26), high antigliadin antibodies (15/21), gluten-sensitivity HLA alleles (10/10), and zinc (2/2) and vitamin D deficiencies (4/7) were common abnormalities. Fat malabsorption was identified in 8 of 11 boys screened. CONCLUSION: We characterize a novel apraxia phenotype that responds to polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E. The association of carnitine deficiency, gluten sensitivity/food allergy, and fat malabsorption with the apraxia phenotype suggests that a comprehensive metabolic workup is warranted. Appropriate screening may identify a subgroup of children with a previously unrecognized syndrome of allergy, apraxia, and malabsorption who are responsive to nutritional interventions in addition to traditional speech and occupational therapy. Controlled trials in apraxia and autism spectrum disorders are warranted.},

   abstract = {Antibody assays play an important role in the diagnosis of coeliac disease (coeliac sprue, gluten-sensitive enteropathy), a condition characterized by immunological intolerance to gluten from wheat and from proteins of related cereals in genetically predisposed persons. Enhanced concentrations of IgA-antibodies against tissue transglutaminase or endomysium under gluten-containing normal diet represent an important indication for a biopsy from the small intestine. Demonstration of typical changes in the mucose of the small intestine is still required for the definitive diagnosis of coeliac disease. Recently highly specific antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides were detected in serum. These antibodies further improve the reliability of serologic diagnosis. The new assays for IgG-antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides have a very high diagnostic accuracy and are comparable to IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Further investigations have to show whether IgG-antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides are a reliable disease marker also in case of IgA deficiency. Prospective studies are needed to show whether antibody assays could replace biopsy in the diagnosis of coeliac disease in a substantial number of patients.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Low bone mineral density may be a finding among children and adolescents with celiac disease, including those undergoing treatment with a gluten-free diet, but the data are contradictory. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of bone mineral density abnormalities in patients on a gluten-free diet, considering age at diagnosis and duration of dietary treatment. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional prevalence study at the Pediatric Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic of Instituto Materno Infantil Professor Fernando Figueira. METHODS: Thirty-one patients over five years of age with celiac disease and on a gluten-free diet were enrolled. Bone mineral density (in g/cm(2)) was measured in the lumbar spine and whole body using bone densitometry and categorized using the criteria of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry, i.e. low bone mineral density for chronological age < -2.0 Z-scores. Age at diagnosis and duration of dietary treatment were confirmed according to the date of starting the gluten-free diet. RESULTS: Low bone density for chronological age was present in 3/31 patients in the lumbar spine and 1/31 in the whole body (also with lumbar spine abnormality). At diagnosis, three patients with low bone mineral density for the chronological age were more than 7.6 years old. These patients had been on a gluten-free diet for six and seven months and 3.4 years. CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients with celiac disease on long-term treatment are at risk of low bone mineral density. Early diagnosis and long periods of gluten-free diet are directly implicated in bone density normalization.},

   abstract = {Tumors may influence immunologic reactions. Here, we report on a 72-year-old patient who suffered from celiac disease (CD) that had been diagnosed 20 years before. Under a normal diet but without any evidence of enteropathy or CD-associated antibodies, the patient developed a jejunal T-cell lymphoma. It was resected due to perforation and four courses of IMVP-16 were added. The patient started and kept a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). Two years later, he presented with weight loss and a clonally divergent refractory sprue type II with loss of antigen (CD8; T-cell receptor-beta) expression in intraepithelial lymphocytes. At this time point, he showed high titers of CD-associated antibodies, although he was on a strict GFD. This case report highlights several questions: the missing enteropathy under a gluten-containing diet supports the notion of immune suppression in malignant diseases, especially non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Secondly, the patient developed an early form of a second independent T-cell lymphoma (refractory sprue type II) under a strict GFD, then with CD-associated antibodies, which raises the question whether the clonal intraepithelial lymphocytes were stimulating antibody production. Thus, the single detection of CD-associated antibodies in patients with CD is not itself proof of noncompliance with GFD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It has recently been shown that serum autoantibodies targeted against transglutaminase 2 derived from untreated coeliac patients can disturb several steps of angiogenesis in vitro. The purpose of this study was to establish whether the small-bowel mucosal vasculature is altered in coeliac disease and whether the putative changes are gluten dependent. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The small-bowel mucosal microvessel architecture was examined in duodenal biopsy samples from coeliac patients before and after a gluten-free diet and from non-coeliac controls. In addition, the vasculature was subjected to a detailed morphometric analysis. Double immunofluorescent stainings of the vasculature with anti- alpha-smooth muscle actin antibody were performed in order to assess the maturity of mucosal vessels. Coeliac disease-specific transglutaminase 2-targeted autoantibody deposits in the vessel wall were studied using triple immunofluorescent stainings. RESULTS: On a gluten-containing diet the mucosal vasculature in the small intestine of untreated coeliac disease patients was altered in overall organization as well as in the number and maturity of the vessels when compared to healthy subjects. In patients on a gluten-free diet, the vasculature normalized parallel to mucosal recovery. CONCLUSIONS: In coeliac disease, ingestion of gluten leads to altered appearance of small-bowel mucosal microvasculature. It is thus conceivable that the small-bowel mucosal vascular biology might be involved in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease.},

AIMS: To determine long-term quality of life of celiac disease patients and to assess the benefits of gluten-free diet compliance. PATIENTS: We prospectively evaluated 53 newly diagnosed adult celiac disease patients. METHODS: The Short Form 36 Health Survey, the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory were employed at the time of diagnosis, 1 year, and beyond 4 years (median: 53 months) on treatment. RESULTS: At 1 year, a significant improvement from baseline in quality of life indicators was observed (p<0.001 to p<0.0001) with comparable scores to healthy subjects. At 4 years, the Short Form 36 Health Survey scores (p<0.002 to p<0.0002) and Beck Depression Inventory score (p<0.002) show significant deterioration compare with 1 year. Most scores remained significantly better than those at diagnosis (p<0.03 to p<0.0005). No changes were detected in the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale scores. The long-term impairment of quality of life was attributable to the deterioration of most dimensions in patients who were not strictly compliant with the gluten-free diet (p<0.05 to p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term deterioration of quality of life outcomes after the first year of gluten-free diet was associated with the lack of strict compliance with the diet.},

Our objectives were to assess differences in quality of life of patients according to the clinical presentation at diagnosis, and to determine the time-course impact of a gluten-free diet. PATIENTS/METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 132 newly diagnosed adult CD patients and 70 healthy controls using self-administered questionnaires: the Short Form-36 health survey, the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale; the Beck Depression Inventory both, at diagnosis and at 3-, 6- and 12-months on treatment. RESULTS: At diagnosis, patients with classical symptoms (n=97) exhibited a significantly more pronounced alteration of all items of the three questionnaires than atypical/silent cases (n=35) (p<0.01 to <0.00001). Silent CD patients had even better baseline scores (p<0.05 to <0.00001). Treatment produced a substantial and rapid (3-month) improvement of most outcome measures in classical and atypical patients but not in asymptomatic cases. Both subgroups attained comparable final scores with no differences comparing strictly adherents with partially compliant. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical/silent celiac disease patients have a significantly better baseline quality of life than those with classical symptoms. Treatment induces a rapid and significant improvement in symptomatic cases but not in silent patients with all subgroups having similar 1-year scores comparable to healthy controls.},

We aimed to assess the prevalence of GERD symptoms at diagnosis and to determine the impact of the gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: We evaluated 133 adult CD patients at diagnosis and 70 healthy controls. Fifty-three patients completed questionnaires every 3 months during the first year and more than 4 years after diagnosis. GERD symptoms were evaluated using a subdimension of the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale for heartburn and regurgitation domains. RESULTS: At diagnosis, celiac patients had a significantly higher reflux symptom mean score than healthy controls (P < .001). At baseline, 30.1% of CD patients had moderate to severe GERD (score >3) compared with 5.7% of controls (P < .01). Moderate to severe symptoms were significantly associated with the classical clinical presentation of CD (35.0%) compared with atypical/silent cases (15.2%; P < .03). A rapid improvement was evidenced at 3 months after initial treatment with a GFD (P < .0001) with reflux scores comparable to healthy controls from this time point onward. CONCLUSIONS: GERD symptoms are common in classically symptomatic untreated CD patients. The GFD is associated with a rapid and persistent improvement in reflux symptoms that resembles the healthy population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The sensitivity and specificity of current antihuman tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA assays used to detect celiac disease reportedly approach 100%. In addition, the sensitivity of new generation deamidated gliadin peptide (alpha-DGP) antibody assays has also been reported to be similar to the tTG IgA assays. In routine clinical practice, however, the sensitivities and specificities of these tests for diagnosing celiac disease seem to be lower. AIM: We analyzed sensitivities and specificities of 4 IgA tTG and 3 deamidated gliadin peptide (alpha-DGP) kits. METHODS: The performance of 4 tTG IgA assays, A: Inova (Hu red blood cell), B: Binding site (rHu Ag), C: Eurospital (rHu Ag), D: Immco (rHu Ag) and 3 Inova alpha-DGP assays, E: alpha-DGP-IgA, F: alpha-DGP-IgG, and G: alpha-DGP-IgA+G was evaluated using sera from different subsets of celiac disease patients and controls; group 1: active celiac disease n=28, group 2: gluten-free diet n=54, group 3: healthy controls n=40, group 4: disease controls n=57(Crohn's disease n=17, chronic hepatitis n=40). RESULTS: Using the manufacturer's cut-off values, the sensitivities and specificities of different kits ranged from 71.4% to 96.4% and 87.5% to 100%, respectively. When group 1 was compared with disease controls, sensitivities remained the same but specificities decreased. Receiver operating characteristic plot derived cut-off values modified decision thresholds in all assays except kit (G). Kappa analysis demonstrated variable degrees of agreement. All assays demonstrated higher sensitivities for patients with higher grades of villous atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Overall sensitivity was at or below 90%, which is lower than that reported in the literature. Performance of the recombinant and red blood cell antigen-based tTG assays was similar, whereas the alpha-DGP assays demonstrated lower values. Receiver operating characteristic plot derived cut-off values altered test results. Many factors affect the results of these tests and clinicians should be aware of their limitations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between celiac disease (CD) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) is recognized. Most cases of CD in patients with DM are reported to be asymptomatic. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to (1) compare and audit our practice with the published standards for screening for CD in children with DM, (2) characterize the children with DM and biopsy-confirmed CD, in terms of growth and gastrointestinal symptoms, and compare them with children with DM and negative celiac serology, and (3) document the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) after 1 year of gastrointestinal symptoms, growth, and insulin requirement. METHOD: We performed a retrospective case-note review of 22 children with DM, positive celiac serology +/- biopsy-confirmed CD, and 50 children with DM and negative celiac serology. RESULTS: Twenty-two children (3.9% of the total diabetic population) had positive celiac serology on screening, with 17 (3%) having biopsy-confirmed CD. Ninety-four percent of the children had standardized celiac serology testing. At diagnosis of CD, 13 of the 17 biopsy-positive children (76.4%) had > or =1 gastrointestinal symptom. The frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms in negative celiac serology diabetic children was 6% (3 of 50) (P < .0005). Symptoms resolved in all children after introduction of a GFD. A significant improvement in weight SD score (P = .008) and BMI SD score (P = .02) was noted in those compliant with a GFD after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Children with DM and CD have a higher frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms than their diabetic peers with negative celiac serology and are not truly asymptomatic. Institution of a GFD has a positive effect on nutritional status and symptom resolution in the short-term.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a prevalent, genetically determined, autoimmune, chronic inflammatory state caused by intolerance to gluten that results mainly in gastrointestinal manifestations. One of the most common extra-intestinal manifestations of CD is short stature, and in some patients, short stature may be the presenting and only symptom of the disease, making the diagnosis of CD challenging. Impaired growth in children with CD results mainly from nutritional deficits, and withdrawal of gluten from the diet is frequently associated with a marked improvement of linear growth. In some patients, CD may be characterized by growth hormone (GH) resistance, as suggested by normal or elevated GH levels and low insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels. Rarely, it has been shown that poor catch-up growth and/or IGF-I response to gluten-free diet may be due to the coexistence of celiac disease and GH deficiency. We present two children with coexisting CD and GH deficiency. One patient had MRI findings suggesting congenital isolated GH deficiency, and a possibility of developing multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies later in life.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an inflammatory disorder of the small intestine, triggered by the ingestion of gluten proteins contained in wheat, barley or rye, in genetically susceptible individuals. This disorder is considered to be mainly mediated by cellular immunity and restricted to the human leucocyte antigen-DQ presentation of gluten-derived toxic peptides to T-cells. Moreover, the involvement of innate immunity has been recently demonstrated to be necessary also for the development of intestinal tissue damage. Genetic susceptibility accounts for an uncertain proportion of the disease risk and gluten introduction works as the precipitating factor. However, currently, the research interest is also focused on environmental factors and gene-environment interactions, especially during the first months of life, which might help explain the onset of the disease. Infectious and dietary factors that could modulate the immune response orientating it either towards tolerance or intolerance/autoimmunity are the focus of primary attention. A significant number of studies have looked into the protective effect of breast-feeding against the disease. It is generally accepted that breast-feeding during the introduction of dietary gluten and increasing the duration of breast-feeding are associated with reduced risk of developing celiac disease. However, it is still not fully established whether breast-feeding truly protects with permanent tolerance acquisition or only reduces the symptoms and delays the diagnosis. Moreover, the timing and dose of gluten introduction also seem to be relevant and long-term prospective cohort studies are being carried out in order to elucidate its role in celiac disease development.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD), or permanent gluten intolerance, is one of the most common chronic food-related diseases among children in Europe and the USA. The treatment is lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) (i.e. the exclusion of wheat, rye and barley from the diet, which are important sources particularly of iron, dietary fibre and vitamin B). The present study aimed to evaluate dietary intakes of energy and nutrients in children and adolescents on GFD and compare these with intake of comparable age groups on a normal diet as well as current recommendations. METHODS: Thirty children, 4-17 years of age with confirmed CD and on GFD were agreed to participate in this study at the Department of Pediatrics, Umea University Hospital. Weight and height were used to calculate individual energy requirement according to Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2004 (NNR-04). Dietary intake was assessed using 5-day food records and household measures were used for quantities. Twenty-five children completed their dietary record. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 25 children did not meet the recommended energy intake and the dietary intakes were inadequate regarding quality of macronutrients and quantity of minerals and vitamins. The mean intakes of sucrose and saturated fatty acids were above and the intakes of dietary fibre, vitamin D, magnesium and selenium below the NNR-04. High intakes of sucrose and saturated fat and a low intake of dietary fibre were also noted in a previous national survey on healthy children on a normal diet. The nutrient density of vitamin D, riboflavin, niacin, thiamine, magnesium and selenium were lower among CD children than healthy children but, for iron and calcium, it was higher in CD children. CONCLUSIONS: Children on GFD appear to follow the same trends as healthy children on a normal diet, with high intakes of saturated fat and sucrose and low intakes of dietary fibre, vitamin D and magnesium compared to recommendations.},

We present our case and then discuss symptoms and treatment of familial Mediterranean fever. CASE REPORT: A 3 1/2 year-old girl from the Middle East, parents related, was admitted to the Paediatric Department with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and fever. During each episode the inflammatory markers ESR and CRP were significantly raised, but with no apparent focus of infection. Each episode lasted 1-4 days and subsequently became more frequent. Laboratory evaluation revealed a high titer for IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase suggestive of coeliac disease. Coeliac disease was confirmed by small-bowel biopsy. A gluten-free diet was started, but she continued to have recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and fever. Because of her genetic origin the diagnosis familial Mediterranean fever was suspected. Genetic testing was performed, and she was found to be homozygote for the most common gene encoding for the disease. Colchicine therapy was initiated and her episodes with abdominal pain and fever became less frequent. CONCLUSION: Familial Mediterranean fever is a rare disorder in Norway but frequent in many Mediterranean countries. Common symptoms are recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, chest pain, joint pain and fever. Treatment with colchicine reduces inflammation and the risk of developing amyloidosis.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an auto-immune enteropathy, triggered in genetically predisposed individuals by the ingestion of dietary gluten. Gluten is the alcohol-soluble protein component of the cereals wheat, rye and barley. CD is a multifactorial condition, originating from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. The necessary environmental trigger is gluten, while the genetic predisposition has been identified in the major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 6, with over 90% of CD patients expressing HLA DQ2 and the remaining celiac patients express DQ8. The fact that only about 4 % of DQ2/8-positive individuals exposed to gluten develop CD, has led to the recognition that other genetic and environmental factors are also necessary. In the last few years, several epidemiological studies have suggested that the timing of the introduction of gluten, as well as the pattern of breastfeeding, may play an important role in the subsequent development of CD. Here, we present and review the most recent evidences regarding the effect of timing of gluten introduction during weaning, the amount of gluten introduced and simultaneous breastfeeding, on the development of CD.},

   abstract = {For adolescents with celiac disease (CD), a gluten-free diet (GFD) is crucial for health, but compliance is problematic and noncompliance is common even among those aware of the risks. To better understand their lives with the disease, Swedish CD adolescents were invited to take part in focus group discussions. Data were analyzed for recurrent stigma-related themes across the groups. Adolescents described an awareness of being different from others that was produced by meal appearance and the poor availability of gluten-free food. The GFD often required discussions and special requests, so eating in public had the effect of making an invisible condition visible, and thereby creating a context for felt or enacted stigma. Maintaining invisibility avoided negative consequences of stigma, and other strategies were used to reduce the costs of visibility. The results of the study show that the GFD can produce stigma experiences in adolescence, and that dietary compliance (or lack thereof) can be understood in terms of dealing with GFD concealment and disclosure.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine the prevalence of a new set of anti-glycan and anti-outer membrane protein (anti-OMP) antibodies in a Hungarian cohort of adult Celiac disease (CD) patients. METHODS: 190 consecutive CD patients [M/F: 71/119, age:39.9 (SD:14.1) years], 100 healthy, and 48 gastrointestinal controls were tested for glycan anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (gASCA), anti-laminaribioside (ALCA), anti-chitobioside, anti-mannobioside, anti-OMP antibodies and major NOD2/CARD15 mutations. Thirty out of 82 CD patients enrolled at the time of diagnosis were re-evaluated for the same antibodies after longstanding gluten-free diet (GFD). RESULTS: 65.9% of the CD patients were positive for at least one of the tested antibodies at the time of the diagnosis. Except anti-OMP and ALCA, anti-microbial antibodies were exclusively seen in untreated CD; however, the overall sensitivity was low. Any glycan positivity (LR+: 3.13; 95% CI: 2.08-4.73) was associated with an increased likelihood ratio for diagnosing CD. Significant correlation was found between the levels of anti-glycan and anti-endomysial or anti-transglutaminase antibodies. Anti-glycan positivity was lost after longstanding GFD. Anti-glycan antibody titers were associated with symptoms at presentation, but not the presence of NOD2/CARD15 mutations. Patients with severe malabsorption more frequently had multiple antibodies at diagnosis (P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: The presence of anti-glycan antibodies in CD seems to be secondary to the impaired small bowel mucosa which can lead to increased antigen presentation. Furthermore, anti-glycan positivity may be considered an additional marker of CD and dietary adherence.},

   abstract = {The global prevalence of celiac disease is of one person per 250 inhabitants. The disease is induced by gluten, a peptide contained in wheat, rye and barley that during small intestinal digestion generates smaller peptides. Some of these are resistant to hydrolysis and cross through the epithelium into the mucosa, inducing a cascade of immune reactions leading to the appearance of the disease in susceptible individuals. Gluten appeared as a consequence of agricultural practices initiated 10000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent of southwest Asia. Celiac disease epidemiology is complicated since consumption of gluten differs depending on the origin of populations. Treatment of celiac disease consists of withdrawing gluten from the diet, a task that becomes difficult in the long term. The concept of gluten-free food has changed along time. This article updates the concept of celiac disease, the history of gluten consumption in the world, the characteristics of a gluten free diet and the difficulties to adhere to it.},

A case of severe iron deficiency anaemia as a manifestation of CD is described here. There is a need to raise awareness among health professionals about CD and its extra-intestinal presentations. Suspicion of CD should lead to antibody screening tests and positive results should be followed by an intestinal biopsy for a definitive diagnosis. Involvement of a paediatric dietitian is vital in the management of CD and lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet is necessary.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease (CD) is a permanent intolerance of gluten, i.e., of gliadin and related proteins found in the endosperm of wheat, rye and barley. It is characterized by polygenic predisposition, autoimmune nature, predominantly asymptomatic or atypical clinical course, as well as by high prevalence in patients with Down's syndrome (DS) and some other diseases. OUTLINE OF CASES: We are presenting a girl and two boys, aged 6-7 (x = 6.33) years with DS and CD recognized under the feature of sideropenic anaemia resistant to oral therapy with iron. Beside mental retardation, low stature and the morphological features characteristic of DS, two patients had a congenital heart disease; one ventricular septal defect and the other atrioventricular canal. In two patients, trisomy on the 21st chromosome pair (trisomy 21) was disclosed in all cells, while one had a mosaic karyotype. All three patients had classical laboratory parameters of sideropenic anaemia: blood Hb 77-89 g/l (x = 81.67), HCT 0.26-0.29% (x = 0.28), MCV 69-80 fl (x = 73), MCH 24.3-30 pg (x = 26.77) and serum iron 2-5 micromol/L (x = 4.0). Beside anaemia and in one patient a mild isolated hypertransaminasemia (AST 67 U/l, ALT 62 U/l), other indicators of CD were not registered in any of the children. In addition, in all three patients, we also detected an increased level of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (atTG) of IgA class (45-88 U/I) so that we performed endoscopic enterobiopsy in order to reliably confirm the diagnosis of CD. In all three patients, the pathohistological finding of the duodenal mucosa specimen showed mild to moderate destructive enteropathy associated with high intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration, cryptic hyperplasia and lympho-plasmocytic infiltration of the stroma. In all three patients, the treatment with a strict gluten-free diet and iron therapy applied orally for 3-4 months resulted in blood count normalization and the correction of sideropenia. Serum level of the atTG-IgA, repeated after a 12-month diet, was also normal. CONCLUSION: CD should be taken into consideration in all cases of sideropenic anaemia resistant to iron oral therapy in children with DS.The diagnosis of CD implicates corresponding pathohistological confirmation, while the treatment of sideropenic anaemia and its complications, beside iron preparations, also requires compliance with a gluten-free diet.},

A linear discriminant model, based on the signals of 11 polymeric membranes, selected from the 36 above using a stepwise procedure, was used to semi-quantitatively classify samples of a "Gluten-free" foodstuff (baby milked flour), previously contaminated with known amounts of gliadins (<10, 20-50 or >50mg/kg), as "Gluten-free", "Low-Gluten content" or "Gluten-containing". For this food matrix, the device had sensitivity towards gliadins of 1-2mg/kg and overall sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 78%, respectively. Moreover, the device never identified an ethanolic extract containing gliadins as "Gluten-free". Finally, the system also allowed distinguishing "Gluten-free" and "Gluten-containing" foodstuffs (15 foods, including breads, flours, baby milked flours, cookies and breakfast cereals) with an overall sensitivity and specificity greater than 83%, using the signals of only 4 selected polymeric membranes (selected using a stepwise procedure). Since only one "Gluten-containing" foodstuff was misclassified as "Gluten-free", the device could be used as a preliminary tool for quality control of foods for celiac patients.},

The use of antitransglutaminase and antiendomisium antibodies and the endoscopical duodenal biopsy are the cornerstones for its diagnosis. The introduction of a gluten-free diet will achieve the normalization of the intestinal mucosa. It will avoid the risk of long term complications and an it will achieve an improvement in quality of life.

Nickel exposure via the intestinal mucosa can induce diarrhea, abdominal pain, and swelling. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between these symptoms and nickel intake by means of a novel oral mucosa patch test. Eighty-six patients with intestinal symptoms related to ingestion of nickel-containing foods were submitted to epicutaneous and oral mucosa patch tests for nickel. All patients with positive oral mucosa patch test results were subject to a low-nickel diet and monitored over time. Skin lesions were observed in 33 out of 86 (38.4%) patients evaluated by the epicutaneous patch test. Mucosal lesions were seen in 53 out of 86 (61.6%) patients given the oral mucosa patch test. After 2 months of a low-nickel diet, 52 out of 53 (98.1%) patients showed an improvement of their symptoms. There is a significant correlation between response time of the oral mucosa patch test and the latency of symptoms after ingestion of nickel-containing foods. Consequently, the oral mucosa patch test can be used to recognize and study the adverse effects of dietary nickel exposure that could be defined as allergic contact mucositis. A low-nickel diet is also shown to be an effective treatment for this condition.},

The aim of the present work was to characterize the NFR, study the time-course of NFR-positive results in relation to gluten withdrawal and evaluate the potential role of NFR in the follow-up of CD. Twenty untreated, 87 treated CD patients and 15 healthy controls were recruited and followed for 12 months. Their sera were incubated on monkey oesophagus sections to evaluate the presence of NFR by indirect immunofluorescence analysis. Duodenal mucosa samples from treated CD patients were challenged with gliadin peptides, and thus the occurrence of NFR in culture supernatants was assessed. The NFR immunoglobulins (Igs) reactivity with the nuclear extract of a human intestinal cell line was investigated. Serum NFR was present in all untreated CD patients, persisted up to 151 +/- 37 days from gluten withdrawal and reappeared in treated CD patients under dietary transgressions. Serum NFR was also detected in two healthy controls. In culture supernatants of coeliac intestinal mucosa challenged with gliadin peptides, NFR appeared before EMA. The Igs responsible for NFR were identified as belonging to the IgA2 subclass. The NFR resulted differently from EMA and anti-nuclear antibodies, but reacted with two nuclear antigens of 65 and 49 kDa. A new autoantibody, named NFR related to CD, was described. Furthermore, NFR detection might become a valuable tool in monitoring adherence to a gluten-free diet and identifying slight dietary transgressions.},

   abstract = {Increasing prevalence, protean clinical manifestations, and lack of pharmacological therapy make celiac disease (CD) a complex and highly relevant illness in gastroenterology. This chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine is caused by the ingestion of gluten containing cereals in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI manifestations. Awareness among physicians is growing due to accessible and highly accurate diagnostic and screening methods. Recent evidence suggests a possible rising incidence of CD. Environmental factors such as early life gluten exposure, intestinal infections, short duration of breast-feeding, and changes in intestinal microbiota have been proposed to have a role in CD pathogenesis. Thus, prevention approaches to diminish the rising prevalence of CD are currently being evaluated. Still, the cornerstone treatment of CD remains a strict gluten-free diet. This nutritional regime is demanding, and non-adherence is common because of social isolation, financial issues, or restriction of food diversity. Allowing patients to occasionally consume small amounts of gluten would greatly improve their quality of life. Owing to recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of CD, different targets have been identified and have motivated the development of several experimental therapeutic strategies. The main goal of this review is to discuss the mechanisms that can be exploited therapeutically to prevent or delay CD, disease associations and its complications. Current treatments for complications of CD, including refractory CD and malignancy, are beyond the scope of this review.},

DIAGNOSIS: Osteoporosis, persistent after 12 years of hormone replacement therapy, and celiac disease. MANAGEMENT: The patient was initially treated for bone loss with postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy. DXA analyses showed a continued decline in BMD despite adequate replacement of calcium and vitamin D levels and withdrawal of gluten from the patient's diet. An oral bisphosphonate was recommended with plans to reassess BMD after 1 year.},

CASE PRESENTATION: We report a rare case of nephrotic syndrome due to membranous nephropathy in a patient with celiac disease. A 77-years-old male patient presented with uncontrolled hypertension, anemia and acute renal failure. He was diagnosed with celiac disease and membranous nephropathy confirmed by small bowel and renal biopsy. Patient was treated with gluten free diet and immuno-suppressive therapy; however, he died within 2 to 3 months due to myocardial infarction. CONCLUSION: The association between celiac disease and nephrotic syndrome is extremely rare. Only two adult patients with celiac disease and membranous nephropathy have been reported in the literature so far. Since the prevalence of celiac disease ranges between 0.75% and 4.54%, the question arises whether the coexistence of celiac disease and membranous nephropathy is just a coincidence or a rare association. As they both are immune mediated diseases, a link between them is a strong possibility.},

A wide spectrum of hepatobiliary diseases has been described, including asymptomatic elevations of liver enzyme levels, nonspecific hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and autoimmune and cholestatic liver disease. Moreover, in the majority of patients, liver enzyme levels will normalize on a gluten-free diet. In addition, celiac disease may be associated with rare hepatic complications, such as hepatic T-cell lymphoma. Because many celiac patients do not have overt gastrointestinal symptoms, a high index of suspicion is required. Simple methods of detecting celiac disease such as serum antibody tests help in the early identification of the disease, thus preventing serious complications of the disorder. The IgG DGP antibody test and IgA tTG antibody test used in combination are an excellent screening test for suspected cases of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease, triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by ingested gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and other closely related cereal grains. The only treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet for life. This paper presents a systematic review of the scientific literature on the safety of pure oats for individuals with celiac disease, which historically has been subject to debate. Limitations identified within the scientific database include: limited data on long-term consumption, limited numbers of participants in challenge studies, and limited reporting about the reasons for withdrawals from study protocols. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that a small number of individuals with celiac disease may be intolerant to pure oats and some evidence from in vitro studies suggests that an immunological response to oat avenins can occur in the absence of clinical manifestations of celiac disease as well as suggesting that oat cultivars vary in toxicity. Based on the majority of the evidence provided in the scientific database, and despite the limitations, Health Canada and the Canadian Celiac Association (CCA) concluded that the majority of people with celiac disease can tolerate moderate amounts of pure oats. The incorporation of oats into a gluten-free diet provides high fiber and vitamin B content, increased palatability, and beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. However, it is recommended that individuals with celiac disease should have both initial and long-term assessments by a health professional when introducing pure oats into a gluten-free diet.},

As a dietary antigen, gluten undergoes extensive but incomplete proteolytic digestion in the intestinal lumen. The resultant peptide fragments of gluten require deamidation, but not necessarily further intracellular processing for presentation. Recent studies reveal why the disease associated HLA-DQ2 molecule is particularly suited for binding proline-rich gluten peptides. In comparison, DQ8 exhibits different binding characteristics, which may explain the lesser risk for disease in association with this molecule.},

METHODS: The study was conducted during April-June 2006 sending a questionnaire to 24 School Directions of nursery and primary schools in a Northern Italian region (Friuli Venezia Giulia). RESULTS: Considering all the schools we obtained a global response rate of 82.3% (115/142): 73.7% (42/57) of nursery schools and 85.9% (73/85) of primary school. 86.1% (99/115) of teachers thought that doing programmes aimed to improve nutrition behaviours is effective. 98.3% (113/115) of teachers answered that favourite fats in the diet are vegetables, 23.5% (27/115) that 55%-60% of the total caloric intake in children diet should consist in carbohydrates, 37.4% (43/115) ticked correct definition of diabetes. 75.7% (87/115) of interviewed teachers explain the term Body Mass Index correctly and 42.6% (49/115) know the cut-off between normal weight and overweight. CONCLUSION: analysing the levels of importance attributed by teachers to nutrition issues, it emerges a noteworthy interest on this topic. This should be a stimulus to promote projects and training courses on this topic.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Secondary lactose intolerance (SLI) belongs to the rarer manifestations of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE). It occurs in more severe forms of the disease and its presence contributes significantly to the degree of its expression. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to determine the frequency of SLI in infants with clinically classic form of GSE, as well as its relationship with the duration, severity and age at the diagnosis of the basic disease and the degree of small bowel mucosa damage. METHODS: The study was based on a sample of 42 infants, 30 female and 12 male, aged 7-12 months (x = 9.98 +/- 1.69), with a clinically classic form of GSE. The diagnosis of GSE was established based on the characteristic pathohistological appearance of small bowel mucosa and clinical improvement of patients on gluten-free diet, while SLI on pathological lactose or milk tolerance test. The assessment of basic disease severity was based on body mass divergence in relation to the standard value, as well as on Hb and serum iron levels, while the degree of small bowel mucosa damage was determined according to the modified Marsh criteria. RESULTS: SLI was verified in 8/42 or 19.05% of patients. In addition to the symptoms and clinical signs of GSE, all the patients with SLI also featured the problems characteristic of lactose tolerance disorders, i.e. watery diarrhoea, borborygmus and meteorism occurring after milk meals. In addition, all had perianal erythema (6 with erosive changes), as well as destructive enteropathy (5 subtotal and 3 total). The difference in the duration of the basic disease, age at diagnosis, as well as in the degree of body mass deviation from the standard value between the lactose-tolerant and lactose-intolerant infants was not found. In addition, no difference in Hb and serum iron levels or in the degree of small bowel mucosa damage was found between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that SLI presents a relatively frequent occurrence in infants with clinically classic GSE, as well as that it occurs independently to the duration, severity and age at diagnosis of the basic disease and the degree of small bowel mucosa damage.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gluten-free diet (GFD) presents the basis of coeliac disease (CD) treatment. If strictly applied, the disorders of the small bowel mucosa and other disease signs rapidly resolve. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to evaluate the effect of GFD on the growth and nutritional status of children with the classical form of CD. In addition, we analyzed the differences between these parameters with the duration and the patients' compliance with GFD. METHODS: The study goals were achieved on a sample of 90 children, 56 female and 34 male, aged 0.5-7.5 (1.53 +/- 1.05) years, with the classic CD diagnosed on the basis of typical pathohistological findings of the small bowel mucosa and clinical recovery of patients on GFD. The duration of the patients' follow-up was 1.08-8.75 (3.03 +/- 1.14) years, i.e. until the age of 2.5-15 (4.59 +/- 1.78) years. The initial and control values of body height (BH) in relation to matched values for age and gender were expressed in percentiles, while the deviation in body weight (BW) for the matched values of height and gender was expressed in percentages. The referent haemoglobin (Hb) rate in blood, as a laboratory indicator of nutritional status in children aged up to 5 years was > or = 110 g/L, and for those aged above 5 years it was > or = 115 g/L Compliance with GFD was based on the pathohistological findings of the small bowel mucosa or determination of tissue transglutaminase. RESULTS: Over the studied period, the effect of GFD was highly significant, both on the increase of BH percentiles (37.62 +/- 26.26 vs. 57.22 +/- 25.29; p < 0.001), and on the decrease of BW deficit 11.58 +/- 10.80 vs. 0.89 +/- 8.194; p < 0.001). After the treatment period, none of the children showed slowed growth rate or BW deficit above 20%, while BW deviation ranging between 10-20% in relation to the referent values was registered in 17 (18.19%) and the excess of over 20% in 2 patients. In 86 (95.56%) patients, control Hb values in blood were normal, while mild anaemia was registered in 4 patients, all compliant with GFD. The difference between the compliant and non-compliant patients with GFD was not detected either in BH percentiles (p = 0.586) or in BW percentage deviation as compared to standard values (p = 0.516) or in blood Hb values (p = 0.445). In addition, differences between the children on GFD lasting over and below 3 years were not detected either in BH percentiles (p = 0.915) or in BW deviation percentages in relation to the ideal rate (p = 0.476). CONCLUSION: GFD applied for 1-3 years has a highly significant effect on the growth rate and nutritional status of children with the classical form of CD. Significant differences in these parameters of the disease were not detected between strictly compliant and non-compliant patients on GFD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is recognized as one of the most common and important autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders affecting children. There is evidence that a diagnosis of CD during childhood improves health outcomes. The increasing prevalence of CD is due to increased awareness of the wide range of extraintestinal symptoms associated with CD. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there has been a temporal increase in the diagnosis of CD associated with an increased diagnosis of children without typical gastrointestinal symptoms at the Stollery Children's Hospital (Edmonton, Alberta). METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven CD diagnosed at the Stollery Children's Hospital from 1998 to 2007, were identified by retrospective chart review. Baseline and follow-up data, including demographics, symptoms, risk factors, anthropometrics and laboratory investigations, were collected. RESULTS: An increase in the frequency of diagnosis of CD was noted during the study period, particularly from January 2003 onward. Before January 2003, nine children were diagnosed with CD - all with typical symptoms. Between January 2003 and January 2007, inclusive, 149 children were diagnosed with CD, of whom 46% had absent or atypical symptoms. At follow-up, 96% of patients reported improved symptoms, including 53% of individuals who reported being asymptomatic before diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In the last four years of the period studied, the number of children diagnosed with CD at Stollery Children's Hospital increased 11-fold. Screening children at risk for CD, and those with atypical presentations, contributed to the increased number of diagnoses. Identification of CD and establishment of lifelong, dietary gluten avoidance during childhood has important health benefits and should be encouraged.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Successful pregnancy. RESULT(S): On investigation she had microcytic hypochromic anemia and high titers of IgA tissue transglutaminase. Duodenal biopsy was done and histology was suggestive of celiac disease. The patient was put on gluten-free diet. Eight months later she had a successful conception. CONCLUSION(S): We suggest that celiac disease should be checked in infertile patients of unexplainable etiology with anemia, as just changing their diet can solve their fertility problem.},

METHODS: Dendritic cells were matured from venous blood of patients with active or treated celiac disease and DQ2-DQ8-positive or negative controls. Dendritic cells were treated with a peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin (500 microg/ml) and their activation was analyzed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting analysis, cytokine secretion, and their ability to elicit T cell proliferation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Gliadin upregulated interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-12 (p40) secretion in dendritic cells and induced strong expression of the maturation markers human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, CD25, CD83, and CD86 of all subjects irrespective of their genotype or the presence of disease, whereas the digest of bovine serum albumin showed no effect. However, gliadin-stimulated dendritic cells from active celiac showed enhanced stimulation of autologous T cells compared to the other groups. CONCLUSION: Further research should be aimed at identifying the mechanisms that control inflammation in healthy individuals.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gluten sensitive enteropathy or celiac disease (CD) is a disorder of small bowel that occurs upon exposure to gluten. A total of 67 children of either sex in the age group of 1-12 years with unexplained failure to thrive were studied for the prevalence of CD. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. It included detailed history, clinical assessment, estimation of anti gliadin (AGA), tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) and duodenal biopsy. Treatment with gluten free diet and follow-up of diagnosed cases was done for one year. RESULT: Sixteen cases (23.88%) had villous atrophy and positive serology, essential criteria for the diagnosis of CD. Forty six (69%) children were between 4-12 years of age. Male to female ratio was 2.3:1. Main symptoms were irritability (63%), diarrhea (56%) and weight loss (56%). Thirty seven (56%) children had weight less than 3(rd) percentile. tTGA was 100% sensitive and 90.2% specific. Duodenal biopsy showed decreased villious-crypt ratio in 81.25% and intra epithelial lymphocytosis in 81% children (p<0.000001). All the confirmed cases were advised strict gluten free diet for one year. On follow-up at six months, all children showed improvement in their symptoms and weight gain. CONCLUSION: CD is an important cause of unexplained failure to thrive in children.},

   abstract = {The excretion of hydrogen in breath commonly persists, despite an overnight fast. Although the elevation of hydrogen concentration above the fasting value after the administration of a test sugar is evidence of malabsorption, the level of the fasting value itself in untreated celiac patients is unknown. Therefore, we studied the fasting breath hydrogen (FBH(2)) concentration in 40 healthy controls, 35 subjects with functional bowel disorders, and 30 patients of untreated celiac disease with and without bread or wheat diet one day before the test. The fasting level of hydrogen concentration in untreated celiac patients (28.7 +/- 19.5 ppm) was significantly higher than those in healthy volunteers (9.5 +/- 3.4 ppm) and subjects with functional bowel disorders (10.6 +/- 4.5 ppm). The percentage of patients with elevated H(2) fasting levels in untreated celiac disease (82.5%) was significantly higher than that in healthy controls (10%) and subjects with functional bowel disorders (17.1%). In 30 celiac patients, studied with and without wheat-free diet one day before the test, the fasting hydrogen levels decreased from 28.7 +/- 19.5 ppm to 10.6 +/- 3.5 ppm, and becoming normal in all patients of celiac disease. Our results show that the patients of untreated celiac disease should be instructed not to eat things made up of wheat one day before hydrogen breath testing so that the normal fasting hydrogen concentration can be obtained and false-negative hydrogen breath test results can be avoided.},

Guidelines for serologic testing and confirmation of diagnosis of celiac disease by the American Gastroenterological Association and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition are used in this review. Level 1 evidence was used. MAIN MESSAGE: Although blood tests are helpful for screening purposes, the confirmatory test for celiac disease is a small intestinal biopsy. CONCLUSION: Patients whose blood tests for celiac disease provide positive results should have endoscopic small intestinal biopsies to confirm the diagnosis before starting a gluten-free diet.},

METHODS: A total of 134 patients underwent plasma zinc estimation at baseline and after a four week period. Zinc-deficient patients were randomly assigned to two groups. Group G (n = 48) received GFD without zinc supplementation, Group G + Z (n = 48) received GFD with zinc supplementation for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The rise in plasma Zinc levels was significant in each group regardless of zinc supplementation but similar when compared in the two groups after 4 weeks. Mean zinc levels at baseline and increase in zinc levels were statistically similar at 4 weeks in patients with diarrhea and short stature. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc levels rise with GFD irrespective of zinc supplementation.},

The osteoporosis did not respond to the treatment of his celiac disease but was completely reversed by bisphosphonate therapy. Autoantibodies against osteoprotegerin were detected in three additional patients with celiac disease. Such autoantibodies may be associated with the development of high-turnover osteoporosis, but whether autoantibodies against osteoprotegerin commonly contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in patients with celiac disease remains to be determined.},

Furthermore, CD is associated with upper gastrointestinal malignancies, particularly lymphoma of the small intestine. Besides lymphoma, an increased frequency of associated small bowel carcinoma has been described. Here we report the case of a 70-year-old male suffering from CD who was treated with a gluten-free diet presenting with complaints of nausea, vomiting and weight loss of about 8 kg in two months. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which identified distention of the stomach and duodenum and in the pars horizontalis a distinct obstruction was suggestive. However, histopathological examination showed a normal mucosal membrane. Additionally, a computed tomography scan of the abdomen was performed which showed an expanded stomach and duodenum up to the ligament of Treitz. During an explorative laparotomy a small tumor was palpated near the ligament of Treitz. Subsequently, a duodenal segment resection was performed. After surgery, the patient recovered well and left our hospital in good condition.},

It is produced by the ingestion of gluten contained in wheat, rye, barley, and related products. The only treatment currently available is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet for life. This requirement for dietary compliance is difficult, especially for adolescents and adults, and better alternatives are needed. Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of celiac disease indicate that there are several attractive targets for new pharmacologic treatments. These therapies involve oral enzyme supplementation, tissue transglutaminase inhibition, blockage of HLA-DQ presentation, and silencing of gluten-reactive T cells using cytokines or other methods. All of these therapies are in the experimental phase of development, and it is not clear if they will be approved for clinical studies. Meanwhile, a strict gluten-free diet remains a safe and effective treatment for celiac patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is common and requires a permanent strict gluten-free diet (GFD). However, data concerning how the situation is experienced by children are limited. The present study aimed to investigate the compliance with a GFD and the impact of CD and GFD on the lifestyle of patients and their families, together with proposed recommendations for improvement of quality of life. METHODS: Children with biopsy confirmed CD were recruited consecutively from the outpatient gastroenterology clinic. Participants were evaluated by a special questionnaire for compliance with the GFD, patients' knowledge about CD, and the well-being and lifestyle of children and their families. Comparisons between discrete variables were performed by a chi-square test. RESULTS: Seventy-three children of median age 9.4 (interquartile range = 5-14.5) years were evaluated. Compliance to diet was reported by 58%. Reasons for noncompliance were: poor palatability (32%), dining outside home (17%), poor availability of products (11%), and asymptomatic disease diagnosed by screening (11%). The acceptance of the GFD was reported as good in 65%, whereas avoidance of travelling and restaurants was stated by 17% and 46% of families, respectively. Most families experienced difficulties detecting gluten from the food label. Proposed factors for improvement of quality of life were: better labelling of gluten-containing ingredients (76%) and more gluten-free (GF) foods in supermarkets (58%) and restaurants (42%). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CD have low compliance with the GFD. Better education about the disease, the availability of GF products, and appropriate food labelling could improve compliance and quality of life.},

Uncertainty exists as to whether GI symptoms may explain the poorer treatment outcome of women with CD. This study was designed to explore relationships of GI symptoms and psychological well-being in men and women with long-standing CD. Patients with CD (n = 108; 59% women), aged 45-64 years, treated with a GFD for at least 8 years were evaluated by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and the Psychological General Well-Being index. The results show that women with a high rate of GI symptoms have no lower level of psychological well-being than corresponding men with CD and that women with CD with reduced psychological well-being have no more GI symptoms than corresponding men. Our results fail to support the notion that the reduced subjective health in CD is explained by GI symptoms. They may be secondary to perceived difficulties in managing everyday life, suggesting that launching a nurse-led follow-up may be helpful, as has been proven to be useful in other lifelong disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the perceived poor outcome of dietary treatment makes Swedish women with coeliac disease (CD) prone to use more health care services than other women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The health care consumption over 36 consecutive months was examined for 137 Swedish women aged 20-80 years with CD in remission after living on a gluten-free diet for a median of 4 years (range 1-8 years). Comparisons were made with the health care consumption of 411 women in the general population matched for age and residence. RESULTS: The results show that women with CD use health care services annually a median of 5.0 times (range 0-76) that is more than female controls 3.6 (0-311) (p < 0.05) mainly in primary care and for complaints related to mental and behavioral disorders (ICD F), diseases of the digestive system (ICD K) and diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (ICD M). CONCLUSIONS: Women with CD used health care services in keeping with studies indicating reduced health-related quality of life of people with this condition. The results provide evidence that women with CD in remission suffer from co-morbidities that may signal a need for a multidisciplinary follow-up of subjects with CD in Sweden.},

The association of autoimmune diseases with celiac disease has been reported, but few publications deal with the combination of SSc and celiac disease. METHODS: We investigated the presence of anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies and serum antiendomysial antibodies (anti-EMA) in 50 patients with SSc. All subjects were on a gluten-containing diet. Duodenal mucosa histology and biopsy culture were performed in anti-tTG-positive patients; anti-EMA and IgA, IgG1 anti-tTG were detected in culture supernatants. RESULTS: The incidence of celiac disease in patients with SSc was found to be 8%. Serum anti-tTG antibody-positive results were detectable in 5 out of 50 patients with SSc, but only in 4 of them was the diagnosis confirmed by histological results (Marsh classification). CONCLUSION: Our data show an increased prevalence of celiac disease in patients with SSc.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a cutaneous manifestation of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease). Patients with DH demonstrate circulating IgA antibodies against epidermal transglutaminase (eTG) and tissue transglutaminase (tTG). It has been suggested that eTG is the autoantigen of DH. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the autoimmune response to eTG and tTG in patients with DH on a normal or gluten-free diet (GFD). METHODS: Sera from 52 patients with DH were studied for the presence of IgA antibodies to eTG and tTG by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. In 38 patients, serum was obtained before initiation of a GFD, whereas 14 patients had been on a GFD for at least 2 years. RESULTS: Autoantibodies against eTG were detected in 36 of 38 patients (95%) and those against tTG in 30 of 38 patients (79%) with DH on a normal diet. Of 14 patients on a long-term GFD, 7 patients were free of DH lesions and did not require dapsone treatment. None of these patients showed circulating antibodies against eTG or tTG. The remaining 7 patients on a GFD were not able to stop taking dapsone. All these patients demonstrated anti-eTG antibodies, whereas only 3 of them showed additional reactivity against tTG. LIMITATION: Autoantibody levels against eTG and tTG before and after introduction of a GFD were not examined in the same patients. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that antibodies to eTG are the most sensitive serologic marker in treated and untreated patients with DH and confirm the central role of eTG in the pathogenesis of this disease.},

   abstract = {The diagnosis of coeliac disease has traditionally depended on symptoms and intestinal biopsies; nowadays, the diagnosis has been expanded to include an array of serological markers and subtle microscopic lesions. The most important advance in classifying mucosal lesions in coeliac disease was forwarded by Marsh (1992), who provided the biological explanation of how the small bowel reacts to a variety of environmental antigenic challenges including gluten. In the modified version of this classification (Arnhem 1998-1999) autoantibodies have integrated into Marsh's histopathological scheme. As a large part of the coeliac 'iceberg' remains unrecognised, the difficulties in diagnosis continue to challenge clinicians and researchers. Advances in immuno-histochemistry and discovery of the other sensitive markers have acquainted us with so-called Microscopic enteritis, the distinctive subtle abnormalities behind the atypical gluten sensitivity symptoms that often remain unrecognised. Current diagnostic pathways do not always include facilities for looking for this common histological feature in atypical cases. This is essential since improving of the detection rate has been shown to be directly proportional to recognition of cases with milder or minimal mucosal abnormalities. In this revision, we will define and characterise microscopic enteritis as the entity behind a wide range of unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms. Screening for this subtle and distinctive presentation in small bowel pathology will open a new prospect in recognising the most common but unrecognised atypical forms of symptomatic gluten related enteropathies.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are counted among psychosomatic diseases, whose incidence has been rapidly increasing in the last decades. To date, the etiology, diagnostic and therapeutic management of eating disorders have not been uniformly determined. The objective of the study is determination of the role of a pediatric endocrinologist in diagnostics and management of eating disorders. MATERIAL: In the years 1992-2007 in Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Endocrinology Chair of Pediatrics, Polish-American Institute of Pediatrics, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland were hospitalized 164 patients with suspected anorexia nervosa, aged 9-20 years, 150 girls, and 14 boys. All girls were included in psychological and dietetic treatment. Additionally, in group of 36 girls, the 3-years observation of bone mineralization changes was performed. METHODS: The indications for hospitalization included the assessment of nutritional status, particularly electrolyte imbalance, cardiovascular complications and nutritional treatment. II. Procedure included on department: 1) Correction of general children's state. 2) Monitoring of cardiovascular system disorders. 3) Nutritional treatment. 4) Differential diagnosis. III. Prevention and treatment of late complications was performed in group of 36 girls. In this group, every 6 months were evaluated: body mass index, duration of secondary amenorrhea, serum sex hormone, IGF-I and cortisol levels and 24-hour urine cortisol. Spine densitometry in the AP projection was performed every 12 months, using a Lunar unit (DEXA). The pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis was introduced in girls with duration of secondary amenorrhea lasted for more than 6 months, with decreased bone mineralization BMD < (-) 1SD and body mass deficit < 20%. 16 girls which did not presented disorders of bone mineralization, or refused treatment have not got the pharmacological treatment, while in 20 girls the pharmacological therapy (calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation and hormonal treatment - Estraderm TTS and Provera 5 mg) was provided. RESULTS: Anorexia nervosa was diagnosed in 150 cases, bulimia in 6 cases, in 2 children was diagnosed celiac disease, in 2 patients adrenal insufficiency, in 1 girl myasthenia, in 1 girl diabetes mellitus type 1, in 1 boy hypothalamo-pituitary tumor and in 1 boy psychosis was diagnosed. The nutritional improvement was evaluated in group of 36 girls, which continued treatment in time 3 years. At the beginning of the observation period the mean value of the body mass index (BMI) was 15.95 kg/m2, and after 36 months of the treatment the mean BMI value was 20 kg/m2. Before the treatment one patient was still menstruated despite her body mass loss, 8 girls were pre-menarche, and the remaining 27 patients had secondary amenorrhea of the mean duration of 11.14 months. In the initial period of the follow-up, all the anorectic patients demonstrated a decreased bone mineral density. Before treatment the median Z score in the entire experimental group was (-)1,2 SD whereas after 3 years of treatment value of Z score decreased by 0,5 SD in group of 16 girls without the pharmacological treatment and increased by 0,5 SD in 20 girls on pharmacological treatment. The significant, negative correlation between secondary amenorrhea and Z score value was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The role of a pediatrician in therapeutic management of eating disorders is intervention in life-threatening conditions, treatment of acute complications, differential diagnosis, nutritional treatment, prevention and management of late complications. Because of etiology and special way of treatment the management of anorexia nervosa should have been taken by psychiatrist. The duty of endocrinologists and gynecologists is the late complications treatment, such as an amenorrhea and osteoporosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Refractory celiac disease (RCD) occurs when both symptoms and intestinal damage persist or recur despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. In RCD, the immunophenotype of intraepithelial lymphocytes may be normal and polyclonal (RCD I) or abnormal and monoclonal (RCD II). The aim is to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment, and long-term outcome in a large single-center cohort of patients with RCD. METHODS: We compared the clinical characteristics and outcome in 57 patients with RCD: 42 with RCD I and 15 with RCD II. RESULTS: Fifteen of 57 patients died during follow-up (n=8 with RCD I and n=7 with RCD II), each within the first 2 years after RCD diagnosis. The overall 5-year cumulative survival is 70%, 80%, and 45% for the entire cohort, RCD I, and RCD II, respectively. The refractory state itself and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) were the most common causes of death, respectively. A new staging system is proposed based on the cumulative effect of 5 prognostic factors investigated at the time of the refractory state diagnosis: for patients in stages I, II, and III, the 5-year cumulative survival rate was 96%, 71%, and 19%, respectively (P< .0001). CONCLUSIONS: RCD is associated with high mortality with RCD II having an especially poor prognosis because of the development of EATL. A new staging model is proposed that may improve the precision of prognosis in patients with RCD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize recent advances in celiac disease published between August 2008 and July 2009. RECENT FINDINGS: Celiac disease affects nearly 1% of most populations but remains largely unrecognized. In the last year, work has shown that the prevalence of celiac disease has increased dramatically, not simply due to increased detection. Also, undiagnosed celiac disease may be associated with increased mortality. Significant progress has been made in understanding how gliadin peptides can cross the intestinal border and access the immune system. New genetic loci and candidate genes that may contribute to the risk of celiac disease and its overlap with type 1 diabetes mellitus have been identified. Novel deamidated gliadin peptides antibodies have better diagnostic accuracy over native gliadin-based tests. The inclusion of duodenal bulb biopsy specimens may increase the rate of celiac disease detection. The spectrum of celiac disease likely includes a minority of patients with mild enteropathy. A practical seven-item instrument may facilitate standardized evaluation of gluten-free diet adherence. Finally, refractory celiac disease, although rare, is associated with a poor prognosis. SUMMARY: Celiac disease is a global health problem that requires a multidisciplinary and increasingly cooperative multinational research effort.},

   abstract = {Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is defined by persistent or recurrent malabsorptive symptoms and villous atrophy despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) for at least 6-12 months in the absence of other causes of non-responsive treated coeliac disease and overt malignancy. Symptoms are often severe and require additional therapeutic intervention besides a GFD. RCD can be classified as type 1 (normal intraepithelial lymphocyte phenotype), or type 2 (defined by the presence of abnormal (clonal) intraepithelial lymphocyte phenotype). Patients with RCD may never have responded to a GFD or may have relapsed despite adherence and initial response to the GFD. RCD type 1 usually improves after treatment with a combination of aggressive nutritional support, adherence to a GFD, and alternative pharmacological therapies. By contrast, clinical response to alternative therapies in RCD type 2 is less certain and the prognosis is poor. Severe complications such as ulcerative jejunitis and enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma may occur in a subgroup of patients with RCD. The aims of this article are to (1) review recent advances in the diagnosis and management of patients with RCD, and (2) describe current and novel methods for classification of patients with RCD into categories that are useful to predict outcome and direct treatment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clinical response is typically observed in most adults with celiac disease (CD) after treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD). The rate of mucosal recovery is less certain. The aims of this study were (1) to estimate the rate of mucosal recovery after GFD in a cohort of adults with CD, and (2) to assess the clinical implications of persistent mucosal damage after GFD. METHODS: The study group included adults with biopsy-proven CD evaluated at the Mayo Clinic who had duodenal biopsies at diagnosis and at least one follow-up intestinal biopsy to assess mucosal recovery after starting a GFD. The primary outcomes of interest were mucosal recovery and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Of 381 adults with biopsy-proven CD, 241 (73% women) had both a diagnostic and follow-up biopsy available for re-review. Among these 241, the Kaplan-Meier rate of confirmed mucosal recovery at 2 years following diagnosis was 34% (95% confidence interval (CI): 27-40%), and at 5 years was 66% (95% CI: 58-74%). Most patients (82%) had some clinical response to GFD, but it was not a reliable marker of mucosal recovery (P=0.7). Serological response was associated with confirmed mucosal recovery (P=0.01). Poor compliance to GFD (P<0.01), severe CD defined by diarrhea and weight loss (P<0.001), and total villous atrophy at diagnosis (P<0.001) were strongly associated with persistent mucosal damage. There was a trend toward an association between achievement of mucosal recovery and a reduced rate of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio=0.13, 95% CI: 0.02-1.06, P=0.06), adjusted for gender and age. CONCLUSIONS: Mucosal recovery was absent in a substantial portion of adults with CD after treatment with a GFD. There was a borderline significant association between confirmed mucosal recovery (vs. persistent damage) and reduced mortality independent of age and gender. Systematic follow-up with intestinal biopsies may be advisable in patients diagnosed with CD as adults.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Collagenous sprue (CS) is characterized by the presence of a distinctive band of subepithelial collagen deposition in the small bowel. We evaluated the clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of patients with CS. METHODS: Thirty patients with CS were identified at the 3 Mayo Clinic sites between 1993 and 2009. Clinical data from medical records were reviewed. RESULTS: The study cohort was 70% female (age range, 53-91 years). Most patients had severe diarrhea and weight loss. Hospitalization to treat dehydration was necessary in 16 (53%) patients. Associated immune-mediated diseases were noted in 70% of the patients; celiac disease was the most frequent. Other associated diseases were microscopic colitis, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune enteropathy. The median thickness of the layer of subepithelial collagen deposition in the small bowel was 29 mum (20-56.5 mum). Subepithelial collagen deposition in the colon or stomach was noted in 8 patients. A clinical response was observed in 24 (80%) patients after treatment with a combination of a gluten-free diet and immunosuppressive drugs. Histologic improvement was confirmed in 9 patients, with complete remission in 5. Two patients died (1 of complications of CS and 1 of another illness). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with CS are treated effectively with a combination of gluten-free diet and steroids. CS is often associated with collagen deposition or chronic inflammation in other segments of the gastrointestinal tract as well as other immune-mediated disorders.},

Response surface methodology was used to optimize a fibre-enriched GF bread formulation based on corn starch, rice flour and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. Maize fibre and water were the predictor variables (factors), and loaf specific volume, crumb firmness and crumb L value were the dependent variables (responses) used to assess the product quality. The optimal formulation, determined from the data, contained 6.5% maize fibre and 102.5% water, starch/flour base. The developed mathematical models for the measured responses could be successfully used for their prediction during baking. Shelf-life study of the optimized formulation revealed that bread stored under modified atmosphere packaging exhibited lower crumb firmness and moisture content values, and thus remained softer through storage. Scanning electron microscopy of the crumb showed a continuum matrix between starch and maize fibre, in the optimized formulation, obtaining a more aerated structure.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To characterise the predominant species of bacterial populations associated with duodenal biopsies of paediatric patients with active and treated coeliac disease. METHODS: 20 biopsy specimens from patients with active coeliac disease, 12 from patients with treated coeliac disease, and eight from age-matched controls were evaluated for comparative purposes. Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) populations were analysed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using group-specific primers. RESULTS: Bacteroides diversity was higher in biopsy specimens from controls than in those from patients with active and treated coeliac disease. Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides fragilis/Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides ovatus were more abundant in controls than in patients with coeliac disease (p<0.05). Bacteroides vulgatus was more frequently detected in controls than in patients with treated coeliac disease (p<0.01). Bacteroides dorei was more common in patients with active coeliac disease than in those with treated coeliac disease and control children (p<0.01). Bifidobacterium diversity was higher in patients with coeliac disease than in controls. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis were more prevalent in patients with active coeliac disease than in patients with treated coeliac disease and control children. A higher LAB diversity was found in patients with treated coeliac disease and controls than in patients with active coeliac disease. Weissella spp and Lactobacillus fermentum were more frequently detected in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls and patients with active coeliac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and LAB populations in the duodenum of Spanish children with typical coeliac disease (active and treated) and controls differ in diversity and species composition; this could contribute to features of the disease.},

We report a 3-year-old Iraqi girl with malnutrition due to coexisting coeliac and Hartnup's disease. On admission to hospital, she presented with kwashiorkor, anaemia, hepatitis and hypoalbuminia. She had severe skin changes with erythema, desquamation, erosions and diffuse hyperpigmentation involving the whole integument, particularly the perioral area, trunk and legs. She also had angular cheilitis, glossitis, conjunctivitis and diffuse alopecia. After treatment with a high-protein gluten-free diet and supplementation with vitamins and microelements there was a rapid improvement in the skin lesions. The severity of the skin lesions in this case can be explained by the coexistence of two metabolic diseases causing complex malnutrition.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy characterized by mucosal inflammation and villous atrophy of the small bowel upon exposure to ingested gluten. Refractory celiac disease (RCD), defined as persisting villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia despite strict gluten-free diet, is a rare form of celiac disease with poor prognosis due to a higher rate of severe complications such as life-threatening malnutrition or the development of intestinal T-cell lymphoma. The cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome (CMLNS) represents a rare complication of celiac disease with unknown pathogenesis which is associated with but not restricted to RCD and not necessarily associated with a malignant course. We here report a 64-year-old patient who was referred to us with a history of refractory celiac disease. During further diagnostic work-up multiple intraabdominal cystic structures were detected by a computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging. A laparotomy was performed to exclude T-cell lymphoma. Histology of the intraabdominal cysts revealed the diagnosis of cavitating mesenteric lymph node syndrome as the underlying cause of the masses. Steroid therapy was initiated which led to complete regression of diarrhoea but did not induce a diminution of mesenteric lymph nodes. Three years after the diagnosis of CMLNS, the patient presented with an acute abdomen due to a small bowel perforation caused by an enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma. We discuss the differential diagnoses of intraabdominal masses in celiac disease and review the current literature on CMLNS.},

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Clinical, serological, histo-pathological and nutritional findings were integrated into an ad hoc created scoring system. Weight gain was monitored during the study observation window. RESULTS: Twenty-eight presumptive celiac patients were identified among those assisted. CD diagnosis was as follows: Confirmed: 17.9% (Score: 9.2 +/- 0.4); Highly likely: 60.7% (Score: 6.6 +/- 1.1); Non-conclusive: 32.1% (Score: 4.7 +/- 0.5); respectively. Ninety-two point eight percent of subjects were malnourished at the moment of the first interview. Total intestinal villi atrophy was observed in less than one-third of the identified celiac patients. Tittering of antibodies associated with CD was as follows: Anti-gliadin: Completed: 25; Positive: 72.0%; Anti-transglutaminase: Completed: 11; Positive: 54.5%. Nutritional replenishment actions comprised: Diet gluten withdrawal (100.0%); Vitamins and minerals prescription (92.9%); supplementary Enteral Nutrition (57.2%); and Parenteral Nutrition (21.4%). Weight gain was of 400 grams in 80.8% of CD patients after 33.7 days of follow- up; and of 700 grams in 13 of them after 321 days. The scoring system presented in this study could be useful for diagnosis and treatment of CD: a condition that keeps baffling physicians and nutritionists alike.},

Celiac disease (CD) is an enteropathy caused by an aberrant immune response to cereal gluten proteins and the only therapy is the adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). In this context, a preliminary study was conducted to establish whether the GFD in itself could modify the composition and immune properties of the gut microbiota. The trial included 10 healthy subjects (30.3 years-old), which were submitted to a GFD over one month. Analysis of fecal microbiota and dietary intake indicated that numbers of healthy gut bacteria decreased, while numbers of unhealthy bacteria increased parallel to reductions in the intake of polysaccharides after following the GFD. Fecal samples of subjects under a GFD, which represent an altered microbiota, also exerted lower immune stimulatory effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells than those of subjects on a regular gluten-containing diet. This addendum presents further discussion on the rationale behind these findings, limitations of the study and possible consequences of dietary counselling in the care process of celiac disease patients.},

Subjects affected by CD cannot tolerate gluten protein, a mixture of storage proteins contained in several cereals (wheat, rye, barley and derivatives). Gluten free-diet remains the cornerstone treatment for celiac patients. Therefore the absence of gluten in natural and processed foods represents a key aspect of food safety of the gluten-free diet. A promising area is the use of minor or pseudo-cereals such as amaranth, buckwheat, quinoa, sorghum and teff. The paper is focused on the new definition of gluten-free products in food label, the nutritional properties of the gluten-free cereals and their use to prevent nutritional deficiencies of celiac subjects.},

   abstract = {In the intestinal tract, only a single layer of epithelial cells separates innate and adaptive immune effector cells from a vast amount of antigens. Here, the immune system faces a considerable challenge in tolerating commensal flora and dietary antigens while preventing the dissemination of potential pathogens. Failure to tightly control immune reactions may result in detrimental inflammation. In this respect, 'conventional' regulatory CD4(+) T cells, including naturally occurring and adaptive CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T cells, Th3 and Tr1 cells, have recently been the focus of considerable attention. However, regulatory mechanisms in the intestinal mucosa are highly complex, including adaptations of nonhaematopoietic cells and innate immune cells as well as the presence of unconventional T cells with regulatory properties such as resident TCRgammadelta or TCRalphabeta CD8(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes. This review aims to summarize the currently available knowledge on conventional and unconventional regulatory T cell subsets (Tregs), with special emphasis on clinical data and the potential role or malfunctioning of Tregs in four major human gastrointestinal diseases, i.e. inflammatory bowel diseases, coeliac disease, food allergy and colorectal cancer. We conclude that the clinical data confirms some but not all of the findings derived from experimental animal models.},

STUDY DESIGN: Patients with CD were identified and clinical data collected from hospital records over a 6-year period (2000-2005). RESULTS: Altogether 197 patients aged 0.6-15.9 (mean 7.2) years were identified. They were found amongst the child population served by the hospital, the mean number of children at age 0.5-16 years was 268 000 during 2000-2005. The presenting symptom amongst the youngest patients (<3 years) was chronic diarrhoea (in 67%), and amongst older patients, abdominal pain. At the time of diagnosis, growth was severely retarded (height <2 SD for age) in 6.6%; mean height was -0.06 SD and weight + 1% for height. After diet treatment for a mean of 6 months, both height and weight increased significantly. Anaemia and iron deficiency were present in 25% and 43% of patients respectively. Intraepithelial T-cell receptor gamma/delta cells were pathologic in all 150 specimens studied. CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of CD depends on age. Even when we found six times more patients than during years 1976-1985 in the same hospital, published data on the prevalence of CD suggest that we found only a small minority of children with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac Disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine in which dietary gluten ingestion leads to a chronic enteropathy. Recently, scientific evidence suggested a potential role of gut microbiota in CD. To have a snapshot of dominant duodenal microbiota we analyzed the mucosa-associated microbiota of 20 children with CD, before and after a gluten-free diet (GFD) regimen, and of 10 controls. Total DNA was extracted from duodenal biopsies and amplification products of 16S ribosomal DNA were compared by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). TTGE profiles were analyzed by statistical multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The average number of bands in TTGE profiles was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in active (n.b. 16.7 +/- 0.7) and inactive states (n.b. 13.2 +/- 0.8) than in controls (n.b. 3.7 +/- 1.3). Mean interindividual similarity index was 54.9% +/- 14.9% for active disease, 55.6% +/- 15.7% for remission state and 21.8% +/- 30.16% for controls. Similarity index between celiac children before and after GFD treatment was 63.9% +/- 15.8%. Differences in microbiota biodiversity were among active and remission state (P = 0.000224) and amid active CD and controls (P < 0.001). Bacteroides vulgatus and Escherichia coli were detected more often in CD patients than in controls (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results highlighted a peculiar microbial TTGE profile and a significant higher biodiversity in CD pediatric patients' duodenal mucosa. The possible pathophysiological role of these microbial differences needs further characterization.},

Our aim was to assess the properties of the monoclonal TNF-alpha antibody infliximab in a patient with high-dose steroid refractory CS. A 27-year-old man developed watery diarrhea with weight loss and abdominal pain. Duodenal biopsies showed a subtotal villous atrophy with an extensive subepithelial layer of collagenous fibers. An apparent GFD did not reduce symptoms. High dose steroid treatment (75 mg prednisone) in combination with azathioprine (150 mg) reduced diarrhea but did not induce complete remission. Based on strongly elevated mucosal TNF-alpha transcript concentrations we introduced infliximab (5 mg/kg body weight) into therapy. After two applications the patient's symptoms quickly improved. During the following year no recurrence of diarrhea has been observed. This case suggests that infliximab is an effective treatment in complicated cases of collagenous sprue.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease has become one of the best-understood HLA-linked disorders. Although it shares many immunologic features with inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease is uniquely characterized by (1) a defined trigger (gluten proteins from wheat and related cereals), (2) the necessary presence of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, and (3) the generation of circulating autoantibodies to the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (TG2). TG2 deamidates certain gluten peptides, increasing their affinity to HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. This generates a more vigorous CD4(+) T-helper 1 T-cell activation, which can result in intestinal mucosal inflammation, malabsorption, and numerous secondary symptoms and autoimmune diseases. Moreover, gluten elicits innate immune responses that act in concert with the adaptive immunity. Exclusion of gluten from the diet reverses many disease manifestations but is usually not or less efficient in patients with refractory celiac disease or associated autoimmune diseases. Based on the advanced understanding of the pathogenesis of celiac disease, targeted nondietary therapies have been devised, and some of these are already in phase 1 or 2 clinical trials. Examples are modified flours that have been depleted of immunogenic gluten epitopes, degradation of immunodominant gliadin peptides that resist intestinal proteases by exogenous endopeptidases, decrease of intestinal permeability by blockage of the epithelial ZOT receptor, inhibition of intestinal TG2 activity by transglutaminase inhibitors, inhibition of gluten peptide presentation by HLA-DQ2 antagonists, modulation or inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines, and induction of oral tolerance to gluten. These and other experimental therapies will be discussed critically.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine current evidence for dietary supplementation with zinc and other micronutrients for primary prevention of multiple micronutrient deficiencies that are known to result from therapies used in the treatment of gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological observations and clinical findings have strengthened the concept that both nutritional deficiencies and nutritional excesses impair the gastrointestinal response(s) and alter susceptibility to inflammation and other diseases. The interaction of micronutrient intake, biochemical indicators of nutritional status, and four specific gastrointestinal inflammation states are reviewed. These conditions include celiac disease and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies resulting from the sustained adherence to a gluten-free diet; micronutrient nutrition as an important determinant of immunity for two major types of inflammatory bowel disease: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies which may be exacerbated by the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. SUMMARY: For each inflammation 'state', enhancement of micronutrient status can improve immunocompetance and minimize therapeutic side-effects. The impact of single-micronutrient deficiencies on immune responses, and the possible impact of uncorrected micronutrient status are discussed.},

   abstract = {A novel, specific and sensitive non-immunological liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based assay has been developed to detect and quantify trace levels of wheat gluten in food and consumer products. Detection and quantification of dietary gluten is important, because gluten is a principle trigger of a variety of immune diseases including food allergies and intolerances. One such disease, celiac sprue, can cause intestinal inflammation and enteropathy in patients who are exposed to dietary gluten. At present, immunochemistry is the leading analytical method for gluten detection in food. Consequently, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), such as the sandwich or competitive type assays, are the only commercially available methods to ensure that food and consumer products are accurately labeled as gluten-free. The availability of a comprehensive, fast and economic alternative to the immunological ELISA may also facilitate research towards the development of new drugs, therapies and food processing technologies to aid patients with gluten intolerances and for gluten-free labeling and certification purposes. LC-MS is an effective and efficient analytical technique for the study of cereal grain proteins and to quantify trace levels of targeted dietary gluten peptides in complex matrices. Initial efforts in this area afforded the unambiguous identification and structural characterization of six unique physiologically relevant wheat gluten peptides. This paper describes the development and optimization of an LC-MS/MS method that attempts to provide the best possible accuracy and sensitivity for the quantitative detection of trace levels of these six peptides in various food and consumer products. The overall performance of this method was evaluated using native cereal grains. Experimental results demonstrated that this method is capable of detecting and quantifying select target peptides in food over a range from 10pg/mg to 100ng/mg (corresponding to approximately 0.01-100ppm). Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) for the six target peptides were determined to range from 1 to 30pg/mg and 10-100pg/mg respectively. Reproducibility of the assay was demonstrated by evaluation of calibration data as well as data collected from the analysis of quality control standards over a period of four consecutive days. The average coefficient of determination (R(2)) for each peptide was consistently found to be >0.995 with residuals ranging from approximately 80% to 110%. Spike recovery data for each peptide in various matrices was evaluated at a concentration level near the approximate LOQ for each, as well as at higher concentration levels (30 and 60ng/mg). The average range of accuracy of detection for all peptides at the lower concentration level was determined to be 90% (+/-11), while accuracy at the 30 and 60ng/mg levels was 98% (+/-5%) and 98% (+/-3%), respectively. The usefulness and capabilities of this method are presented in a practical application to prospectively screen a variety of common commercially available (native and processed) gluten-containing and gluten-free foods and products.},

Owing to the increasing prevalence, prevention strategies, including encouragement of breastfeeding and introduction of small amounts of gluten whereas still on breastfeeding at fourth to sixth month of age, become more important than before. For avoiding complications of celiac disease, a strict gluten-free diet is essential. A lifelong gluten-free diet may bring about difficulties as avoiding gluten completely is problematic owing to the contamination with gluten of presumably gluten free foods. New therapeutic approaches include enzyme supplementation, correction of the intestinal barrier defect against gluten entry, blocking of gliadin presentation by human leukocyte antigen blockers and tissue transglutaminase inhibitors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE) is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing grains in susceptible individuals. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) may be the sole manifestation of GSE. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of gluten sensitivity enteropathy (GSE) in a large group of patients with RAS and assess the efficacy of gluten free diet (GFD) on the improvement of aphthous lesions in those who were diagnosed with GSE. METHODS: Two hundred and forty seven patients with RAS were included. The patients had at least three aphthous attacks per year. Patients were screened by IgA anti-endomysial antibody (EMA), IgA anti tissue transglutaminase (TTG) and serum IgA level. Those with a positive serology underwent endoscopic biopsies of the duodenal mucosa and patients with negative serology were excluded. The diagnosis of GSE was based on a positive serological test and abnormal duodenal histology. For patients with GSE, gluten free diet was recommended. RESULTS: Six out of 247 RAS patients had positive TTG test alone, and one had positive EMA and TTG. All 7 patients with positive serologic tests underwent duodenal biopsies. Histological findings were compatible with GSE in all of them (Marsh I in four patients, Marsh II in two patients and Marsh IIIB in one another.). The mean age of GSE patients was 27.42 +/- 10.56 (range, 13 to 40) years old. They were suffering from RAS for an average duration of 4.5 years. All of the 7 GSE patients had not responded to the routine anti-aphthae medications, including topical corticosteroids, tetracycline and colchicine. Four patients who adhered to a strict gluten-free diet showed noticeable improvement in their aphthous lesions over a period of 6 months. CONCLUSION: A significant minority (e.g. 2.83%) of RAS patients have GSE. This could be compared with the 0.9% prevalence of GSE in the general population of Iran. This study suggests that evaluation for celiac disease is appropriate in patients with RAS. Additionally, the unresponsiveness to conventional anti-aphthae treatment could be an additional risk indicator.},

Its success depends partly on its adaptability and high yield potential but also on the gluten protein fraction which confers the viscoelastic properties that allow dough to be processed into bread, pasta, noodles, and other food products. Wheat also contributes essential amino acids, minerals, and vitamins, and beneficial phytochemicals and dietary fibre components to the human diet, and these are particularly enriched in whole-grain products. However, wheat products are also known or suggested to be responsible for a number of adverse reactions in humans, including intolerances (notably coeliac disease) and allergies (respiratory and food). Current and future concerns include sustaining wheat production and quality with reduced inputs of agrochemicals and developing lines with enhanced quality for specific end-uses, notably for biofuels and human nutrition.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent auto-immune enteropathy, triggered in genetically predisposed individuals by the ingestion of dietary gluten. Gluten is the alcohol-soluble protein component of the cereals wheat, rye and barley. CD is a multifactorial condition, originating from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. The necessary environmental trigger is gluten, while the genetic predisposition has been identified in the major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 6p21, with over 90% of CD patients expressing HLA DQ2 and the remaining celiac patients express DQ8. The fact that only about 4% of DQ2/8-positive individuals exposed to gluten develop CD, has led to the recognition that other genetic and environmental factors are also necessary. In the last few years, several epidemiological studies have suggested that the timing of the introduction of gluten, as well as the pattern of breastfeeding, may play an important role in the subsequent development of CD. Here, we present and review the most recent evidences regarding the effect of timing of gluten introduction during weaning, the amount of gluten introduced and simultaneous breastfeeding, on the development of CD.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an increasingly diagnosed, permanent autoimmune enteropathy, triggered, in susceptible individuals, by the ingestion of gluten, the alcohol - soluble protein fraction of some cereals, such as wheat, rye and barley. The main protein of wheat gluten is called gliadin, the similar proteins of rye and barley are secalin and hordein, respectively. Approximately 96% of CD patients express the HLA molecule DQ2, while the remainder mostly express the less common haplotype DQ8, reflecting the pivotal role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of CD. Because of their aminoacid sequence and tri-dimensional structure, gluten peptides selectively bind to these HLA alleles present on the surface of antigen presenting cells and then they are presented to the T lymphocytes in intestinal mucosa, thus starting the inflammatory immune response. CD is defined by the characteristic histological changes of small bowel mucosa: villous atrophy, crypts hyperplasia and T cells infiltration of the lamina propria, along with the increase of the number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. The withdrawal of the gluten- containing food from the diet determines a complete recovery of the intestinal mucosa, whereas the reintroduction causes a relapse of the disease. This review focuses on the description of gluten peptides that elicit the mucosal immune response via the activation of innate and adaptive immunity in CD. It also describes the antagonist gluten peptides, obtained by artificial modification of gluten T epitopes or naturally occurring in the alcohol protein fraction of a cultivar of durum wheat, able to immuno-modulate the pathogenic immune response of CD.},

Clinical manifestations of CD vary from asymptomatic patients to severe forms of malabsorption syndromes, which may involve multiple systems and increase the risk of some malignancies. Diagnosis of CD requires a high degree of suspicion. There is no single test for the diagnosis, which is reached after a combination of clinical and laboratory data. The first step for diagnosis is a serum test such as tissue antitransglutaminase, antibodies or antiendomisio. If serum result is positive, prompt duodenal biopsy is necessary for diagnostic confirmation. An IgA deficiency, which occurs in 3% of patients with DC, may lead to false-negatives because serology is based on IgA. Another situation of false-negative tests is diet restriction of gluten; therefore diagnostic investigation must be carried out during a diet containing gluten. The screening for CD in asymptomatic individuals is not indicated.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-term follow-up of patients with celiac disease is important for monitoring their clinical status, dietary compliance and complications. AIM: To examine the current practices of Canadian gastroenterologists providing long-term care to patients with celiac disease. METHODS: All gastroenterologists in Canada (n=585) were surveyed regarding their practice demographics, familiarity with celiac disease practice guidelines, and follow-up clinical examination and investigations. RESULTS: Of the 585 surveys mailed to gastroenterologists, 567 were expected to be returned. A total of 242 completed surveys (43%) were received. Of these, 237 (184 adult, 51 pediatric and two mixed) had an active practice that included patients with celiac disease. Long-term follow-up care was provided routinely by 76% of respondents. Follow-up consisted of annual clinic visits (67%), dietary review (77%), reinforcement of the need for adherence to a gluten-free diet (90%) and recommending membership in an advocacy group (65%). Physical examination was performed by 78%; most ordered laboratory tests including serology (65%).Adult gastroenterologists performed routine follow-up intestinal biopsy more often than their pediatric counterparts (46% versus 10%), but performed serology less frequently (48% versus 86%). Pediatric patients were more likely to be followed by a multidisciplinary team. All pediatric gastroenterologists were familiar with at least one celiac disease practice guideline, whereas 15% of adult gastroenterologists were not familiar with any practice guideline. The majority of gastroenterologists who did not routinely provide follow-up expected care to be provided by the patient's primary physician (86%). CONCLUSIONS: Most gastroenterologists in Canada who responded to the survey provided long-term follow-up care to patients with celiac disease. The diverse practices reported underscore the need to develop consensus-based guidelines for long-term care of these patients.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease has been associated with other autoimmune disorders such as autoimmune hepatitis, moreover it is known that T cell mediated immune response to dietary gluten and released cytokines are important for the entheropathy seen in celiac disease. We investigated celiac autoantibodies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Sera from 84 patients with Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) type 1 and 88 patients with Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) were tested for Immunoglobulin A and G antibodies to Gliadin, Immunoglobulin A antibodies to tissue transglutaminase using enzyme immunoassay, and Immunoglobulin A anti-endomysial antibodies by both indirect immunofluorescence, and enzyme immunoassay. The patients positive for anti-endomysial antibodies and/or anti tissue transglutaminase antibodies were considered for deuodenal biopsy. The study was approved by Research Center for Gastroenterology and Liver Disease Ethics Committee and all patients gave their written informed consent to participate.Immunoglobulin A anti-endomysial and Immunoglobulin A anti-gliadin antibodies were positive in two out of 84 patients with AIH. Moreover, Immunoglobulin A anti-gliadin antibodies were positive in another patient who was also positive for anti tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Tissue transglutaminase antibodies were positive in eight (9.1%) of 88 patients with CHB, two of which were also positive for anti-endomysial antibodies. One of the patients with CHB was only positive for anti-endomysial antibodies.Compared with the general population, the prevalence of celiac autoantibodies in CHB and AIH patients is relatively high, and it is noteworthy that most positive patients were asymptomatic for celiac disease. We suggest screening for celiac disease before and during treatment in patients with viral and autoimmune hepatitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The term "microscopic colitis" includes lymphocytic colitis (LC) and collagenous colitis, bearing common clinical presentation distinguishable only by histopathological examination of colonic biopsies. This study reports on demographic and clinical characteristics, and outcome of a cohort of patients with LC. METHODS: Demographic, clinical and histopathological data were reviewed. Every patient underwent total colonoscopy with multiple biopsies examined by an expert pathologist. Diagnosis of LC was confirmed if histopathological criteria were present. Routine laboratory tests were collected to rule out other diagnosis. RESULTS: We included 80 patients (28 males; mean age: 46.4 years). At diagnosis, 71 patients (88%) reported diarrhea, 46 (58%) abdominal pain, 21 (36%) weight loss, 10 (13%) nausea. Regarding autoimmune or inflammatory diseases accompanying LC, thyroid disorders and celiac disease (CD) ranked first. Moreover, in over 10% of patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, duodenal biopsies showed villi alterations classified as Marsh I damage, without clinical and serological data for diagnosis of CD. Mesalazine and oral topical steroids (budesonide or beclomethasone) were used to treat LC in 34 (43%) and 32 (39%) of patients, respectively, with similar percentages of clinical response (approximately 80%). CONCLUSIONS: The need for total colonoscopy with multiple biopsies in all patients with chronic watery diarrhea was confirmed. Since the association between CD and LC exists, additional tests should be performed in patients not responding to gluten-free diet or to LC specific therapy to exclude the other condition. Mesalazine obtained a similar outcome than oral steroids in this cohort.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial disorder influenced by environmental, genetic and immunological factors. Increasing evidence showed CTLA-4 gene as an important susceptibility locus for autoimmune disorders. A native soluble cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (sCTLA-4), lacking of transmembrane sequence, has been described in several autoimmune diseases. We aimed to evaluate the presence of increased sCTLA-4 concentration in the serum of patients with CD and the possible immunoregulatory function. Blood samples were collected from 160 CD patients; sCTLA-4 levels were evaluated by ELISA, western blot and reverse transcription-PCR. The capability of serum sCTLA-4 to modulate T-lymphocyte proliferation in vitro was evaluated by two-way mixed leukocyte reaction assay. We demonstrated high levels of sCTLA-4 in serum of untreated celiac patients. Additionally, we observed that sCTLA-4 concentrations are related to gluten intake and that a correlation between autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase and sCTLA-4 concentration exists. Moreover, sCTLA-4 levels correlate with the degree of mucosal damage. Conversely, no correlation between sCTLA4 levels and the HLA-related risk was observed. Finally, we show that sCTLA-4 from sera of CD patients displays functional activities. These results strongly suggest a regulation of sCTLA-4 synthesis depending on the presence or absence of dietary gluten and imply a possible immunomodulatory effect on cytotoxic T lymphocyte functions. In gluten-exposed patients, serum sCTLA-4 levels might provide insight about mucosal injury.},

In untreated CD, fat malabsorption can occur. The aim of this study was to investigate the profile of serum fatty acids in newly detected CD before and after treatment with a gluten-free diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 50 adults with active CD showing small-bowel mucosal villous atrophy, from the same patients in remission after treatment with a gluten-free diet, and from 59 controls. Serum fatty acids were analyzed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Especially the proportions of arachidonic acid (20:4 n-6) and the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n-3 family docosapentaenoic acid (22:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3) were decreased in subjects with active CD. Serum levels of these fatty acids increased during remission, but still remained significantly lower than control values. Levels of unsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were generally increased in subjects with CD compared with those in controls. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CD, determination of serum fatty acid composition can be considered if the dietary history or symptoms suggest an inadequate supply of long-chain fatty acids.},

   abstract = {The understanding of the pathogenesis of celiac disease has made huge advances in recent years. The disease is caused by an inappropriate immune response to dietary gluten proteins. This immune response is controlled by CD4(+) T cells in the lamina propria that recognize gluten peptides in the context of disease predisposing HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules.(1, 2) These T cells are specific for proline- and glutamine-rich gluten peptides that are resistant to proteolysis and that have been become deamidated by the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Strikingly, celiac disease patients produce antibodies to this same enzyme when exposed to dietary gluten. Here we discuss how the new insight in the pathogenesis has lead to development of new diagnostics and nourished research into novel treatments.},

   abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that a mental task attenuates the meal-induced vasodilation in the splanchnic vasculature. Ten subjects performed a 5-min colour-word conflict test (CWT) under fasting and postprandial conditions. Subjects in the postprandial condition had ingested solid food with an energy content of 300 kcal (1,255 kJ) before either performing the CWT (mental task trial) or resting (resting control trial). The mean blood velocities (MBV) in the coeliac artery (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured. The MBV in the CA and SMA were divided by the MAP to assess the vascular conductance (VC). The MBV in the CA and SMA were significantly increased by the CWT under fasting conditions. In the postprandial condition, the MBV in the CA and SMA significantly increased immediately after the meal in both the mental task and resting control trials. The VC in the SMA, but not in the CA, was significantly decreased by the CWT under fasting conditions. In the postprandial conditions, there was no significant difference in the VC in both arteries between mental task and resting control trials. These results suggest that a mental task exerts different effects on the CA and SMA under fasting but not postprandial condition. The vasoconstrictive effect of a mental task on the SMA does not counter the vasodilatory effect of meal ingestion.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Background and aim of the work the coexistence of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD) has been long established. METHODS: Between January 2000 and December 2009, biopsy-proven CD was diagnosed in 12 children with T1D, giving a prevalence of 4.8 % in our out-patient clinic population. For each patient with coexisting T1D and CD, two control subjects with T1D and without CD who matched for age, sex and duration of diabetes were chosen. Prospective study follow up lasted 24 months. At the enrolment time, and at 2-month intervals, time from diagnosis of T1D to diagnosis of CD, presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, HbA1c value, body mass index (BMI), Height and Weight SDS were collected by a single observer. Daily insulin requirements were also retained. RESULTS: In 3 children, CD predated the onset of T1D and these children were excluded from the analysis. The 9 children who subsequently developed CD became earlier diabetic than control group (p=0.002). Eight of these children had CD diagnosis within 1 year after T1D onset. Seven out of 9 children were positive for TTG antibodies and all were positive for EMA. A significant increase in insulin requirement was found in CD children after 1 year of GFD (p= 0.02). The mean HbAlc value in CD children was higher than in the control subjects (p<0.01).A significant increase in the insulin requirement after 1 year in the GFD compliant children was found. There was a significant improvement in height-SDS after institution of GFD in the GFD-compliant children. Families of children with both T1D and CD reported higher burden than those affected by T1D only (p=0.001). The health care providers perceived family burden to increase with CD appearance (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study supports the importance of screening for CD in children with T1D 1. The early treatment with GFD of biopsy-confirmed CD children promotes a significant catch-up growth and prevents a growth failure during the follow-up.},

   abstract = {We report on the first association of celiac disease, polyarteritis nodosa and HBV infection in a patient who developed a neuropathy. On admission his general and neurological conditions were severely compromised. Haematological test revealed HBV infection and high levels of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase, endomysium, gliadin. EMG showed sensory-motor asymmetric axonal neuropathy. A sural nerve biopsy revealed fibre loss, axonal degeneration with asymmetrical distribution and fascicular ischaemia. A duodenal biopsy was consistent with celiac disease. The patient was treated with immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy, and gluten-free diet with good result. Celiac disease can be related to a higher risk of autoimmune disorders and may have contributed to the development of multineuropathy in this patient.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease (CD) remains under diagnosed with only 10-20% of patients identified. Genes encoding HLA DQ2 or DQ8 are found in the vast majority of those with CD and testing for their presence can be useful to rule out the possibility CD. CD is more common in certain ethnic groups including those of North Indian origin. The classical presentation tends to occur in younger children, while atypical presentations occur at an older age. The number of children being diagnosed with CD is increasing; this may be due to greater recognition of the more atypical presentations, improved serologic tests, and the screening of asymptomatic groups at increased risk, but may also be due to an overall increased prevalence. Although serologic testing has become more reliable, there still remain significant problems around testing, particularly in those <18 months of age. All children should undergo a duodenal biopsy on a gluten containing diet in order to diagnose CD before recommending a gluten-free diet (GFD). A GFD should be offered to all children diagnosed with CD even when perceived as asymptomatic, as there is significant morbidity associated with CD later in life.},

   abstract = {Post-translational modifications are associated with certain autoimmune diseases. For example, in the initial steps of coeliac disease (CD), transglutaminase type 2 (TG2) catalyzes a post-translational deamidation of specific glutamine residues in dietary gluten, resulting in antibodies against both modified gliadin and against TG2. Anti-TG2 has become a specific biomarker for CD. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the presence of antibodies against citrullinated peptides (ACPA) characterizes a distinct subset of this inflammatory disorder. Moreover, antibodies against the enzyme that catalyzes the citrullination (peptidylarginine deiminase; PAD) are found in RA. Their relation to disease severity indicates a possible pathogenetic role. Thus, in two major autoimmune diseases (CD and RA), antibodies are present against a post-translationally modified substrate and against the calcium-dependent thiol-enzyme (TG2 and PAD, respectively) responsible for the modification. This review highlights the similarities between the TGs and the PADs and their putative pathogenetic roles in autoimmune diseases. Possible mechanisms of the effects of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption on RA are discussed. By reflecting the progress in CD, the pathogenesis of ACPA-positive RA can be hypothesized where expression and regulation of PADs play significant roles. Indeed, autoimmune diseases should be studied collectively as well as individually. The new insight may lead towards innovative pharmacotherapeutic principles.},

   abstract = {Currently the only treatment for coeliac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet excluding food products containing wheat, rye and barley. There is, however, only scarce evidence as to harmful effects of rye in coeliac disease. To confirm the assumption that rye should be excluded from the coeliac patient's diet, we now sought to establish whether rye secalin activates toxic reactions in vitro in intestinal epithelial cell models as extensively as wheat gliadin. Further, we investigated the efficacy of germinating cereal enzymes from oat, wheat and barley to hydrolyse secalin into short fragments and whether secalin-induced harmful effects can be reduced by such pretreatment. In the current study, secalin elicited toxic reactions in intestinal Caco-2 epithelial cells similarly to gliadin: it induced epithelial cell layer permeability, tight junctional protein occludin and ZO-1 distortion and actin reorganization. In high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS), germinating barley enzymes provided the most efficient degradation of secalin and gliadin peptides and was thus selected for further in vitro analysis. After germinating barley enzyme pretreatment, all toxic reactions induced by secalin were ameliorated. We conclude that germinating enzymes from barley are particularly efficient in the degradation of rye secalin. In future, these enzymes might be utilized as a novel medical treatment for coeliac disease or in food processing in order to develop high-quality coeliac-safe food products.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Currently the only treatment for celiac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet. The diet is, however, often burdensome, and thus new treatment options are warranted. We isolated proteases from germinating wheat grain naturally meant for total digestion of wheat storage proteins and investigated whether these enzymes can diminish toxic effects of gluten in vitro and ex vivo. METHODS: Pepsin and trypsin digested (PT) gliadin was pretreated with proteases from germinating wheat, whereafter the degradation was analyzed by HPLC-MS (high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy) and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The toxicity of cleaved PT-gliadin products was assessed in Caco-2 epithelial cells, celiac patient-derived T cells, and in human small intestinal mucosal organ culture biopsies. RESULTS: Proteases from germinating wheat degraded gliadin into small peptide fragments, which, unlike unprocessed PT-gliadin, did not increase epithelial permeability, induce cytoskeletal rearrangement or changes in ZO-1 expression in Caco-2 cells. Pretreated gliadin did not stimulate T cell proliferation in vitro or enhance the production of autoantibodies to culture supernatants and the activation of CD25+ lymphocytes in the organ culture to the same extent as unprocessed PT-gliadin. DISCUSSION: Germinating wheat enzymes reduce the toxicity of wheat gliadin in vitro and ex vivo. Further studies are justified to develop an alternative therapy for celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explain the role of oxidative stress in the pathology of celiac disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: The activities of antioxidant enzymes and the levels of glutathione and lipid hydroperoxides were measured in the samples of small intestinal biopsies from 39 children with different forms of the disease and in 19 control subjects. RESULTS: The activities of analyzed enzymes varied significantly between the examined groups. An increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase was observed in patients with active and silent celiac disease, while the activities of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase and the glutathione content were significantly reduced. The level of lipid hydroperoxides was significantly elevated in these groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress is an important factor in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The antioxidant capacity of celiac patients is significantly reduced, mostly by a depletion of glutathione. Natural antioxidants and appropriate dietary supplements could be important complements to the classic therapy of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {It seems obvious to healthcare professionals that patients with coeliac disease should receive regular follow-up. Surprisingly, there is little evidence that patients benefit in terms of reduced morbidity or mortality. However, several authoritative bodies have published guidelines on the management of coeliac disease that recommend regular follow-up. There is good evidence that compliance with a gluten-free diet reduces the risk of complications such as osteoporosis or small bowel lymphoma. Compliance is enhanced particularly by education about the disease and the gluten-free diet and by support from peers or professionals. Such input can be provided by regular follow-up, which thereby should improve compliance and hence long-term health. The consensus of the recommendations for follow-up suggests an annual review by a physician and dietitian. At annual follow-up the disease status can be checked and nutritional advice can be given, including checking the adequacy of, and the compliance with, the gluten-free diet. Complications and associated medical conditions can be sought, genetic risks explained and support and reassurance given. Specialist dietitians have particular expertise in relation to diet and nutritional management; specialist clinicians have a broader range of expertise in many aspects of management of the disease. A team approach for providing follow-up is the ideal, with a clinician and dietitian, both with expertise in coeliac disease, being involved. No one particular group of healthcare professionals is necessarily better than the other at providing follow-up.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To investigate the relations between the formation of pigment gallstone and the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier, as well as the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Eighty guinea pigs were randomly divided into three groups in which they were respectively given normal diet, gallstone-causing diet, and gallstone-formation diet with a supplementary intestinal mucosal protection compound known as glutamine. The model of pigment gallstone was established after 8 weeks of dietary administration. Indices about the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier and bacterial translocation were measured. Clinical cases were divided into three groups: control, cholesterol gallstone, and pigment gallstone, where the levels of plasma diamine oxidase (DAO), plasma endotoxin and the excretion rates of technetium 99m-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (99mTC-DTPA) in the urine of each group were measured. RESULTS: In the pigment gallstone group, the level of plasma DAO and endotoxin, the excretory ratio of lactulose and mannitol in urine, the bacterial translocation ratio in the celiac lymph nodes and the activities of beta-glucuronidase increased comparing to the control group. The gallstone-formation rate for the intestinal mucosal protection group (GLN) decreased, and other indices, except the activity of beta-glucuronidase, were all lower than that of gallstone-formation group. In the clinical experiment, the levels of plasma DAO and endotoxin, as well as the excretory rate of 99mTC-DTPA in urine were higher in the patients with gallstones than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The formation of pigment gallstone was related to the abnormal function of the intestinal mucosal barrier. The abnormality in the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier probably induced the formation of gallstone by a bacterial translocation mechanism.},

While some clinicians advocate screening for CD in all patients with T1D, others are unsure whether this is warranted. The diagnosis of patients who present with symptomatic CD, including malabsorption and obvious pathology upon biopsy, remains straightforward, with improvements noted on a gluten-free diet. Many patients identified by screening, however, tend to be asymptomatic. Evidence is inconclusive as to whether the benefits of screening and potentially treating asymptomatic individuals outweigh the harms of managing a population already burdened with a serious illness.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The usefulness of celiac disease-related serology in monitoring patients on a gluten-free diet has been debated. AIM: To describe serologic changes over time and assess whether serology tests can predict compliance with the gluten-free diet. METHODS: Sera obtained at baseline and every 3 months thereafter for 1 year in 82 adult celiac disease patients were assayed for: (1) IgA antigliadin, (2) IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase, (3) IgA endomysial, (4) IgA, and (5) IgG anti-deamidated gliadin peptides, (6) dual detection of IgA and IgG anti-deamidated gliadin peptides, (7) a single assay for IgA and IgG of both anti-deamidated gliadin peptide and anti-tissue transglutaminase, and (8) IgA antiactin antibodies. RESULTS: At 3 months after diagnosis, most antibody assays significant decrease in mean concentrations (p<0.0001) and the percentage of positive samples (p<0.0001) with further improvement in subsequent determinations. Strictly adherents had significantly lower concentrations of antibodies (p<0.01 to p<0.00001) and smaller proportion of positive samples for IgA endomysial, IgA antiactin antibodies and IgA antigliadin (15.6%, 17.4% and 23.9%, respectively) than partially compliant. At 1 year, IgA endomysial (p<0.02), IgA antiactin antibodies (p<0.05) and anti-tissue transglutaminase (p<0.02) predicted the degree of compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-free diet treatment produced rapid and significant qualitative and quantitative changes in celiac disease-related antibodies which may be useful for monitoring dietary compliance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Although antigliadin antibodies (AGA) are markers of coeliac disease, elevated levels of these antibodies are also seen in many other autoimmune, neurological, haematological, collagen vascular and cutaneous disorders, even in the absence of clinically overt gastrointestinal disease. Several studies have reported an association between psoriasis and AGA, with improvement in severity of psoriasis on a gluten-free diet. This study aims to determine whether patients with psoriasis in Kashmir have an increased prevalence of elevated AGA. METHODS: A total of 120 patients (all native Kashmiris) with psoriasis and an equal number of age- and sex-matched controls without any personal or family history of autoimmune disorders were included in the study. Both groups were tested for IgA and IgG AGAs using a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in the prevalence of AGA among patients with psoriasis (6.67% for IgA and 4.17% for IgG) and control group individuals (7.5% IgA and 5.0% IgG) was observed. The mean AGA levels in the two groups were not statistically different. Furthermore, no significant association between AGA levels and psoriasis severity, joint involvement, age of onset of psoriasis or arthritis was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that AGA are not elevated in psoriasis patients as compared with a healthy population, and there is no association between AGA and psoriasis, its onset, severity and joint symptoms.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of coeliac disease and treatment with a gluten-free diet on growth and glycaemic control in asymptomatic children with Type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Data were compared in children with coeliac disease diagnosed by annual antibody screening and jejunal biopsy and treated with a gluten-free diet (n = 49) against individuals who were antibody negative (n = 49) matched for age, sex and duration of diabetes. RESULTS: No differences in growth were observed. In the years prior to diagnosis of coeliac disease, mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) was lower in cases compared with control subjects [8.3 +/- 1.1% vs. 8.7 +/- 0.9%, P = 0.02 (mean +/- sd)]. In cases, HbA(1c) deteriorated 12 months from the start of a gluten-free diet to levels similar to control subjects (8.9 +/- 1.5% vs. 8.8 +/- 1.5%, P-value for analysis of variance = 0.9). In regression analysis, the diagnosis of coeliac disease and start of a gluten-free diet was associated with a rise in HbA(1c) in the first year of treatment [odds ratio 1.56 (95% confidence intervals 1.16-2.10), P = 0.003] after adjusting for insulin dose and regimen and other variables. CONCLUSIONS: In children with Type 1 diabetes, lower HbA(1c) prior to diagnosis of silent coeliac disease rises following treatment with a gluten-free diet to levels similar to those without coeliac disease. Although unproven, these observations may relate to abnormalities at the small bowel mucosa before the appearance of circulating coeliac antibodies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because patients with celiac disease face increased risk of cancer and there is considerable circumstantial evidence that oxidatively damaged DNA may be used as a marker predictive of cancer development, we decided, for the first time, to characterize oxidative stress/oxidative DNA damage in celiac disease patients. METHODS: Two kinds of oxidatively damaged DNA biomarkers, namely, urinary excretion of 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua, and the level of oxidatively damaged DNA in the leukocytes, as well as the level of antioxidant vitamins were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and HPLC/gas chromatography with isotope dilution mass detection methods. These parameters were determined in three groups: (a) children with untreated celiac disease, (b) patients with celiac disease on a strict gluten-free diet, and (c) healthy children. RESULTS: The mean level of 8-oxodG in DNA isolated from the leukocytes and in the urine samples of the two groups of celiacs was significantly higher than in controls, irrespective of diet. There was no statistically significant difference in these parameters between treated and untreated celiacs. The mean plasma retinol and alpha-tocopherol concentration in the samples of untreated celiacs was significantly lower than in treated celiacs. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that although diet can be partially responsible for oxidative stress/oxidatively damaged DNA in celiac patients, there is a factor independent of diet. IMPACT: It is possible that celiac disease patients may be helped by dietary supplementation rich in vitamin A (and E) to minimize the risk of cancer development.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy that affects people of all ages worldwide. This disease has emerged as a major health-care problem, as advances in diagnostic and screening methods have revealed its global prevalence. Environmental factors such as gluten introduction at childhood, infectious agents and socioeconomic features, as well as the presence of HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes or genetic variations in several non-HLA genes contribute to the development of celiac disease. Growing insight into the variable clinical and histopathological presentation features of this disease has opened new perspectives for future research. A strict life-long gluten-free diet is the only safe and efficient available treatment, yet it results in a social burden. Alternative treatment modalities focus on modification of dietary components, enzymatic degradation of gluten, inhibition of intestinal permeability and modulation of the immune response. A small group of patients with celiac disease (2-5%), however, fail to improve clinically and histologically upon elimination of dietary gluten. This complication is referred to as refractory celiac disease, and imposes a serious risk of developing a virtually lethal enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wheat, rye and barley prolamins are toxic to patients with coeliac disease. Barley is diploid with pure inbred cultivars available, and is attractive for genetic approaches to detoxification. AIM: To identify barley hordein fractions which activated the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secreting peripheral blood T-cells from coeliac volunteers, and compare immunotoxicity of hordeins from experimental barley lines. METHODS: To reactivate a T-cell response to hordein, volunteers underwent a 3-day oral barley challenge. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from twenty-one HLA DQ2(+) patients with confirmed coeliac disease. IFN-gamma ELISpot assays enumerated T-cells activated by purified prolamins and positive controls. RESULTS: Hordein-specific T-cells were induced by oral barley challenge. All prolamin fractions were immunotoxic, but D- and C-hordeins were most active. Barley lines lacking B- and C-hordeins had a 5-fold reduced hordein-content, and immunotoxicity of hordein extracts were reduced 20-fold compared with wild-type barley. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo oral barley challenge offers a convenient and rapid approach to test the immunotoxicity of small amounts of purified hordeins using fresh T-cells from patients in high throughput overnight assays. Barley lines that did not accumulate B- and C-hordeins were viable, yet had substantially reduced immunotoxicity. Creation of hordein-free barley may therefore be possible.},

   abstract = {The treatment for celiac disease, a removal of gluten in the diet, is safe and effective for the vast majority of patients. There is a large body of evidence that the diagnosis and treatment of those with celiac disease ensures considerable health benefits. Although a gluten-free diet is the principal treatment for celiac disease, it is relatively expensive, inconvenient and difficult to adhere to. For these reasons, there is interest in developing alternative therapies. Emerging research for the treatment of celiac disease has focused on three areas: to decrease gluten exposure, to modify intestinal permeability and to modulate immune activation. Therapies developed thus far consist of enzymes designed to digest gluten and the use of inhibitors of paracellular permeability to decrease the migration of gluten peptides into the lamina propria. Other potential therapeutic maneuvers include the binding of gluten by polymers, the use of tissue transglutaminase (TTG) inhibitors and DQ2 or DQ8 blockers, or modulation of cytokine production. While all represent new and exciting therapies, an ideal therapy should have virtually no side effects similar to a gluten-free diet. A pharmaceutical agent may be used on an intermittent basis, such as following occasional gluten exposure or on a chronic basis to mitigate the effects of potential inadvertent ingestion of gluten.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a common disease in the Saharawi population of Arab-Berber origin. Saharawi patients with CD and their families were invited to participate in a follow-up study aimed at checking the CD serology status in patients being treated with the gluten-free diet (GFD) and investigating the prevalence of CD in first-degree relatives. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated 975 subjects (62.8% females and 37.2% males, age range 0.7 to 75.4 years, median age 13.4 years) belonging to 212 families, by determining the serum immunoglobulin A anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibody levels. Thirty-two first-degree relatives were already receiving GFD when tested. RESULTS: Overall, 42.2% of the 244 treated subjects with CD showed a borderline/positive anti-transglutaminase determination, and 36.6% were also anti-endomysial positive. The serologic family screening detected 33 previously undiagnosed CD cases. The 65 affected first-degree relatives were sibling (42), mother (12), son/daughter (7), and father (4). The overall prevalence of CD among first-degree relatives was 65 of 763 (8.5%, 95% confidence interval 6.5-10.5). Based on our previous estimate of CD prevalence in the pediatric Saharawi population (5.6%), the sibling relative risk was 1.5. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of CD in the Saharawis is only modestly increased in first-degree relatives compared with the general population, probably because of the higher frequency of CD predisposing genes in the general population. Saharawi patients with CD receiving GFD showed poor adherence to the treatment, which could contribute to residual CD-related morbidity and mortality.},

   abstract = {Under the Food Allergen and Consumer Protection Act, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must issue a rule for the voluntary labeling of food as gluten-free. In the proposed rule, many single-ingredient foods, such as millet, are considered inherently free of gluten. Inherently gluten-free grains will be considered misbranded if they carry a gluten-free label and do not also state that all foods of the same type are gluten-free (eg, "all millet is gluten free"). Twenty-two inherently gluten-free grains, seeds, and flours not labeled gluten-free were purchased in June 2009 and sent unopened to a company who specializes in gluten analysis. All samples were homogenized and tested in duplicate using the Ridascreen Gliadin sandwich R5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with cocktail extraction. Thirteen of 22 (59%) samples contained less than the limit of quantification of 5 parts per million (ppm) for gluten. Nine of 22 (41%) samples contained more than the limit of quantification, with mean gluten levels ranging from 8.5 to 2,925.0 ppm. Seven of 22 samples (32%) contained mean gluten levels >/=20 ppm and would not be considered gluten-free under the proposed FDA rule for gluten-free labeling. Gluten contamination of inherently gluten-free grains, seeds, and flours not labeled gluten-free is a legitimate concern. The FDA may want to modify their proposed rule for labeling of food as gluten-free, removing the requirement that gluten-free manufacturers of inherently gluten-free grains, seeds, and flours must state on product labels that all foods of that type are gluten-free.},

   abstract = {In the small intestine of celiac disease patients, dietary wheat gluten and similar proteins in barley and rye trigger an inflammatory response. While strict adherence to a gluten-free diet induces full recovery in most patients, a small percentage of patients fail to recover. In a subset of these refractory celiac disease patients, an (aberrant) oligoclonal intraepithelial lymphocyte population develops into overt lymphoma. Celiac disease is strongly associated with HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8, as both genotypes predispose for disease development. This association can be explained by the fact that gluten peptides can be presented in HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules on antigen presenting cells. Gluten-specific CD4(+) T cells in the lamina propria respond to these peptides, and this likely enhances cytotoxicity of intraepithelial lymphocytes against the intestinal epithelium. We propose a threshold model for the development of celiac disease, in which the efficiency of gluten presentation to CD4(+) T cells determines the likelihood of developing celiac disease and its complications. Key factors that influence the efficiency of gluten presentation include: (1) the level of gluten intake, (2) the enzyme tissue transglutaminase 2 which modifies gluten into high affinity binding peptides for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, (3) the HLA-DQ type, as HLA-DQ2 binds a wider range of gluten peptides than HLA-DQ8, (4) the gene dose of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, and finally,(5) additional genetic polymorphisms that may influence T cell reactivity. This threshold model might also help to understand the development of refractory celiac disease and lymphoma.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in celiac disease (CD) patients at the time of diagnosis and during a gluten-free diet (GFD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 43 adult CD patients (18 with a typical and 15 with an atypical clinical presentation, and 10 with dermatitis herpetiformis, DH) and 86 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We administered the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire at diagnosis and after 1, 12 and 24 months of a GFD. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis CD patients showed significantly lower SF-36 scores than controls; this figure was observed in women but not in men. At baseline, both typical and atypical CD patients had lower SF-36 scores than controls, while DH patients showed a SF-36 profile comparable to that of controls. During a GFD the SF-36 scores improved continuously in CD patients and in the female subgroup, becoming similar to those of matched controls at 1-year follow-up. After gluten withdrawal typical and atypical CD patients improved their SF-36 scores and reached values comparable to those of controls. CONCLUSIONS: At diagnosis, CD patients perceived a poor HRQoL; this figure appears to be mostly associated with female gender. In all subgroups of CD patients with a low HRQoL at diagnosis, the GFD allowed progressive restoration of HRQoL perception.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: We evaluated the diagnostic performance of an ELISA test for anti-gliadin IgA and IgG antibodies, which uses synthetic deamidated gliadin peptides (anti-gliadin antibodies, AGAs) as coating; the results were compared with a test that uses extracted gliadin (AGAe). METHODS: The study was conducted on the sera of 144 patients suffering from celiac disease (CD), including 20 patients with IgA deficiency and 9 who were following a gluten-free diet (GFD), and 129 controls. RESULTS: In the 115 CD patients (without IgA deficiency), the sensitivity of AGAe IgA and IgG was 32.2 and 60.9%, whereas that of AGAs IgA and IgG was 59.1 and 72.2%. The specificity for AGAe IgA and IgG, and AGAs IgA and IgG was 93.8 and 89.9%, and 96.9% and 99.2%, respectively. Of the 20 patients with CD and IgA deficiency, 7 tested positive for AGAe IgG and 14 for AGAs IgG. The test using deamidated gliadin peptides performed better in terms of sensitivity and specificity than the AGA tests with extracted antigen. CONCLUSIONS: The very high specificity of the AGAs IgG test (99.2%) also suggests that patients who test positive with this assay require a thorough followup, even if the anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) and anti-endomysial autoantibodies (EMA) assays are negative.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The presence of celiac disease-associated autoantibodies (antiendomysium and antitissue transglutaminase [anti-TG2]) with normal jejunal mucosa indicate potential celiac disease. We performed a prospective, 3-year cohort study to determine the natural history of potential celiac disease in children. METHODS: The study included 106 children with potential celiac disease, based on serology analysis and normal duodenal architecture. All but 2 carried the HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8 haplotype. In all children, every 6 months, growth, nutritional parameters, celiac disease serology, and autoimmunity were investigated. In biopsies, gammadelta intraepithelial-, CD3-, and lamina propria CD25-positive cells were counted; duodenal deposits of anti-TG2 immunoglobulin A were detected. Biopsy analysis was repeated after 2 years on patients with persistent positive serology and/or symptoms. RESULTS: Celiac disease was detected primarily in first-degree relatives and patients with autoimmune disorders (40.6%). A gluten-free diet was prescribed to 20/106 patients because of symptoms, which were relieved in only 11. Eighty-nine of the 106 patients entered the follow-up study, with normal daily consumption of gluten. During the follow-up antibodies disappeared in 14.6% and fluctuated in 32.6%. Villous atrophy was observed in 12/39 patients (30.8%) who underwent a repeat biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Most children with potential celiac disease remain healthy. After 3 years, approximately 33% of patients develop villous atrophy. Intestinal deposits of anti-TG2 IgA identify children at risk for villous atrophy.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder primarily targeting the small bowel, although extraintestinal extensions have been reported. The autoimmune processes can affect the liver with manifestations such as primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis. We describe a 61-year-old woman with celiac disease and an increased levels of aminotransferases. The persistence of increased levels of aminotransferases after 1 year of gluten-free diet and the positivity for an anti-nuclear and anti-double-strand DNA antibodies led to a misdiagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus-related hepatitis. Based on these findings the patient was placed on steroids, which after a few months were stopped because of the onset of diabetes mellitus. Soon after steroid withdrawal, the patient had a marked increase in aminotransferases and gamma-globulins, and a liver biopsy revealed chronic active hepatitis. A course of three months of steroids and azathioprine normalized both biochemical and clinical parameters. Currently the patient is symptom-free and doing well. In conclusion, a hypertransaminasemia persisting after a gluten-free diet should be interpreted as a sign of coexisting autoimmune liver disease. Any autoantibody positivity (in this case to ANA and anti-dsDNA) should be carefully considered in order to avoid misdiagnosis delaying appropriate clinical management.},

   abstract = {It is known that celiac disease is characterized by a huge variety of clinical forms ranging from classical ones to silent forms, potential ones and to an increased number of cases of gluten-sensitivity. The latter is an abnormal non-allergic sensibility to gluten. Clinical manifestations can be very different without a severe intestinal damage (Marsh/Oberhuber 0-I) and this condition seems to benefit from a gluten free diet. Cases of gluten-sensitivity appear very interesting in the search of histological markers with elevated specificity, which are able to identify slight and early gluten dependent enteropathy, especially in at risk patients for celiac disease even before classical autoantibodies appear: for instance, this is the case of intraepithelial lymphocytes T-cell receptor gamma delta and mucosal deposits of class IgA anti transglutaminase antibodies. Other studies are investigating transglutaminase isoenzimes (different from tissue one), that can be identified in patients with gluten dependent symptoms without classical autoantibodies. Forms of gluten allergy have a different pathogenesis from celiac disease and are represented by "backer's asthma" or by classical allergy to wheat proteins. Clinical manifestations can vary from anaphylactic reactions to dermatological, respiratory and intestinal symptoms. Also in these cases the therapeutic approach is based on gluten free diet.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate the factors that influence the oral hygiene and the periodontal treatment needs of children and adolescents with coeliac disease (CD) in Greece. METHODS: The sample consisted of 35 children and adolescents, aged 4-18 years. The evaluation included consideration of the detailed medical history, the duration of CD and of gluten-free diet, the history of oral mucosal findings and a dental questionnaire that included information about oral hygiene habits, symptoms of periodontal disease and dental attendance. The clinical dental examination consisted of the simplified gingival index, the oral hygiene index and the periodontal screening and recording index. STATISTICS: The chi square and logistic regression analysis were performed in order to determine the factors or parameters that had a statistically significant (p </= 0.05) impact on oral hygiene and periodontal treatment needs of children and adolescents with CD. RESULTS: The periodontal treatment need of children and adolescents with CD were high and most of them needed treatment of gingivitis (60.01%) and only a few subjects had a healthy periodontium (34.29%). The periodontal treatment need index, the simplified gingival index and the hygiene index correlated statistically significantly with the presence of a coexisting disease, frequency of tooth brushing, bleeding upon brushing and oral malodor. CONCLUSION: The periodontal treatment need of children and adolescents with CD correlated with factors that related to the presence of a second medical condition and to the personal oral hygiene habits. Additionally, the oral hygiene level and periodontal status of children with CD do not have any specific characteristics but they have similarities to the oral hygiene level and periodontal status of the children of the general population.},

Prior to her referral, endoscopic small intestinal biopsy had been carried out under general anesthesia with a possible diagnosis of Celiac Disease (CD). Her parents did not want their child to undergo general anesthesia for the second time for the excisional biopsy. We decided to follow the patient until all systemic investigations were concluded. In evaluation, the case was diagnosed with CD and the conjunctival tumor showed complete regression during gluten-free dietary treatment. The clinical fleshy appearance of the lesion with spider-like vascular extensions and subconjunctival hemorrhagic spots, possible association with an acquired immune system dysfunction due to CD, and spontaneous regression by a gluten-free diet led us to make a presumed diagnosis of conjunctival Kaposi sarcoma.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: : Given dietary gluten exposure, growing children with celiac disease may experience malabsorption of nutrients, negatively affecting bone health. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of low bone mass in children with celiac disease, according to the presence of symptoms at diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : A retrospective chart review of the Stollery Children's Hospital Celiac Clinic charts (April 1989-September 2007) was conducted. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine was measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Demographics, symptoms at presentation, and anthropometric and biochemical data relevant to bone health were recorded. RESULTS: : Seventy-four children (9.6 +/- 3.7 years; range 3.3-16.0 years) were included. Lumbar BMD z scores more than or equal to -1 were observed in 58 cases (65%), z scores below -1 but above -2 were observed in 14 cases (19%) and z scores less than or equal to -2 were observed in 12 cases (16%). There was no significant difference in mean lumbar BMD z scores between symptomatic and asymptomatic children (P = 0.34). When adjusted for bone age and bone surface area, BMD lumbar z score was inversely correlated with age at diagnosis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: : An equivalent reduction in spine bone mass was observed in children with celiac disease at diagnosis regardless of the presence of symptoms. Delayed diagnosis of children with celiac disease may increase the risk of adult osteoporosis. Appropriate screening of children at risk of celiac disease for the purpose of early diagnosis, as well as routine evaluation of bone mineral density in such children, are important to prevent long-term complications associated with poor bone health.},

Five hundred and forty-nine CD patients were retrospectively assessed. Two hundred and fifty-one (45.7%) showed classical, 262 (47.7%) subclinical, and 36 (6.6%) silent form of CD at the time of the diagnosis. The mean time under GFD was 7.13 years (range 1-15 years). Out of 549 patients, 381 (69.4%) were fully compliant, 112/549 (20.4%) reported less than one dietary transgression/month, and 56/549 (10.2%) reported at least one dietary transgression/month. Out of 549 patients, 18 (3.3%) patients developed complications under GFD (seven malignant and 11 nonmalignant complications). Fourteen patients were previously affected by classical CD (5.6% of the overall patients with classical CD), and four were affected by subclinical CD (1.5% of the overall patients with subclinical CD). None of the patients affected by silent CD developed complications. There was no statistical difference between the mean age of the two groups developing complications (P = n.s.). Complications appeared after a mean time under GFD of 6.5 years in classical CD, and after a mean time of 3.5 years in subclinical CD (P = n.s.). Finally, 6/14 (42.8%) patients with classical CD were not fully compliant to GFD, while 2/4 (50%) of subclinical CD patients were not fully compliant to GFD (P = n.s.). Less than 5% of CD patients may develop complications under GFD. Complications seem to affect more classical CD than subclinical CD, and seem to be irrespective of optimal GFD adherence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The benefits of serologic screening and early diagnosis of celiac disease in asymptomatic patients are not known. We investigated the impact of a gluten-free diet on self-perceived health and well-being in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 698 consecutive adults newly diagnosed with celiac disease because of classic (n = 490) or extraintestinal (n = 62) symptoms or through screening of at-risk groups (n = 146; 23 were asymptomatic and analyzed separately). The survey included questions on health and well-being; quality of life was evaluated by the psychological general well-being (PGWB) questionnaire. Patients were followed for 1 year of treatment; 110 healthy subjects served as controls. RESULTS: On a gluten-free diet, self-perceived health improved significantly among patients with classic symptoms and those detected by screening. Patients in all groups were equally concerned about their health before the diagnosis, but anxiety was alleviated by the gluten-free diet. At diagnosis, the quality of life reduced among all 3 groups but improved significantly among patients on the diet. Among the 23 asymptomatic patients, perception of health worsened and concern about health increased while they were on the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Self-perceived health and well-being were low among patients at the time they were diagnosed with celiac disease. Most patients benefited from a gluten-free diet, so it is important to identify patients with celiac disease. Perception of health decreased among asymptomatic cases, which discourages population-based screening.},

   abstract = {Collagenous sprue is associated with high morbidity; however, the etiology of this disorder is unclear. Data regarding the pathological and clinical manifestations of patients with collagenous sprue are also limited. We, thus, undertook this study to gain insight into the etiology, disease manifestations and outcomes of collagenous sprue. We searched our departmental database (1999-2008) to identify cases of collagenous sprue and to obtain clinical and laboratory data. Small bowel histology, including thickness of subepithelial collagen, intra-epithelial lymphocyte phenotype and results of T-cell clonality assays were evaluated. Nineteen patients (15 women, 4 men, age 22-80 years, mean 57 years) were identified. Seventeen (89%) had celiac disease and two had unclassified sprue; 9 of 17 (53%) celiac disease patients had refractory disease; 5 of 15 (33%) lacked diarrhea (atypical presentation), including 2 of 6 (33%) with active (untreated) celiac disease and 3 of 9 (33%) with refractory celiac disease. Autoimmune disorders were seen in 12 of 19 (63%) patients and microscopic colitis (n=7), lymphocytic gastritis (n=2) or collagenous gastritis (n=2) were seen in nine patients. Subepithelial collagen thickness was mildly (n=6), moderately (n=10), or markedly (n=3) increased and villous atrophy was total (n=13) or subtotal (n=6). Phenotypically aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes were not detected in any case. Polymerase chain reaction analysis showed a dominant T-cell clone in the only patient with refractory celiac disease type II. Histological improvement occurred in 7 of 11 (64%) patients. Overall, 8 of 19 (42%) responded to gluten-free diet, including 2 of 9 (22%) with refractory celiac disease and 10 responded to immunomodulatory therapy, including 6 of 9 (67%) with refractory celiac disease. Only one patient died from complications of refractory celiac disease. No patient developed lymphoma. The vast majority of our patients with collagenous sprue had celiac disease. Although, many patients required immunomodulatory therapy for symptom control, a subset responded to gluten-free diet alone. In our experience, collagenous sprue patients had relatively good clinical outcomes.},

   abstract = {More than 20 years of serological approach to diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) has deeply changed the classical clinical presentation of the disease, and some reports indicate that CD and obesity can coexist in both childhood and adolescence. We reviewed clinical records of 149 children with CD followed in our institution between 1991 and 2007, considering weight, height and body mass index (BMI), both at diagnosis and after at least 12 months of gluten-free diet (GFD). In all, 11% of patients had BMI z-score >+1 and 3% were obese (z-score >+2) at presentation. In our population, there was a significant (P=0.008) increase in BMI z-score after GFD and the percentage of overweight (z-score >+1) subjects almost doubled (11 vs 21%, P=0.03). Our data suggest the need for a careful follow-up of nutritional status after diagnosis of CD, especially addressing those who are already overweight at presentation.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: The symptoms and consequences of celiac disease usually resolve with a lifelong gluten-free diet. However, clinical presentation is variable and most patients presenting with abdominal symptoms in primary care will not have celiac disease and unnecessary diagnostic testing should be avoided. OBJECTIVE: To summarize evidence on the performance of diagnostic tests for identifying celiac disease in adults presenting with abdominal symptoms in primary care or similar settings. DATA SOURCES: A literature search via MEDLINE (beginning in January 1966) and EMBASE (beginning in January 1947) through December 2009 and a manual search of references for additional relevant studies. STUDY SELECTION: Diagnostic studies were selected if they had a cohort or nested case-control design, enrolled adults presenting with nonacute abdominal symptoms, the prevalence of celiac disease was 15% or less, and the tests used included gastrointestinal symptoms or serum antibody tests. DATA EXTRACTION: Quality assessment using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool and data extraction were performed by 2 reviewers independently. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated for each study and pooled estimates were computed using bivariate analysis if there was clinical and statistical homogeneity. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixteen studies were included in the review (N = 6085 patients). The performance of abdominal symptoms varied widely. The sensitivity of diarrhea, for example, ranged from 0.27 to 0.86 and specificity from 0.21 to 0.86. Pooled estimates for IgA antiendomysial antibodies (8 studies) were 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.95) for sensitivity and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98-1.00) for specificity (positive likelihood ratio [LR] of 171 and negative LR of 0.11). Pooled estimates for IgA antitissue transglutaminase antibodies (7 studies) were 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82-0.94) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95-0.99), respectively (positive LR of 37.7 and negative LR of 0.11). The IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies showed variable results, especially for sensitivity (range, 0.46-0.87 and range, 0.25-0.93, respectively). One recent study using diamidated gliadin peptides showed good specificity (> or = 0.94), but evidence is limited in this target population. CONCLUSION: Among adult patients presenting with abdominal symptoms in primary care or other unselected populations, IgA antitissue transglutaminase antibodies and IgA antiendomysial antibodies have high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mass screening for celiac disease is controversial. The objective of this study was to determine whether detection of childhood celiac disease by mass screening improves long-term health status and health-related quality of life. METHODS: We conducted a prospective 10-year follow-up study of 32 children who were aged 2 to 4 years, had celiac disease identified by mass screening, and had a gluten-free diet (19) or a normal gluten-containing diet (13). The follow-up included assessments of general health status, celiac disease-associated symptoms, celiac disease-associated serum antibodies, and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Ten years after mass screening, 81% of the children were adhering to a gluten-free diet. The health status improved in 66% of the treated children: in 41% by early treatment and in 25% by prevention of the gluten-dependent symptoms that they developed after diagnosis. For 19% of the children, treatment after screening would not have improved their health status, because they had no symptoms at screening and have remained symptom-free while consuming gluten. The health-related quality of life of the children with symptoms improved significantly after 1 year of gluten-free diet. Ten years after screening, the health-related quality of life of the children with celiac disease was similar to that of the reference population. CONCLUSION: Identification by mass screening led 10 years later to health improvement in 66% of children without deterioration of generic health-related quality of life. There is a good compliance after mass screening. In a research setting, delaying treatment for children without symptoms seems to be an option after a positive screening test. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to assess possible long-term complications in untreated, nonsymptomatic celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the small bowel that is characterized by increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and villous atrophy of the mucosa. It is unclear how often intraepithelial lymphocytosis in the absence of atrophy is a manifestation of gluten sensitive enteropathy. The objective of this study was to identify factors that discriminate patients with CD from those with lymphocytic duodenosis (LD, intraepithelial lymphocytosis without villous atrophy). We compared Class 2 HLA type, presenting symptoms, and serology in patients with LD and CD. METHODS: Retrospective review of 124 systematically assessed patients with LD compared with 454 CD patients with villous atrophy. All patients had duodenal biopsies and Class 2 HLA typing performed. HLA type, symptoms, serology pattern, and response to a gluten-free diet were analyzed using univariate logistic regression modeling, adjusted for age and gender. RESULTS: Half of the (63 (51%)) LD patients lack the Class 2 HLA genotypes encoding DQ2 or DQ8 whereas only 11 (2%) CD patients had neither DQ2 nor DQ8, P<0.001. The genes encoding DQ2 were much more prevalent in CD (91%) than that in LD (37%, P<0.001), however, the rate of carriage of DQ8 did not differ between the two groups (15% vs. 15%, P=0.9). Although diarrhea and weight loss were equally frequent in LD and CD patients, LD patients were less likely to be associated with anemia (P=0.007), malaise (P=0.006), skin disorder (P=0.007), or a family history of CD (P<0.001). The LD subjects were much less likely to have tissue transglutaminase or endomysial antibodies than were CD subjects (12% or 0% vs. 87% and 87%; P<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The LD cohort differs significantly in terms of HLA type, serology, and clinical features, suggesting that the majority of patients with LD do not belong in the spectrum of CD.},

All authors contributed to study design, data collection and analysis, and approved the final draft for submission. The corresponding author declares that the manuscript is submitted on behalf of all authors. BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The best mode of follow-up in celiac disease has not yet been established. The intention of this study was to clarify which noninvasive follow-up investigation - serological tests or intestinal permeability test (IPT) - correlates best with histology and whether the interval between diagnosis and follow-up affects the accuracy of these tests. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from adult patients with celiac disease (diagnosed between December 1989 and July 2006) followed up with biopsy, IPT, and serological tests [IgG anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA-IgG), AGA-IgA, and endomysial antibodies (EMA)] were retrieved from a computerized database. Results of noninvasive tests were compared with the persistence of villous atrophy on biopsy. Patients were divided into groups A, which comprised patients followed up within 2 years after diagnosis, and B, comprising patients followed up later than 2 years. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were evaluable. The lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio had a sensitivity of 85 % and a specificity of 46.2 % for mucosal atrophy, whereas saccharose excretion showed a sensitivity of 60 % and a specificity of 52.6 %. The sensitivities of AGA-IgA and AGA-IgG were 15 % and 20 %, respectively, while specificity was 100 % for both. Validity of AGA was limited due to low number of positive results. EMA assay was 50 % sensitive and 77.8 % specific. In group A (n = 23) L/M ratio performed best in terms of sensitivity (88.9 %), whereas EMA achieved a higher specificity (71.4 %). In group B, the sensitivity of the L/M ratio decreased to 85.7 %, while the specificity of EMA increased to 91.7 %. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, none of the noninvasive tests was an accurate substitute for follow-up biopsy in detecting severe mucosal damage.},

They reject quitting the diet as a valid option, and instead construct a 'diet world' in which dietary transgression is presented as an integrated part of everyday life. In this way, patients can manage occasional diet lapses without putting the validity of the diet itself at stake. By examining how the gluten-free diet is treated in interaction, we find out more about the pre-existing everyday strategies that have to be taken into account when new therapies are being introduced.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Celiac disease (CD) is a T cell-mediated chronic autoimmune enteropathy occurring in genetically susceptible individuals, and manifested by a permanent intolerance to gluten-containing products. CD commonly presents in children as failure to thrive and malabsorption or after screening high-risk groups such as people with diabetes. Almost half of adult patients with CD have a body mass index (BMI) >25 at diagnosis. Classic symptoms like diarrhea are less common in obese patients. Few children have been reported with CD and obesity. Because many children with newly diagnosed CD are identified by screening high-risk groups, obesity is more common than previously suspected. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of obesity at diagnosis in children with CD and to describe the clinical characteristics of this group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 143 patients with CD diagnosed between 1986 and 2003 at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. Data collected included patient's age, sex, ethnicity, presenting signs and symptoms, BMI, celiac antibody titers, small-intestinal biopsy results, and follow-up weight 1 year after initiating a gluten-free diet (GFD). RESULTS: Seven of the 143 (5%) patients had BMI >95th percentile. The most common presenting symptoms among obese patients were abdominal pain, diabetes, and diarrhea. Symptoms improved in all of the patients on a GFD. BMI decreased in 4 (50%), increased in 2 (25%), and was not available in 1 patient at 1 year after starting on GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is more common in children with CD than previously recognized. In the appropriate clinical setting, CD must be considered even in obese children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is characterized by persisting mucosal pathology in spite of a strict gluten free diet (GFD). In RCD type II, phenotypically aberrant (CD7+CD3-CD4/8-cytoplasmicCD3+) T-lymphocytes are present within the intraepitelial lymphocyte (IEL) population in the small intestine, and 50-60% of these patients develops an enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). AIM: To investigate whether aberrant T-lymphocytes in RCD II can be detected in other parts of the small intestinal mucosa besides the intraepithelial compartment. Additionally, the presence of aberrant T-lymphocytes was analyzed in two RCD II patients that developed atypical skin lesions. METHODS: Multiparameter flow cytometric immunophenotyping was performed on both IEL and lamina propria lymphocyte (LPL) cell suspensions, isolated from small bowel biopsy specimens of RCD II patients (n = 14), and on cutaneous lymphocytes isolated from skin-lesion biopsy specimens of RCD II patients (n = 2). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis of frozen RCD II derived small intestinal biopsies was performed. RESULTS: Our results clearly show that aberrant T-lymphocytes may be present in both the IEL and the LPL compartments of RCD II derived small intestinal biopsies. Although the highest percentages are always present in the IEL compartment, aberrant LPL can exceed 20% of total LPL in half the RCD II patients. Interestingly, cutaneous lymphocytes isolated from atypical skin lesions that developed in some RCD II patients showed a similar aberrant immunophenotype as found in the intestinal mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: In RCD II, the aberrant T-lymphocytes may also reside in the subepithelial layer of the small intestinal mucosa, in the lamina propria, and even in extraintestinal localizations including the skin. Whether this phenomenon represents a passive overflow from the intestinal epithelium or active trafficking towards other anatomical localizations remains to be elucidated. RCD II appears to be a disseminated disease, which may impose the risk of EATL development outside the intestine.},

This review examines the clinical and experimental evidence exploring the putative relationship between gluten sensitivity (GS) and the generation of GI symptoms. It explores the hypothesis that, in a proportion of patients, GS causes functional bowel disorder (FBD)-like symptoms. We propose a model for investigating and understanding the induction of GI symptoms and dysfunction by gluten in FBD and organic disease. We hypothesize that, even in the absence of fully developed celiac disease, gluten can induce symptoms similar to FBD. We discuss the hypothesis that GS and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) provide two triggers that can explain at least part of the spectrum that constitutes IBS, further advancing an understanding of the role of mucosal responses to luminal factors in FBDs. We propose that the animal model of GS in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)- DQ8 mice allows investigation of mucosal pathophysiological changes that occur before the onset of full-blown inflammation in a GS host. A better understanding of how gluten can cause symptoms in sensitive individuals will illuminate the interaction between host genotype, diet, and intestinal microbiota in generating one of the most common GI conditions.},

In order to confirm this issue in a larger cohort, rheumatic manifestations were analyzed in 21 adult celiac patients using a comprehensive clinical, laboratory and radiological analysis. The diagnosis of celiac disease was based on the histopathology of jejunal biopsy specimens. The mean duration of celiac disease was 15 (0-31) years. All patients were currently on gluten-free diet and none of the patients had gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of the study. Using various imaging techniques, involvement of the sacroiliac joints was confirmed in 70% of celiac patients. Imaging revealed different morphological changes in the sacroiliac joint, e.g. accumulation of synovial fluid, synovitis, erosion with concomitant sclerosis, sacroiliitis or calcification of the ligament. These changes probably represent different clinical stages and/or manifestations of the same process. In a follow-up study of eight patients, after 11 years on a gluten-free diet, the great majority of patients had no clinical symptoms; yet, a subclinical progression of the sacroiliac joint involvement could be verified. Our results suggest the importance of regular rheumatologic follow-up of patients with celiac disease.},

Epidemiological studies report that breastfeeding could protect from these diseases. However, data are controversial and the mechanisms unclear. Experimental data suggest that breastfeeding-induced protection might rely on tolerance induction as long as some criteria are fulfilled. Thus, the tolerogenic potential of breast milk would depend on maternal exposure to common environmental and dietary antigens and the efficiency of antigen transfer across mammary epithelium. Induction of tolerance upon breast milk-mediated antigen transfer will also depend on the presence of immunomodulatory factors in breast milk and of its impact on neonatal gut and immune system maturation. The better understanding of maternal influence on tolerance induction through breastfeeding should allow the development of new strategies to prevent immune-mediated diseases.},

Physiologically, this process is probably of central importance for preventing inflammatory responses to the numerous dietary and microbial antigens present in the gut. Defective oral tolerance can lead to gut inflammatory disease, food allergies, and celiac disease. In the last two cases, the diseases develop early in life, stressing the necessity of understanding how oral tolerance is set up in neonates. This article reviews the parameters that have been outlined in adult animal models as necessary for tolerance induction and assesses whether these factors operate in neonates. In addition, we highlight the factors that are specific for this period of life and discuss how they could have an impact on oral tolerance. We pay particular attention to maternal influence on early oral tolerance induction through breast-feeding and outline the major parameters that could be modified to optimize tolerance induction in early life and possibly prevent allergic diseases.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease (CD) is a common illness, affecting 0.5-1% of the population. Its classic presentation consists of gastrointestinal symptoms, however, many extra-intestinal symptoms and some associated diseases have been studied. Pediatricians should know the typical and atypical presentations of CD and how to diagnosis and treat its complications. The aim of this study was describe what pediatricians in Brazil know about CD. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional study with pediatricians who participated in the Nestle Pediatrics Course, in the city of Natal, Brazil, in 2008. They were asked to complete a self-applicable questionnaire covering aspects concerning the prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of CD and the conditions associated with this disease. RESULTS: A total of 632 pediatricians completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents (82.9%) were female. All the geographical regions of Brazil were represented. More than 65% of respondents had undergone specialist training in pediatrics, and 40% of respondents had worked as pediatricians for more than 25 years. Only 22% replied that celiac disease may be asymptomatic, 57% stated that antigliadin antibody measurement represents the best screening tool for the disease, and two-thirds replied that bowel biopsy would be the most indicated method. The pathologies and conditions associated with celiac disease were identified by fewer than 50% of respondents. Exclusion of gluten from the patient's diet was mentioned as the treatment for celiac disease by 86.4% of the pediatricians. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that pediatricians have superficial information about CD. The need for relevant information on celiac disease is fundamental and is recognized by the pediatricians themselves.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the Marsh-Oberhuber classification and a recently proposed classification may help to identify patients with latent CD. METHODS: Biopsy samples from twelve patients with latent CD (age range 3-32 years) defined as having normal duodenal mucosa when ingesting a free diet, and subsequently developing severe villous atrophy, were retrospectively reviewed in blind according to the Marsh-Oberhuber classification and the new grading system. RESULTS: In 67% of patients the Marsh-Oberhuber and the new classification could have yielded a diagnosis of CD soon after the first biopsy (3a-3c score when reviewed according to this classification, and B2 score when reviewed according to the new grading system), thereby avoiding further (up to two more in four cases) unnecessary endoscopic procedures. CONCLUSION: Both the Marsh-Oberhuber and the new classification allow to discriminate latent CD from patients with normal mucosa. Thus, these classifications may help in identifying and treating patients at an early stage.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The majority of patients with coeliac disease remain undetected world-wide. Finland has aimed at a high detection rate by training health personnel, and has advocated serologic screening for known coeliac disease risk groups. The purpose here was to assess whether this approach has been effective in clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was based on a prospective database of new coeliac patients aged 16 years or more, to whom the Social Insurance Institution had paid monthly compensation for the additional cost of maintaining a gluten-free diet since 2002. To obtain this compensation the diagnostic criteria for coeliac disease, including biopsy findings, had to be attested in a statement from a physician. The incidence and prevalence rates were calculated until the end of 2006. The total population aged 16 years or more was 4.31 million. RESULTS: In 2004-06, a total of 5020 persons (64% female) receiving a new dietary grant were identified through the database. The mean annual incidence of proven coeliac disease was thus 39 per 100,000 individuals. Altogether, 23,553 persons received the dietary grant. This gives a nation-wide point prevalence of adult coeliac disease of 0.55% (0.70% F, 0.38% M). There was a regional variation from 33 to 49 per 100,000 in the annual incidence and from 0.41% to 0.72% in the prevalence of coeliac disease. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, these figures for proven coeliac disease are the highest reported. Increased alertness to the condition and active case finding has made this efficient diagnostics possible.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate the predictive value of tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies for villous atrophy in adult and pediatric populations to determine if duodenal biopsy can be avoided. METHODS: A total of 324 patients with celiac disease (CD; 97 children and 227 adults) were recruited prospectively at two tertiary centers. Human IgA class anti-tTG antibody measurement and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed at diagnosis. A second biopsy was performed in 40 asymptomatic adults on a gluten-free diet (GFD) and with normal tTG levels. RESULTS: Adults showed less severe histopathology (26% vs 63%, P < 0.0001) and lower tTG antibody titers than children. Levels of tTG antibody correlated with Marsh type in both populations (r = 0.661, P < 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression revealed that only tTG antibody was an independent predictor for Marsh type 3 lesions, but clinical presentation type and age were not. A cut-off point of 30 U tTG antibody yielded the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.854). Based on the predictive value of this cut-off point, up to 95% of children and 53% of adults would be correctly diagnosed without biopsy. Despite GFDs and decreased tTG antibody levels, 25% of the adults did not recover from villous atrophy during the second year after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Strongly positive tTG antibody titers might be sufficient for CD diagnosis in children. However, duodenal biopsy cannot be avoided in adults because disease presentation and monitoring are different.},

   abstract = {Abnormalities of liver function are one of the manifold extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease. Although the spectrum of liver manifestations associated with celiac disease is particularly wide, two main forms of liver damage namely, cryptogenic and autoimmune, appear to be strictly related to gluten-sensitive enteropathy. The most frequent finding is represented by a cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia, observed in about a half of untreated celiac patients, as an expression of a mild liver dysfunction with a histological picture of nonspecific reactive hepatitis (celiac hepatitis) reverting to normal after 6-12 months of a strict gluten-free diet. In a few cases, when celiac disease is diagnosed, a more severe liver injury, characterized by a cryptogenic chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis, is present. In these patients, liver damage can still improve after a gluten-free diet institution. Moreover, a close association between celiac disease and autoimmune liver disorders has been widely demonstrated. Indeed, celiac disease has been found in 3-7% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, in 3-6% with autoimmune hepatitis, and in 2-3% with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Differently from cryptogenic liver injury, autoimmune liver dysfunction, found in celiac disease, does not usually improve after a gluten-free diet. Presently, it is difficult to establish if the two main kinds of liver injury found in celiac disease (cryptogenic and autoimmune) are discrete entities with a different pathogenesis or if they are an expression of the same disorder where genetic factors and the duration of gluten exposure may determine the severity and the pattern of liver injury.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) can be associated with a variety of extraintestinal manifestations, including neurological diseases. A new neurological correlation has been found between CD and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). OBJECTIVE: To verify the association between SNHL and CD, and to establish whether the neurological hearing impairment in CD is related to nonorgan-specific and antineuronal antibodies, as well as the presence of autoimmune disorders. METHODS: A sample of 59 consecutive biopsy- and serologically proven CD patients were studied. Among CD patients, 11 were newly diagnosed and 48 were on a gluten-free diet. Hearing function was assessed by audiometric analysis in all CD patients as well as in 59 age- and sex-matched controls. Patients were tested for a panel of immune markers including nonorgan-specific autoantibodies and antineuronal antibodies. RESULTS: SNHL was detected in five CD patients (8.5%) and in two controls (3.4%). In one patient, the SNHL was bilateral, whereas the remaining four had a monolateral impairment. The prevalence of SNHL was not significantly different between CD patients and controls. At least one of the antibodies tested for was positive in two of the five CD patients with SNHL and in 12 of the 54 CD patients without SNHL. Antineuronal antibodies to central nervous system antigens were consistently negative in the five CD patients with SNHL. Only one of the five CD patients with SNHL had Hashimoto thyroiditis. CONCLUSIONS: SNHL and CD occur coincidentally. Hearing function should be assessed only in CD patients with clinical signs of hearing deficiency.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is increasing in prevalence, which is currently estimated at one in 100 of the population and may occur de novo in adults. The diagnosis requires a joint clinicopathological approach; the recommended first-line test is serology with immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase and IgA endomysial antibodies. These serological tests show high levels of sensitivity and specificity, but biopsy is the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis. It is important that both tests are performed before the introduction of a gluten-free diet. Although the classical histopathology changes of coeliac disease with partial or total villous atrophy are well recognized, the pathology classification of coeliac disease is changing, with recognition that coeliac disease may show minimal pathology (normal architecture and an intraepithelial lymphocyte count/100 enterocytes >/= 25). This entity is also described as lymphocytic duodenosis, and recommendation of follow-up serology testing is paramount in this condition. Follow-up of patients with coeliac disease is warranted, as normal serology does not predict mucosal recovery. Failure to heal predicts risk of progression to refractory coeliac disease and malignancies. Refractory coeliac disease occurs in 1-2% of patients and this diagnosis requires a combined clinical and histopathology approach with immunocytochemistry.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The coexistence of cystic fibrosis (CF) and celiac disease (CD) has been reported. To our knowledge there is no study directly comparing the incidence of CD in CF patients to that in the general population at the same time. There is no published data on genetic predisposition to CD in CF patients either. Therefore, in the present study we aimed to assess the genetic predisposition to CD and its incidence in CF patients comparing it to data from the general population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty-two CF patients were enrolled in the study. In 230 CF patients the genetic predisposition to CD (the presence of HLA-DQ2/ DQ8) was assessed. In all CF patients, serological screening for CD was conducted. In patients with positive antiendomysial antibodies (EMA) gastroduenoscopy was offered. Intestinal histology was classified according to modified Marsh criteria. The results of serological CD screening in 3235 Polish schoolchildren and HLA-DQ typing in 200 healthy subjects (HS) were used for comparison. RESULTS: Positive EMA was found in 2.84% of the studied CF patients. The incidence of proven CD was 2.13%. The incidence of CD as well as positive serological screening were significantly more frequent in the CF group than in the general population. The frequency of CD-related HLA-DQ alleles in CF and HS did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic predisposition to celiac disease in cystic fibrosis patients is similar to that of the general population. However, our results suggest that cystic fibrosis is a risk factor for celiac disease development.},

METHODS: Inpatients of the pediatric hospitals in Shanghai, Jinan, Wuhan and Chengdu who were diagnosed as chronic diarrhea were recruited from Jan. 2005 to Dec. 2008. Their clinical history, physical examination and laboratory data were collected. The SPSS version 11.5 statistical package for Microsoft Windows was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Data of 199 patients and finally enrolled 118 hospitalized chronic diarrhea inpatients during the observation period were collected and 14 (12%) of the chronic diarrhea patients were suspected as having celiac disease and in one the diagnosis of celiac disease was confirmed. Gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment was effective. M/F: 12/2, the age ranged from 6 months to 12 years; 43% (6/14) had malnutrition, 29% (4/14) had anemia, villous atrophy was found in 4 patients by endoscopy. Duodenal biopsies revealed stage I in 1, stage II in 2, stage IIIa in 7, stage IIIb in 3 and stage IIIc in 1 patient according to the modified Marsh classification. CONCLUSION: This study was the first time to report the research of celiac disease in children with chronic diarrhea in China. The percentage of suspicious celiac disease patients was 12% (14/118) in children and one was confirmed. CD exists in China. Chinese pediatricians should pay attention to the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A small fraction of dietary protein survives enzymatic degradation and is absorbed in potentially antigenic form. This can trigger inflammatory responses in patients with celiac disease or food allergies, but typically induces systemic immunological tolerance (oral tolerance). At present it is not clear how dietary antigens are absorbed. Most food staples, including those with common antigens such as peanuts, eggs, and milk, contain long-chain triglycerides (LCT), which stimulate mesenteric lymph flux and postprandial transport of chylomicrons through mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and blood. Most dietary antigens, like ovalbumin (OVA), are emulsifiers, predicting affinity for chylomicrons. We hypothesized that chylomicron formation promotes intestinal absorption and systemic dissemination of dietary antigens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Absorption of OVA into MLN and blood was significantly enhanced when OVA was gavaged into fasted mice together with LCT compared with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), which do not stimulate chylomicron formation. The effect of LCT was blocked by the addition of an inhibitor of chylomicron secretion, Pluronic L-81. Adoptively transferred OVA-specific DO11.10 T-cells proliferated more extensively in peripheral lymph nodes when OVA was gavaged with LCT than with MCT or LCT plus Pluronic L-81, suggesting that dietary OVA is systemically disseminated. Most dietary OVA in plasma was associated with chylomicrons, suggesting that these particles mediate systemic antigen dissemination. Intestinal-epithelial CaCo-2 cells secreted more cell-associated, exogenous OVA when stimulated with oleic-acid than with butyric acid, and the secreted OVA appeared to be associated with chylomicrons. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Postprandial chylomicron formation profoundly affects absorption and systemic dissemination of dietary antigens. The fat content of a meal may affect immune responses to dietary antigens by modulating antigen absorption and transport.},

Often, RLS negatively affects quality of life but may remain undiagnosed. This study evaluated the association between celiac disease and RLS. RESULTS: The incidence of RLS among 85 patients with celiac disease was 35%, with a prevalence of 25% compared with 10% of spouses (P<0.02). In 79% of patients with RLS and celiac disease, neuromuscular symptoms began during or after onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. Iron deficiency was present in 40% of celiac patients with active RLS compared with 6% of patients without RLS (P<0.001). After 6 months of a gluten-free diet, RLS symptoms improved in 50% of 28 patients. CONCLUSION: Screening for celiac disease in patients with RLS is important since this commonly overlooked silent disease may be a correctable factor for some patients with idiopathic RLS.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammation is strongly associated with approximately 1/5th of all human cancers. Arising from combinations of factors such as environmental exposures, diet, inherited gene polymorphisms, infections, or from dysfunctions of the immune response, chronic inflammation begins as an attempt of the body to remove injurious stimuli; however, over time, this results in continuous tissue destruction and promotion and maintenance of carcinogenesis. Here we focus on intestinal inflammation and its associated cancers, a group of diseases on the rise and affecting millions of people worldwide. Intestinal inflammation can be widely grouped into inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and celiac disease. Long-standing intestinal inflammation is associated with colorectal cancer and small-bowel adenocarcinoma, as well as extraintestinal manifestations, including lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. This article highlights potential mechanisms of pathogenesis in inflammatory bowel diseases and celiac disease, as well as those involved in the progression to associated cancers, most of which have been identified from studies utilizing mouse models of intestinal inflammation. Mouse models of intestinal inflammation can be widely grouped into chemically induced models; genetic models, which make up the bulk of the studied models; adoptive transfer models; and spontaneous models. Studies in these models have lead to the understanding that persistent antigen exposure in the intestinal lumen, in combination with loss of epithelial barrier function, and dysfunction and dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Transcriptional changes in this environment leading to cell survival, hyperplasia, promotion of angiogenesis, persistent DNA damage, or insufficient repair of DNA damage due to an excess of proinflammatory mediators are then thought to lead to sustained malignant transformation. With regards to extraintestinal manifestations such as lymphoma, however, more suitable models are required to further investigate the complex and heterogeneous mechanisms that may be at play.},

We examined the markers related to Treg cells, and bacterial signaling, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR)-2 and -4, in the duodenal mucosa of patients with food allergy (FA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Small intestinal samples were collected from patients with FA on a normal or an elimination diet, from healthy controls and patients with untreated celiac disease. Single and double immunohistochemistry were used to enumerate the densities of Foxp3-positive cells and TLR2- and TLR4-positive cells in the mucosa and evaluate the colocalization of Foxp3 expression in CD4, CD25, and CTLA-4 cells. The mRNA expression of CD25, Foxp3, TLR2, and TLR4 was measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The densities of Foxp3 and TLR4 cells were significantly increased in patients with untreated FA compared with healthy controls (P = 0.003, P = 0.033), and the Foxp3 cells were higher in untreated than in treated allergic patients (P < 0.001). The immense majority of Foxp3 cells were CD4 (median 100%), CTLA-4 (100%), or CD25 (81%). The ratio of Foxp3 mRNA to Foxp3 cells was decreased in patients with FA and in patients with celiac disease compared with controls (P = 0.036, P = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Foxp3 cells are increased in the duodenum of patients with untreated FA, but these cells are not able to suppress the harmful immune response, indicated by the low expression of Foxp3 transcripts. The increase of TLR4 cells and their correlation with TCRgammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes suggest a role for the innate immunity and intestinal microbiota in FA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease affects about 1% of the population, with the majority being undetected. As a consequence, there have been calls for the introduction of screening. Before screening is given serious consideration, it is important to assess how acceptable early diagnoses and treatment would be. AIM: To assess patients' views as to the diagnosis and treatment of disease. METHODS: Coeliac disease patients who had taken a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months (mean 60 months) were mailed a questionnaire. Coeliac patients presenting with typical classical symptoms were compared with those diagnosed without such symptoms. RESULTS: Overall, 83% (147/177) of coeliac patients returned the questionnaires. Two-thirds (68%, 101/147) reported that their dietary restrictions reduced their enjoyment of food; 46% (68/147) believed their food cost them more and estimated this to be an extra 10 pounds sterling (16 euros) per week. Of those reporting greater cost, 31 (21%) said this was a problem for them. Half (54%, 80/147) reported doing things they enjoyed less often because of their diet, with the most common activity sacrificed being dining out (n = 65). In spite of these findings, 81% (119/147) reported being pleased that they were diagnosed, with 66% (59/89) of cases with classical symptoms wishing they had been diagnosed earlier compared with 45% (23/51) of those without such symptoms (chi(2) = 6.0, P < .05). In contrast, 27% (14/51) of coeliacs diagnosed without classical symptoms regretted being diagnosed with their condition compared with 10% (9/89) of those with classical symptoms (chi(2) = 7.1, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Even after several years of a gluten-free diet, many patients with coeliac disease regard it as a substantial burden, with a quarter of screen detected patients reporting regret at being diagnosed. Our findings question how acceptable screening for coeliac disease would be in people with minimal or no symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The only therapy for coeliac disease (CD) is a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD). Little is known about the detailed composition of such a diet. AIM: To clarify the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it with a non-GFD diet in representative non-CD populations. METHODS: A total of 139 consecutive patients with CD were invited to fill in a prospective validated 5-day food diary, of whom data from 93 were analysed. Results were compared with data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey of Adults and the UK Women's Cohort Study (UKWCS). RESULTS: Individuals consuming a strict GFD generally had similar intakes of energy and nutrients to those of comparison populations, but a higher proportion of carbohydrate intake was obtained from nonmilk extrinsic sugars and intakes of nonstarch polysaccharides were low. Compared with the UKWCS sample, female patients adhering to a GFD had lower intakes of magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, selenium and folate. In male patients, intakes of magnesium and selenium were particularly low. CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforces the need for clinicians to recognize that avoidance of gluten cannot be the sole focus of a gluten-free diet. Maintenance of adequate intakes of essential nutrients and in particular complex carbohydrates must also be the goal for patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a prospective screening strategy for the early diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) in children with Down syndrome (DS). STUDY DESIGN: Blood samples were taken from 155 children with DS. Buccal swabs were also taken from 9 of these children for determination of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 positivity. Independently, immunoglobulin A anti-endomysium-(EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (TGA) were tested. An intestinal biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis of CD. RESULTS: Sixty-three children (40.6%) had test results that were positive for HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. Results of HLA DQ-typing of DNA isolated from blood and buccal swabs were identical. Eight of the children in whom test results were positive for HLA-DQ2/8 also had positive test results for EMA and TGA. CD was confirmed in 7 of these children with an intestinal biopsy, and in 1 child, CD was suggested with improvement on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: We found a prevalence of CD in children with DS of 5.2% (10 times higher than the general Dutch population). We recommend HLA-DQ2/8 typing from buccal swabs in the first year of life and initiating serologic screening of children with DS in whom test results are positive for HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 at age 3 years. Early knowledge of negative HLA-DQ2/8 status can reassure most parents that their children do not have a CD risk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: no systematic studies on the prevalence of coeliac disease (CD) have been reported from China. In western populations CD is more common in patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). We have screened patients with these conditions presenting to the outpatient department of a large hospital of "Traditional Chinese Medicine" (TCM) in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, P.R. China. METHODS: we tested sera of 78 unrelated Han Chinese patients (5 IDDM and 73 D-IBS), using ELISA serological tests for IgG anti-gliadin antibodies (IgG-AGA) and IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA-tTG). RESULTS: six out of 78 patients (7.7%) were positive for IgG-AGA (two men and four women) and two (2.6%) were positive for IgA-tTGs. One of the latter patients was negative for IgG-AGA. Besides, one patient had a dubious IgA-tTG antibody and a positive IgG-AGA. None of the six patients agreed to undergo duodenal biopsy. Two out of these six patients followed a gluten-free diet for one year. In one patient the diarrhoea ceased and his body weight increased. Another stopped losing weight. CONCLUSIONS: this study previously published as a letter in GUT (Wu J, Xia B, von Blomberg BME, Zhao C, Yang XW, Crusius JBA, Pena AS. Coeliac disease: emerging in China? Gut 2010; 59(3): 418-9) demonstrated that CD may exist in the Jiangsu province of P.R. China. The present article draws attention to the difficulties of following a standard protocol in China such as established in western countries and highlights important factors less well known in the west in relation to the development of CD in China. Wheat production became significant in China between 1600 and 1300 B.C. After the Han dynasty (500-200 B.C.), wheat was one of the main cereals in China. One the major wheat fields in China is located in the Jiangsu province where the research for this article was performed. A review of Chinese literature shows that the predominant HLA-DQ CD risk alleles and haplotypes are present in the Jiangsu province. Genetic background, food consumption, and the results of our study suggest that CD should actively be investigated in P.R. China.},

We hypothesize that selective sympathetic stimulation of the upper gastrointestinal tract will preserve the advantages of systemic sympathetic stimulation without its adverse events. This study evaluated the effect of splanchnic nerve stimulation on metabolic rate, food intake, and body composition. METHODS: Sixteen Sprague Dawley rats had monopolar electrodes placed on the superior common splanchnic nerve innervating the celiac ganglia. An indifferent electrode was placed subcutaneously on the back. The animals were placed on a 60% fat diet, and eight rats were stimulated for 6 weeks. The stimulation was advanced over 3 days from 0.6 mA to 3 mA. Metabolic rate and food intake were measured daily; weight change was monitored weekly, and body composition was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at the end of the study. Four of the eight animals had metabolic rate measured three times over 2-day periods at 0 mA, 1 mA, and 3 mA of stimulation in a metabolic chamber. RESULTS: Except for the first week of stimulation, there was no difference in body weight between the stimulated and control groups. Cumulative food intake was less in the stimulated group (p<0. 001). The lean-to-fat ratio was greater in the stimulated group (p<0. 01), and the animals that received incremental stimulation showed significantly augmented metabolic rate (p<0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Splanchnic nerve stimulation decreased food intake, increased metabolic rate, and improved body composition.},

CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of malaise, weight loss, abdominal swelling and lower limb edema. His paraclinical tests revealed pancytopenia, large ascites, splenomegaly and esophageal varices consistent with portal hypertension. Duodenal biopsy and serologic findings were compatible with celiac disease. His symptoms improved on a gluten-free diet, but his clinical course was further complicated with ulcerative jejunoileitis, and intestinal T-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSION: It seems that celiac disease, by an increased immune reaction in the splenoportal axis, can result in the development of idiopathic portal hypertension in susceptible affected patients.},

METHODS: The sera of 288 consecutive patients with Behcet's disease were screened with anti-endomysial antibody and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody for celiac disease. Those with a positive test underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsies to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease. The patients with celiac disease were put on a gluten free diet to evaluate its efficacy on the improvement of their lesions. RESULTS: Fourteen patients had positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody test (two with positive anti-endomysial antibody as well). Duodenal biopsies showed findings compatible with Marsh 3 in one and Marsh 1 in three other patients. All the diagnosed patients with celiac disease responded to the gluten free diet. CONCLUSION: Our findings didn't support any association between celiac disease and Behcet's disease in Iranian patients compared to the general population of Iran.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an antibody-mediated enteropathy that presents permanent intolerance to ingested gluten. Currently, only one kind of treatment is available: the complete dietary elimination of all sources of gluten. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of replacing gluten with psyllium on sensory characteristics of bread dough and to compare the chemical, nutritional, technological, and sensory characteristics of the modified preparations. This study is experimental and was subdivided into five steps: selection and development of preparation, chemical analysis, sensory analysis, and statistical analysis. Modified samples of the bread dough achieved a 93.0% acceptance rate for individuals with celiac disease and up to 97.0% for individuals without celiac disease. The most affected characteristics were odor and texture. In terms of chemical composition of the bread dough, energy was reduced by 32.1% and the fat fraction was 42.3% before being cooked. Data obtained from sensory analysis of psyllium doughs indicate that the products had good acceptance by individuals with celiac disease as well as by individuals without celiac disease. This suggests that psyllium can replace gluten in preparations. Furthermore, in terms of chemical composition, products made with modified dough had less fat and fewer calories.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little information is available on the effect of a follow-up strategy in celiac disease patients during gluten-free diet. AIMS: To assess 5 year time course of t-transglutaminase antibodies (t-TG) in celiac disease patients enrolled in a community based follow-up program. METHODS: Annual t-TG testing and periodical clinic visit in 2245 patients. RESULTS: Proportion of patients with negative t-TG progressively increased from 83% to 93% during the 5-year follow-up: poor adherence to gluten-free diet (HR 4.764), long duration of gluten-free diet (HR 0.929) and female gender (HR 1.472) were independently associated with serological outcome. In individual patients, 69% tested t-TG "persistently negative", 1% "persistently positive" and 30% "intermittently negative or positive". By applying mathematical modelling to t-TG conversion rates observed in this latter group at beginning and end of the follow-up program, the predicted proportion of t-TG negative population increased from 90% to 95% over 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Time-course of t-TG serology in the community fluctuates in 1/3 of celiac disease patients suggesting inconstant adherence to gluten-free diet and need of follow-up strategy. Periodical serological and clinical follow-up is a viable and efficacious strategy to promote adherence to gluten-free diet as inferred from time-course of t-TG serology.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Celiac disease is an extremely common, although underdiagnosed, disorder. Knowledge about the varied clinical manifestations and the proper approach to screening and diagnosing celiac disease will lead to appropriate early intervention in affected children RECENT FINDINGS: New age-dependent algorithms are emerging to properly screen for celiac disease. There is new evidence on the patchy nature of celiac disease supporting the practice of multiple duodenal biopsies including the bulb of the duodenum. Therapeutic dietary compliance, particularly in asymptomatic children, can be poor, and therefore, the involvement of a dietician trained in celiac disease is instrumental in keeping patients up to date with dietary guidelines and to improve their compliance to the diet. Expanding knowledge about the pathogenesis of celiac disease has led to the development of investigational therapeutic alternatives to the gluten-free diet. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating methods of celiac disease prevention in at-risk infants. SUMMARY: This review aims at outlining the different manifestations of celiac disease in children as well as a step-wise approach to screen and diagnose the disease. A better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of celiac disease is paving the way to innovative diagnostic tools, preventive strategies, and therapeutic interventions alternative to a gluten-free diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Qiyao Xiaoke Capsule (QXC, a Chinese preparation for invigorating qi and nourishing yin) on glycolipid metabolism in the liver and skeletal muscle of rats with catch-up growth (CUG) induced by high-fat diet. METHODS: CUG model rats were made by limiting forge followed by high-fat diet, and intervened with different dosages [1.8 (g/kg x d), 0.6 g/(kg x d)] of QXC. And the experiment was controlled with pioglitazone. Levels of blood glucose, serum free fatty acid (FFA), serum insulin (Fins), plasma adiponcetin (AC) and insulin resistance index (IRI) as well as the weights of peri-epididymis and peri-renal fat and their ratio to body weight were observed 8 weeks later. The contents of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and liver were also determined. RESULTS: Insulin resistance in CUG rats can be induced by high-fat diet. Compared with the un-treated model rats, levels of Fins and AC were higher, IRI and FFA were lower in CUG rats after intervened by QXC (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Moreover, QXC at large dose showed the effects of reducing TG content in liver and skeletal muscle, advancing the glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, displaying an efficacy similar to that of pioglitazone (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: QXC could improve the glycolipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced CUG rats through different pathways of intervention to alleviate/delay the occurrence and development of insulin resistance in the liver and skeletal muscle.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an intolerance to dietary proteins of wheat, barley, and rye. CD may have substantial morbidity, yet it is quite common with a prevalence of 1%-2% in Western populations. It is not clear why the CD phenotype is so prevalent despite its negative effects on human health, especially because appropriate treatment in the form of a gluten-free diet has only been available since the 1950s, when dietary gluten was discovered to be the triggering factor. The high prevalence of CD might suggest that genes underlying this disease may have been favored by the process of natural selection. We assessed signatures of selection for ten confirmed CD-associated loci in several genome-wide data sets, comprising 8154 controls from four European populations and 195 individuals from a North African population, by studying haplotype lengths via the integrated haplotype score (iHS) method. Consistent signs of positive selection for CD-associated derived alleles were observed in three loci: IL12A, IL18RAP, and SH2B3. For the SH2B3 risk allele, we also show a difference in allele frequency distribution (Fst) between HapMap phase II populations. Functional investigation of the effect of the SH2B3 genotype in response to lipopolysaccharide and muramyl dipeptide revealed that carriers of the SH2B3 rs3184504*A risk allele showed stronger activation of the NOD2 recognition pathway. This suggests that SH2B3 plays a role in protection against bacteria infection, and it provides a possible explanation for the selective sweep on SH2B3, which occurred sometime between 1200 and 1700 years ago.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a chronic disease with a various clinical presentation, including anxiety and depression. AIM: To investigate the quality of sleep in coeliac disease. METHODS: The participants were coeliacs at diagnosis; coeliacs on a gluten-free diet at follow-up and healthy volunteers. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), SF36, Zung and Fatigue scales and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS: The PSQI score was higher in coeliacs at diagnosis and in a gluten-free diet than in healthy volunteers (P < 0.001). A gluten-free diet did not improve the PSQI score (P = 0.245) in coeliac disease. The other test scores were similar between coeliacs at diagnosis and those on a gluten-free diet, whereas significant differences were found between coeliacs and volunteers. PSQI score was inversely associated with the quality of the physical (r = -0.327, P = 0.002) and mental (r = -0.455, P < 0.001) component scores. The sleep quality scores were related to depression (r = 0.633, P < 0.001), fatigue (r = 0.377, P < 0.001), state anxiety (r = 0.484, P < 0.001) and trait anxiety (r = 0.467, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disorders are common in coeliac disease not only at diagnosis but also during treatment with a gluten-free diet. Sleep disorders are related to depression, anxiety and fatigue, and inversely related to quality of life scale scores.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (nontropical sprue) is autoimmune disorder of the intestinal mucose, which usually develops in humans hypersensitive to gluten. The disease can occur at any age, with the greatest occurrence in early adulthood. Besides intestinal symptomatology--abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss--celiac disease is often accompanied by extra-intestinal complications including osteopenia or osteoporosis and osteomalacia. Overproduction of cytokines IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha increases bone resorption, which is further accelerated by hyperparathyroidism connected with malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D. Interaction of both these mechanisms activated bone loss. Similarly as the classic (symptomatic) celiac disease, the occult form, commonly seen in the elderly, may be associated with a risk of osteoporosis or osteomalacia related fractures. Diagnosis is based on positivity of IgA and IgG antigliadin and endomysial antibodies and characteristic endoscopic detection of inflammation and atrophy of duodenal mucose. Areal screening of celiac disease in osteoporotic patients is very dubious. However, a methodical examination should be performed in all patients with unexplainable hyperparathyroidism or in those with various autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, thyroiditis chronica), or in premenopausal women and men, who did not reach the appropriate peak bone mass. On the other hand, detailed analysis of calcium metabolism, including markers of bone remodlling and X-ray densitometry (DXA), are recommended in all patients with verified celiac disease. The effectiveness of a gluten-free diet and substitution with vitamin D and calcium, or treatment with bisphosphonates are discussed. The promising therapy appears to be new molecules with reparative effect on intestinal mucose such as AT-1001.},

However, we found that denatured sera from healthy persons also showed reactivity against TG2. METHODS: To further examine the specificity of this phenomenon, sera of healthy individuals and celiac patients were denatured by heat or pH shift. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Denatured sera of all individuals showed autoantibodies against TG2 in ELISA that could be specifically inhibited by TG2, but the biological role of these autoantibodies remains unknown. The alpha fibrinogen precursor could be isolated as serum protein that reacts with TG2 antibodies and treated sera reacted with fibrinogen in Western blotting. Cross-reactivity of TG2 antibodies with fibrinogen and vice versa was observed. CONCLUSION: We hypothesise that denaturation of sera reveals hidden autoantibodies against TG2, which might be normally masked by fibrinogen.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is increasingly recognized autoimmune enteropathy caused by a permanent gluten intolerance. Gluten is the main storage protein of wheat, in genetically predisposed individuals. Celiac disease risk in first degree relatives is about 10%. Diarrhea and changes of bowel movement, observed as well in celiac disease as in IBS, may lead to misdiagnosis of IBS basing on the Rome criteria or may be associated with coexistence of both diseases. The aim of the study was to assess the celiac disease prevalence in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The study group comprised 200 patients (120 women and 80 men) aged 18-78 years (mean: 46.7 years) with diarrhoeal form of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), according to the Rome criteria II. At the beginning and after a three month period anti tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA tTG) were estimated. Gastroscopy with biopsy where performed in those with IgA tTG titre above 1/200. 40 patients were immunologically positive and 14 of them have histopathologically proven celiac disease. In the group of patients with detected celiac disease, gluten free diet was applied besides the treatment with trimebutin or mebewerin, recommended for IBS. After 6 months the decrease of IgA tTG titre in the serum was observed. In 5 of these patients IgA tTG level was negative. It was associated with the significant decrease of clinical symptoms, such as diarrhea and flatulence. The remaining symptoms, such as abdominal pain, feeling of incomplete defecation demanded continuation of IBS treatment. With regard to often atypical celiac disease symptoms--adult active searching should be performed to differentiate from irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Coeliac disease (gluten enteropathy) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of autoimmune etiology in genetically predisposed individuals. It is the most frequent enteropathy with frequency of 1/100 and 1/300 in the adult population in America and Europe respectively. Typical form of celiac disease including abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea is quite rare in adults. In some coeliac patients, symptoms persist in spite of strict gluten free diet. One of the reasons of this is interference of the autoimmune diseases. Results of our studies revealed in the group of 110 patients with diagnosed gluten enteropathy, coexistence of autoimmune disease, such as diabetes mellitus type 1 in 7.2% cases, hyperthyreosis on 1.8% of cases, vitiligo in 0.9% of cases, primary biliary cirrhosis in 2% of cases and rheumatoidal arthritis in 0,9 of cases. In the group of 80 ulcerative colitis patients, coexistence of celiac disease basing on serological histopatological investigation was found in 4 patients (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Coexistence of coeliac disease with other autoimmune diseases is quite frequent. Gluten enteropathy symptoms may be interpreted as originating from other autoimmune disease. It can delay the diagnosis of celiac disease and introduction of gluten free diet, which improves the quality of life and protects from dangerous GI complications.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (gluten enteropathy) is chronic immunomediated disorder of gastrointestinal tract in genetically predisposed patients. We present the case of 46 years old man, with already diagnosed several autoimmune disorders, such as: diabetes mellitus LADA type, Graves-Basedow disease and vitiligo. Despite treatment of the above diseases, diarrhea and persistent abdominal pain was observed. Diagnosis of gluten enteropathy based on serology and histological evaluation of biopsies from distal part of duodenum enabled us to introduce gluten free diet, which contributed to attenuation of symptoms and better control of glucose serum levels. We think, that celiac disease should be taken into the consideration in differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea and persistent abdominal pain, especially in patients with coexisting autoimmune diseases.},
