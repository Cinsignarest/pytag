   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low-grade mucosal inflammation and immune activation are involved in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Furthermore, IBS symptoms are associated with a significantly higher prevalence of psychological distress, which in itself results into an impaired quality of life (QoL). Vitamin D could ameliorate the symptoms of patients suffering from IBS through its beneficial effects on psychological factors and inflammation. METHODS: A total of 90 IBS patients participated in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Participants were randomly selected to receive either 50 000 IU vitamin D3 or a placebo fortnightly for a period of 6 months. Patients reported their IBS symptoms at the baseline and monthly during intervention periods. The IBS severity score system (IBSSS) and IBS-specific QoL questionnaires were used at the baseline and postintervention. KEY RESULTS: Over the 6-month intervention period, a significantly greater improvement in IBS symptoms such as abdominal pain and distention, flatulence, rumbling, and overall gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (except dissatisfaction with bowel habits) was observed in the patients receiving vitamin D as compared to the placebo group. The IBSSS and the IBS-QoL scores in the vitamin D group significantly improved compared to the placebo group postintervention (mean IBSSS score change: -53.82 +/- 23.3 vs -16.85 +/- 25.01, p < 0.001, respectively; mean IBS-QoL score change: 14.26 +/- 3 vs 11 +/- 2.34, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Vitamin D seems to be an effective and safe option to improve QoL and symptoms of IBS. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02579902).},

   abstract = {The present study is to determine the prevalence and implication of coeliac disease (CD) among adult Saudis and compared to those with diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome. This prospective study was conducted among 980 adults. Out of that, 482 subjects (staff and students of Riyadh Health Science College) were designated as control cohorts for undetected coeliac disease. Furthermore, another contingent of 498 subjects diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) at Prince Salman Hospital and Al-Iman General Hospital also constituted a segment of the overall initial 1020 subjects. Both cases and control were tested for serological markers of coeliac disease (tissues transglutaminase (tTGAs) and endomysial autoantibody (EMAs) and were confirmed by histopathology test. All the positive for cases of coeliac disease were screened for iron deficiency anaemia, Vitamin D deficiency, and osteoporosis and weight assessment. The percentage of coeliac disease in control subjects and patients diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were found to be 1.9% and 9.6% respectively, about 38% of the total coeliac disease patients are among females of middle age (20-39-years) and 16% of the males in the same age range. Whereas, 20% and 25% of all coeliac disease cases with ages of 40-59 were remarked as females and males respectively. The identical nature and overlap of symptoms of the two conditions could possibly result in misdiagnosis of coeliac diseases or over-diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome. The findings of the study might also give considerable implications of the disease in the nutritional level which is noticeable.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Higher coffee intake has been purportedly related to a lower risk of liver cancer. However, it remains unclear whether this association may be accounted for by specific biological mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the potential mediating roles of inflammatory, metabolic, liver injury, and iron metabolism biomarkers on the association between coffee intake and the primary form of liver cancer-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DESIGN: We conducted a prospective nested case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition among 125 incident HCC cases matched to 250 controls using an incidence-density sampling procedure. The association of coffee intake with HCC risk was evaluated by using multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression that accounted for smoking, alcohol consumption, hepatitis infection, and other established liver cancer risk factors. The mediating effects of 21 biomarkers were evaluated on the basis of percentage changes and associated 95% CIs in the estimated regression coefficients of models with and without adjustment for biomarkers individually and in combination. RESULTS: The multivariable-adjusted RR of having >/=4 cups (600 mL) coffee/d compared with <2 cups (300 mL)/d was 0.25 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.62; P-trend = 0.006). A statistically significant attenuation of the association between coffee intake and HCC risk and thereby suspected mediation was confirmed for the inflammatory biomarker IL-6 and for the biomarkers of hepatocellular injury glutamate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and total bilirubin, which-in combination-attenuated the regression coefficients by 72% (95% CI: 7%, 239%). Of the investigated biomarkers, IL-6, AST, and GGT produced the highest change in the regression coefficients: 40%, 56%, and 60%, respectively. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the inverse association of coffee intake with HCC risk was partly accounted for by biomarkers of inflammation and hepatocellular injury.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder, frequently managed by general practitioners and gastroenterologists. It is a complex condition, characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits, and it affects 11% of the population worldwide. It has a profound effect on quality of life for many patients and poses a substantial cost to society. Due to the complexity and diversity of IBS, diagnosis and treatment can be challenging. Common drawbacks in diagnosing and treating this disorder include unnecessary tests, failure to establish trust in the physician-patient relationship and difficulties in explaining the diagnosis. Research in recent years has however refined the diagnostic criteria and improved our ability to safely identify IBS with a limited number of investigations. A concise diagnostic evaluation, guided adequate information, prompt initiation of symptom-guided treatment and consistency in the patient-doctor relationship can help relieve the suffering experienced by patients with IBS. For patients with mild symptoms, reassurance, education, lifestyle changes and dietary advice are often sufficient. Patients with moderate to severe symptoms might need symptom modifying drugs, and psychological treatments such as CBT or hypnotherapy may be offered at this stage. For patients with severe and incapacitating symptoms, a multidisciplinary approach is recommended and psychotropic drugs are often used. This clinical review offers suggestions for a diagnostic approach as well as a treatment strategy, based on the current evidence on pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment in IBS.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are used in a great number of both paediatric and adult diseases, mainly in gastrointestinal disorders, like diarrhoea. Nevertheless, their beneficial effect on immune alterations, such as atopic dermatitis and, more recently, in women related diseases such as vulvovaginitis and mastitis have also been observed. However, the use of probiotics is not completely implemented into the routine clinical practice for primary care physicians. There is still a great controversy with scarce scientific evidence, due to the diversity in the designs thereof which justifies the variability in the efficacy results. This outcome leads to difficulties in developing definitive treatment guidelines although there are exceptions, for example, WGO. The aim of this workshop, held at the VI Congress of the Spanish Society of Probiotics and Prebiotics is the training of primary care physicians, both paediatricians and general practitioners in the clinical applications of these nutritional preparations in different diseases: acute diarrhoea; antibiotic associated diarrhoea, necrotizing enterocolitis, employment in infant milk formulas, infant colic, irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as vulvovaginitis and mastitis.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are living micro-organisms that do not naturally have shelf life, and normally are weakly protected against the digestive action of the GI tract. A new dual coating technology has been developed in an effort to maximize survival, that is, to be able to reach the intestine alive and in sufficient numbers to confer the beneficial health effects on the host. Dual-coating of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) is the result of fourth-generation coating technology for the protection of these bacteria at least 100-fold or greater than the uncoated LAB. This innovative technique involves a first pH-dependent protein layer that protects bacteria from gastric acid and bile salt, and a second polysaccharide matrix that protects bacteria from external factors, such as humidity, temperature and pressure, as well as the digestive action during the passage through the GI tract. Dual-coated probiotic formulation is applicable to different therapeutic areas, including irritable bowel syndrome, atopic dermatitis, acute diarrhea, chronic constipation, Helicobacter pylori eradication, and prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. An updated review of the efficacy of doubly coated probiotic strains for improving bacterial survival in the intestinal tract and its consequent clinical benefits in humans is here presented.},

   abstract = {Recently, increasing interest in natural dietary and therapeutic preparations used as dietary supplements has been observed. One of them is frankincense. This traditional medicine of the East is believed to have anti-inflammatory, expectorant, antiseptic, and even anxiolytic and anti-neurotic effects. The present study aims to verify the reported therapeutic properties of Boswellia resin and describe its chemical composition based on available scientific studies. The main component of frankincense is oil (60%). It contains mono- (13%) and diterpenes (40%) as well as ethyl acetate (21.4%), octyl acetate (13.4%) and methylanisole (7.6%). The highest biological activity among terpenes is characteristic of 11-keto-ss-acetyl-beta-boswellic acid, acetyl-11-keto-ss-boswellic acid and acetyl-alpha-boswellic acid. Contemporary studies have shown that resin indeed has an analgesic, tranquilising and anti-bacterial effects. From the point of view of therapeutic properties, extracts from Boswellia serrata and Boswellia carterii are reported to be particularly useful. They reduce inflammatory conditions in the course of rheumatism by inhibiting leukocyte elastase and degrading glycosaminoglycans. Boswellia preparations inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and prevent the release of leukotrienes, thus having an anti-inflammatory effect in ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, bronchitis and sinusitis. Inhalation and consumption of Boswellia olibanum reduces the risk of asthma. In addition, boswellic acids have an antiproliferative effect on tumours. They inhibit proliferation of tumour cells of the leukaemia and glioblastoma subset. They have an anti-tumour effect since they inhibit topoisomerase I and II-alpha and stimulate programmed cell death (apoptosis).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess the associations between lean fish, fatty fish and total fish intakes and risk of stroke in the Spanish cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Spain). DESIGN: Fish intake was estimated from a validated dietary questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association between the intakes of lean fish, fatty fish and total fish and stroke risk. Models were run separately for men and women. SETTING: Five Spanish regions (Asturias, San Sebastian, Navarra, Granada and Murcia). SUBJECTS: Individuals (n 41 020; 15 490 men and 25 530 women) aged 20-69 years, recruited from 1992 to 1996 and followed-up until December 2008 (December 2006 in the case of Asturias). Only participants with definite incident stroke were considered as cases. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 13.8 years, 674 strokes were identified and subsequently validated by record linkage with hospital discharge databases, primary-care records and regional mortality registries, comprising 531 ischaemic, seventy-nine haemorrhagic, forty-two subarachnoid and twenty-two unspecific strokes. After multiple adjustments, no significant associations were observed between lean fish, fatty fish and total fish consumption and the risk of stroke in men or women. In men, results revealed a non-significant trend towards an inverse association between lean fish (hazard ratio=0.84; 95 % CI 0.55, 1.29, P trend=0.06) and total fish consumption (hazard ratio=0.77; 95 % CI 0.51, 1.16, P trend=0.06) and risk of total stroke. CONCLUSIONS: In the EPIC-Spain cohort, no association was found between lean fish, fatty fish and total fish consumption and risk of stroke.},

We aimed to examine the association between unprocessed red meat, processed meat and total red meat consumption and risk of total stroke and ischaemic stroke. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted based on the data for 41,020 men and women aged 29-69 years at baseline. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 13.8 years, 674 incident cases of stroke (531 ischaemic strokes, 79 haemorrhagic strokes, 42 subarachnoid haemorrhages and 22 mixed or unspecified events) were identified. After multiple adjustment, unprocessed red meat, processed meat and total red meat consumption were not correlated with incidence of total stroke or ischaemic stroke in either men or women. The hazard ratios (HRs) for unprocessed red meat and processed meat and risk of total stroke comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles were, respectively, 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-1.21; P-trend=0.15) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.64-1.32; P-trend=0.82) in men and 1.21 (95% CI 0.79-1.85; P-trend=0.10) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.51-1.27; P-trend=0.17) in women.

   abstract = {Objective. To clarify the effect of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v on the salivary cortisol and salivary IgA levels in young adults under examination stress. Design. Forty-one students with an upcoming academic exam were included in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The probiotic bacteria or the placebo product was administered in capsules once a day during 14 days. Saliva was collected and a perceived stress test was filled out at each sampling occasion. Saliva was collected for cortisol analysis by Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLI) and salivary IgA was analysed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Abundance of lactobacilli was evaluated by cultivation of saliva on selective medium and identification of L. plantarum 299v was done on randomly selected colonies by a random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) typing. Results. A significant difference in cortisol levels was found between the treatment group and the placebo group (P < 0.05), together with a significant increase in levels of lactobacilli in the treatment group compared with the placebo group (P < 0.001). No significant changes were found for salivary IgA. Conclusion. A probiotic bacterium with ability to reduce symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) prohibited increased levels of the stress marker cortisol during the examination period. The registration number of the study is NCT02974894, and the study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Primary bile acid diarrhoea (BAD) is associated with increased bile acid synthesis and low fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19). Bile acid sequestrants are used as therapy, but are poorly tolerated and may exacerbate FGF19 deficiency. AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacological effects of conventional sequestrants and a colonic-release formulation preparation of colestyramine (A3384) on bile acid metabolism and bowel function in patients with BAD. METHODS: Patients with seven-day 75selenium-homocholic acid taurine (SeHCAT) scan retention <10% were randomised in a double-blind protocol to two weeks treatment with twice-daily A3384 250 mg (n = 6), 1 g (n = 7) or placebo (n = 6). Thirteen patients were taking conventional sequestrants at the start of the study. Symptoms were recorded and serum FGF19 and 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) measured. RESULTS: Median serum FGF19 on conventional sequestrant treatment was 28% lower than baseline values in BAD (p < 0.05). C4 on conventional sequestrant treatment was 58% higher in BAD (p < 0.001). No changes were seen on starting or withdrawing A3384. A3384 improved diarrhoeal symptoms, with a median reduction of 2.2 points on a 0-10 Likert scale compared to placebo, p < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Serum FGF19 was suppressed and bile acid production up-regulated on conventional bile acid sequestrants, but not with A3384. This colonic-release formulation of colestyramine produced symptomatic benefit in patients with BAD.},

   abstract = {Complementary or alternative medicine is of great interest for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, with the aim of ameliorating the side effects of the drugs commonly used or improving their efficacy. In this study, we evaluated the ability of goat whey to prevent intestinal inflammation in the experimental model of acetic acid-induced rats and compared it to sulfasalazine. Pretreatment with goat whey (1, 2, and 4g/kg) and sulfasalazine (250mg/kg) on colitic rats improved colonic inflammatory markers, including myeloperoxidase activity, leukotriene B4 levels, as well as the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Furthermore, the administration of goat whey significantly reduced the colonic oxidative stress by reducing malondialdehyde levels and increased total glutathione content, a potent antioxidant peptide. The histological evaluation of the colonic specimens from colitic rats confirmed these beneficial effects, as goat whey preserved the colonic tissue, especially in those rats treated with the highest dose of goat whey or with sulfasalazine. The immunohistochemistry analysis of the colonic tissue evaluation also revealed a reduction in the expression of cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, together with an increased expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1. These results suggest that goat whey exerted a preventive effect against the intestinal damage induced by acetic acid, showing a similar efficacy to that shown by sulfasalazine, therefore making it a potential treatment for human inflammatory bowel disease.},

No statistically significant associations were found between levels of any POP and fasting glucose. However, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners 138 and 180 were positively associated with 2-h glucose levels and PCB 180 also with fasting immunoreactive insulin (IRI). We also found a positive association of p,p'- dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'- DDE), PCBs (138, 153, and 180), hexachlorobenzene, and summation operatorPOPs with 2-h IRI. Serum concentrations of PCBs (138, 153, and 180), hexachlorobenzene, and summation operatorPOPs were also positively associated with homeostasis model assessment (HOMA2-IR) levels. Moreover, p,p'- DDE, PCBs (138, 153 and 180), hexachlorobenzene, and summation operatorPOPs were negatively associated with Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI-gly) levels. No significant association was found between glycated hemoglobin and the concentrations of any POP. The removal of women under blood glucose lowering treatment from the models strengthened most of the associations previously found for the whole population. Our findings suggest that exposure to certain POPs is a modifiable risk factor contributing to insulin resistance.},

   abstract = {Mankind has existed for 2.5 million years but only in the last 10,000 years have we been exposed to wheat. Wheat was first cultivated in the Fertile Crescent (South Western Asia) with a farming expansion that lasted from about 9000BC to 4000BC. Thus it could be considered that wheat (and gluten) is a novel introduction to man's diet! Prior to 1939 the rationing system had already been devised. This led to an imperative to try to increase agricultural production. Thus it was agreed in 1941 that there was a need to establish a Nutrition Society. The very roots of the society were geared towards necessarily increasing the production of wheat. This goal was achieved and by the end of the 20th century, global wheat output had expanded 5-fold. Perhaps as a result the epidemiology of coeliac disease (CD) or gluten sensitive enteropathy has changed. CD is a state of heightened immunological responsiveness to ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. CD now affects 1 % or more of all adults, for which the treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. However, there is a growing body of evidence to show that a far greater proportion of individuals without coeliac disease are taking a gluten-free diet of their own volition. This clinical entity has been termed non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), although the condition is fraught with complexities due to overlap with other gluten-based constituents that can also trigger similar clinical symptoms. This review will explore the relationship between gluten, the rising prevalence of modern coeliac disease, and the new entity of NCGS along with its associated uncertainties.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Bile acids may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS. We investigated the potential effects of bile acids entering the colon and its role in the symptom pattern in IBS. DESIGN: We measured 75Se-labelled homocholic acid-taurine (75SeHCAT) retention, and serum levels of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 in patients with IBS (n=141) and control subjects (75SeHCAT n=29; C4 and FGF19 n=435). In patients with IBS stool frequency and form, as well as GI symptom severity were registered, and in a proportion of patients colonic transit time and rectal sensitivity were measured (n=66). An 8-week open-label treatment with colestipol was offered to patients with 75SeHCAT <20%, and the effect of treatment was evaluated with IBS severity scoring system and adequate relief of IBS symptoms. RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with IBS had lower 75SeHCAT values (p=0.005), higher C4c levels (C4 corrected for cholesterol) (p<0.001), but similar FGF19 levels. Abnormal 75SeHCAT retention (<10%) was seen in 18% of patients, whereas 23% had elevated C4c levels. Patients with IBS with 75SeHCAT retention <10% had more frequent stools, accelerated colonic transit time, rectal hyposensitivity, a higher body mass index, higher C4c and lower FGF19 levels. Colestipol treatment improved IBS symptoms (IBS severity scoring system 220+/-109 vs. 277+/-106; p<0.01), and 15/27 patients fulfilled criteria for treatment response (adequate relief >/=50% of weeks 5-8). CONCLUSIONS: Increased colonic bile acid exposure influences bowel habit and colonic transit time in patients with IBS. A high response rate to open label treatment with colestipol supports this, but placebo-controlled studies are warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vegetable and/or fruit intakes in association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk have been investigated in case-control studies conducted in specific European countries and cohort studies conducted in Asia, with inconclusive results. No multi-centre European cohort has investigated the indicated associations. METHODS: In 486,799 men/women from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition, we identified 201 HCC cases after 11 years median follow-up. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for HCC incidence for sex-specific quintiles and per 100 g d(-1) increments of vegetable/fruit intakes. RESULTS: Higher vegetable intake was associated with a statistically significant, monotonic reduction of HCC risk: HR (100 g d(-1) increment): 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71-0.98. This association was consistent in sensitivity analyses with no apparent heterogeneity across strata of HCC risk factors. Fruit intake was not associated with HCC incidence: HR (100 g d(-1) increment): 1.01; 95% CI: 0.92-1.11. CONCLUSIONS: Vegetable, but not fruit, intake is associated with lower HCC risk with no evidence for heterogeneity of this association in strata of important HCC risk factors. Mechanistic studies should clarify pathways underlying this association. Given that HCC prognosis is poor and that vegetables are practically universally accessible, our results may be important, especially for those at high risk for the disease.},

No reliable biomarkers of IBS have been identified so far. AIMS: In a case-control study, using a novel application of breath analysis to distinguish IBS patients from healthy controls based on the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Subsequently, the diagnostic VOC-biomarker set was correlated with self-reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of subjects of the Maastricht IBS clinical cohort and of a general population cohort, LifeLines DEEP. METHODS: Breath samples were collected from 170 IBS patients and 153 healthy controls in the clinical cohort and from 1307 participants in general population cohort. Multivariate statistics were used to identify the most discriminatory set of VOCs in the clinical cohort, and to find associations between VOCs and GI symptoms in both cohorts. RESULTS: A set of 16 VOCs correctly predicted 89.4% of the IBS patients and 73.3% of the healthy controls (AUC = 0.83). The VOC-biomarker set correlated moderately with a set of GI symptoms in the clinical (r = 0.55, P = 0.0003) and general population cohorts (r = 0.54, P = 0.0004). A Kruskal-Wallis test showed no influence from possible confounding factors in distinguishing IBS patients from healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: A set of 16 breath-based biomarkers that distinguishes IBS patients from healthy controls was identified. The VOC-biomarker set correlated significantly with GI symptoms in two independent cohorts. We demonstrate the potential use of breath analysis in the diagnosis and monitoring of IBS, and a possible application of VOC analyses in a general population cohort.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Low-grade intestinal inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of IBS. In this trial, we aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of mesalazine in patients with IBS. DESIGN: We conducted a phase 3, multicentre, tertiary setting, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with Rome III confirmed IBS. Patients were randomly assigned to either mesalazine, 800 mg, or placebo, three times daily for 12 weeks, and were followed for additional 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was satisfactory relief of abdominal pain/discomfort for at least half of the weeks of the treatment period. The key secondary endpoint was satisfactory relief of overall IBS symptoms. Supportive analyses were also performed classifying as responders patients with a percentage of affirmative answers of at least 75% or >75% of time. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients with IBS were enrolled from 21 centres. For the primary endpoint, the responder patients were 68.6% in the mesalazine group versus 67.4% in the placebo group (p=0.870; 95% CI -12.8 to 15.1). In explorative analyses, with the 75% rule or >75% rule, the percentage of responders was greater in the mesalazine group with a difference over placebo of 11.6% (p=0.115; 95% CI -2.7% to 26.0%) and 5.9% (p=0.404; 95% CI -7.8% to 19.4%), respectively, although these differences were not significant. For the key secondary endpoint, overall symptoms improved in the mesalazine group and reached a significant difference of 15.1% versus placebo (p=0.032; 95% CI 1.5% to 28.7%) with the >75% rule. CONCLUSIONS: Mesalazine treatment was not superior than placebo on the study primary endpoint. However, a subgroup of patients with IBS showed a sustained therapy response and benefits from a mesalazine therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClincialTrials.gov number, NCT00626288.},

   abstract = {For decades, interactions between the enteric neuromuscular apparatus and the central nervous system have served as the primary focus of pathophysiological research in the functional gastrointestinal disorders. The accumulation of patient reports, as well as clinical observations, has belatedly led to an interest in the role of various luminal factors and their interactions with each other and the host in functional gastrointestinal disorders. Most prominent among these factors has been the role of food. As a consequence, while not always evidence-based, dietary interventions are enjoying a renaissance in irritable bowel syndrome management. Not surprisingly, given its exploration in many disease states, the gut microbiota has also been studied in functional gastrointestinal disorders; data remain inconclusive. Likewise, there is also a considerable body of experimental and some clinical data to link functional gastrointestinal disorders pathogenesis to disturbances in epithelial barrier integrity, abnormal entero-endocrine signaling and immune activation. These data provide growing evidence supporting the existence of micro-organic changes, particularly in subgroups of patients with functional dyspepsia and IBS. However, their exact role in the complex pathophysiology and symptom generation of functional gastrointestinal disorders needs to be further studied and elucidated particularly with longitudinal and interventional studies.},

   abstract = {With up to 200 m(2) the human intestine is the organ with the largest absorptive surface of the body. It is lined by a single layer of epithelial cells that separates the host from the environment. The intestinal epithelium provides both, selective absorption of nutrients, ions, and water but also a highly effective barrier function which includes the first line of defense against environmental antigens. The paracellular part of this barrier function is provided by tight junction (TJ) proteins, especially the large family of claudins. Changes in abundance or molecular structure of claudins can generally result in three typical effects, (i) decreased absorptive passage, (ii) increased secretory passage of small solutes and water causing leak flux diarrhea and (iii) increased absorptive passage of macromolecules which may induce inflammatory processes. Several intestinal diseases are associated with such changes that can result in intestinal inflammation and symptoms like weight loss, abdominal pain or diarrhea. This review summarizes our current knowledge on barrier dysfunction and claudin dysregulation in several intestinal diseases gastroenterologists are often faced with, like inflammatory bowel disease, microscopic colitis, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, gallstones and infectious diseases like HIV enteropathy, Campylobacter jejuni and Clostridium perfringens infection.},

In this clinical review, we evaluate the literature associated with using probiotics in common pediatric gastrointestinal disorders, focusing specifically on antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), colic, inflammatory bowel disease, and functional gastrointestinal diseases. Meta-analysis of several randomized controlled trials have confirmed benefit for the administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea and to treat acute infectious diarrhea. Individual studies have also suggested benefit of probiotics to prevent acute gastroenteritis and serve as an adjunct in ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, CDI, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic in breastfed babies. Although promising, larger well-designed studies need to confirm these findings. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {The survival of breast cancer patients is largely influenced by tumor characteristics, such as TNM stage, tumor grade and hormone receptor status. However, there is growing evidence that inherited genetic variation might affect the disease prognosis and response to treatment. Several lines of evidence suggest that alleles influencing breast cancer risk might also be associated with breast cancer survival. We examined the associations between 35 breast cancer susceptibility loci and the disease over-all survival (OS) in 10,255 breast cancer patients from the National Cancer Institute Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) of which 1,379 died, including 754 of breast cancer. We also conducted a meta-analysis of almost 35,000 patients and 5,000 deaths, combining results from BPC3 and the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) and performed in silico analyses of SNPs with significant associations. In BPC3, the C allele of LSP1-rs3817198 was significantly associated with improved OS (HRper-allele =0.70; 95% CI: 0.58-0.85; ptrend = 2.84 x 10(-4) ; HRheterozygotes = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.55-0.92; HRhomozygotes = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.31-0.76; p2DF = 1.45 x 10(-3) ). In silico, the C allele of LSP1-rs3817198 was predicted to increase expression of the tumor suppressor cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (CDKN1C). In the meta-analysis, TNRC9-rs3803662 was significantly associated with increased death hazard (HRMETA =1.09; 95% CI: 1.04-1.15; ptrend = 6.6 x 10(-4) ; HRheterozygotes = 0.96 95% CI: 0.90-1.03; HRhomozygotes = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.09-1.35; p2DF =1.25 x 10(-4) ). In conclusion, we show that there is little overlap between the breast cancer risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified so far and the SNPs associated with breast cancer prognosis, with the possible exceptions of LSP1-rs3817198 and TNRC9-rs3803662.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonist ibodutant is under Phase III clinical investigation to treat female patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The aim of this study was to investigate the NK2 receptor-related gender specificity in a model of colitis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Colitis was induced by rectal instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS, 0.5 mL, 30 mg.mL(-1) in 30% ethanol) in female and male guinea pigs. Electromyographic recording of the responses to colorectal distension (CRD) was made 3 days later. Ibodutant (0.33 , 0.65, 1.9 and 6.5 mg.kg(-1) ) was given s.c., 30 min before CRD. Release of neurokinin A and substance P from isolated mucosal and smooth muscle tissues following treatment with KCl (80 mM) or capsaicin (10 muM) was measured by EIA. Plasma pharmacokinetics of ibodutant following a single s.c. administration (0.73 or 2.1 mg.kg(-1) ) were measured over 24 h. KEY RESULTS: Ibodutant did not affect abdominal contractions in control animals. After TNBS-induced colitis, ibodutant prevented the increased visceral hypersensitivity to CRD in females, at lower doses than in males. Ibodutant pharmacokinetics did not differ between females and males. Tachykinins release was greater in smooth muscle than in mucosal samples. Capsaicin-stimulated release of tachykinins from inflamed mucosal samples from females was significantly lower than in males. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Ibodutant prevented abdominal nociception in a model of visceral hypersensitivity in guinea pigs with a greater efficacy in females than in males. Our results highlight a gender-related difference in colonic visceral hypersensitivity and mucosal nerve activation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Evidence suggests that patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have an altered cytokine profile, although it is unclear whether cytokines are linked with symptom severity. We aimed to determine whether global serum and mucosal cytokine profiles differ between IBS patients and healthy subjects and whether cytokines are associated with IBS symptoms. METHODS: Serum from 144 IBS patients and 42 healthy subjects was analyzed for cytokine levels of interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by MSD MULTI-ARRAY. In total, 109 IBS and 36 healthy sigmoid colon biopsies were analyzed for mRNA expression of IL-8, IL-10, TNF, and FOXP3 by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Multivariate discrimination analysis evaluated global cytokine profiles. Rectal sensitivity, oroanal transit time, and psychological and gastrointestinal symptom severity were also assessed. RESULTS: Global cytokine profiles of IBS patients and healthy subjects overlapped, but cytokine levels varied more in IBS patients. Serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 tended to be increased and levels of IFN-gamma tended to be decreased in IBS patients. Mucosal mRNA expression of IL-10 and FOXP3 tended to be decreased in IBS patients. Within both the full study cohort and IBS patients alone, serum level of TNF was associated with looser stool pattern, while subjects with more widespread somatic symptoms had increased serum levels of IL-6. Although neither IBS bowel habit subgroups nor patients with possible post-infectious IBS were associated with distinct cytokine profiles, a small cluster of IBS patients with comparatively elevated immune markers was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Global cytokine profiles did not discriminate IBS patients from healthy subjects, but cytokine profiles were more varied among IBS patients than among healthy subjects, and a small subgroup of patients with enhanced immune activity was identified. Also, association of inflammatory cytokines with some clinical symptoms suggests that immune activation may be of importance in a subset of IBS patients.},

   abstract = {Probiotics have seen widespread use for a variety of gastrointestinal problems, especially in two common disorders: irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Since a wide variety of probiotic preparations has been used, and despite a large number of studies performed, a great deal of heterogeneity exists among them. Straightforward evidence-based recommendations for the use of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease have thus been difficult to formulate. In an effort to improve understanding of the risk-benefit balance of probiotics in these conditions, this study (1) queried the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for all reported adverse drug events related to probiotics in 2013, and (2) constructed risk-benefit planes for both irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease using a geometric approximation of the confidence region between risk and benefit. The results show that adverse events from probiotics vary widely by disease, and when they occur, they are mild and may be difficult to distinguish from the natural history of the underlying disorders they are used to treat. The risk-benefit plane for irritable bowel syndrome straddles the risk-benefit threshold, so patients can expect a balance between a low chance of risk and also a low chance of benefit. The risk-benefit plane for inflammatory bowel disease largely lies above the risk-benefit threshold, so patients may expect more benefit than risk in most cases. More standardized and high-quality research is needed to improve our understanding of risk and benefit for these complex biopharmaceuticals.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies showed that patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) had an increased intestinal permeability as well as a decreased expression of tight junctions. Glutamine, the major substrate of rapidly dividing cells, is able to modulate intestinal permeability and tight junction expression in other diseases. We aimed to evaluate, ex vivo, glutamine effects on tight junction proteins, claudin-1 and occludin, in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBS-D. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with IBS-D, diagnosed with the Rome III criteria, were included (8 women/4 men, aged 40.7 +/- 6.9 years). Colonic biopsy specimens were collected and immediately incubated for 18 hours in culture media with increasing concentrations of glutamine from 0.6-10 mmol/L. Claudin-1 and occludin expression was then measured by immunoblot, and concentrations of cytokines were assessed by multiplex technology. Claudin-1 expression was affected by glutamine (P < .05, analysis of variance). In particularly, 10 mmol/L glutamine increased claudin-1 expression compared with 0.6 mmol/L glutamine (0.47 +/- 0.04 vs 0.33 +/- 0.03, P < .05). In contrast, occludin expression was not significantly modified by glutamine. Interestingly, glutamine effect was negatively correlated to claudin-1 (Pearson r = -0.83, P < .001) or occludin basal expression (Pearson r = -0.84, P < .001), suggesting that glutamine had more marked effects when tight junction protein expression was altered. Cytokine concentrations in culture media were not modified by glutamine treatment. CONCLUSION: Glutamine increased claudin-1 expression in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBS-D. In addition, glutamine effect seems to be dependent on basal expression of tight junction proteins.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reproductive factors influence the risk of developing epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), but little is known about their association with survival. We tested whether prediagnostic reproductive factors influenced EOC-specific survival among 1025 invasive EOC cases identified in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, which included 521,330 total participants (approximately 370,000 women) aged 25-70 years at recruitment from 1992 to 2000. METHODS: Information on reproductive characteristics was collected at recruitment. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and multivariable models were adjusted for age and year of diagnosis, body mass index, tumour stage, smoking status and stratified by study centre. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 3.6 years (+/-3.2 s.d.) following EOC diagnosis, 511 (49.9%) of the 1025 women died from EOC. We observed a suggestive survival advantage in menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) users (ever vs never use, HR=0.80, 95% CI=0.62-1.03) and a significant survival benefit in long-term MHT users (5 years use vs never use, HR=0.70, 95% CI=0.50-0.99, P(trend)=0.04). We observed similar results for MHT use when restricting to serous cases. Other reproductive factors, including parity, breastfeeding, oral contraceptive use and age at menarche or menopause, were not associated with EOC-specific mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are warranted to investigate the possible improvement in EOC survival in MHT users.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Specific coffee subtypes and tea may impact risk of pre- and post-menopausal breast cancer differently. We investigated the association between coffee (total, caffeinated, decaffeinated) and tea intake and risk of breast cancer. METHODS: A total of 335,060 women participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC) Study, completed a dietary questionnaire from 1992 to 2000, and were followed-up until 2010 for incidence of breast cancer. Hazard ratios (HR) of breast cancer by country-specific, as well as cohort-wide categories of beverage intake were estimated. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 11 years, 1064 premenopausal, and 9134 postmenopausal breast cancers were diagnosed. Caffeinated coffee intake was associated with lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer: adjusted HR=0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82 to 0.98, for high versus low consumption; Ptrend=0.029. While there was no significant effect modification by hormone receptor status (P=0.711), linear trend for lower risk of breast cancer with increasing caffeinated coffee intake was clearest for estrogen and progesterone receptor negative (ER-PR-), postmenopausal breast cancer (P=0.008). For every 100 ml increase in caffeinated coffee intake, the risk of ER-PR- breast cancer was lower by 4% (adjusted HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.00). Non-consumers of decaffeinated coffee had lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (adjusted HR=0.89; 95% CI: 0.80 to 0.99) compared to low consumers, without evidence of dose-response relationship (Ptrend=0.128). Exclusive decaffeinated coffee consumption was not related to postmenopausal breast cancer risk, compared to any decaffeinated-low caffeinated intake (adjusted HR=0.97; 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.14), or to no intake of any coffee (HR: 0.96; 95%: 0.82 to 1.14). Caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee were not associated with premenopausal breast cancer. Tea intake was neither associated with pre- nor post-menopausal breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Higher caffeinated coffee intake may be associated with lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Decaffeinated coffee intake does not seem to be associated with breast cancer.},

   abstract = {Ingestion and digestion of food as well as expulsion of residual material from our gastrointestinal tract requires normal propulsive, i.e. motor, function. Hypomotility refers to inherited or acquired changes that come with decreased contractile forces or slower transit. It not only often causes symptoms but also may compromise nutritional status or lead to other complications. While severe forms, such as pseudo-obstruction or ileus, may have a tremendous functional impact, the less severe forms of hypomotility may well be more relevant, as they contribute to common disorders, such as functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, chronic constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Clinical testing can identify changes in contractile activity, defined by lower amplitudes or abnormal patterns, and the related effects on transit. However, such biomarkers show a limited correlation with overall symptom severity as experienced by patients. Similarly, targeting hypomotility with pharmacological interventions often alters gut motor function but does not consistently improve symptoms. Novel diagnostic approaches may change this apparent paradox and enable us to obtain more comprehensive information by integrating data on electrical activity, mechanical forces, patterns, wall stiffness, and motions with information of the flow of luminal contents. New drugs with more selective effects or more specific delivery may improve benefits and limit adverse effects. Lastly, the complex regulation of gastrointestinal motility involves the brain-gut axis as a reciprocal pathway for afferent and efferent signaling. Considering the role of visceral input in emotion and the effects of emotion on visceral activity, understanding and managing hypomotility disorders requires an integrative approach based on the mind-body continuum or biopsychosocial model of diseases.},

The aim of present study was to investigate gender differences in gastrointestinal, extra-intestinal, and psychological symptoms, and sense of coherence (SOC) and QOL in a large group of patients diagnosed with IBS. METHODS: We analyzed questionnaire data from 557 patients (152 men) diagnosed with IBS consecutively included in studies at an outpatient clinic for functional bowel disorders between 2002 and 2010. Following questionnaires were included: IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), IBSQOL Scale, Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI), SOC Scale, Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15). KEY RESULTS: Women had harder stools (FDR-adjusted p-value: q = 0.033), more severe bloating (q = 0.020), higher symptom severity (q = 0.042), higher total somatic symptom burden (q = 0.035), lower SOC (q = 0.042), and lower QOL. Women rated more general anxiety (q = 0.017) and gastrointestinal-specific anxiety (q = 0.042), but there were no group differences in depression, pain, stool frequency, impact on daily life, dissatisfaction with bowel habit, or extra-colonic symptoms. The differences found were small (effect sizes: r < 0.3). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: In this study, we demonstrated more similarities than differences between men and women with IBS. The largest difference were seen for QOL which might reflect certain structural stressors to which women in general are more exposed than men.},

   abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore patients' experiences of healthcare encounters in severe irritable bowel syndrome. BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common functional disorder with symptoms such as abdominal pain and disturbed bowel habits, the cause of which is not completely known. Treatments options are limited, and healthcare encounters in irritable bowel syndrome have been described as unsatisfying and frustrating for both patients and professional healthcare providers. Furthermore, the influence of power on healthcare encounters has long been recognised, especially regarding the disadvantaged position of those suffering from functional illness which cannot be identified by commonly used tests or investigations. METHODS: We interviewed 10 patients during 2014, all attending an outpatient clinic and suffering from severe irritable bowel syndrome. Relying on narrative and feminist theory, we explored how they actively negotiate professional discourse communicated to them in the clinical encounter. RESULTS: The patients' experiences of healthcare encounters in irritable bowel syndrome were mostly described as negative, and often induced feelings of confusion and self-doubt. Positive encounters were described as being listened to, believed and taken seriously. Narrators found it especially problematic when healthcare professionals described irritable bowel syndrome as a minor disorder with primarily stress or psychological aetiology and put the responsibility for recovery onto the patient. Patients' actively negotiated such professional discourse by presenting a counternarrative describing their own suffering and strengths, experienced healthcare shortcomings and possible organic aetiology of irritable bowel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Patients suffering from severe irritable bowel syndrome described how they often felt a need to protect their positive identities in the face of trivialisation and disbelief by healthcare professionals. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A deepened understanding of patients' experiences of healthcare encounters in irritable bowel syndrome could enable more helpful and supporting interventions by healthcare professionals.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) is a 7-point scale used extensively in clinical practice and research for stool form measurement, which has undergone limited validity and reliability testing. AIM: To determine the validity and reliability of the BSFS in measuring stool form in healthy adults and patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). METHODS: One hundred and sixty-nine healthy volunteers provided a stool sample and used the BSFS to classify stool form, which was compared with measured stool water content and with values from 19 patients with IBS-D. Eighty-six volunteers used the BSFS to classify 26 stool models to determine accuracy and reliability. RESULTS: Volunteers' classifications of stool type correlated with stool water (Spearman's rho = 0.491, P < 0.001), which increased in hard (Types 1-2), normal (Types 3-5) and loose stools (Types 6-7) (P < 0.001). The BSFS detected differences in stool form between healthy volunteers (mean 3.7, s.d. 1.5) and IBS-D patients (mean 5.0, s.d. 1.2) (P < 0.001). Overall, 977/1204 (81%) stool models were correctly classified (substantial accuracy, kappa = 0.78), although <80% of Types 2, 3, 5 and 6 were classified correctly. On 852/1118 (76%) occasions, volunteers classified covert duplicate models to the same stool type (substantial reliability, kappa = 0.72), but with only moderate reliability for Types 2 (63%, kappa = 0.57) and 3 (62%, kappa = 0.55). CONCLUSIONS: The BSFS demonstrated substantial validity and reliability, although difficulties arose around clinical decision points (Types 2, 3, 5, 6) that warrant investigation in larger clinical populations. Potential for improving validity and reliability through modifications to the BSFS or training in its use should be explored.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex condition with multiple factors contributing to its aetiology and pathophysiology. Aetiologically these include genetics, life-time events and environment, and physiologically, changes in motility, central processing, visceral sensitivity, immunity, epithelial permeability and gastrointestinal microflora. Such complexity means there is currently no specific reliable biomarker for IBS, and thus IBS continues to be diagnosed and classified according to symptom based criteria, the Rome Criteria. Carefully phenotyping and characterisation of a 'large' pool of IBS patients across Europe and even the world however, might help identify sub-populations with accuracy and consistency. This will not only aid future research but improve tailoring of treatment and health care of IBS patients. PURPOSE: The aim of this position paper is to discuss the requirements necessary to standardize the process of selecting and phenotyping IBS patients and how to organise the collection and storage of patient information/samples in such a large multi-centre pan European/global study. We include information on general demographics, gastrointestinal symptom assessment, psychological factors, quality of life, physiological evaluation, genetic/epigenetic and microbiota analysis, biopsy/blood sampling, together with discussion on the organisational, ethical and language issues associated with implementing such a study. The proposed approach and documents selected to be used in such a study was the result of a thoughtful and thorough four-year dialogue amongst experts associated with the European COST action BM1106 GENIEUR (www.GENIEUR.eu).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: A diet with reduced content of fermentable short-chain carbohydrates (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols [FODMAPs]) has been reported to be effective in the treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, there is no evidence of its superiority to traditional dietary advice for these patients. We compared the effects of a diet low in FODMAPs with traditional dietary advice in a randomized controlled trial of patients with IBS. METHODS: We performed a multi-center, parallel, single-blind study of 75 patients who met Rome III criteria for IBS and were enrolled at gastroenterology outpatient clinics in Sweden. Subjects were randomly assigned to groups that ate specific diets for 4 weeks-a diet low in FODMAPs (n = 38) or a diet frequently recommended for patients with IBS (ie, a regular meal pattern; avoidance of large meals; and reduced intake of fat, insoluble fibers, caffeine, and gas-producing foods, such as beans, cabbage, and onions), with greater emphasis on how and when to eat rather than on what foods to ingest (n = 37). Symptom severity was assessed using the IBS Symptom Severity Scale, and patients completed a 4-day food diary before and at the end of the intervention. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients completed the dietary intervention (33 completed the diet low in FODMAPs, 34 completed the traditional IBS diet). The severity of IBS symptoms was reduced in both groups during the intervention (P < .0001 in both groups before vs at the end of the 4-week diet), without a significant difference between the groups (P = .62). At the end of the 4-week diet period, 19 patients (50%) in the low-FODMAP group had reductions in IBS severity scores >/=50 compared with baseline vs 17 patients (46%) in the traditional IBS diet group (P = .72). Food diaries demonstrated good adherence to the dietary advice. CONCLUSIONS: A diet low in FODMAPs reduces IBS symptoms as well as traditional IBS dietary advice. Combining elements from these 2 strategies might further reduce symptoms of IBS. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02107625.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Few treatments have been able to effectively manage pediatric irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (Internet-CBT) based on exposure for abdominal symptoms is effective for adult IBS. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Internet-CBT based on behavioral exposure for adolescents with IBS. METHODS: Adolescents with IBS fulfilling the Rome III criteria were randomized to either Internet-CBT or a wait-list control. The Internet-CBT was a 10-week intervention where the main component was exposure to IBS symptoms by reduction of avoidance of abdominal symptoms and instead stepwise provocation of symptoms. The primary outcome was total score on Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale for IBS (GSRS-IBS). Secondary outcomes included adolescent- and parent-rated quality of life and parent-rated gastrointestinal symptoms. Difference between groups was assessed from pretreatment to posttreatment and the Internet-CBT group was also evaluated at 6 months after treatment completion. RESULTS: A total of 101 adolescents with IBS (13-17 years of age) were included in this study. Dropout rates were low (6%) and all randomized patients were included in intent-to-treat analyses based on mixed effects models. Analyses showed a significant larger pretreatment to posttreatment change on the primary outcome GSRS-IBS (B=-6.42, P=0.006, effect size Cohen's d=0.45, 95% confidence interval (0.12, 0.77)) and on almost all secondary outcomes for the Internet-CBT group compared with the control group. After 6 months, the results were stable or significantly improved. CONCLUSIONS: Internet-CBT based on exposure exercises for adolescents with IBS can effectively improve gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is frequently associated to many functional gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders in obese patients, according to their body mass index and their recruitment source. METHODS: Five hundred ninety-six obese patients (body mass index (BMI) > 30) filled out a standard questionnaire in order to evaluate the presence of functional gastrointestinal disorders. They were divided into four groups according to the Rome III criteria and their BMI: OF, obese patients from functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) enrollment; OO, obese patients from obesity management enrollment; MF, morbid obesity patients from FGID enrollment; and MO, morbid obesity patients from obesity management enrollment. Data analysis was performed using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Out of the 596 obese patients included in the present study, 183 (33 %) were complaining of FGIDs, while 413 (67 %) were consulting for obesity management. Compared to the OF group, the OO patients had a higher prevalence of females (P = 0.008) and a younger age (P < 0.001). Clinically, they reported a lower incidence of regurgitation (P = 0.044), of chest pain (P = 0.004), of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; P = 0.035), and of functional diarrhea (P = 0.030). Compared to the MF group, the MO patients had an older age (P = 0.001), a higher BMI (P = 0.013), and clinically by a high frequency of functional dyspepsia (P = 0.006). There were symptoms that had similar prevalence in all groups (OF, OO, MF, MO) such as epigastric pain, postprandial distress, constipation, diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain soiling, or nonspecific anorectal disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the recruitment source accounted for marked and specific differences in the prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders in obesity and morbid obesity. Symptoms with similar prevalence in all groups should be systematically detected in all patients.},

   abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Do women who have diabetes before menopause have their menopause at an earlier age compared with women without diabetes? SUMMARY ANSWER: Although there was no overall association between diabetes and age at menopause, our study suggests that early-onset diabetes may accelerate menopause. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Today, more women of childbearing age are being diagnosed with diabetes, but little is known about the impact of diabetes on reproductive health. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We investigated the impact of diabetes on age at natural menopause (ANM) in 258 898 women from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), enrolled between 1992 and 2000. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Determinant and outcome information was obtained through questionnaires. Time-dependent Cox regression analyses were used to estimate the associations of diabetes and age at diabetes diagnosis with ANM, stratified by center and adjusted for age, smoking, reproductive and diabetes risk factors and with age from birth to menopause or censoring as the underlying time scale. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Overall, no association between diabetes and ANM was found (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89-1.01). However, women with diabetes before the age of 20 years had an earlier menopause (10-20 years: HR = 1.43; 95% CI 1.02-2.01, <10 years: HR = 1.59; 95% CI 1.03-2.43) compared with non-diabetic women, whereas women with diabetes at age 50 years and older had a later menopause (HR = 0.81; 95% CI 0.70-0.95). None of the other age groups were associated with ANM. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Strengths of the study include the large sample size and the broad set of potential confounders measured. However, results may have been underestimated due to survival bias. We cannot be sure about the sequence of the events in women with a late age at diabetes, as both events then occur in a short period. We could not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Based on the literature, an accelerating effect of early-onset diabetes on ANM might be plausible. A delaying effect of late-onset diabetes on ANM has not been reported before, and is not in agreement with recent studies suggesting the opposite association. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The coordination of EPIC is financially supported by the European Commission (DG-SANCO) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer.

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is unique in that it is innervated by several distinct populations of neurons, whose cell bodies are either intrinsic (enteric, viscerofugal) or extrinsic (sympathetic, sensory afferents) to the wall of the gut. We are usually completely unaware of the continuous, complicated orchestra of functions that these neurons conduct. However, for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) or functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as Functional Dyspepsia (FD) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) altered gastrointestinal motility, discomfort and pain are common, debilitating symptoms. Whilst bouts of inflammation underlie the symptoms associated with IBD, over the past few years there is increased pre-clinical and clinical evidence that infection and inflammation are key risk factors for the development of several functional gastrointestinal disorders, in particular IBS. There is a strong correlation between prior exposure to gut infection and symptom occurrence; with the duration and severity of the initial illness the strongest associated risk factors. This review discusses the current body of evidence for neuroplasticity during inflammation and how in many cases fails to reset back to normal, long after healing of the damaged tissues. Recent evidence suggests that the altered expression and function of key ion channels and receptors within extrinsic sensory neurons play fundamental roles in the aberrant pain sensation associated with these gastrointestinal diseases and disorders.},

   abstract = {Several modifiable lifestyle factors, including smoking, alcohol, certain dietary factors and weight are independently associated with gastric cancer (GC); however, their combined impact on GC risk is unknown. We constructed a healthy lifestyle index to investigate the joint influence of these behaviors on GC risk within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. The analysis included 461,550 participants (662 first incident GC cases) with a mean follow-up of 11.4 years. A healthy lifestyle index was constructed, assigning 1 point for each healthy behavior related to smoking status, alcohol consumption and diet quality (represented by the Mediterranean diet) for assessing overall GC and also body mass index for cardia GC and 0 points otherwise. Risk of GC was calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models while adjusting for relevant confounders. The highest versus lowest score in the healthy lifestyle index was associated with a significant lower risk of GC, by 51% overall (HR 0.49 95% CI 0.35, 0.70), by 77% for cardia GC (HR 0.23 95% CI 0.08, 0.68) and by 47% for noncardia GC (HR 0.53 (95% CI 0.32, 0.87), p-trends<0.001. Population attributable risk calculations showed that 18.8% of all GC and 62.4% of cardia GC cases could have been prevented if participants in this population had followed the healthy lifestyle behaviors of this index. Adopting several healthy lifestyle behaviors including not smoking, limiting alcohol consumption, eating a healthy diet and maintaining a normal weight is associated with a large decreased risk of GC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Diets high in saturated and trans fat and low in unsaturated fat may increase type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk, but studies on foods high in fat per unit weight are sparse. We assessed whether the intake of vegetable oil, butter, margarine, nuts and seeds and cakes and cookies is related to incident T2D. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A case-cohort study was conducted, nested within eight countries of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC), with 12,403 incident T2D cases and a subcohort of 16,835 people, identified from a cohort of 340,234 people. Diet was assessed at baseline (1991-1999) by country-specific questionnaires. Country-specific hazard ratios (HRs) across four categories of fatty foods (nonconsumers and tertiles among consumers) were combined with random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: After adjustment not including body mass index (BMI), nonconsumers of butter, nuts and seeds and cakes and cookies were at higher T2D risk compared with the middle tertile of consumption. Among consumers, cakes and cookies were inversely related to T2D (HRs across increasing tertiles 1.14, 1.00 and 0.92, respectively; P-trend <0.0001). All these associations attenuated upon adjustment for BMI, except the higher risk of nonconsumers of cakes and cookies (HR 1.57). Higher consumption of margarine became positively associated after BMI adjustment (HRs across increasing consumption tertiles: 0.93, 1.00 and 1.12; P-trend 0.03). Within consumers, vegetable oil, butter and nuts and seeds were unrelated to T2D. CONCLUSIONS: Fatty foods were generally not associated with T2D, apart from weak positive association for margarine. The higher risk among nonconsumers of cakes and cookies needs further explanation.},

   abstract = {The new and recent advances in neuroelectric and neuroimaging technologies provide a new era for further exploring and understanding how brain and cognition function can be stimulated by environmental factors, such as exercise, and particularly to study whether physical exercise influences brain development in early ages. The present study, namely the ActiveBrains project, aims to examine the effects of a physical exercise programme on brain and cognition, as well as on selected physical and mental health outcomes in overweight/obese children. A total of 100 participants aged 8 to 11 years are randomized into an exercise group (N=50) or a control group (N=50). The intervention lasts 20-weeks, with 3-5 sessions per week of 90 min each, and is mainly focused on high-intensity aerobic exercise yet also includes muscle-strengthening exercises. The extent to what the intervention effect remains 8-months after the exercise programme finishes is also studied in a subsample. Brain structure and function and cognitive performance are assessed using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalographic recordings. Secondary outcomes include physical health outcomes (e.g. physical fitness, body fatness, bone mass and lipid-metabolic factors) and mental health outcomes (e.g. chronic stress indicators and overall behavioural and personality measurements such as anxiety or depression). This project will substantially contribute to the existing knowledge and will have an impact on societies, since early stimulation of brain development might have long lasting consequences on cognitive performance, academic achievement and in the prevention of behavioural problems and the promotion of psychological adjustment and mental health.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Little is understood regarding how disease progression alters immune and sensory nerve function in colitis. We investigated how acute colitis chronically alters immune recruitment and the impact this has on re-activated colitis. To understand the impact of disease progress on sensory systems we investigated the mechanisms underlying altered colonic neuro-immune interactions after acute colitis. DESIGN: Inflammation was compared in mouse models of health, acute tri-nitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) colitis, Remission and Reactivated colitis. Cytokine concentrations were compared by ELISA in-situ and in explanted colon tissue. Colonic infiltration by CD11b/F4-80 macrophage, CD4 THELPER (TH) and CD8 TCYTOTOXIC (TC) and alpha4beta7 expression on mesenteric lymph node (MLN) TH and TC was determined by flow cytometry. Cytokine and effector receptor mRNA expression was determined on colo-rectal afferent neurons and the mechanisms underlying cytokinergic effects on high-threshold colo-rectal afferent function were investigated using electrophysiology. RESULTS: Colonic damage, MPO activity, macrophage infiltration, IL-1beta and IL-6 concentrations were lower in Reactivated compared to Acute colitis. TH infiltration and alpha4beta7 expression on TH MLN was increased in Remission but not Acute colitis. IFN-gamma concentrations, TH infiltration and alpha4beta7 expression on TH and TC MLN increased in Reactivated compared to Acute colitis. Reactivated explants secreted more IL-1beta and IL-6 than Acute explants. IL-6 and TNF-alpha inhibited colo-rectal afferent mechanosensitivity in Remission mice via a BKCa dependent mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Acute colitis persistently alters immune responses and afferent nerve signalling pathways to successive episodes of colitis. These findings highlight the complexity of viscero-sensory neuro-immune interactions in painful remitting and relapsing diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prebiotic dietary fibers resist digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract and allow for stimulation of bacteria in the distal intestine and colon. Stimulation of bacteria among different individuals varies greatly, depending on a wide range of variables. OBJECTIVE: To determine the range of differences in response between individuals, a preclinical in vitro fermentation was conducted with six fecal donors. The primary objective was to compare the fecal microbiota of six individuals at baseline, 12 h and 24 h post-exposure to partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG). METHOD: Fecal donations were collected from six healthy individuals consuming a non-specific Western diet, free of antibiotic treatments in the past year, not affected by any GI diseases and not consuming any probiotic or prebiotic supplements. Fecal samples were exposed to 0.5 g of PHGG and measured for bacterial changes at 0, 12 and 24 h based on 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Parabacteroides increased from 3.48% of sequence reads to 10.62% of sequence reads after 24 h (p = 0.0181) and Bacteroidetes increased from 45.89% of sequence reads to 50.29% of sequence reads (p = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: PHGG stimulates growth of Parabacteroides, a genus of bacteria that have been inversely associated with IBS and ulcerative colitis. PHGG provides stimulation of beneficial Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides and Parabacteroides), which may be correlated with many positive health markers and outcomes. PHGG is a prebiotic dietary fiber that is readily fermentable.},

AIMS: To present a consensus review of the most current knowledge of IBS, updating the 2009 Guidelines by incorporating new internationally published scientific evidence, with a special interest in Mexican studies. METHODS: The PubMed literature from January 2009 to March 2015 was reviewed and complemented through a manual search. Articles in English and Spanish were included and preference was given to consensuses, guidelines, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Statements referring to the different aspects of the disease were formulated and voted upon by 24 gastroenterologists employing the Delphi method. Once a consensus on each statement was reached, the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation were determined through the GRADE system. RESULTS: Forty-eight statements were formulated, updating the information on IBS and adding the complementary data that did not appear in the 2009 Guidelines regarding the importance of exercise and diet, diagnostic strategies, and current therapy alternatives that were analyzed with more stringent scientific vigor or that emerged within the last 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: We present herein a consensus review of the most relevant advances in the study of IBS, updating and complementing the 2009 Guidelines. Several studies conducted in Mexico were included.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to quantify and compare dietary non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity (NEAC), estimated using two dietary assessment methods, and to explore its relationship with plasma NEAC. METHODS: Fifty healthy subjects volunteer to participate in this study. Two dietary assessment methods [a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and a 24-hour recall (24-HR)] were used to collect dietary information. Dietary NEAC, including oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), total polyphenols, ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, was estimated using several data sources of NEAC content in food. NEAC status was measured in fasting blood samples using the same assays. We performed nonparametric Spearman's correlation analysis between pairs of dietary NEAC (FFQ and 24-HR) and diet-plasma NEAC, with and without the contribution of coffee's NEAC. Partial correlation analysis was used to estimate correlations regardless of variables potentially influencing these relationships. RESULTS: FFQ-based NEAC and 24-HR-based NEAC were moderately correlated, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.54 to 0.71, after controlling for energy intake, age and sex. Statistically significant positive correlations were found for dietary FRAP, either derived from the FFQ or the 24-HR, with plasma FRAP (r ~ 0.30). This weak, albeit statistically significant, correlation for FRAP was mostly present in the fruits and vegetables food groups. Plasma ORAC without proteins and 24-HR-based total ORAC were also positively correlated (r = 0.35). CONCLUSION: The relationship between dietary NEAC and plasma FRAP and ORAC suggests the dietary NEAC may reflect antioxidant status despite its weak in vivo potential, supporting further its use in oxidative stress-related disease epidemiology.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dysbiosis is associated with many diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), obesity and diabetes. Potential clinical impact of imbalance in the intestinal microbiota suggests need for new standardised diagnostic methods to facilitate microbiome profiling. AIM: To develop and validate a novel diagnostic test using faecal samples to profile the intestinal microbiota and identify and characterise dysbiosis. METHODS: Fifty-four DNA probes targeting >/=300 bacteria on different taxonomic levels were selected based on ability to distinguish between healthy controls and IBS patients in faecal samples. Overall, 165 healthy controls (normobiotic reference collection) were used to develop a dysbiosis model with a bacterial profile and Dysbiosis Index score output. The model algorithmically assesses faecal bacterial abundance and profile, and potential clinically relevant deviation in the microbiome from normobiosis. This model was tested in different samples from healthy volunteers and IBS and IBD patients (n = 330) to determine the ability to detect dysbiosis. RESULTS: Validation confirms dysbiosis was detected in 73% of IBS patients, 70% of treatment-naive IBD patients and 80% of IBD patients in remission, vs. 16% of healthy individuals. Comparison of deep sequencing and the GA-map Dysbiosis Test, (Genetic Analysis AS, Oslo, Norway) illustrated good agreement in bacterial capture; the latter showing higher resolution by targeting pre-determined highly relevant bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The GA-map Dysbiosis Test identifies and characterises dysbiosis in IBS and IBD patients, and provides insight into a patient's intestinal microbiota. Evaluating microbiota as a diagnostic strategy may allow monitoring of prescribed treatment regimens and improvement in new therapeutic approaches.},

   abstract = {The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and associated oxidative stress is increasing. The antioxidant mineral selenium (Se) was measured in serum samples from 106 IBD patients (53 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 53 with Crohn's disease (CD)) and from 30 healthy controls. Serum Se concentrations were significantly lower in UC and CD patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001) and significantly lower in CD patients than in UC patients (p = 0.006). Se concentrations in patients were significantly influenced by sex, body mass index (BMI), the inflammatory biomarker alpha-1-antitrypsin, surgery, medical treatment, the severity, extent, and form of the disease and the length of time since onset (p < 0.05). Se concentrations in IBD patients were positively and linearly correlated with nutritional (protein, albumin, prealbumin, cholinesterase and total cholesterol) and iron status-related (hemoglobin, Fe and hematocrit) parameters (p < 0.05). A greater impairment of serum Se and cardiovascular status was observed in CD than in UC patients. An adequate nutritional Se status is important in IBD patients to minimize the cardiovascular risk associated with increased inflammation biomarkers, especially in undernourished CD patients, and is also related to an improved nutritional and body iron status.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: alpha-Conotoxin Vc1.1 is a small disulfide-bonded peptide from the venom of the marine cone snail Conus victoriae. Vc1.1 has antinociceptive actions in animal models of neuropathic pain, but its applicability to inhibiting human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuroexcitability and reducing chronic visceral pain (CVP) is unknown. DESIGN: We determined the inhibitory actions of Vc1.1 on human DRG neurons and on mouse colonic sensory afferents in healthy and chronic visceral hypersensitivity (CVH) states. In mice, visceral nociception was assessed by neuronal activation within the spinal cord in response to noxious colorectal distension (CRD). Quantitative-reverse-transcription-PCR, single-cell-reverse-transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry determined gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor B (GABABR) and voltage-gated calcium channel (CaV2.2, CaV2.3) expression in human and mouse DRG neurons. RESULTS: Vc1.1 reduced the excitability of human DRG neurons, whereas a synthetic Vc1.1 analogue that is inactive at GABABR did not. Human DRG neurons expressed GABABR and its downstream effector channels CaV2.2 and CaV2.3. Mouse colonic DRG neurons exhibited high GABABR, CaV2.2 and CaV2.3 expression, with upregulation of the CaV2.2 exon-37a variant during CVH. Vc1.1 inhibited mouse colonic afferents ex vivo and nociceptive signalling of noxious CRD into the spinal cord in vivo, with greatest efficacy observed during CVH. A selective GABABR antagonist prevented Vc1.1-induced inhibition, whereas blocking both CaV2.2 and CaV2.3 caused inhibition comparable with Vc1.1 alone. CONCLUSIONS: Vc1.1-mediated activation of GABABR is a novel mechanism for reducing the excitability of human DRG neurons. Vc1.1-induced activation of GABABR on the peripheral endings of colonic afferents reduces nociceptive signalling. The enhanced antinociceptive actions of Vc1.1 during CVH suggest it is a novel candidate for the treatment for CVP.},

   abstract = {Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in subjects who are not affected by either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). The prevalence of NCGS is not clearly defined yet. Indirect evidence suggests that NCGS is slightly more common than CD, the latter affecting around 1% of the general population. NCGS has been mostly described in adults, particularly in females in the age group of 30-50 years; however, pediatric case series have also been reported. Since NCGS may be transient, gluten tolerance needs to be reassessed over time in patients with NCGS. NCGS is characterized by symptoms that usually occur soon after gluten ingestion, disappear with gluten withdrawal, and relapse following gluten challenge within hours/days. The 'classical' presentation of NCGS is a combination of irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, bowel habit abnormalities (either diarrhea or constipation), and systemic manifestations such as 'foggy mind', headache, fatigue, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, dermatitis (eczema or skin rash), depression, and anemia. In recent years, several studies explored the relationship between the ingestion of gluten-containing food and the appearance of neurological and psychiatric disorders/symptoms like ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, schizophrenia, autism, depression, anxiety, and hallucinations (so-called gluten psychosis). The diagnosis of NCGS should be considered in patients with persistent intestinal and/or extraintestinal complaints showing a normal result of the CD and WA serological markers on a gluten-containing diet, usually reporting worsening of symptoms after eating gluten-rich food. NCGS should not be an exclusion diagnosis only. Unfortunately, no biomarker is sensitive and specific enough for diagnostic purposes; therefore, the diagnosis of NCGS is currently based on establishing a clear-cut cause-effect relationship between the ingestion of gluten and the appearance of symptoms by a standardized double-blind, placebo-controlled gluten challenge.},

   abstract = {Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, in subjects that are not affected by either celiac disease or wheat allergy. Given the lack of a NCGS biomarker, there is the need for standardizing the procedure leading to the diagnosis confirmation. In this paper we report experts' recommendations on how the diagnostic protocol should be performed for the confirmation of NCGS. A full diagnostic procedure should assess the clinical response to the gluten-free diet (GFD) and measure the effect of a gluten challenge after a period of treatment with the GFD. The clinical evaluation is performed using a self-administered instrument incorporating a modified version of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. The patient identifies one to three main symptoms that are quantitatively assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale with a score ranging from 1 to 10. The double-blind placebo-controlled gluten challenge (8 g/day) includes a one-week challenge followed by a one-week washout of strict GFD and by the crossover to the second one-week challenge. The vehicle should contain cooked, homogeneously distributed gluten. At least a variation of 30% of one to three main symptoms between the gluten and the placebo challenge should be detected to discriminate a positive from a negative result. The guidelines provided in this paper will help the clinician to reach a firm and positive diagnosis of NCGS and facilitate the comparisons of different studies, if adopted internationally.},

Non-IgE-GI-FA have a favorable prognosis, with majority resolving by age 3-5 years. Diagnosis relies on the recognition of symptoms pattern in FPIAP and FPIES and biopsy in FPE. Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the pathomechanism, which will lead eventually to the development of diagnostic tests and treatments. Limited evidence supports the role of food allergens in subsets of constipation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic. The immunologic pathomechanism is not fully understood and empiric prolonged avoidance of food allergens should be limited to minimize nutrient deficiency and feeding disorders/food aversions in infants.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although gas-related symptoms (GRS) are common and intrusive, there are no questionnaires to quantitate this problem. This study aimed to develop an instrument to rectify this gap in our knowledge. METHODS: Concepts were initially identified from the literature and interviews with gastroenterologists. Exploratory one-to-one interviews and focus groups with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients (n = 28) and non-IBS subjects (n = 27) with GRS were conducted in UK, France, and Spain leading to a conceptual framework for the questionnaire. Last, iterative rounds of cognitive debriefing were performed with IBS (n = 16) and non-IBS subjects (n = 14). KEY RESULTS: From the first three steps, nine GRS (bloating, distension, flatulence, odorous flatulence, difficult gas evacuation, stomach rumbling, belching, bad breath, and abdominal movement) were identified although abdominal movement was subsequently excluded. Twelve quality of life domains affected by these symptoms were identified as: Clothing, emotional, physical appearance, diet, daily living, work, social life, physical activity, relationships, sex life, sleep, and cognitive function. A 24-h recall for symptoms and a 7-day recall for impact assessment were supported by the qualitative findings. Cognitive debriefing confirmed the understanding of the instrument. Across the three languages, the instrument was conceptually and linguistically consistent. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The International Gas Questionnaire is a 2-part instrument, developed rigorously and simultaneously in three languages assessing seven symptoms (17 items) and their impact on 12 domains (26 items) in IBS and general population. It is now undergoing psychometric validation and should provide a unique tool for epidemiological surveys and clinical trials for developing new treatments for these symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased serum neopterin had been described in older age two decades ago. Neopterin is a biomarker of systemic adaptive immune activation that could be potentially implicated in metabolic syndrome (MetS). Measurements of waist circumference, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin as components of MetS definition, and plasma total neopterin concentrations were performed in 594 participants recruited in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). RESULTS: Higher total neopterin concentrations were associated with reduced HDLC (9.7 %, p < 0.01 for men and 9.2 %, p < 0.01 for women), whereas no association was observed with the rest of the MetS components as well as with MetS overall (per 10 nmol/L: OR = 1.42, 95 % CI = 0.85-2.39 for men and OR = 1.38, 95 % CI = 0.79-2.43). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that high total neopterin concentrations are cross-sectionally associated with reduced HDLC, but not with overall MetS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet can ameliorate symptoms in adult irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) within 48 h. AIM: To determine the efficacy of a low FODMAP diet in childhood IBS and whether gut microbial composition and/or metabolic capacity are associated with its efficacy. METHODS: In a double-blind, crossover trial, children with Rome III IBS completed a 1-week baseline period. They then were randomised to a low FODMAP diet or typical American childhood diet (TACD), followed by a 5-day washout period before crossing over to the other diet. GI symptoms were assessed with abdominal pain frequency being the primary outcome. Baseline gut microbial composition (16S rRNA sequencing) and metabolic capacity (PICRUSt) were determined. Metagenomic biomarker discovery (LEfSe) compared Responders (>/=50% decrease in abdominal pain frequency on low FODMAP diet only) vs. Nonresponders (no improvement during either intervention). RESULTS: Thirty-three children completed the study. Less abdominal pain occurred during the low FODMAP diet vs. TACD [1.1 +/- 0.2 (SEM) episodes/day vs. 1.7 +/- 0.4, P < 0.05]. Compared to baseline (1.4 +/- 0.2), children had fewer daily abdominal pain episodes during the low FODMAP diet (P < 0.01) but more episodes during the TACD (P < 0.01). Responders were enriched at baseline in taxa with known greater saccharolytic metabolic capacity (e.g. Bacteroides, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) and three Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthologues, of which two relate to carbohydrate metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: In childhood IBS, a low FODMAP diet decreases abdominal pain frequency. Gut microbiome biomarkers may be associated with low FODMAP diet efficacy.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rater reproducibility of the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), which categorizes stools into one of seven types, is unknown. We sought to determine reliability and agreement by individual stool type and when responses are categorized by Rome III clinical designation as normal or abnormal (constipation or diarrhea). METHODS: Thirty-four gastroenterology providers from three institutions rated 35 stool photographs using the BSFS. Twenty rerated the photographs. KEY RESULTS: 1190 individual stool type ratings were completed. Though only four photographs had absolute agreement (all Type 1 or Type 7), general agreement was high with 1132 (95.1%) of ratings being within one category type of the modal rating. Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the BSFS by individual stool type was excellent with intraclass correlations of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86-0.90, p < 0.001) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.91, p < 0.001), respectively. However, agreement decreased when using Rome III designations with 13 (37%) photographs having significantly diverging classifications (semi-interquartile range = 0.5). These 13 photographs were rated by the majority of raters as either type 2 vs type 3 or type 5 vs type 6 stools, representing the boundaries of normal vs abnormal stools. Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the BSFS by Rome III clinical categorization decreased with intraclass correlations of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.69-0.81, p < 0.001) and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.49-0.81, p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The Bristol Stool Form Scale has excellent reliability and agreement when used to rate individual stool type by raters. However, BSFS reliability and agreement decreases when determining Rome III stool form categories.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects a large number of children throughout the world. The symptom expression of IBS is heterogeneous, and several factors which may be interrelated within the IBS biopsychosocial model play a role. These factors include visceral hyperalgesia, intestinal permeability, gut microbiota, psychosocial distress, gut inflammation, bile acids, food intolerance, colonic bacterial fermentation, and genetics. The molecular and cellular mechanisms of these factors are being actively investigated. In this mini-review, we present updates of these mechanisms and, where possible, relate the findings to childhood IBS. Mechanistic elucidation may lead to the identification of biomarkers as well as personalized childhood IBS therapies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship of both pubertal development and sex to childhood irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) clinical characteristics including gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, abdominal pain) and psychological factors. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with children ages 7-17 years (n = 143) with a pediatric Rome III IBS diagnosis recruited from both primary and tertiary clinics between January 2009 and January 2014. Subjects completed 14-day prospective pain and stool diaries, as well as validated questionnaires assessing several psychological factors (somatization, depression, anxiety) and Tanner stage. Stool form ratings were completed using the Bristol Stool Form Scale. RESULTS: Girls with higher Tanner scores (more mature pubertal development) had both decreased pain severity and pain interference; in contrast, boys with higher Tanner scores had both increasing pain severity (beta = 0.40, P = .02) and pain interference (beta = 0.16, P = .02). Girls (vs boys), irrespective of pubertal status, had both increased somatic complaints (P = .005) and a higher percentage (P = .01) of hard (Bristol Stool Form Scale type 1 or 2) stools. Pubertal status and sex did not significantly relate to IBS subtype, pain frequency, stooling frequency, anxiety, or depression. CONCLUSIONS: In children with IBS, both pubertal development and/or sex are associated with abdominal pain severity, stool form, and somatization. These differences provide insight into the role of pubertal maturation during the transition from childhood to adult IBS.},

In children with IBS, the prevalence of perceived food intolerances and their impact are unknown. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine the prevalence of self-perceived food intolerances and the relationship of these intolerances to abdominal pain, psychosocial distress, and quality of life in children with IBS. DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study. Questionnaire and prospective diary data were collected from 2008 to 2014 by trained research coordinators. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants were children 7 to 18 years old (pediatric Rome III IBS, n=154; age-sex matched healthy children, n=32) in Houston, TX. MEASURES: Perceived food intolerances and avoided foods were captured using the Childhood Food and Symptom Association Questionnaire. IBS severity was assessed by a >/=7-day pain diary and validated psychosocial questionnaires assessing quality of life, somatization, functional disability, depression, and anxiety. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: We used descriptive Spearman bivariate correlation, chi(2), and Poisson log-linear generalized model with Wald chi(2) statistics. RESULTS: A greater proportion of children with IBS (143 of 154 [92.9%]) vs healthy children (20 of 32 [62.5%]) identified at least one self-perceived food intolerance (chi(2)=22.5; P<0.001). Children with IBS identified a greater number (median=4 [25% to 75% quartile=2 to 6]) of perceived symptom-inducing foods than healthy children (median=2 [25% to 75% quartile=0 to 4]; chi(2)=28.6; P<0.001). Children with IBS avoided more foods (median=2 [25% to 75% quartile=1 to 4]) than healthy children (median=0 [25% to 75% quartile=0 to 2.75]; chi(2)=20.8; P<0.001). The number of self-perceived food intolerances was weakly associated (r value range= -0.17 to 0.21) with pain frequency, pain severity, somatization, anxiety, functional disability, and decreased quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBS have a high prevalence of self-perceived food intolerances. The number of these intolerances is weakly associated with measures of IBS severity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The literature has consistently shown that extreme social-economic groups predicted type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), rather than summarising the social gradient throughout all society stratification. Body mass index (BMI) was established as the principal mediator, with little support for other anthropometries. Our aim was to investigate an individual life-course social position (LiSoP) gradient and its mediators with T2D risk in the EPIC-Spain cohort. METHODS: 36 296 participants (62% women), mostly aged 30-65 years, and free of T2D at baseline (1992-1996) were followed up for a mean of 12.1 years. A combined score of paternal occupation in childhood and own adult education assessed individual life-course social risk accumulation. Hazard ratios of T2D were estimated using Cox regression, stratifying by centre and age, and adjusting for different explanatory models, including anthropometric indices; dietary history; smoking and physical activity lifestyles; and clinical information. RESULTS: Final models evidenced significant risks in excess of 63% for middle and 90% for lower classes of LiSoP in men; and of 104 and 126%, respectively, in women. Concurrently, LiSoP presented significant social gradients for T2D risk (P < 0.01) in both sexes. Waist circumference (WC) accounted for most of the risk excess in women, and BMI and WC in men. CONCLUSIONS: LiSoP gradient was related to T2D risk in Spanish men and women. WC mostly explained the relationship in both genders, together with BMI in men, yet LiSoP retained an independent effect in final models.},

This review discusses diagnostic criteria and research to date on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of NCGS. RECENT FINDINGS: There is recent evidence to support NCGS as a distinct clinical entity. The symptoms attributed to NCGS are nonspecific, overlapping with those reported in patients with celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome. In contrast to celiac disease and wheat allergy, the diagnosis of NCGS is more challenging because there are no specific clinical biomarkers and because the pathogenesis of NCGS is largely not well understood. The pathogenesis of NCGS may reflect alterations in innate immunity to gluten or other components of wheat, may be linked with autoimmunity, or is a result of a reaction to gluten as a fermentable carbohydrate. SUMMARY: NCGS is a newly characterized and evolving clinical entity that requires ruling out other causes of wheat-related or gluten-related gastrointestinal symptoms, including celiac disease and wheat allergy, coupled with double-blind placebo-controlled crossover challenge with gluten.},

Functional constipation patients and irritable bowel syndrome-constipation (IBS-C) patients were administrated high specific volume polysaccharide (HSVP) three times daily for a period of 2 wk to relieve their symptoms. Scores on a stool form scale, and patient reports of straining during a bowel movement, having sensations of an incomplete bowel movement or a blocked anorectum, and abnormal defecation intervals were recorded, graded, and scored by a functional constipation sample group. Similarly, a cohort of IBS-C patients reported their occurrence of abdominal discomfort or pain, abnormal stool formation, defecation frequency, and straining during a bowel movement. Additionally, both groups reported any adverse reactions associated with taking HSVP. All patients in both groups returned for follow-up visits, and no adverse reactions to treatment with HSVP were reported. In the functional constipation group, HSVP was effective for treating symptoms of constipation in 81.46% and 93.17% of patients after 7 and 14 d of dosing, respectively (both p<0.05). In the IBS-C group, symptoms of constipation were relieved in 71.67% and 88.34% of patients after 7 and 14 d of dosing, respectively (both p<0.05). High specific volume polysaccharide was shown be effective for treatment of functional constipation and IBS-C, without causing significant adverse events.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We evaluated eating behaviors and quality of life (QOL) in preadolescent children at risk for obesity, with and without abdominal pain (AP). METHODS: Participants were parent-child dyads enrolled in a randomized, controlled obesity prevention trial. The children were between 5 and 10 years of age and at risk for obesity (70th-95th percentile of body mass index, n = 420). Parents completed measures of their child's eating behaviors, QOL, AP, and bowel function and their own depression status, concern about child weight, and feeding practices. Children's height and weight were also measured. RESULTS: Children with frequent AP (>/=2/month, n = 103) were compared with children reporting infrequent AP (<2/month, n = 312). Age and body mass index did not differ between groups, but AP was more prevalent in girls. Child emotional overeating and parental depression scores were higher in the frequent AP group (P < 0.01), and child QOL was lower (P < 0.01). In multivariable analysis, female gender (odds ratio [OR] 2.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-3.97), emotional overeating (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.37-3.81), and parental depression (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.12-1.35) were associated with more frequent AP. Secondary analyses were completed for children who met Rome III criteria for irritable bowel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians working with children with AP at risk for obesity should consider assessing for and, when appropriate, addressing parent and child factors that could exacerbate AP.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The stability and composition of intestinal flora plays a vital role in human wellbeing throughout life from as early as birth. Over the past 50 years, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotic administration in pediatric gastroenterology. This document aims to provide a recommendation score on probiotic utilization in pediatric gastroenterology, together with a review of current knowledge concerning its benefits, tolerability, and safety. STUDY DESIGN: Published literature was selected without study design restriction: clinical guidelines, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, outcomes research and case-controlled studies were selected using the following MESH-validated terms: probiotics, diarrhea, acute diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, bacterial diarrhea, nosocomial diarrhea, prophylactic diarrhea, Helicobacter pylori infection, colic, infantile colic, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, and allergy. Once the validity and the quality of results were evaluated, a recommendation score and level of evidence were assigned for pediatric gastrointestinal-related conditions, according to the updated Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines: 1a for systematic review (SR) of RCTs, 1b for individual RCT, 1c for SR and individual RCT, 2a for SR of cohort studies, 2b for individual cohort studies, 2c for outcomes research, and 3a for SR of case-control studies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Latin American Expert group consensus recommends the use of the following probiotics for pediatric gastrointestinal conditions: prevention of acute infectious diarrhea (AID): 1b for Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), and L. reuteri; prevention of nosocomial diarrhea: 1 b for B. lactis Bb12, B. bifidum, LGG and Streptococcus thermophiles; treatment of AID: 1a for LGG and S. boulardii, 1b for L. reuteri; prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: 1b for LGG and S. boulardii; prevention of traveler's diarrhea: 1b for S. boulardii; prevention of infantile colic: 1a for L. reuteri DSM 17938; treatment of infantile colic: 1b for L. reuteri DSM 17938; prevention of NEC: 1a for B. breve, mixtures of Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus, LGG, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri DSM 17938; induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis: 1b for VSL#3; improving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: 2c for LGG and VSL#3.},

   abstract = {Functional bowel disorders (FBD), mainly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional constipation (FC, also called chronic idiopathic constipation), are very common worldwide. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, although less common, has a strong impact on patients' quality of life, as well as being highly expensive for our healthcare. A definite cure for those disorders is still yet to come. Over the years, several therapeutic approaches complementary or alternative to traditional pharmacological treatments, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fibre and herbal medicinal products, have been investigated for the management of both groups of diseases. However, most available studies are biased by several drawbacks, including small samples and poor methodological quality. Probiotics, in particular Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacilli (among which Lactobacillus rhamnosus), synbiotics, psyllium, and some herbal medicinal products, primarily peppermint oil, seem to be effective in ameliorating IBS symptoms. Synbiotics and fibre seem to be beneficial in FC patients. The probiotic combination VSL#3 may be effective in inducing remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis, in whom Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 seems to be as effective as mesalamine in maintaining remission. No definite conclusions can be drawn as to the efficacy of fibre and herbal medicinal products in IBD patients due to the low number of studies and the lack of randomized controlled trials that replicate the results obtained in the individual studies conducted so far. Thus, further, well-designed studies are needed to address the real role of these therapeutic options in the management of both FBD and IBD.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A significant proportion of children with functional abdominal pain develop chronic pain. Identifying clinical characteristics predicting pain persistence is important in targeting interventions. We examined whether child anxiety and/or pain-stooling relations were related to maintenance of abdominal pain frequency and compared the predictive value of 3 methods for assessing pain-stooling relations (ie, diary, parent report, child report). METHODS: Seventy-six children (7-10 years old at baseline) who presented for medical treatment of functional abdominal pain were followed up 18 to 24 months later. Baseline anxiety and abdominal pain-stooling relations based on pain and stooling diaries and child- and parent questionnaires were examined in relationship to the persistence of abdominal pain frequency. RESULTS: Children's baseline anxiety was not related to persistence of pain frequency. Children who, however, displayed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms at baseline maintained pain frequency at follow-up, whereas in children in whom there was no relationship between pain and stooling, pain frequency decreased. Pain and stool diaries and parent report of pain-stooling relations were predictive of pain persistence but child-report questionnaires were not. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of IBS symptoms in school-age children with functional abdominal pain appears to predict persistence of abdominal pain over time, whereas anxiety does not. Prospective pain and stooling diaries and parent report of IBS symptoms were predictors of pain maintenance, but child report of symptoms was not.},

The presence of L. farciminis in both ileal and colonic mucosal tissues was demonstrated by FISH and qPCR, with ileum as the preferential niche, as for the SFB population. A different spatial distribution of the probiotic was observed: in the ileum, bacteria were organized in micro-colonies more or less close to the epithelium whereas, in the colon, they were mainly visualized far away from the epithelium. When rats were submitted to WAS, the L. farciminis population substantially decreased in both intestinal regions, due to a stress-induced increase in colonic motility and defecation, rather than a modification of bacterial binding to the intestinal mucin Muc2.},

Isolates of Blastocystis sp.were subtyped using Sequence Tagged Site and representative samples were sequenced at SSUrRNA locus.A total of sixty five isolates of Blastocystis sp. were identified [IBS (n = 50); Controls (n = 15)] of which 91% belonged to ST3 and 9% belonged to ST1. No other subtypes could be identified. Statistically significant association was observed between Blastocystis sp. and IBS patients; however no particular subtype could be ascertained to any particular clinical type of IBS.The frequency of occurrence of Blastocystis sp. was more in IBS patients as compared to the controls and ST3 being the most prevalent subtype. The genetic polymorphism of SSU-rRNA gene amongst the different Blastocystis sp.isolates found in this study reinforces the fact that these organisms are genetically highly divergent.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Although there is convincing evidence that red and processed meat intake increases the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), the potential role of meat cooking practices has not been established yet and could partly explain the current heterogeneity of results among studies. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between meat consumption and cooking practices and the risk of CRC in a population-based case-control study. METHODS: A total of 1671 CRC cases and 3095 controls recruited in Spain between September 2008 and December 2013 completing a food frequency questionnaire with a meat-specific module were included in the analyses. Odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by logistic regression models adjusted for known confounders. RESULTS: Total meat intake was associated with increased risk of CRC (OR T3-T1 1.41; 95% CI 1.19-1.67; p trend < 0.001), and similar associations were found for white, red and processed/cured/organ meat. Rare-cooked meat preference was associated with low risk of CRC in red meat (ORrare vs. medium 0.66; 95% CI 0.51-0.85) and total meat (ORrare vs. medium 0.56; 95% CI 0.37-0.86) consumers, these associations being stronger in women than in men. Griddle-grilled/barbecued meat was associated with an increased CRC risk (total meat: OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.13-1.87). Stewing (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.04-1.51) and oven-baking (OR 1.18; 95% CI 1.00-1.40) were associated with increased CRC risk of white, but not red, meat. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports an association of white, red, processed/cured/organ and total meat intake with an increased risk of CRC. Moreover, our study showed that cooking practices can modulate such risk.},

   abstract = {Lactose intolerance related to primary or secondary lactase deficiency is characterized by abdominal pain and distension, borborygmi, flatus, and diarrhea induced by lactose in dairy products. The biological mechanism and lactose malabsorption is established and several investigations are available, including genetic, endoscopic and physiological tests. Lactose intolerance depends not only on the expression of lactase but also on the dose of lactose, intestinal flora, gastrointestinal motility, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and sensitivity of the gastrointestinal tract to the generation of gas and other fermentation products of lactose digestion. Treatment of lactose intolerance can include lactose-reduced diet and enzyme replacement. This is effective if symptoms are only related to dairy products; however, lactose intolerance can be part of a wider intolerance to variably absorbed, fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs). This is present in at least half of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and this group requires not only restriction of lactose intake but also a low FODMAP diet to improve gastrointestinal complaints. The long-term effects of a dairy-free, low FODMAPs diet on nutritional health and the fecal microbiome are not well defined. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the genetic basis, biological mechanism, diagnosis and dietary management of lactose intolerance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Several cross-sectional surveys have been conducted to study the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in children. The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis of published literature to estimate the prevalence of IBS among Asian children. METHOD: A computer-assisted search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and regional databases of Asia was carried out. Selected articles were reviewed in depth and data were extracted. Pooled prevalence, sex differences, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the I(2) test. RESULTS: A total of 16 cross-sectional studies that reported prevalence of IBS (in children and adolescents) and qualified to be included were taken into the final analysis containing 38,076 patients. Selected studies are from China, Korea, Japan, Iran, Sri Lanka, and Saudi Arabia. Studies showed a marked heterogeneity with I(2) of 98.59 (P < 0.0001). Prevalence of IBS ranges from 2.8% to 25.7%, with a pooled prevalence of 12.41% (95% confidence interval 9.87-14.95). Prevalence risk ratio of girl:boy is 1.39. Prevalence of subtypes is diverse and varies between studies. CONCLUSIONS: The published data indicate that IBS is a significant problem among Asian children and adolescents. Female sex predisposes children and adolescents to develop IBS.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Functional gastrointestinal disorders are among the most common chronic disorders in children worldwide. Studies in schoolchildren from various Latin American countries have shown a high prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders, but their prevalence in Mexican schoolchildren is unknown. Our aim was to assess the prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders in Mexican schoolchildren in accordance with the Rome III criteria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children and adolescents from public and private schools in Monterrey and Cuernavaca privately completed the Spanish version of the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III Version (QPGS-III) in class, using the same methods and questionnaires of previous studies conducted by our group in other Latin American countries. RESULTS: A total of 362 schoolchildren (public school 82, private school 280), with a mean age of 11.6+/-2.1 years completed the QPGS-III. Ninety-nine schoolchildren (27.3%) met the criteria for a FGID, according to the Rome III criteria. Functional constipation was the most common FGID (12.6%). Irritable bowel syndrome (6.4%) was the most common FGID associated with abdominal pain. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of FGIDs between sexes (P=.8). CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of FGIDs in Mexican school-aged children and adolescents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A large proportion (25-46%) of adults with inflammatory bowel disease in remission has symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which are thought to reflect ongoing inflammation. Data on paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients are lacking. AIM: To investigate (i) the prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients in remission and (ii) the relationship of IBS-type symptoms with biochemical markers of disease activity. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all patients (<18 years) with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis attending the out-patient clinic of one of three Dutch hospitals between March 2014 and June 2015. Clinical disease activity was determined using the abbreviated-PCDAI or PUCAI. Biochemical disease activity was assessed using faecal calprotectin and serum CRP. IBS-symptoms were assessed using physician-administered Rome III-questionnaires. RESULTS: We included 184 patients (92 female; mean age: 14.5 years) (Crohn's disease: 123, ulcerative colitis: 61). The prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory bowel disease in clinical remission was 6.4% (95% CI: 2.5-11.1%; Crohn's disease: 4.5%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). Prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children with faecal calprotectin <250 mug/g was 16.1% (95% CI: 7.6-25.8%; Crohn's disease: 16.7%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). No difference in faecal calprotectin or CRP was found between patients in clinical remission with or without IBS-type symptoms (faecal calprotectin: IBS+ median 58 mug/g, IBS- 221 mug/g, P = 0.12; CRP: IBS+ median 1.4 mg/L, IBS- 1.1 mg/L, P = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory bowel disease is highly dependent on the definition of remission. Nonetheless, the prevalence is much lower than that previously reported in studies in adult inflammatory bowel disease patients. IBS-type symptoms appear to be unrelated to gastrointestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) physiopathology is multifactorial and roles for both microbiota and bile acid (BA) modifications have been proposed. We investigated role of dysbiosis, transit pattern and BA metabolism in IBS. METHODS: Clinical data, serum, and stool samples were collected in 15 healthy subjects (HS), 16 diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D) and 15 constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C). Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by real-time PCR. Sera and fecal BA profiles, 7alpha-C4 levels, and in vitro BA transformation activity by fecal microbiota were measured by mass spectrometry. Serum Fibroblast Growth Factor 19 (FGF19) was assayed by ELISA. KEYS RESULTS: Dysbiosis was present in IBS patients with an increase in Escherichia coli in IBS-D patients (p = 0.03), and an increase in Bacteroides (p = 0.01) and Bifidobacterium (p = 0.04) in IBS-C patients. Sera primary and amino-conjugated BA were increased in IBS-D (63.5 +/- 5.5%, p = 0.01 and 78.9 +/- 6.3%, p = 0.03) and IBS-C patients (55.9 +/- 5.5%, p = 0.04 and 65.3 +/- 6.5%, p = 0.005) compared to HS (37.0 +/- 5.8% and 56.7 +/- 8.1%). Serum 7alpha-C4 and FGF19 levels were not different among all three groups. Fecal primary BA were increased in IBS-D patients compared to HS, including chenodeoxycholic acid which has laxative properties (25.6 +/- 8.5% vs 3.5 +/- 0.6%, p = 0.005). Bile acid deconjugation activity was decreased in IBS-D (p = 0.0001) and IBS-C (p = 0.003) feces. Abdominal pain was positively correlated with serum (R = 0.635, p < 0.001) and fecal (R = 0.391, p = 0.024) primary BA. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Different sera and fecal BA profiles in IBS patients could be secondary to dysbiosis and further differences between IBS-C and IBS-D could explain stool patterns. This study opens new fields in IBS physiopathology and suggests that modification of BA profiles could have therapeutic potential.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Innate immune responses to conserved microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin are likely important in microbial-host interactions and intestinal homeostasis. We hypothesized that bacterial translocation and activation of mucosal immunity against common microbial antigens might be involved in the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We therefore compared serum levels of LPS, soluble CD14 (sCD14), and flagellin antibodies between patients with different subtypes of IBS and healthy controls. METHODS: We analyzed serum obtained from 88 patients (74 females) aged 19(43)-73 years and 106 healthy volunteers (77 females) aged 19(38)-62 years. Diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) was present in 32 patients (36%), 23 patients (26%) had constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS), and 33 patients (38%) had A-IBS. We used ELISA for sCD14 and antiflagellin immunoglobulin G and limulus amebocyte assay for LPS. Abdominal symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities were assessed using validated questionnaires. KEY RESULTS: We found a significantly higher serum level of LPS in patients with D-IBS compared to controls (p = 0.0155). The level of antibodies to flagellin was higher in patients with IBS than in controls (mainly driven by higher levels in D-IBS, p = 0.0018). The levels of sCD14 were lower in D-IBS patients compared to controls (p = 0.0498). We found a weak, but significant correlation between the levels of antiflagellin antibodies and anxiety among IBS patients (rho = 0.38; p = 0.0045). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Our results support the concept that immune reactivity to luminal antigens may have a role in the development of D-IBS. The serum level of antiflagellin antibodies was found to correlate with patients' self-reported anxiety score.},

CASE/INTERVENTION: In the course of 6 mo of nutrition therapy utilizing an elimination diet, specific foods triggering abdominal bloating and pain, and vulvovaginal pain were identified. In the course of treatment, the nutrition and supplement program instituted for this patient allowed her to return to her prior functional level without pain (including sexual activity) and resolution of her IBS. She has remained symptom free for at least 6 mo posttreatment. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the potential usefulness of incorporating a customized nutritional approach to determine proinflammatory foods in patients with chronic vulvodynia and overlapping IBS. Long-term pain resolution and healthy sexual functioning in this case was supported by food elimination and nutritional supplementation.},

   abstract = {We previously identified osteopontin (OPN) as a promising marker for the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we investigated the association between prediagnostic circulating OPN levels and HCC incidence in a large population-based cohort. A nested case-control study was conducted within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. During a mean follow-up of 4.8 years, 100 HCC cases were identified. Each case was matched to two controls and OPN levels were measured in baseline plasma samples. Viral hepatitis, liver function, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) tests were also conducted. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate multivariable odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for OPN levels in relation to HCC. Receiver operating characteristics curves were constructed to determine the discriminatory accuracy of OPN alone or in combination with other liver biomarkers in the prediction of HCC. OPN levels were positively associated with HCC risk (per 10% increment, ORmultivariable = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.14-1.48). The association was stronger among cases diagnosed within 2 years of follow-up. Adding liver function tests to OPN improved the discriminatory performance for subjects who developed HCC (AUC = 0.86). For cases diagnosed within 2 years, the combination of OPN and AFP was best able to predict HCC risk (AUC = 0.88). The best predictive model for HCC in this low-risk population is OPN in combination with liver function tests. Within 2 years of diagnosis, the combination of OPN and AFP best predicted HCC development, suggesting that measuring OPN and AFP could identify high-risk groups independently of a liver disease diagnosis.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The spectrum of gastroenterology-related diseases related to obesity is growing. Few clinical tools exist to aid in clinician-guided dietary counseling. GOALS: (1) Develop and validate a 1-page diet history form that would provide information on dietary factors that can contribute to gastrointestinal (GI) illness and to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet; and (2) evaluate the form in a general GI clinic to determine its potential utility as a clinical tool. STUDY: A 1-page diet history form was developed and underwent qualitative and quantitative validation in comparison to a formal diet evaluation by a registered dietitian. The form was then evaluated in consecutive patients attending a general GI clinic, and analyzed for overall diet content, compliance with a Mediterranean diet, and presence of high-risk (red flag) dietary behaviors. RESULTS: The form was evaluated in 134 patients. In a validation cohort (n=30) the qualitative dietary components measured were highly concordant with a formal dietary interview. Total daily calorie intake correlated with formal dietary review (R=0.61), but tended to underestimate total calories due to less precision in portion size. The prospective cohort (n=104) patients had a mean body mass index of 29.8. Overall, 52.9% were obese, 50% had metabolic syndrome, and 51% had a primary GI illness directly impacted by dietary factors (gastroesophageal reflux, irritable bowel, fatty liver). Overall, 85.6% of patients documented red flag behaviors. Patients with obesity trended for more red flags than overweight or normal body mass index groups. CONCLUSION: A 1-page diet questionnaire correlated well with formal dietary assessment and identified clinically relevant dietary interventions in a high percentage of GI patients.},

   abstract = {Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC). Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Research supports relationships between stress and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and disorders. This pilot study assesses relationships between perceived stress, quality of life (QOL), and self-reported pain ratings as an indicator of symptom management in patients who self-reported gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). RESULTS: In the full sample (n = 402) perceived stress positively correlated with depression (r = 0.76, P < .0001), fatigue (r = 0.38, P < .0001), sleep disturbance (r = 0.40, P < .0001), average pain (r = 0.26, P < .0001), and worst pain (r = 0.25, P < .0001). Higher perceived stress also correlated with lower mental health-related QOL. Similar correlations were found for the participants with GERD (n = 188), IBS (n = 132), and IBD (n = 82). Finally, there were significant correlations in the GERD cohort between perceived stress, and average pain (r = 0.34, P < .0001) and worst pain (r = 0.29, P < .0001), and in the IBD cohort between perceived stress, and average pain (r = 0.32, P < .0001), and worst pain (r = 0.35, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Perceived stress broadly correlated with QOL characteristics in patients with GERD, IBS, and IBD, and their overall QOL was significantly lower than the general population. Perceived stress also appeared to be an indicator of symptom management (self-reported pain ratings) in GERD and IBD, but not IBS. While future research using objective measures of stress and symptom/disease management is needed to confirm these associations, as well as to evaluate the ability of stress reduction interventions to improve perceived stress, QOL and disease management in these GI disorders, integrative medicine treatment programs would be most beneficial to study.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: IBS shows genetic predisposition, but adequately powered gene-hunting efforts have been scarce so far. We sought to identify true IBS genetic risk factors by means of genome-wide association (GWA) and independent replication studies. DESIGN: We conducted a GWA study (GWAS) of IBS in a general population sample of 11,326 Swedish twins. IBS cases (N=534) and asymptomatic controls (N=4932) were identified based on questionnaire data. Suggestive association signals were followed-up in 3511 individuals from six case-control cohorts. We sought genotype-gene expression correlations through single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-expression quantitative trait loci interactions testing, and performed in silico prediction of gene function. We compared candidate gene expression by real-time qPCR in rectal mucosal biopsies of patients with IBS and controls. RESULTS: One locus at 7p22.1, which includes the genes KDELR2 (KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 2) and GRID2IP (glutamate receptor, ionotropic, delta 2 (Grid2) interacting protein), showed consistent IBS risk effects in the index GWAS and all replication cohorts and reached p=9.31x10(-6) in a meta-analysis of all datasets. Several SNPs in this region are associated with cis effects on KDELR2 expression, and a trend for increased mucosal KDLER2 mRNA expression was observed in IBS cases compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that general population-based studies combined with analyses of patient cohorts provide good opportunities for gene discovery in IBS. The 7p22.1 and other risk signals detected in this study constitute a good starting platform for hypothesis testing in future functional investigations.},

   abstract = {Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterized by the onset of symptoms after eating gluten-containing food. We aimed to single out NCGS subjects among subjects with functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients were enrolled in a multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled trial with crossover. Symptoms and quality of life were evaluated by means of 10-cm VAS and SF36. Iron parameters, transaminases and C reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated. After a three-week-long gluten-free diet (GFD), responsive patients were randomly assigned to gluten intake (5.6 g/day) or placebo for seven days, followed by crossover. The primary endpoint was the worsening of symptoms (VAS increase >/=3 cm) during gluten ingestion compared to placebo. One hundred and forty patients were enrolled and 134 (17 males, mean age 39.1 +/- 11.7 years, BMI 22.4 +/- 3.8) completed the first period. A total of 101 subjects (10 males, mean age 39.3 +/- 11.0 years, BMI 22.3 +/- 4.0) reported a symptomatic improvement (VAS score 2.3 +/- 1.2 vs. 6.5 +/- 2.2 before and after GFD, p = 0.001). 98 patients underwent the gluten challenge and 28 (all females, mean age 38.9 +/- 12.7 years, BMI 22.0 +/- 2.9) reported a symptomatic relapse and deterioration of quality of life. No parameters were found to be statistically associated with positivity to the challenge. However, 14 patients responded to the placebo ingestion. Taking into account this finding, about 14% of patients responding to gluten withdrawal showed a symptomatic relapse during the gluten challenge. This group is suspected to have NCGS.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by intermittent abdominal pain/discomfort, altered bowel habits and abdominal bloating/distension. This review aimed at presenting the recent developments concerning the role of diet in the pathophysiology and management of IBS. There is no convincing evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy/intolerance, and there is no evidence that gluten causes the debated new diagnosis of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The component in wheat that triggers symptoms in NCGS appears to be the carbohydrates. Patients with NCGS appear to be IBS patients who are self-diagnosed and self-treated with a gluten-free diet. IBS symptoms are triggered by the consumption of the poorly absorbed fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) and insoluble fibre. On reaching the distal small intestine and colon, FODMAPS and insoluble fibre increase the osmotic pressure in the large-intestine lumen and provide a substrate for bacterial fermentation, with consequent gas production, abdominal distension and abdominal pain or discomfort. Poor FODMAPS and insoluble fibres diet reduces the symptom and improve the quality of life in IBS patients. Moreover, it changes favourably the intestinal microbiota and restores the abnormalities in the gastrointestinal endocrine cells. Five gastrointestinal endocrine cell types that produce hormones regulating appetite and food intake are abnormal in IBS patients. Based on these hormonal abnormalities, one would expect that IBS patients to have increased food intake and body weight gain. However, the link between obesity and IBS is not fully studied. Individual dietary guidance for intake of poor FODMAPs and insoluble fibres diet in combination with probiotics intake and regular exercise is to be recommended for IBS patients.},

Despite the many beneficial aspects of consuming wheat products, it is also responsible for several diseases such as celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy, and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). CD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients have similar gastrointestinal symptoms, which can result in CD patients being misdiagnosed as having IBS. Therefore, CD should be excluded in IBS patients. A considerable proportion of CD patients suffer from IBS symptoms despite adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The inflammation caused by gluten intake may not completely subside in some CD patients. It is not clear that gluten triggers the symptoms in NCGS, but there is compelling evidence that carbohydrates (fructans and galactans) in wheat does. It is likely that NCGS patients are a group of self-diagnosed IBS patients who self-treat by adhering to a GFD.},

They regulate the gastrointestinal motility, secretion, visceral sensitivity, absorption, local immune defense, cell proliferation and appetite. These cells act as sensory cells with specialized microvilli that project into the lumen that sense the gut contents (mostly nutrients and/or bacteria byproducts), and respond to luminal stimuli by releasing hormones into the lamina propria. These released hormones exert their actions by entering the circulating blood and reaching distant targets (endocrine mode), nearby structures (paracrine mode) or via afferent and efferent synaptic transmission. The mature intestinal endocrine cells are capable of expressing several hormones. A change in diet not only affects the release of gastrointestinal hormones, but also alters the densities of the gut endocrine cells. The interaction between ingested foodstuffs and the gastrointestinal endocrine cells can be utilized for the clinical management of gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, obesity and diabetes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent literature indicates that a high vegetable intake and not a high fruit intake could be associated with decreased steroid hormone receptor-negative breast cancer risk. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between vegetable and fruit intake and steroid hormone receptor-defined breast cancer risk. DESIGN: A total of 335,054 female participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort were included in this study (mean +/- SD age: 50.8 +/- 9.8 y). Vegetable and fruit intake was measured by country-specific questionnaires filled out at recruitment between 1992 and 2000 with the use of standardized procedures. Cox proportional hazards models were stratified by age at recruitment and study center and were adjusted for breast cancer risk factors. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 11.5 y (IQR: 10.1-12.3 y), 10,197 incident invasive breast cancers were diagnosed [3479 estrogen and progesterone receptor positive (ER+PR+); 1021 ER and PR negative (ER-PR-)]. Compared with the lowest quintile, the highest quintile of vegetable intake was associated with a lower risk of overall breast cancer (HRquintile 5-quintile 1: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.94). Although the inverse association was most apparent for ER-PR- breast cancer (ER-PR-: HRquintile 5-quintile 1: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.96; P-trend = 0.03; ER+PR+: HRquintile 5-quintile 1: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.05; P-trend = 0.14), the test for heterogeneity by hormone receptor status was not significant (P-heterogeneity = 0.09). Fruit intake was not significantly associated with total and hormone receptor-defined breast cancer risk. CONCLUSION: This study supports evidence that a high vegetable intake is associated with lower (mainly hormone receptor-negative) breast cancer risk.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disease with a high population prevalence. The disorder can be debilitating in some patients, whereas others may have mild or moderate symptoms. The most important single risk factors are female sex, younger age and preceding gastrointestinal infections. Clinical symptoms of IBS include abdominal pain or discomfort, stool irregularities and bloating, as well as other somatic, visceral and psychiatric comorbidities. Currently, the diagnosis of IBS is based on symptoms and the exclusion of other organic diseases, and therapy includes drug treatment of the predominant symptoms, nutrition and psychotherapy. Although the underlying pathogenesis is far from understood, aetiological factors include increased epithelial hyperpermeability, dysbiosis, inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, epigenetics and genetics, and altered brain-gut interactions. IBS considerably affects quality of life and imposes a profound burden on patients, physicians and the health-care system. The past decade has seen remarkable progress in our understanding of functional bowel disorders such as IBS that will be summarized in this Primer.},

   abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, BB-12(R), on two primary end points - defecation frequency and gastrointestinal (GI) well-being - in healthy adults with low defecation frequency and abdominal discomfort. A total of 1248 subjects were included in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. After a 2-week run-in period, subjects were randomised to 1 or 10 billion colony-forming units/d of the probiotic strain BB-12(R) or a matching placebo capsule once daily for 4 weeks. Subjects completed a diary on bowel habits, relief of abdominal discomfort and symptoms. GI well-being, defined as global relief of abdominal discomfort, did not show significant differences. The OR for having a defecation frequency above baseline for >/=50% of the time was 1.31 (95% CI 0.98, 1.75), P=0.071, for probiotic treatment overall. Tightening the criteria for being a responder to an increase of >/=1 d/week for >/=50 % of the time resulted in an OR of 1.55 (95% CI 1.22, 1.96), P=0.0003, for treatment overall. A treatment effect on average defecation frequency was found (P=0.0065), with the frequency being significantly higher compared with placebo at all weeks for probiotic treatment overall (all P<0.05). Effects on defecation frequency were similar for the two doses tested, suggesting that a ceiling effect was reached with the one billion dose. Overall, 4 weeks' supplementation with the probiotic strain BB-12(R) resulted in a clinically relevant benefit on defecation frequency. The results suggest that consumption of BB-12(R) improves the GI health of individuals whose symptoms are not sufficiently severe to consult a doctor (ISRCTN18128385).},

   abstract = {Although the relationship between number of teeth and gastric disturbances has been recognised, limited data are available linking tooth loss and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This study aimed to investigate the relation between dental status and IBS among Iranian adults. In a cross-sectional study on 4669 Iranian adults, dental status was evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire. Participants were categorised into five main groups: those with full dentition (without denture), those with denture, individual who had lost 1-2 teeth, 3-5 teeth and half of one jaw or more. IBS and its subtypes were defined using Rome III criteria. After adjusting for different confounding variables, those who had lost 1-2 and 3-5 teeth had 1.35 and 1.33 times greater odds for IBS than fully dentate subjects, respectively. After controlling for different confounders, individuals who had denture had 103% greater odds to have constipation-predominant IBS than those with full dentition (95% confidence interval: 1.29-3.21). Neither in crude nor in adjusted models were any significant association between dental status and other subtypes of IBS. In addition, we did not find any association between losing half of one jaw or more and IBS. We found that losing 1-2 or 3-5 teeth might significantly be associated with increased risk of IBS. Having denture might be related to constipation-predominant IBS. There should be further prospective studies to confirm these findings.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There has been an increasing interest in the role of fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We report results from the first randomized controlled trial of the low FODMAP diet in US adults with IBS and diarrhea (IBS-D). The objectives were to compare the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet vs. a diet based upon modified National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines (mNICE) on overall and individual symptoms in IBS-D patients. METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized-controlled trial of adult patients with IBS-D (Rome III) which compared 2 diet interventions. After a 2-week screening period, eligible patients were randomized to a low FODMAP or mNICE diet for 4 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of patients reporting adequate relief of IBS-D symptoms >/=50% of intervention weeks 3-4. Secondary outcomes included a composite end point which required response in both abdominal pain (>/=30% reduction in mean daily pain score compared with baseline) and stool consistency (decrease in mean daily Bristol Stool Form of >/=1 compared with baseline), abdominal pain and stool consistency responders, and other key individual IBS symptoms assessed using daily questionnaires. RESULTS: After screening, 92 subjects (65 women, median age 42.6 years) were randomized. Eighty-four patients completed the study (45 low FODMAP, 39 mNICE). Baseline demographics, symptom severity, and nutrient intake were similar between groups. Fifty-two percent of the low FODMAP vs. 41% of the mNICE group reported adequate relief of their IBS-D symptoms (P=0.31). Though there was no significant difference in the proportion of composite end point responders (P=0.13), the low FODMAP diet resulted in a higher proportion of abdominal pain responders compared with the mNICE group (51% vs. 23%, P=0.008). Compared with baseline scores, the low FODMAP diet led to greater reductions in average daily scores of abdominal pain, bloating, consistency, frequency, and urgency than the mNICE diet. CONCLUSIONS: In this US trial, 40-50% of patients reported adequate relief of their IBS-D symptoms with the low FODMAP diet or a diet based on modified NICE guidelines. The low FODMAP diet led to significantly greater improvement in individual IBS symptoms, particularly pain and bloating, compared with the mNICE diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent form of liver cancer, is difficult to diagnose and has limited treatment options with a low survival rate. Aside from a few key risk factors, such as hepatitis, high alcohol consumption, smoking, obesity, and diabetes, there is incomplete etiologic understanding of the disease and little progress in identification of early risk biomarkers. METHODS: To address these aspects, an untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomic approach was applied to pre-diagnostic serum samples obtained from first incident, primary HCC cases (n = 114) and matched controls (n = 222) identified from amongst the participants of a large European prospective cohort. RESULTS: A metabolic pattern associated with HCC risk comprised of perturbations in fatty acid oxidation and amino acid, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism was observed. Sixteen metabolites of either endogenous or exogenous origin were found to be significantly associated with HCC risk. The influence of hepatitis infection and potential liver damage was assessed, and further analyses were made to distinguish patterns of early or later diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Our results show clear metabolic alterations from early stages of HCC development with application for better etiologic understanding, prevention, and early detection of this increasingly common cancer.},

   abstract = {With the endogenous formation of vitamin D being significantly curtailed because of public awareness of skin cancer dangers, attention is turning to dietary sources. Cumulative evidence has implicated vitamin D deficiency in increasing susceptibility to various gastrointestinal disorders, including colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, diverticulitis, and irritable bowel syndrome. There is also reason to suggest adjunct vitamin D therapy for such diseases. Although there is justification for increasing vitamin D intake overall, optimal intakes will vary among individuals. Genomic technologies have revealed several hundreds of genes associated with vitamin D actions. The nature of these genes emphasizes the potentially negative implications of modulating vitamin D intakes in the absence of complementary human genetic and genomic data, including information on the gut microbiome. However, we are not yet in a position to apply this information. Genomic data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and metagenomics) could provide evidence that vitamin D sufficiency has been achieved. We suggest that there is an increasingly strong case for considering the more widespread use of vitamin D fortified foods and/or dietary supplements to benefit gastrointestinal health. However, intake levels might beneficially be informed by personalized genetic and genomic information, for optimal disease prevention and maintenance of remission.},

   abstract = {Although it appears biologically plausible for iron to be associated with gastric carcinogenesis, the evidence is insufficient to lead to any conclusions. To further investigate the relationship between body iron status and gastric cancer risk, we conducted a nested case-control study in the multicentric European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. The study included 456 primary incident gastric adenocarcinoma cases and 900 matched controls that occurred during an average of 11 years of follow-up. We measured prediagnostic serum iron, ferritin, transferrin and C-reactive protein, and further estimated total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin saturation (TS). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of gastric cancer by iron metrics were estimated from multivariable conditional logistic regression models. After adjusting for relevant confounders, we observed a statistically significant inverse association between gastric cancer and ferritin and TS indices (ORlog2 = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.72-0.88; OR10%increment = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.78-0.97, respectively). These associations appear to be restricted to noncardia gastric cancer (ferritin showed a p for heterogeneity = 0.04 and TS had a p for heterogeneity = 0.02), and no differences were found by histological type. TIBC increased risk of overall gastric cancer (OR50 microg/dl = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.02-1.2) and also with noncardia gastric cancer (p for heterogeneity = 0.04). Additional analysis suggests that time between blood draw and gastric cancer diagnosis could modify these findings. In conclusion, our results showed a decreased risk of gastric cancer related to higher body iron stores as measured by serum iron and ferritin. Further investigation is needed to clarify the role of iron in gastric carcinogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether and how n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are related to type 2 diabetes (T2D) is debated. Objectively measured plasma PUFAs can help to clarify these associations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Plasma phospholipid PUFAs were measured by gas chromatography among 12,132 incident T2D cases and 15,919 subcohort participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct study across eight European countries. Country-specific hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Prentice-weighted Cox regression and pooled by random-effects meta-analysis. We also systematically reviewed published prospective studies on circulating PUFAs and T2D risk and pooled the quantitative evidence for comparison with results from EPIC-InterAct. In EPIC-InterAct, among long-chain n-3 PUFAs, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) was inversely associated with T2D (HR per standard deviation [SD] 0.93; 95% CI 0.88-0.98), but eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were not significantly associated. Among n-6 PUFAs, linoleic acid (LA) (0.80; 95% CI 0.77-0.83) and eicosadienoic acid (EDA) (0.89; 95% CI 0.85-0.94) were inversely related, and arachidonic acid (AA) was not significantly associated, while significant positive associations were observed with gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), dihomo-GLA, docosatetraenoic acid (DTA), and docosapentaenoic acid (n6-DPA), with HRs between 1.13 to 1.46 per SD. These findings from EPIC-InterAct were broadly similar to comparative findings from summary estimates from up to nine studies including between 71 to 2,499 T2D cases. Limitations included potential residual confounding and the inability to distinguish between dietary and metabolic influences on plasma phospholipid PUFAs. CONCLUSIONS: These large-scale findings suggest an important inverse association of circulating plant-origin n-3 PUFA (ALA) but no convincing association of marine-derived n3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) with T2D. Moreover, they highlight that the most abundant n6-PUFA (LA) is inversely associated with T2D. The detection of associations with previously less well-investigated PUFAs points to the importance of considering individual fatty acids rather than focusing on fatty acid class.},

   abstract = {Whether risk factors for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) differ by subtype (i.e., dualistic pathway of carcinogenesis, histologic subtype) is not well understood; however, data to date suggest risk factor differences. We examined associations between reproductive and hormone-related risk factors for EOC by subtype in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Among 334,126 women with data on reproductive and hormone-related risk factors (follow-up: 1992-2010), 1,245 incident cases of EOC with known histology and invasiveness were identified. Data on tumor histology, grade, and invasiveness, were available from cancer registries and pathology record review. We observed significant heterogeneity by the dualistic model (i.e., type I [low grade serous or endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell, malignant Brenner] vs. type II [high grade serous or endometrioid]) for full-term pregnancy (phet = 0.02). Full-term pregnancy was more strongly inversely associated with type I than type II tumors (ever vs. never: type I: relative risk (RR) 0.47 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.33-0.69]; type II, RR: 0.81 [0.61-1.06]). We observed no significant differences in risk in analyses by major histologic subtypes of invasive EOC (serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell). None of the investigated factors were associated with borderline tumors. Established protective factors, including duration of oral contraceptive use and full term pregnancy, were consistently inversely associated with risk across histologic subtypes (e.g., ever full-term pregnancy: serous, RR: 0.73 [0.58-0.92]; mucinous, RR: 0.53 [0.30-0.95]; endometrioid, RR: 0.65 [0.40-1.06]; clear cell, RR: 0.34 [0.18-0.64]; phet = 0.16). These results suggest limited heterogeneity between reproductive and hormone-related risk factors and EOC subtypes.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To report the indications and/or recommendations by Societies and Institutions for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in functional intestinal disorders in childhood. RECENT FINDINGS: A position by Societies and Institutions is available only for infant colic, irritable bowel syndrome and constipation. Supplementation with the probiotic L reuteri DSM 17938 in breastfed term infants with colic appears to be effective in reducing crying, while still debated is its role in the prevention of colic. Irritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder in children and at present no specific treatments are available; existing data show that although high-quality studies are still needed, some evidence support the efficacy of LGG and VSL#3 in paediatric IBS. At present there is no evidence for the use of pre- or probiotics in childhood constipation. SUMMARY: Probiotics in a near future may have a definite role is some FGIDs of infants and children. The main limitations for the recommendation by Societies and Institutions are the methodological issues that limit the quality of the evidence and the heterogeneity of treatments (probiotic strain and dose, mode, dose and duration of supplementation, primary outcomes, etc). Some specific strains are promising for infant colic (L. reuteri DSM 17938) and irritable bowel syndrome (LGG) while at present there is no indication for their use in the treatment of childhood constipation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a frequent symptom in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and is associated with poor quality of life. However, few studies have evaluated its impact on daily life or the perceived distress it can cause. Using a multi-methods approach, this study describes the impact and manifestations of fatigue in patients with IBS and investigates the relationship between fatigue severity and illness-related and health-promoting factors. METHODS: A total of 160 patients with IBS completed self-reported questionnaires assessing fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, psychological distress, and sense of coherence. Fatigue was assessed with the Fatigue Impact Scale, which also includes structured and open-ended questions which were analyzed with a deductive qualitative analysis. Patients were classified as having severe, moderate, or mild fatigue based on frequency, distress and impact on daily life. KEY RESULTS: The open-ended questions revealed a multidimensional impact on life. Fatigue mainly interfered with the ability to perform physical activities, work, and domestic work, and the ability to interact socially. Decreased stamina was evident, along with strategies to limit the bodily consequences of tiredness. Severe fatigue was accompanied by more severe IBS symptoms, anxiety and depression and lower sense of coherence. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Fatigue is a distressing symptom which occurs in a sizeable proportion of patients with IBS. It affects life in a multidimensional way, with poor bodily stamina being the most prominent feature. Fatigue, along with sense of coherence, depression and anxiety, needs to be assessed, confirmed and targeted for interventions.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Various food patterns have been associated with weight change in adults, but it is unknown which combinations of nutrients may account for such observations. We investigated associations between main nutrient patterns and prospective weight change in adults. METHODS: This study includes 235,880 participants, 25-70 years old, recruited between 1992 and 2000 in 10 European countries. Intakes of 23 nutrients were estimated from country-specific validated dietary questionnaires using the harmonized EPIC Nutrient DataBase. Four nutrient patterns, explaining 67 % of the total variance of nutrient intakes, were previously identified from principal component analysis. Body weight was measured at recruitment and self-reported 5 years later. The relationship between nutrient patterns and annual weight change was examined separately for men and women using linear mixed models with random effect according to center controlling for confounders. RESULTS: Mean weight gain was 460 g/year (SD 950) and 420 g/year (SD 940) for men and women, respectively. The annual differences in weight gain per one SD increase in the pattern scores were as follows: principal component (PC) 1, characterized by nutrients from plant food sources, was inversely associated with weight gain in men (-22 g/year; 95 % CI -33 to -10) and women (-18 g/year; 95 % CI -26 to -11). In contrast, PC4, characterized by protein, vitamin B2, phosphorus, and calcium, was associated with a weight gain of +41 g/year (95 % CI +2 to +80) and +88 g/year (95 % CI +36 to +140) in men and women, respectively. Associations with PC2, a pattern driven by many micro-nutrients, and with PC3, a pattern driven by vitamin D, were less consistent and/or non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: We identified two main nutrient patterns that are associated with moderate but significant long-term differences in weight gain in adults.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose was to evaluate the overlap frequency of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and overactive bladder syndrome (OBS), as well as other gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms, in functional dyspepsia (FD). Additionally, we sought to determine whether adult Rome III FD subtypes were uniquely related to overlap syndromes or symptoms. METHODS: The study was a retrospective review of 100 consecutive pediatric patients, age 8-17 years, diagnosed with FD. All had completed a standardized medical history including gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms as well as specific symptoms related to GERD and OBS. The frequency of overlap with IBS, GERD, and OBS were determined for the whole group and for those fulfilling adult FD subtype criteria. Individual symptoms were also compared by FD subtype. RESULTS: Overlap IBS was present in 33 % of the FD patients. At least one GERD symptom was present in 74 % of patients with 41 % reporting heartburn. At least one OBS symptom was present in 44 % of patients with 29 % reporting urinary urgency. Other than pain, the most common reported gastrointestinal symptom was nausea (86 %). Systemic symptoms were common. Overlap syndromes/symptoms did not vary by FD subtype. Postprandial distress syndrome was associated with pain with eating, weight loss, and waking at night to have a stool. CONCLUSIONS: FD is a heterogeneous condition in children and adolescents with significant variability in the presence of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms and overlap syndromes. Varying symptom profiles need to be accounted for and analyzed in studies involving subjects with FD.},

   abstract = {Myostatin and irisin are two myokines related to energy metabolism, acting on skeletal muscle and recently suggested on adipose tissue in mice. However, the exact role of these myokines in humans has not been fully established. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between serum levels of myostatin and irisin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and non-diabetic controls and to explore its links with metabolic parameters. Case-control study including 73 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and 55 non-diabetic subjects as control group. Circulating myostatin and irisin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients showed significantly lower myostatin levels (p = 0.001) and higher irisin levels (p = 0.036) than controls. An inverse relationship was observed between myostatin and irisin levels (p = 0.002). Moreover, in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, after adjusting by confounder factors, myostatin was negatively related to fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.005) and to triglyceride levels (p = 0.028) while irisin showed a positive association with these variables (p = 0.017 and p = 0.006 respectively). A linear regression analysis showed that irisin and fasting plasma glucose levels were independently associated to myostatin levels and that myostatin and triglyceride levels were independently associated to irisin concentrations in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Our results suggest that serum levels of myostatin and irisin are related in patients with type 2 diabetes. Triglyceride and glucose levels could modulate myostatin and irisin concentrations as a compensatory mechanism to improve the metabolic state in these patients although further studies are needed to elucidate whether the action of these myokines represents an adaptative response.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the maternal and newborn status of erythrocyte fatty acids and the antioxidant defense system after the intake of two portions of salmon per week during late pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnant women (N = 123) were randomly assigned to continue their habitual diet, which was low in oily fish (control group, n = 61) or to consume two 150-g salmon portions per week (salmon group, n = 62) beginning at 20 wk of gestation and lasting until delivery. Fatty acids, selenium, and glutathione concentrations and antioxidant defense enzyme activities were measured in maternal erythrocytes at 20, 34, and 38 wk of pregnancy, and in cord erythrocytes collected at birth. Plasma concentrations of antioxidant molecules were measured. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, consuming salmon had little effect on erythrocyte fatty acids in either mothers or newborns. Components of the antioxidant defense system did not differ between groups. Glutathione peroxidase activity and the concentrations of tocopherols, retinol, and coenzyme Q10 were significantly lower in cord blood compared with maternal blood at week 38 in both groups. CONCLUSION: Maternal and newborn erythrocyte fatty acids are not strongly affected by the intake of two portions of salmon per week during the second half of pregnancy, although erythrocyte docosahexaenoic acid might be increased in newborns. Maternal and newborn antioxidant defense systems are not impaired by intake of salmon from 20 wk gestation.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review was to summarize the evidence regarding probiotics treatment for pediatric IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: The overall management of children with IBS should be tailored to the patient's specific symptoms and identifiable triggers. The four major therapeutic approaches include: pharmacologic, dietary, psychosocial, and complementary/alternative medicine interventions.Although there is limited evidence for efficacy of pharmacological therapies such as antispasmodics and anti-diarrheals, these may have a role in severe cases. A Cochrane review concluded that only weak evidence exists regarding beneficial effects of pharmacological agents in providing relief from symptoms in functional abdominal pain (AP) in children. Role of antibiotics in treatment of children with IBS remains controversial. Various non-pharmacologic treatments are available for pediatric IBS. In a recent systematic review including 24 studies some evidence was found indicating beneficial effects of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy, and probiotics (LGG and VSL#3).Few randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are available in children. A meta-analysis including 9 trials which tested different probiotics as a treatment for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGIDs) in children and adolescents concluded that Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and VSL#3 significantly increased treatment success. We recently showed that, in children with IBS, a mixture of Bifidobacterium infantis M-63(R), breve M-16V(R) and longum BB536(R) is safe and is associated with better AP control and improved quality of life when compared to placebo. SUMMARY: Probiotics are emerging as new therapeutic tools in FGIDs, due to the recognition of the importance of gut microbiota in influencing brain-gut interactions, and of the role played by intestinal infections in the genesis of AP-FGIDs. Preclinical data suggest that changes in the gut microbiota can affect brain signaling systems related to pain and associated emotional behavior. Therefore, probiotics could play a relevant role in the management of FGIDs, by affecting the gut microbiota or by altering brain function and pain perception centrally.},

   abstract = {The intestinal microbiota of patients with constipated-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (C-IBS) displays chronic dysbiosis. Our aim was to determine whether this microbial imbalance instigates perturbation of the host intestinal mucosal immune response, using a model of human microbiota-associated rats (HMAR) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis. The analysis of the microbiota composition revealed a decrease of the relative abundance of Bacteroides, Roseburia-Eubacterium rectale and Bifidobacterium and an increase of Enterobacteriaceae, Desulfovibrio sp., and mainly Akkermansia muciniphila in C-IBS patients compared to healthy individuals. The bacterial diversity of the gut microbiota of healthy individuals or C-IBS patients was maintained in corresponding HMAR. Animals harboring a C-IBS microbiota had reduced DSS colitis with a decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines from innate, Th1, and Th17 responses. The pre-treatment of conventional C57BL/6 mice or HMAR with A. muciniphila, but not with Escherichia coli, prior exposure to DSS also resulted in a reduction of colitis severity, highlighting that the anti-inflammatory effect of the gut microbiota of C-IBS patients is mediated, in part, by A. muciniphila. This work highlights a novel aspect of the crosstalk between the gut microbiota of C-IBS patients and host intestinal homeostasis.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: The cardiovascular effects of probiotics Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 (LC40), or L. coryniformis CECT5711 (K8) plus L. gasseri CECT5714 (LC9) (1:1) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and 30 SHR were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 10): a control WKY group, a control SHR groups, an SHR group treated with LC40, and an SHR treated with K8/LC9 group for 5 weeks (at a dose of 3.3 x 10(10) colony-forming units/day in drinking water). Long-term administration of probiotics reduced systolic blood pressure. The consumption of K8/LC9 mixture significantly reduced the cardiac and renal hypertrophy. Both groups of probiotics reversed the impaired aortic endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine observed in SHR. They also abolished the increased aortic superoxide levels by reducing the increased toll-like receptor-4 mRNA levels and NADPH oxidase activity found in SHR. K8/LC9 consumption also increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation. Probiotic treatments induced a change in the cecum microbiota of SHR, with higher counts of the Lactobacillus spp. cluster, and lower counts of Bacteriodes spp. and Clostridium spp. CONCLUSION: Probiotics exert cardiovascular protective effects in genetic hypertension related to the improvement of vascular pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory status.},

   abstract = {The composition of the microbiota varies according to prenatal events, delivery methods, infant feeding, infant care environment, and antibiotic use. Postnatal gut function and immune development are largely influenced by the intestinal microbiota. Emerging evidence has shown that early microbiota colonization may influence the occurrence of later diseases (microbial programming). The vast majority of microbial species (commensals) give rise to symbiotic host-bacterial interactions that are fundamental for human health. However, changes in the composition of the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) may be associated with several clinical conditions, including obesity and metabolic diseases, autoimmune diseases and allergy, acute and chronic intestinal inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), allergic gastroenteritis (e.g., eosinophilic gastroenteritis and allergic IBS), and necrotizing enterocolitis. Based on recent advances, modulation of gut microbiota with probiotics, prebiotics, or fermented dairy products has been suggested as a treatment of, or prevention for, different disorders such as IBS, infectious diarrhea, allergic disease, and necrotizing enterocolitis.},

The etiology of the condition is uncertain but recent research suggests that the gut bacterial composition may play a role in its development. Therefore, manipulation of the intestinal microbiome by using probiotics and symbiotics has the potential to improve patient outcomes in IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous randomized controlled trials suggest a benefit of probiotics in the management of IBS, with a significant reduction in the likelihood of symptoms persisting after therapy, and improvements in abdominal pain, bloating and flatulence when probiotics are compared with placebo. Evidence for the effect of probiotics on quality of life is conflicting. Relatively few randomized controlled trials have examined the effect of symbiotics on outcomes in IBS, but results thus far are promising. SUMMARY: Probiotics appear to be beneficial in IBS. Data supporting the use of symbiotics is sparse. Whether symbiotics are superior to probiotics is unclear.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Visceral hypersensitivity and psychological symptoms are frequent features in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Exploring mechanistic pathways leading to visceral hypersensitivity is of importance to direct future studies and treatment options. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of psychological factors to the perception of painful and non-painful rectal sensations in hyper- vs normosensitive IBS patients. METHODS: We included 138 IBS patients (Rome II criteria) who underwent an ascending method of limited rectal balloon distension paradigm. At the end of each distension step, subjects rated the perceived intensity of non-painful ('unpleasantness') and painful rectal sensations on visual analog scales. Sensitivity status was determined based on pain thresholds. Anxiety, depression and somatization were assessed by questionnaires. Mixed models were used to test the relationship between sensitivity status, psychological variables, and pain & unpleasantness ratings upon increasing distension. KEY RESULTS: Hypersensitive IBS patients had lower sensory thresholds for pain, first perception, urge to defecate, and discomfort (p < 0.0001). Upon increasing distension, they rated both painful and non-painful sensations as more intense than normosensitive patients (p < 0.0001). Psychological factors were associated with higher pain ratings during distension in hypersensitive (p < 0.006-0.0001), but not in normosensitive patients. Anxiety, but not depression or somatization, was associated with increased intensity ratings of non-painful sensations (p < 0.001), independent of sensitivity status. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Hypersensitive IBS patients are characterized by increased perception of pain, but also of non-painful sensations. Psychological factors increase the perception of painful sensations in hypersensitive patients only, whereas non-painful visceral sensations were exaggerated in anxious patients regardless of the sensitivity status.},

   abstract = {Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated to a change in stool consistency or frequency, include low-grade inflammation and intestinal microbiota changes. Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However, research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials, concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. It is fair to state that for both IBD and IBS, more well-designed, rigorous, randomized clinical trials must be performed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: In vivo and in vitro evidence suggests that antioxidant vitamins and carotenoids may be key factors in the treatment and prevention of obesity and obesity-associated disorders. Hence, the objective of the present study was to determine the relationship between plasma lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin and carotenoid levels and adiposity and cardio-metabolic risk markers in overweight and obese adolescents participating in a multidisciplinary weight loss programme. METHODS: A therapeutic programme was conducted with 103 adolescents aged 12-17 years old and diagnosed with overweight or obesity. Plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, retinol, beta-carotene and lycopene, anthropometric indicators of general and central adiposity, blood pressure and biochemical parameters were analysed at baseline and at 2 and 6 months of treatment. RESULTS: Lipid-corrected retinol (P < 0.05), beta-carotene (P = 0.001) and alpha-tocopherol (P < 0.001) plasma levels increased significantly, whereas lipid-corrected lycopene levels remained unaltered during the treatment. Anthropometric indicators of adiposity (P < 0.001), blood pressure (P < 0.01) and biochemical parameters (P < 0.05) decreased significantly, whereas fat free mass increased significantly (P < 0.001). These clinical and biochemical improvements were related to changes in plasma lipid-corrected antioxidant vitamin and carotenoid levels. The adolescents who experienced the greatest weight loss also showed the largest decrease in anthropometric indicators of adiposity and biochemical parameters and the highest increase in fat free mass. Weight loss in these adolescents was related to an increase in plasma levels of lipid-corrected alpha-tocopherol (P = 0.001), beta-carotene (P = 0.034) and lycopene (P = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin and carotenoid levels are associated with reduced adiposity, greater weight loss and an improved cardio-metabolic profile in overweight and obese adolescents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: In recent years, obesity has reached alarming levels among children and adolescents. The study of plasma fatty acid (FA) composition, as a reflection of diet, and its associations with other parameters, that are closely linked to obesity and the cardiometabolic profile, may be useful for setting nutritional goals for obesity treatment and prevention. This study explored the relationship between plasma FA levels and body fat and cardiometabolic risk markers, in overweight adolescents. METHODS: A multidisciplinary weight loss program was followed by 127 overweight and obese adolescents aged 12-17 years old. Plasma FA composition, anthropometric indicators of adiposity and biochemical parameters were analyzed at baseline, two months (the end of the intensive intervention phase) and six months (the end of the extensive phase). RESULTS: While saturated fatty acid (SFA) and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels decreased significantly during the intervention, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and n-3 PUFA showed the opposite trend. The decrease in SFA C14:0 was associated with a reduction in total and LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and insulin. The increase in MUFAs, especially C18:1n-9, was related to a reduction in weight, fat mass, fat mass index and glucose. Regarding PUFAs, changes in the n-3 series were not associated with any of the parameters studied, whereas the reduction in n-6 PUFAs was directly related to weight, fat mass, total and HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, glucose and insulin, and inversely associated with diastolic blood pressure. The adolescents with greater weight loss presented significant changes in MUFAs, n-6 PUFAs and C14:0. CONCLUSIONS: Modifications in plasma FA composition were associated with adiposity reduction and cardiometabolic profile improvement in an anti-obesity program aimed at adolescents. The changes observed in FA composition were related to the success of the treatment, since the individuals most affected by these variations were those who presented the greatest weight loss.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition with a complex and largely unknown etiology. There is no cure, and treatment options are mainly directed to the amelioration of symptoms. IBS causes reduced quality of life and poses considerable repercussions on health and socioeconomic systems. There is a heritable component in IBS, and genetic research is a valuable tool for the identification of causative pathways, which will provide important insight into the pathophysiology. However, although some gene-hunting efforts have been conducted and a few risk genes proposed, IBS genetic research is lagging behind compared to other complex diseases. In this mini-review, we briefly summarize existing genetic studies, discuss the main challenges in IBS genetic research, and propose strategies to overcome these challenges for IBS gene discovery.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: IBS is a common gut disorder of uncertain pathogenesis. Among other factors, genetics and certain foods are proposed to contribute. Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID) is a rare genetic form of disaccharide malabsorption characterised by diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating, which are features common to IBS. We tested sucrase-isomaltase (SI) gene variants for their potential relevance in IBS. DESIGN: We sequenced SI exons in seven familial cases, and screened four CSID mutations (p.Val557Gly, p.Gly1073Asp, p.Arg1124Ter and p.Phe1745Cys) and a common SI coding polymorphism (p.Val15Phe) in a multicentre cohort of 1887 cases and controls. We studied the effect of the 15Val to 15Phe substitution on SI function in vitro. We analysed p.Val15Phe genotype in relation to IBS status, stool frequency and faecal microbiota composition in 250 individuals from the general population. RESULTS: CSID mutations were more common in patients than asymptomatic controls (p=0.074; OR=1.84) and Exome Aggregation Consortium reference sequenced individuals (p=0.020; OR=1.57). 15Phe was detected in 6/7 sequenced familial cases, and increased IBS risk in case-control and population-based cohorts, with best evidence for diarrhoea phenotypes (combined p=0.00012; OR=1.36). In the population-based sample, 15Phe allele dosage correlated with stool frequency (p=0.026) and Parabacteroides faecal microbiota abundance (p=0.0024). The SI protein with 15Phe exhibited 35% reduced enzymatic activity in vitro compared with 15Val (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SI gene variants coding for disaccharidases with defective or reduced enzymatic activity predispose to IBS. This may help the identification of individuals at risk, and contribute to personalising treatment options in a subset of patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: diet quality indexes are tools are aimed at quantifying the compliance to a defined dietary pattern. These indexes are a combined measure of dietary factors (food groups, foods, nutrients and ratios) and/ or lifestyles factors. The Mediterranean Diet (MD) is a dietary pattern characterized by their positive effects against chronic diseases. There have been many indexes proposed for the assessment of this dietary pattern. An evaluation of their composition and health benefits is therefore convenient. OBJECTIVE: the objective is to evaluate indexes of adherence to the MD with regard to their definition, methodological issues and validation as reported in epidemiological studies. METHODS: we searched in PubMed for studies that developed MD Indexes up to October 2014. RESULTS: a total number of 22 indexes were identified, with differences regarding the number of components (7-28), scoring (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 or 10, in case of compliance), range (0-100) and type of components (which could be food groups/foods or their combination, with nutrients). Among the positive components, fruits and vegetables were the most common and meats, among the negative components. There were also differences with regard to their composition and evaluation (e.g. criteria of moderate alcohol consumption), as well as with the scoring system (in medians, terciles or established servings). CONCLUSIONS: this review suggests that since there is great heterogeneity in the definition of MD. It would be therefore convenient to establish more clearly the components to be included and to establish commonly defined criteria to quantify this dietary pattern.},

   abstract = {Intestinal function is primarily controlled by an intrinsic nervous system of the bowel called the enteric nervous system (ENS). The cells of the ENS are neural crest derivatives that migrate into and through the bowel during early stages of organogenesis before differentiating into a wide variety of neurons and glia. Although genetic factors critically underlie ENS development, it is now clear that many non-genetic factors may influence the number of enteric neurons, types of enteric neurons, and ratio of neurons to glia. These non-genetic influences include dietary nutrients and medicines that may impact ENS structure and function before or after birth. This review summarizes current data about gene-environment interactions that affect ENS development and suggests that these factors may contribute to human intestinal motility disorders like Hirschsprung disease or irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate annual medical and nonmedical costs of care for children diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional abdominal pain (syndrome; FAP/FAPS). STUDY DESIGN: Baseline data from children with IBS or FAP/FAPS who were included in a multicenter trial (NTR2725) in The Netherlands were analyzed. Patients' parents completed a questionnaire concerning usage of healthcare resources, travel costs, out-of-pocket expenses, productivity loss of parents, and supportive measures at school. Use of abdominal pain related prescription medication was derived from case reports forms. Total annual costs per patient were calculated as the sum of direct and indirect medical and nonmedical costs. Costs of initial diagnostic investigations were not included. RESULTS: A total of 258 children, mean age 13.4 years (+/-5.5), were included, and 183 (70.9%) were female. Total annual costs per patient were estimated to be euro2512.31. Inpatient and outpatient healthcare use were major cost drivers, accounting for 22.5% and 35.2% of total annual costs, respectively. Parental productivity loss accounted for 22.2% of total annual costs. No difference was found in total costs between children with IBS or FAP/FAPS. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric abdominal pain related functional gastrointestinal disorders impose a large economic burden on patients' families and healthcare systems. More than one-half of total annual costs of IBS and FAP/FAPS consist of inpatient and outpatient healthcare use. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Registry: NTR2725.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is defined by symptoms of abdominal pain and altered bowel habits without detectable organic disease. Antidepressants and serotonin receptor modulators are used to treat IBS, but rare serious adverse events highlight the safety hurdle. Newer drugs with secretory and motility effects via local gut mechanisms have been successfully approved for IBS, often by registering first in a related, non-IBS condition to optimize dosing, formulation and therapeutic window. AREAS COVERED: This review looks at approaches for novel IBS drug discovery. The underlying pathologies can be tackled locally from the 'outside-in' (intestinal lumen, mucosa and neuromuscular) to identify therapeutic targets. The article discusses the mechanisms associated with bile acid malabsorption, microbial dysbiosis, decreased intestinal barrier function, immune dysregulation, motility and visceral hypersensitivity. EXPERT OPINION: Challenges for new drug discovery are the unknown mechanisms underlying IBS, making it difficult to predict clinically efficacious molecular targets, limited options for translational research and disease progression biomarkers. Drugs acting locally via multiple targets (e.g., eluxadoline [The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Viberzi (eluxadoline) for IBS-D on May 27th 2015], crofelemer) to validated mechanisms are proving successful with tolerable safety margins. Novel mechanisms, identified and optimized based on the emerging role of nutrient signaling, probiotics or microbial products, are promising. Therapeutic treatment earlier in disease progression may improve response and have longer term benefits.},

Altered neural processing of intestinal pain signals involves interoceptive brain regions in adults with functional and inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders. Although these disorders frequently present in childhood, there are no published studies in youth. We determined whether neural processing of somatic pain stimuli differs in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as compared to healthy controls (HC). METHODS: IBS and IBD AYA (16-20 years) underwent anticipated and thermal pain stimuli of low and high intensity on their forearm and simultaneous blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Data from adult HC were used for comparison. Subjects answered surveys evaluating alexithymia, anxiety, depression, and pain catastrophizing. Group data were compared using linear mixed effects and analysis of variance. RESULTS: Study groups were similar by sex but not age. Significant group by pain condition interactions were observed in interoceptive brain regions during pain anticipation, and within perceptual brain regions during perceived pain. Higher activation within interoceptive brain regions during anticipated pain was observed in IBS compared with IBD and HC subjects. IBD patients demonstrated increased activation in perceptual brain regions during experienced pain as compared to IBS and HC. CONCLUSIONS: IBS and IBD AYA demonstrate altered neural processing of somatic pain compared with each other and with HC. Our results suggest that neuromodulatory interventions targeting interoceptive brain circuits in IBS and perceptual brain regions in IBD may be effective.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selenium status is suboptimal in many Europeans and may be a risk factor for the development of various cancers, including those of the liver and biliary tract. OBJECTIVE: We wished to examine whether selenium status in advance of cancer onset is associated with hepatobiliary cancers in the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study. DESIGN: We assessed prediagnostic selenium status by measuring serum concentrations of selenium and selenoprotein P (SePP; the major circulating selenium transfer protein) and examined the association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; n = 121), gallbladder and biliary tract cancers (GBTCs; n = 100), and intrahepatic bile duct cancer (IHBC; n = 40) risk in a nested case-control design within the EPIC study. Selenium was measured by total reflection X-ray fluorescence, and SePP was determined by a colorimetric sandwich ELISA. Multivariable ORs and 95% CIs were calculated by using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: HCC and GBTC cases, but not IHBC cases, showed significantly lower circulating selenium and SePP concentrations than their matched controls. Higher circulating selenium was associated with a significantly lower HCC risk (OR per 20-mug/L increase: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.72) but not with the risk of GBTC or IHBC. Similarly, higher SePP concentrations were associated with lowered HCC risk only in both the categorical and continuous analyses (HCC: P-trend </= 0.0001; OR per 1.5-mg/L increase: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.63). CONCLUSION: These findings from a large prospective cohort provide evidence that suboptimal selenium status in Europeans may be associated with an appreciably increased risk of HCC development.},

   abstract = {Opioids are one of the most prescribed drug classes for treating acute pain. However, chronic use is often associated with tolerance as well as debilitating side effects, including nausea and dependence, which are mediated by the central nervous system, as well as constipation emerging from effects on the enteric nervous system. These gastrointestinal (GI) side effects limit the usefulness of opioids in treating pain in many patients. Understanding the mechanism(s) of action of opioids on the nervous system that shows clinical benefit as well as those that have unwanted effects is critical for the improvement of opioid drugs. The opioidergic system comprises three classical receptors (mu, delta, kappa) and a nonclassical receptor (nociceptin), and each of these receptors is expressed to varying extents by the enteric and intestinal extrinsic sensory afferent nerves. The purpose of this review is to discuss the role that the opioidergic system has on enteric and extrinsic afferent nerves in the lower GI tract in health and diseases of the lower GI tract, particularly inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, and the implications of opioid treatment on clinical outcomes. Consideration is also given to emerging developments in our understanding of the immune system as a novel source of endogenous opioids and the mechanisms underlying opioid tolerance, including the potential influence of opioid receptor splice variants and heteromeric complexes.},

   abstract = {Endometrial cancer (EC) is the fourth most frequent cancer in women in Europe, and as its incidence is increasing, prevention strategies gain further pertinence. Risk prediction models can be a useful tool for identifying women likely to benefit from targeted prevention measures. On the basis of data from 201,811 women (mostly aged 30-65 years) including 855 incident EC cases from eight countries in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, a model to predict EC was developed. A step-wise model selection process was used to select confirmed predictive epidemiologic risk factors. Piece-wise constant hazard rates in 5-year age-intervals were estimated in a cause-specific competing risks model, five-fold-cross-validation was applied for internal validation. Risk factors included in the risk prediction model were body-mass index (BMI), menopausal status, age at menarche and at menopause, oral contraceptive use, overall and by different BMI categories and overall duration of use, parity, age at first full-term pregnancy, duration of menopausal hormone therapy and smoking status (specific for pre, peri- and post-menopausal women). These variables improved the discriminating capacity to predict risk over 5 years from 71% for a model based on age alone to 77% (overall C statistic), and the model was well-calibrated (ratio of expected to observed cases = 0.99). Our model could be used for the identification of women at increased risk of EC in Western Europe. To achieve an EC-risk model with general validity, a large-scale cohort-consortium approach would be needed to assess and adjust for population variation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The substantial characteristics of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are associated with estrogens in women. Both soy isoflavones and vitamin D can modulate estrogen receptors in the colonic smooth muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of soy isoflavones, vitamin D and their probable interactions in women with IBS. METHODS: In a factorial blinded randomized clinical trial, 100 women with IBS (age:18-75yr, were randomly assigned in 4 arms to receive either placebo of vitamin D and placebo of soy isoflavones (P+P), or placebo of vitamin D and soy isoflavones (P+S), or vitamin D and placebo of soy isoflavones (D+P), or vitamin D and soy isoflavones (D+S) for 6 weeks. Dosage of soy isoflavone was 2 capsules of 20 mg soy isoflavones per day, and dosage of vitamin D was one pearl of 50'000 IU biweekly. The clinical outcomes were IBS symptoms severity scores (IBS-SSS), disease- specific quality of life (IBS-QOL) and total score (IBS-TS) that evaluated at weeks 0, 6, and 10, and compared to each other. RESULTS: IBS-TS improved significantly in both S+P and D+P groups (p- value = 0.004, 0.015). The interaction effect of soy isoflavones and vitamin D on IBS-TS was significant (p<0.05). The interaction effect of soy isoflavones with vitamin D and the main effect of vitamin D on IBS-SSS were not statistically significant, whereas IBS-SSS decreased significantly in S+P and D+P groups (p-value = 0.001, 0.047 respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that co-administration of soy isoflavones with vitamin D did not improve the IBS- SSS and IBS- QOL; however, it improved the IBS-TS.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the common gastrointestinal disorders with unknown etiology. In experimental models, it is proposed that soy isoflavones may suppress the clinical and psychological symptoms of IBS by alteration of gut barrier tight junctions. METHODS We conducted this study to evaluate the effects of soy isoflavones on IBS symptoms and patients' quality of life. In a randomized double blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, 67 patients with IBS were allocated to consume either soy isoflavones capsules or a placebo for 6 weeks. The primary outcome was a significant reduction in symptoms severity score and the secondary outcome was a significant improvement in quality of life. RESULTS 45 participants completed the study. There was no significant changes in mean differences of symptoms severity score between the two groups; however soy isoflavone supplementation could significantly improve the quality of life scores (p=0.009). CONCLUSION Soy isoflavones supplementation could improve the quality of life in patients with IBS; however it did not suppress the symptoms severity in 6 weeks. Further research with a longer duration is needed to determine the sustained clinical efficacy. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02026518.},

   abstract = {Plant roots anchor the plant to the soil and absorb water and nutrients for growth. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating root development is essential for improving plant survival and agricultural productivity. Extensive molecular genetic studies have provided important information on crucial components for the root development control over the last few decades. However, it is becoming difficult to identify new regulatory components in root development due to the functional redundancy and lethality of genes involved in root development. In this study, we performed a chemical genetic screen to identify novel synthetic compounds that regulate root development in Arabidopsis seedlings. The screen yielded a root growth inhibitor designated as 'rootin', which inhibited Arabidopsis root development by modulating cell division and elongation, but did not significantly affect shoot development. Transcript analysis of phytohormone marker genes revealed that rootin preferentially altered the expression of auxin-regulated genes. Furthermore, rootin reduced the accumulation of PIN1, PIN3, and PIN7 proteins, and affected the auxin distribution in roots, which consequently may lead to the observed defects in root development. Our results suggest that rootin could be utilized to unravel the mechanisms underlying root development and to investigate dynamic changes in PIN-mediated auxin distribution.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms (GI) compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are common in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission. The causes of these symptoms remain to be clarified. Our aim was to investigate prevalence and factors associated with IBS-like symptoms in patients with UC in deep remission. METHODS: We included 298 patients with UC and used Mayo score, sigmoidoscopy, and fecal calprotectin to define deep remission versus active disease. Presence of IBS-like symptoms according to the Rome III criteria, severity of GI, extraintestinal and psychological symptoms, stress levels, and quality of life were measured with validated questionnaires. Serum cytokines and high-sensitive C-reactive peptide were determined. RESULTS: The criteria for deep remission was fulfilled by 132 patients (44%) and 24 of these fulfilled the Rome III criteria for IBS (18%). Patients with UC in deep remission with IBS-like symptoms had comparable levels of GI symptoms, non-GI somatic symptoms, and quality of life as patients with active UC. The patients with UC in deep remission with IBS-like symptoms had similar levels of fecal calprotectin as patients in deep remission without IBS-like symptoms (18 versus 31 mug/g, P = 0.11), but higher levels of serum cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, IL-13, IL-10 and IL-8, P < 0.05) and higher levels of anxiety (P < 0.001), depression (P = 0.02) and perceived stress (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: IBS-like symptoms in patients with UC in deep remission are common, but not as prevalent as previously reported. Poor psychological well-being and increased serum cytokine levels, but not colonic low-grade inflammation, were associated with IBS-like symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are common in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in clinical remission. It has been suggested that these symptoms might arise due to post-inflammatory changes comparable with post-infectious IBS. The aim was to study factors at new onset of UC that predict development of IBS-like symptoms during clinical remission. METHODS: In total, 98 patients with new onset of UC were followed prospectively for 3 years with yearly follow-up visits. Data from the first visit at the onset of UC were compared between a group of patients who fulfilled the criteria for IBS while in remission (UCR+IBS) during follow-up and a group who did not (UCR-IBS). RESULTS: Among the UC patients, 87 met the criteria for clinical remission and 25 (29%) of these reported IBS-like symptoms in remission during follow-up. There was no difference in inflammatory disease activity at the initial flare or in the prevalence of previous IBS symptoms when comparing UCR+IBS and UCR-IBS patients. The UCR+IBS patients reported more severe gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, during their primary flare. CONCLUSION: The severity and extent of inflammation at onset of UC do not seem to affect the development of IBS-like symptoms in UC patients during clinical remission. The high prevalence of IBS-like symptoms is not explained by pre-existing IBS. UCR+IBS patients reported more severe gastrointestinal symptoms at disease onset, which might indicate a more sensitive gastrointestinal tract in this category of patients.},

A 5-week-old female infant was admitted for evaluation of jaundice and acholic stool. Diagnostic tests, including ultrasound sonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and a hepatobiliary scan, were not conclusive. Although the diagnosis was unclear, the clinical and laboratory findings improved gradually on administration of urodeoxycholic acid and lipid emulsion containing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for 3 weeks. However, a liver biopsy was suggestive of biliary atresia. This finding forced us to perform intraoperative cholangiography, which revealed a patent common bile duct with impacted thick bile. We performed normal saline irrigation and the symptom was improved, the final diagnosis was IBS. Thus, we herein report that IBS can be treated with omega-3 PUFAs as an alternative to surgical intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a chronic disease that often progresses slowly from a precursor stage, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), and that can remain undiagnosed for a long time. METHODS: Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer cohort, we measured prediagnostic plasma sCD23 for 179 individuals who eventually were diagnosed with CLL and an equal number of matched control subjects who remained free of cancer. RESULTS: In a very large proportion of CLL patients' plasma sCD23 was clearly elevated 7 or more years before diagnosis. Considering sCD23 as a disease predictor, the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.90-1.00] for CLL diagnosed within 0.1 to 2.7 years after blood measurement, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86-0.95) for diagnosis within 2.8 to 7.3 years, and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.65-0.86) for CLL diagnosed between 7.4 and 12.5 years. Even at a 7.4-year and longer time interval, elevated plasma sCD23 could predict a later clinical diagnosis of CLL with 100% specificity at >45% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide unique documentation for the very long latency times during which measurable B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder exists before the clinical manifestation of CLL. IMPACT: Our findings have relevance for the interpretation of prospective epidemiologic studies on the causes of CLL in terms of reverse causation bias. The lag times indicate a time frame within which an early detection of CLL would be theoretically possible. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 24(3); 538-45. (c)2014 AACR.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are nonpathogenic live microorganism that can provide a diverse health benefits on the host when consumed in adequate amounts. Probiotics are consumed in diverse ways including dairy product, food supplements and functional foods with specific health claims. Recently, many reports suggest that certain probiotic strains or multi strain mixture have potent immunomodulatory activity in diverse disorders including allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, underlying mechanism of action is still unclear and efficacy of probiotic administration is quite different depending on the type of strains and the amounts of doses. We and others have suggested that live probiotics or their metabolites could interact with diverse immune cells (antigen presenting cells and T cells) and confer them to have immunoregulatory functions. Through this interaction, probiotics could contribute to maintaining immune homeostasis by balancing pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune responses. However, the effect of probiotics in prevention or modulation of ongoing disease is quite diverse even within a same species. Therefore, identification of functional probiotics with specific immune regulatory property is a certainly important issue. Herein, we briefly review selection methods for immunomodulatory probiotic strains and the mechanism of action of probiotics in immune modulation.},

Furthermore, the treated broiler groups (control (T1) and treatment (T2, T3, and T4)) were evaluated for performance, meat quality, and antioxidant status. The results of this study revealed that, among the broilers fed MOLM, the broilers fed 0.5% w/w MOLM (T2) exhibited enhanced meat quality and antioxidant status (P < 0.05). However, the antioxidant activity of the MOLE is greater than that of the MOLM. The LC-MS/MS analysis of MOLM showed high expression of isoflavones and fatty acids from soy and corn source, which antagonistically inhibit the expression of the flavonoids/phenols in the MO leaves thereby masking its antioxidant effects. Thus, altering the soy and corn gradients in conventional nutrition feed with 0.5% w/w MO leaves supplement would provide an efficient and cost-effective feed supplement.},

   abstract = {Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a functional disorder characterized by stereotypical episodes of intense vomiting separated by weeks to months. Although it can occur at any age, the most common age at presentation is 3-7 years. There is no gender predominance. The precise pathophysiology of CVS is not known but a strong association with migraine headaches, in the patient as well as the mother indicates that it may represent a mitochondriopathy. Studies have also suggested the role of an underlying autonomic neuropathy involving the sympathetic nervous system in its pathogenesis. CVS has known triggers in many individuals and avoiding these triggers can help prevent the onset of the episodes. It typically presents in four phases: a prodrome, vomiting phase, recovery phase and an asymptomatic phase until the next episode. Complications such as dehydration and hematemesis from Mallory Wise tear of the esophageal mucosa may occur in more severe cases. Blood and urine tests and abdominal imaging may be indicated depending upon the severity of symptoms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may also be indicated in certain circumstances. Management of an episode after it has started ('abortive treatment') includes keeping the patient in a dark and quiet room, intravenous hydration, ondansetron, sumatriptan, clonidine, and benzodiazepines. Prophylactic treatment includes cyproheptadine, propranolol and amitriptyline. No mortality has been reported as a direct result of CVS and many children outgrow it over time. A subset may develop other functional disorders like irritable bowel syndrome and migraine headaches.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Peppermint oil (PMO) has been used to treat abdominal ailments dating to ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome. Despite its increasing paediatric use, as in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) treatment, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of menthol in children given PMO has not been explored. DESIGN AND SETTING: Single-site, exploratory pilot study of menthol PK following a single 187 mg dose of PMO. Subjects with paediatric Rome II defined (IBS; n=6, male and female, 7-15 years of age) were enrolled. Blood samples were obtained before PMO administration and at 10 discrete time points over a 12 h postdose period. Menthol was quantitated from plasma using a validated gas chromatography mass spectrometry technique. Menthol PK parameters were determined using a standard non-compartmental approach. RESULTS: Following a dose of PMO, a substantial lag time (range 1-4 h) was seen in all subjects for the appearance of menthol which in turn, produced a delayed time of peak (Tmax=5.3 +/- 2.4 h) plasma concentration (Cmax=698.2 +/- 245.4 ng/mL). Tmax and Tlag were significantly more variable than the two exposure parameters; Cmax, mean residence time and total area under the curve (AUC=4039.7 +/- 583.8 ng/mL x h) which had a coefficient of variation of <20%. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed appearance of menthol in plasma after oral PMO administration in children is likely a formulation-specific event which, in IBS, could increase intestinal residence time of the active ingredient. Our data also demonstrate the feasibility of using menthol PK in children with IBS to support definitive studies of PMO dose-effect relationships.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The adolescent clinic is a tertiary referral clinic including patients with a wide variety of complex gastroenterology conditions predominantly tertiary referrals fromGreat Ormond Street Hospital transition clinic. PURPOSE: To assess the benefit of the low FODMAP diet versus the "Milk, egg, wheat and soya" (MEWS) free diet for symptom control in patients with functional gut disorders and/or food allergy from June 2013 to June 2015. METHODS: A total of 436 patients were seen during this time period for dietetic advice and the age range varied from 13-21 years old with 43terms of diagnosis used. These included the broad categories of inflammatory bowel disease, food allergy, functional gut conditions, congenital gut disorders, autoimmune disorders and oncology conditions. For functional gut disorders/food allergy there were 14 terms used which varied from "Functional gut disorder" to "Irritable bowel syndrome" and also included patients with delayed gastric emptying. For patients with food allergy the terms "multiple food allergy" or EosinophilicOesophagitis or Colitis were used. A total of 40 patients with functional gut disorders were referred for the MEWS or low FODMAP diet. The efficacy of the diet was measured using a symptom scale pre and post dietary intervention assessing if patients symptoms changed from nil/mild/moderate tosignificant. The results indicate whether the presenting predominant symptom e.g., bloating, constipation or abdominal pain improved following the dietary intervention. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients were seen for the "MEWS" free diet.These were 17 functional, 3 food allergy, 6 IBS, 2 EosinophilicOesophagitis, 1 oncology patient. The age ranged from 14 to 21 and average ageat treatment was 16.6 years old with 11 males and 18 females. 13 patients were referred for the low FODMAP diet. The patients referred for the low FODMAP diet were 7 with a functional gut disorder, 5Irritable Bowel Syndrome and1 EosinophilicColitis.The age range was 14 to 19 years old with average age at treatment 16.3 years old. There were 6 males and 7 females. The success rate of the MEWS diet measured by reported significant improvement in predominant presenting symptom was 14/29 (48.2%),moderate 4/29 (13.7%) mild 2/29(6.9%) and 9/29 (31%) nil improvement. For the low fodmap diet 6/13 (46.1%) of patientsreported a significant improvement in symptoms,0/13 (0%) moderate,mild 2/13 (15.4%)and 5/13 (38.5%) had nil improvement. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that although there were larger referral rates for the MEWS diet both the MEWS and low FODMAP diet appear to beequally effective dietary approaches for treating patients with functional gut disorders and/or food allergy.},

   abstract = {The community of microorganisms within the human gut (or microbiota) is critical to health and functions with a level of complexity comparable to that of an organ system. Alterations of this ecology (or dysbiosis) have been implicated in a number of disease states, and the prototypical example is Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been demonstrated to durably alter the gut microbiota of the recipient and has shown efficacy in the treatment of patients with recurrent CDI. There is hope that FMT may eventually prove beneficial for the treatment of other diseases associated with alterations in gut microbiota, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and metabolic syndrome, to name a few. Although the basic principles that underlie the mechanisms by which FMT shows therapeutic efficacy in CDI are becoming apparent, further research is needed to understand the possible role of FMT in these other conditions. Although relatively simple to perform, questions regarding both short-term and long-term safety as well as the complex and rapidly evolving regulatory landscape has limited widespread use. Future work will focus on establishing best practices and more robust safety data than exist currently, as well as refining FMT beyond current "whole-stool" transplants to increase safety and tolerability. Encapsulated formulations, full-spectrum stool-based products, and defined microbial consortia are all in the immediate future.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The strong association between t(14;18) translocation and follicular lymphoma (FL) is well known. However, the determinants of this chromosomal aberration and their role in t(14;18) associated FL remain to be established. METHODS: t(14;18) frequency within the B cell lymphoma 2 major breakpoint region was determined for 135 incident FL cases and 251 healthy controls as part of a nested case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer cohort. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in DNA extracted from blood samples taken at recruitment. The relationship between prevalence and frequency of the translocation with baseline anthropometric, lifestyle, and dietary factors in cases and controls was determined. Unconditional logistic regression was used to explore whether the risk of FL associated with these factors differed in t(14;18)(+) as compared to t(14;18)(-) cases. RESULTS: Among incident FL cases, educational level (chi(2) p = 0.021) and height (chi(2) p = 0.025) were positively associated with t(14;18) prevalence, and cases with high frequencies [t(14;18)(HF)] were significantly taller (t test p value = 0.006). These findings were not replicated in the control population, although there were a number of significant associations with dietary variables. Further analyses revealed that height was a significant risk factor for t(14;18)(+) FL [OR 6.31 (95% CI 2.11, 18.9) in the tallest versus the shortest quartile], but not t(14;18)(-) cases. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential role for lifestyle factors in the prevalence and frequency of the t(14;18) translocation. The observation that the etiology of FL may differ by t(14;18) status, particularly with regard to height, supports the subdivision of FL by translocation status.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Altered serotonergic (5-HT) metabolism and visceral perception have been associated with the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Aim of this preliminary study was to assess the effect of the direct precursor of 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), on systemic 5-HT metabolites and visceral perception and to assess potential differential responses between IBS and controls. METHODS: 15 IBS patients and 15 healthy volunteers participated in this randomized double-blind placebo controlled study. Visceroperception was measured by rectal barostat. The 100 mg 5-HTP or placebo was ingested orally. Serotonergic metabolites were assessed in platelet poor plasma. KEY RESULTS: 5-HTP induces rectal allodynia in a significant number of healthy controls; IBS patients exhibit lowered pain thresholds in both placebo and 5-HTP conditions. 5-HTP induces rectal hyperalgesia in hypersensitive but not in non-hypersensitive IBS patients. Administration of 5-HTP significantly increased plasma 5-HTP levels (p < 0.001), did not affect 5-HT levels (p > 0.05), while levels of the main metabolite of 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, increased significantly (p < 0.05) in both groups. The magnitude of these changes observed in 5-HT metabolites was significantly greater in IBS patients. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Oral administration of 5-HTP induced significant alterations in systemic 5-HT metabolites that were accompanied by increased visceroperception of pain in controls and hypersensitive IBS patients. Changes in 5-HT metabolism appear to be important factors involved in visceral hypersensitivity as the 5-HTP-induced pro-nociceptive response was observed in all hypersensitive IBS patients and to a lesser magnitude in a significant number of healthy controls but in none of the non-hypersensitive IBS patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although several dietary factors have been reported to alleviate or aggravate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), no information is available linking habitual dietary patterns to irritable bowel syndrome. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess the association between dietary patterns and the risk of IBS among Iranian adults. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data on 3846 Iranian adults working in 50 different health centers were examined. Dietary intake of study participants was assessed using a 106-item self-administered Dish-based Semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (DS-FFQ) which was designed and validated specifically for Iranian adults. To identify major dietary patterns based on the 39 food groups, we used principal component analysis. A modified Persian version of the Rome III questionnaire was used for assessment of IBS. RESULTS: We identified four major dietary patterns: (i) 'fast food', (ii) 'traditional', (iii) 'lacto-vegetarian', and (iv) 'western' dietary pattern. After adjustment for potential confounders, we found that those in the highest quartile of 'fast food' dietary pattern were tended to have higher risk of IBS than those in the lowest quartile (OR = 1.32; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.75, ptrend = 0.05). An inverse association was also found between 'lacto-vegetarian' dietary pattern and risk of IBS; such that even after adjustment for potential confounders, those in top quartile of this dietary pattern were 24% less likely to have IBS (0.76; 0.59, 0.98; ptrend = 0.02). No overall significant associations were observed between 'traditional' and 'western' dietary patterns and risk of IBS, either before or after adjustment for covariates. CONCLUSION: We found that 'lacto-vegetarian' dietary pattern was associated with reduced risk, while 'fast food' dietary pattern was associated with a greater risk of IBS in Iranian adults.},

   abstract = {Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due to the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can reach 30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of many bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pyloriinfection, and colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from the Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with a potential use in the prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal tract disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely important studies regarding the possibility of using probiotics to promote a balanced microbiota composition, and a sufficient immunological surveillance system as a way to prevent cancer. Considering the fact that the human intestines host 100 trillion bacteria, including more than 1,000 species, there is still need to perform more in depth investigations in order to find probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat cancerous diseases, adding a very promising effect to this already successful panorama. This revision aims to conduct a review of the most recent studies correlating probiotics and its cancer preventing and treatment potential.},

This case reports on the development of PPI-induced hypochlorhydria secondary to a PPI prescription for unresolved gastritis in a patient with irritable bowel syndrome. The patient's gastritis and hypochlorhydria symptoms resolved with the implementation of a comprehensive functional nutrition approach that incorporated dietary guidelines, lifestyle recommendations, and customized nutritional supplementation and herbs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A large proportion of colorectal cancers are thought to be associated with unhealthy dietary and lifestyle exposures, particularly energy excess, obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. It has been suggested that these processes stimulate the production of toxic reactive carbonyls from sugars such as glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde contributes to the production of a group of compounds known as glyceraldehyde-derived advanced glycation end-products (glycer-AGEs), which may promote colorectal cancer through their proinflammatory and pro-oxidative properties. The objective of this study nested within a prospective cohort was to explore the association of circulating glycer-AGEs with risk of colorectal cancer. METHODS: A total of 1,055 colorectal cancer cases (colon n = 659; rectal n = 396) were matchced (1:1) to control subjects. Circulating glycer-AGEs were measured by a competitive ELISA. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), adjusting for potential confounding factors, including smoking, alcohol, physical activity, body mass index, and diabetes status. RESULTS: Elevated glycer-AGEs levels were not associated with colorectal cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quartile, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.82-1.49). Subgroup analyses showed possible divergence by anatomical subsites (OR for colon cancer, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.57-1.22; OR for rectal cancer, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.14-3.19; Pheterogeneity = 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, circulating glycer-AGEs were not associated with risk of colon cancer, but showed a positive association with the risk of rectal cancer. IMPACT: Further research is needed to clarify the role of toxic products of carbohydrate metabolism and energy excess in colorectal cancer development.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are thought to be involved in colorectal cancer development. These processes may contribute to leakage of bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin, across the gut barrier. The objective of this study, nested within a prospective cohort, was to examine associations between circulating LPS and flagellin serum antibody levels and colorectal cancer risk. METHODS: A total of 1,065 incident colorectal cancer cases (colon, n = 667; rectal, n = 398) were matched (1:1) to control subjects. Serum flagellin- and LPS-specific IgA and IgG levels were quantitated by ELISA. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for multiple relevant confouding factors. RESULTS: Overall, elevated anti-LPS and anti-flagellin biomarker levels were not associated with colorectal cancer risk. After testing potential interactions by various factors relevant for colorectal cancer risk and anti-LPS and anti-flagellin, sex was identified as a statistically significant interaction factor (Pinteraction < 0.05 for all the biomarkers). Analyses stratified by sex showed a statistically significant positive colorectal cancer risk association for men (fully-adjusted OR for highest vs. lowest quartile for total anti-LPS + flagellin, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.10-2.51; Ptrend, 0.049), whereas a borderline statistically significant inverse association was observed for women (fully-adjusted OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47-1.02; Ptrend, 0.18). CONCLUSION: In this prospective study on European populations, we found bacterial exposure levels to be positively associated to colorectal cancer risk among men, whereas in women, a possible inverse association may exist. IMPACT: Further studies are warranted to better clarify these preliminary observations.},

In this review, the role of intestinal permeability in common disorders such as infections with intestinal pathogens, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and food allergies will be discussed. In addition, the effect of the frequently prescribed drugs proton pump inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on intestinal permeability, as well as commonly used methods to assess barrier function will be reviewed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A potential link between small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (AP-FGID) has been suggested by symptom similarities and by the reported prevalence of SIBO in children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional AP. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of SIBO using the glucose hydrogen breath test (GHBT), in a cohort of Dutch children with AP-FGID fulfilling the Rome III criteria, and to identify potential predictors. METHODS: Children ages 6 to 18 years with AP-FGID fulfilling the Rome III criteria were included. All of the children underwent a GHBT. SIBO was diagnosed if the fasting breath hydrogen concentration was >/=20 ppm or an increase in H2 levels of >/=12 ppm above the baseline value was measured after ingestion of glucose. Gastrointestinal symptoms were collected using a standardised AP questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 161 Dutch children with AP-FGID were enrolled. Twenty-three patients (14.3%) were diagnosed as having SIBO, as assessed by GHBT; 78% of the children diagnosed as having SIBO had fasting hydrogen levels >/=20 ppm. IBS was significantly more found in children with SIBO compared with children without SIBO (P = 0.001). An altered defecation pattern (ie, change in frequency or form of stool) (P = 0.013), loss of appetite (P = 0.007), and belching (P = 0.023) were significantly more found in children with SIBO compared with those without SIBO. CONCLUSIONS: SIBO is present in 14.3% of children presenting with AP-FGID. IBS, altered defecation pattern, loss of appetite, and belching were predictors for SIBO in children with AP-FGID.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review the literature regarding epidemiology of functional abdominal pain disorders in children and to assess its geographic, gender and age distribution including associated risk factors of developing functional abdominal pain. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsychInfo databases were systematically searched up to February 2014. Study selection criteria included: (1) studies of birth cohort, school based or general population samples (2) containing data concerning epidemiology, prevalence or incidence (3) of children aged 4-18 years (4) suffering from functional abdominal pain. Quality of studies was rated by a self-made assessment tool. A random-effect meta-analysis model was used to estimate the prevalence of functional abdominal pain in childhood. RESULTS: A total of 58 articles, including 196,472 children were included. Worldwide pooled prevalence for functional abdominal pain disorders was 13.5% (95% CI 11.8-15.3), of which irritable bowel syndrome was reported most frequently (8.8%, 95% CI 6.2-11.9). The prevalence across studies ranged widely from 1.6% to 41.2%. Higher pooled prevalence rates were reported in South America (16.8%) and Asia (16.5%) compared to Europe (10.5%). And a higher pooled prevalence was reported when using the Rome III criteria (16.4%, 95% CI 13.5-19.4). Functional abdominal pain disorders are shown to occur significantly more in girls (15.9% vs. 11.5%, pooled OR 1.5) and is associated with the presence of anxiety and depressive disorders, stress and traumatic life events. CONCLUSION: Functional abdominal pain disorders are a common problem worldwide with irritable bowel syndrome as most encountered abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder. Female gender, psychological disorders, stress and traumatic life events affect prevalence.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are some of the most common and challenging disorders in pediatrics. Recurrent abdominal pain is the central feature of pain-associated FGIDs such as irritable bowel syndrome. A thorough understanding of current pathophysiological concepts is essential to successful management. RECENT FINDINGS: The brain-gut axis, role of microbiota and the biopsychosocial model are emerging concepts in FGIDs. The biopsychosocial model focuses on the interplay between genes, environment, and physical and psychosocial factors. Interactions between microbiota and the central, enteric and autonomic nervous systems form the link between gut functions and conscious perceptions. Irritable bowel syndrome is the most extensively studied and prototypical pain-associated FGIDs. An aberrant processing of pain or physiologic signals originating from the gut causes a state of visceral hypersensitivity - a central mechanism of functional pain. Psychosocial and autonomic influences also play large roles. Therapy is tailored to the individual patient and comorbid symptoms. SUMMARY: This review highlights the complex mechanisms and the aberrant brain-gut neural connections forming the basis of FGIDs. Successful management of FGIDs requires knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology coupled with a multidisciplinary treatment approach. Management should focus on cognitive behavioral therapy, dietary factors along with gastrointestinal motility and psychotropic drug therapy.},

   abstract = {GOALS: To evaluate validity, reliability, and responsiveness of the Short Health Scale (SHS) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. BACKGROUND: Subjective health assessment is central when treating patients with IBS. The "Short Health Scale" is a quick 4-item questionnaire covering most aspects of subjective health that has been validated for inflammatory bowel disease. STUDY: To test validity, 451 patients with IBS (mean age, 38 y; 81% females) completed the SHS and questionnaires assessing IBS symptom severity (IBS-SSS), gastrointestinal (GI)-specific anxiety (VSI), and quality of life (IBSQOL). To evaluate reliability and responsiveness to changes, the questionnaires were repeated after 2 weeks in 18 patients, and after 12 weeks in 212 patients who had completed a patient-education program. RESULTS: Validity was documented with (1) gradually increasing mean scores for all 4 SHS items with increasing IBS-SSS (P<0.0001), and (2) correlations between the 4 SHS items and the corresponding items from the other subjective health assessment tools [item 1 (symptom burden): rho=0.67, item 2 (daily function): rho=-0.44 to -0.46, item 3 (disease-related worry): rho=-0.51 to 0.57, item 4 (general well-being): rho=-0.34 to -0.46, P<0.0001]. Reliability was confirmed (Spearman rho>0.7 and intraclass correlations >0.7). Responsiveness was good with responders to the patient-education program (IBS-SSS reduction >/=50 points) having significant reductions in 3 of the SHS items (P<0.05), and borderline change for the fourth SHS item (P=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: SHS is a health measure that shows promising evidence of validity, reliability, and responsiveness in IBS patients. It is quickly completed and evaluated, which supports its usefulness in the busy clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4 is a probiotic strain that has been used as a major ingredient to produce nutraceutical products and as a dairy starter since 2000. The various bio-functional effects and potential for industrial application of B. bifidum BGN4 has been characterized and proven by in vitro (i.e., phytochemical bio-catalysis, cell adhesion and anti-carcinogenic effects on cell lines, and immunomodulatory effects on immune cells), in vivo (i.e., suppressed allergic responses in mouse model and anti-inflammatory bowel disease), and clinical studies (eczema in infants and adults with irritable bowel syndrome). Recently, the investigation of the genome sequencing was finished and this data potentially clarifies the biochemical characteristics of B. bifidum BGN4 that possibly illustrate its nutraceutical functionality. However, further systematic research should be continued to gain insight for academic and industrial applications so that the use of B. bifidum BGN4 could be expanded to result in greater benefit. This review deals with multiple studies on B. bifidum BGN4 to offer a greater understanding as a probiotic microorganism available in functional food ingredients. In particular, this work considers the potential for commercial application, physiological characterization and exploitation of B. bifidum BGN4 as a whole.},

   abstract = {Studies administering plasma protein isolates (PPIs) to experimentally challenged animals have reported improvements in growth, food intake, and overall condition when compared with animals fed control diets, due in part to improvements in gut barrier function, normalization of cytokine signals, and support of enteric immune function. These and early clinical studies suggest that nutritional therapy with PPIs may similarly assist in restoring homeostasis to gut barrier function in humans experiencing mild or more acute enteropathic symptomatology such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. This meta-analysis evaluated the ability of PPIs to promote weight gain and food intake in weanling animals, primarily piglets, after oral challenge with various enteric pathogens or bacterial toxins. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched from 1980 through August 2012 for specified terms and keywords. Twenty-nine articles retrieved through this process were evaluated; 11 studies including 13 experiments were selected for inclusion in the analysis. The meta-analysis included descriptive analyses and methods for combining P values for the primary endpoint, average daily growth (ADG) at week 1, and secondary endpoints including ADG, average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain to feed ratio (G:F) at weeks 1 and 2 and at the end of study. Primary and secondary endpoint analyses of growth (ADG, ADFI, and G:F) were significant (P < 0.01). The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were significantly lower in animals fed dietary PPIs. Additional research in patients experiencing symptoms of enteropathy will further characterize the benefits of PPIs in clinical populations.},

   abstract = {The aim was to investigate the association between pre-diagnostic intakes of polyphenol classes (flavonoids, lignans, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and other polyphenols) in relation to breast cancer survival (all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality). We used data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. Pre-diagnostic usual diet was assessed using dietary questionnaires, and polyphenol intakes were estimated using the Phenol-Explorer database. We followed 11,782 breast cancer cases from time of diagnosis until death, end of follow-up or last day of contact. During a median of 6 years, 1482 women died (753 of breast cancer). We related polyphenol intake to all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality using Cox proportional hazard models with time since diagnosis as underlying time and strata for age and country. Among postmenopausal women, an intake of lignans in the highest versus lowest quartile was related to a 28 % lower risk of dying from breast (adjusted model: HR, quartile 4 vs. quartile 1, 0.72, 95 % CI 0.53; 0.98). In contrast, in premenopausal women, a positive association between lignan intake and all-cause mortality was found (adjusted model: HR, quartile 4 vs. quartile 1, 1.63, 95 % CI 1.03; 2.57). We found no association for other polyphenol classes. Intake of lignans before breast cancer diagnosis may be related to improved survival among postmenopausal women, but may on the contrary worsen the survival for premenopausal women. This suggests that the role of phytoestrogens in breast cancer survival is complex and may be dependent of menopausal status.},

Exposure-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has shown large treatment effects in adults with irritable bowel syndrome, but has not been tested for children 8-12 years with P-FGIDs. AIM: The aim of this trial was to test the feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy of a newly developed exposure-based CBT for children with P-FGIDs. METHOD: The children (n = 20) with a P-FGID, were referred by their treating physicians. The participants received 10 weekly sessions of exposure-based CBT and were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Children improved significantly on the primary outcome measure pain intensity at post (Cohen's d = 0.40, p = 0.049) and at 6-month follow-up (Cohen's d = 0.85, p = 0.004). Improvements were also seen in pain frequency, gastrointestinal symptoms, quality of life, depression, anxiety, school absenteeism and somatic symptoms. Improvements were maintained or further increased at 6-month follow-up. The children engaged in the exposures and were satisfied with the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure-based CBT for children with P-FGIDs is feasible, acceptable and potentially efficacious.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is a surgical treatment of fecal and urinary incontinence that consists of inserting a stimulating electrode into one of the s3 or s4 sacral holes. In addition to the benefit of SNS in the treatment of incontinence, recent studies showed that SNS is effective in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome as well as bladder pain syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of SNS on visceral mechanosensitivity in a cross-organ sensitization rat model. METHODS: Hypersensitive model was obtained by instillation of acetic acid into the bladder of rats during 5 minutes, 30 minutes before the start of the experiments. Visceral sensitivity was assessed by monitoring the change in mean arterial pressure in response to graded isobaric colorectal distension series. To decipher the mechanisms underlying SNS effect, rats were administered intravenously either a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist (naloxone) or a nitric oxide synthesis antagonist (L-NAME). Neuronal activation in the dorsal horn of the sacral spinal cord was measured by counting c-fos immunoreactive cells in response to colorectal distension and NMS. KEY RESULTS: Intravesical acetic acid instillation increased mean arterial pressure variation in response to colorectal distension when compared to saline group. SNS reduced the variation in arterial pressure. Colorectal distension induced a rise in c-fos immunoreactive cells in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This effect was reduced by SNS. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: SNS reduces visceral mechanosensitivity in a cross-organ sensitization model.},

   abstract = {Experience suggests that many celiac patients suffer from persistent symptoms despite a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD). We investigated the prevalence and severity of these symptoms in patients with variable duration of GFD. Altogether, 856 patients were classified into untreated (n = 128), short-term GFD (1-2 years, n = 93) and long-term GFD (>/=3 years, n = 635) groups. Analyses were made of clinical and histological data and dietary adherence. Symptoms were evaluated by the validated GSRS questionnaire. One-hundred-sixty healthy subjects comprised the control group. Further, the severity of symptoms was compared with that in peptic ulcer, reflux disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Altogether, 93% of the short-term and 94% of the long-term treated patients had a strict GFD and recovered mucosa. Untreated patients had more diarrhea, indigestion and abdominal pain than those on GFD and controls. There were no differences in symptoms between the short- and long-term GFD groups, but both yielded poorer GSRS total score than controls (p = 0.03 and p = 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, patients treated 1-2 years had more diarrhea (p = 0.03) and those treated >10 years more reflux (p = 0.04) than controls. Long-term treated celiac patients showed relatively mild symptoms compared with other gastrointestinal diseases. Based on our results, good response to GFD sustained in long-term follow-up, but not all patients reach the level of healthy individuals.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can be assigned to groups with different gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms based on results from a combined nutrient and lactulose challenge. We aimed to identify factors that predict outcomes to this challenge and to determine whether this can be used in noninvasive assessment of visceral sensitivity in patients with IBS. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 100 patients with IBS diagnosed according to Rome III criteria (all subtypes) and seen at a secondary or tertiary care center. After an overnight fast, subjects were given a liquid breakfast (400 mL; Nutridrink) that contained 25 g lactulose. Before the challenge, we assessed visceral sensitivity (via rectal barostat), oro-anal transit time, and fecal microbiota composition (via 16S ribosomal RNA pyrosequencing); we determined IBS severity using questionnaires. The intensity of 8 GI symptoms, the level of digestive comfort, and the amount of exhaled H2 and CH4 in breath were measured before and during a 4-hour period after the liquid breakfast. RESULTS: Based on the intensity of 8 GI symptoms and level of digestive comfort during the challenge, patients were assigned to groups with high-intensity GI symptoms (HGS; n = 39) or low-intensity GI symptoms (LGS; n = 61); patients with HGS had more severe IBS (P < .0001), higher somatization (P < .01), and lower quality of life (P < .05-.01) than patients with LGS. Patients with HGS also had significantly higher rectal sensitivity to random phasic distensions (P < .05-.001, compared with patients with LGS). There were no significant differences between groups in fecal microbiota composition, exhaled gas in breath, or oro-anal transit time. CONCLUSIONS: We found, in a prospective study, that results from a lactulose challenge test could be used to determine visceral sensitivity and severity of IBS. The intensity of patient symptoms did not correlate with the composition of the fecal microbiota. The lactulose challenge test may help better characterize patients with IBS and evaluate the efficacy of new treatments. ClinicalTrial.gov no: NCT01252550.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorders' (FGIDs) associations with body mass index (BMI) have not been thoroughly investigated in the general population. AIM: To investigate the overlap between functional dyspepsia (FDy), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional constipation (FC) and functional diarrhoea (FDh) and the relationship between BMI and those diagnoses in a large French adult population. METHODS: Subjects participating in the Nutrinet-Sante cohort study completed a questionnaire based on Rome III criteria. Anthropometrics, socio-demographical and lifestyle data were collected via self-administered questionnaires. Associations between BMI and FGIDs were investigated with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 35 447 subjects were included in the analysis. Among subjects with FGIDs, 10.4% presented more than one disorder. [FDy coexisted with IBS (23.6%) and FC (15.1%)]. Associations between BMI and FDy differed according to sex. In females, higher odds were observed for underweight and obesity subgroups (OR = 1.26 (95% CI: 0.99-1.59), OR = 1.35 (1.08-1.69), OR = 1.20 (0.81-1.77), OR = 1.47 (0.89-2.42) for underweight, class I, II and III obesity respectively compared with normal BMI), forming a U-shaped relationship confirmed with nonlinear model (P < 0.001). In females, FDh was associated with BMI [OR = 1.05 (1.03-1.07), P < 0.001]. In males, a negative association between BMI and IBS was observed [OR = 0.97 (0.94-0.99), P=0.04]. Other associations were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed an important overlap in FGIDs, supporting the contention of common pathophysiological mechanisms. Relationships between BMI and FGIDs appeared to be sex-dependent. Interaction by sex in the association between BMI and FGIDs should therefore be further explored.},

In this study, we present a comprehensive expression analysis of human and murine BTN and BTNL genes in conditions associated with intestinal inflammation and cancer. Using real-time PCR, expression of human BTN and BTNL genes was analyzed in samples from patients with ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and colon tumors. Expression of murine Btn and Btnl genes was examined in mouse models of spontaneous colitis (Muc2-/-) and intestinal tumorigenesis (ApcMin/+). Our analysis indicates a strong association of several of the human genes with ulcerative colitis and colon cancer; while especially BTN1A1, BTN2A2, BTN3A3, and BTNL8 were significantly altered in inflammation, colonic tumors exhibited significantly decreased levels of BTNL2, BTNL3, BTNL8, and BTNL9 as compared to unaffected tissue. Colonic inflammation in Muc2-/- mice significantly down-regulated the expression of particularly Btnl1, Btnl4, and Btnl6 mRNA, and intestinal polyps derived from ApcMin/+ mice displayed altered levels of Btn1a1, Btn2a2, and Btnl1 transcripts. Thus, our data present an association of BTN and BTNL genes with intestinal inflammation and cancer and represent a valuable resource for further studies of this gene family.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest among specialists in the complications after abdominal surgery due to adhesions. OBJECTIVE: Exploration of experiences, attitudes and expectations of general practitioners concerning bowel obstruction and postoperative abdominal adhesions. METHODS: In October 2012 a postal questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 800 Dutch GPs. RESULTS: The response rate was 45%, 24% (n = 190) filled out the questionnaire completely, 12% (n = 99) had no experience with the subject and 7% (n = 57) had no time to respond. A history of abdominal surgery does play a part in more than 80% of GP's differential diagnosis of abdominal complaints. Seventy-five per cent consider some types of surgery to induce more adhesions. Eighty-five per cent ponder the differentiation between adhesion related complaints and IBS as clear, however difficult (78%) in specific patients. Intestinal transit problems likely due to adhesions are treated with extra fluid (n = 64), more fibres (n = 85) and laxatives (n = 153). Referral to a specialist for adhesiolysis is rarely considered (11%). Forty per cent of the GPs would refer a patient with abdominal pain and suspected adhesions. Seventy-six per cent denote knowledge gaps and low experience in the treatment of intestinal transit problems. Some (n = 23) indicate the need for information about adhesions and obstruction through CME papers. CONCLUSION: Respondents are well equipped to deal with abdominal complaints and intestinal transit problems due to postoperative adhesions. Some indicate the need for information about adhesions and prevention of obstruction through CME papers.},

The aims of this study were to develop and evaluate a new IBS-specific HRQOL instrument (IBS-HR-QOL). METHODS: This methodological study comprised three steps: conceptualization of the IBS-HR-QOL, item extraction and establishment of content validity, and psychometric evaluation of the instrument with 267 IBS patients recruited from four university hospitals. RESULTS: The content validity of the developed IBS-HR-QOL was assessed by 11 experts. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses yielded four factors. The criterion and convergent validities of the IBS-HR-QOL were demonstrated using the Short Form-36 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, respectively. Known-groups validity was demonstrated using a symptom-severity scale. The internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability were satisfactory, with a Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.93 and 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The IBS-HR-QOL comprises a total of 16 items. The IBS-HR-QOL demonstrated good psychometric properties. This instrument is easily comprehensible and short, rendering it feasible for use in clinical practice and research.},

   abstract = {Genetic aspects of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have recently been extensively explored, but environmental influences that affect ASDs have received considerably less attention. Zinc (Zn) is a nutritional factor implicated in ASDs, but evidence for a strong association and linking mechanism is largely lacking. Here we report that trans-synaptic Zn mobilization rapidly rescues social interaction in two independent mouse models of ASD. In mice lacking Shank2, an excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein, postsynaptic Zn elevation induced by clioquinol (a Zn chelator and ionophore) improves social interaction. Postsynaptic Zn is mainly derived from presynaptic pools and activates NMDA receptors (NMDARs) through postsynaptic activation of the tyrosine kinase Src. Clioquinol also improves social interaction in mice haploinsufficient for the transcription factor Tbr1, which accompanies NMDAR activation in the amygdala. These results suggest that trans-synaptic Zn mobilization induced by clioquinol rescues social deficits in mouse models of ASD through postsynaptic Src and NMDAR activation.},

   abstract = {Previously, a lower risk of colorectal cancer was observed with fruit and vegetable consumption in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition within a follow-up period of 9 years which was not fully supported by a recent meta-analysis. Therefore, we were interested in the relation with extended follow-up, also focusing on single subtypes and a variety of intake of fruit and vegetables. Fruit and vegetable consumption was assessed at baseline. After an average of 13 years of follow-up, 3,370 participants were diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer. Diet diversity scores were constructed to quantify variety in fruit and vegetable consumption. A lower risk of colon cancer was observed with higher self-reported consumption of fruit and vegetable combined (HR Q4 vs. Q1 0.87, 95% CI 0.75-1.01, p for trend 0.02), but no consistent association was observed for separate consumption of fruits and vegetables. No associations with risk of rectal cancer were observed. The few observed associations for some fruit and vegetable subtypes with colon cancer risk may have been due to chance. Variety in consumption of fruits and vegetables was not associated with a lower risk of colon or rectal cancer. Although a lower risk of colon cancer is suggested with high consumption of fruit and vegetables, this study does not support a clear inverse association between fruit and vegetable consumption and colon or rectal cancer beyond a follow-up of more than 10 years. Attenuation of the risk estimates from dietary changes over time cannot be excluded, but appears unlikely.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer has a high case-fatality ratio, largely due to late diagnosis. Epidemiologic risk prediction models could help identify women at increased risk who may benefit from targeted prevention measures, such as screening or chemopreventive agents. METHODS: We built an ovarian cancer risk prediction model with epidemiologic risk factors from 202,206 women in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. RESULTS: Older age at menopause, longer duration of hormone replacement therapy, and higher body mass index were included as increasing ovarian cancer risk, whereas unilateral ovariectomy, longer duration of oral contraceptive use, and higher number of full-term pregnancies were decreasing risk. The discriminatory power (overall concordance index) of this model, as examined with five-fold cross-validation, was 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.57, 0.70). The ratio of the expected to observed number of ovarian cancer cases occurring in the first 5 years of follow-up was 0.90 (293 out of 324, 95% CI: 0.81-1.01), in general there was no evidence for miscalibration. CONCLUSION: Our ovarian cancer risk model containing only epidemiological data showed modest discriminatory power for a Western European population. Future studies should consider adding informative biomarkers to possibly improve the predictive ability of the model.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on exercise performance, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, perceived well-being, intestinal injury, and inflammatory responses in nonceliac athletes. METHODS: Thirteen competitive endurance cyclists (8 males, 5 females) with no positive clinical screening for celiac disease or history of irritable bowel syndrome (mean +/- SD; age, 32 +/- 7 yr; weight, 71.1 +/- 13.4 kg; height, 177.0 +/- 11.8 cm, VO2max 59.1 +/- 8.0 mL.kg(-)(1).min(-)(1)) were allocated to a 7-d gluten-containing diet (GCD) or GFD separated by a 10-d washout in a controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Cyclists ate a GFD alongside either gluten-containing or gluten-free food bars (16 g wheat gluten per day) while habitual training and nutrition behaviors were controlled. During each diet, cyclists completed the Daily Analysis of Life Demand for Athletes (DALDA) and GI questionnaires (postexercise and daily). On day 7, cyclists completed a submaximal steady-state (SS) 45-min ride at 70% Wmax followed by a 15-min time trial (TT). Blood samples were taken preexercise, post-SS, and post-TT to determine intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) and inflammatory markers (cytokine responses: interleukin [IL] 1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, tumor necrosis factor alpha). Mixed effects logistic regression was used to analyze data. RESULTS: TT performance was not significantly different (P = 0.37) between the GCD (245.4 +/- 53.4 kJ) and GFD (245.0 +/- 54.6 kJ). GI symptoms during exercise, daily, and DALDA responses were similar for each diet (P > 0.11). There were no significant differences in IFABP (P = 0.69) or cytokine (P > 0.13) responses. CONCLUSIONS: A short-term GFD had no overall effect on performance, GI symptoms, well-being, and a select indicator of intestinal injury or inflammatory markers in nonceliac endurance athletes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies have shown an increased prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) after acute gastroenteritis. Food as a precipitating and perpetuating factor in IBS has gained recent interest, but food intolerance following gastroenteritis is less investigated. The aims of this study were firstly, to compare perceived food intolerance in a group previously exposed to Giardia lamblia with a control group; secondly, to explore the relation with IBS status; and thirdly, to investigate associations with content of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) in foods reported. METHODS: This is a historical cohort study with mailed questionnaire to 1252 Giardia exposed and a control cohort matched by gender and age. Differences between groups were investigated using bivariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate in the exposed group was 65.3 % (817/1252) and in the control group 31.4 % (1128/3598). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for perceived food intolerance for the exposed group was 2.00 with 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.65 to 2.42, as compared with the control group. Perceived intolerance for dairy products was the most frequently reported intolerance, with an adjusted OR for the exposed of 1.95 (95 % CI: 1.51 to 2.51). Perceived intolerance for fatty foods, vegetables, fruit, cereals and alcohol was also significantly higher in the exposed group. The groups did not differ in perceived intolerance to spicy foods, coffee or soda. The association between exposure to Giardia infection and perceived food intolerance differed between the IBS group and the no-IBS group, but IBS was not a significant effect modifier for the association. Perceived intolerance for high FODMAP foods (adjusted OR 1.91) and low FODMAP foods (adjusted OR 1.55) was significantly associated with exposure status. CONCLUSION: Exposure to Giardia infection was associated with perceived food intolerance 3 years after giardiasis. IBS status did not alter the association between exposure status and perceived food intolerance. Perceived intolerance to high FODMAP foods and low FODMAP foods were both statistically significantly associated with exposure to Giardia infection.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and clinical features of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) patients detected by hydrogen and methane in lactulose breath test (LBT), and to study the effects of rifaximin in IBS-D patients. METHODS: Consecutive patients with IBS-D who met Rome criteria, and gender- and age-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled from March 2015 to January 2016 in Peking University Third Hospital. All the ISB-D patients underwent LBT to detect the prevalence of SIBO. The clinical and LBT features of IBS with SIBO (IBS-P group) and without SIBO (IBS-N group) were analyzed. The effects of rifaximin therapy (0.4 g, twice per day for 4 weeks) in IBS-D patients were evaluated by comparing changes in clinical features and LBT results after treatment. RESULTS: (1) Eighty-four IBS-D patients and 22 healthy controls were enrolled. The prevalence of SIBO in IBS-D patients was 41.67% (35/84), with 27 (77.14%) only hydrogen-positive, 5 (14.29%) methane-positive, and 3 (8.57%) both methane- and hydrogen-positive. (2) The body mass index (BMI) in the IBS-P group was lower than in the IBS-N group [(21.61+/-0.57) vs (23.44+/-0.54) kg/m(2,) P<0.05], the maximum stool frequency was also less than in the IBS-N group [(3.85+/-0.23) vs (4.88+/-0.35) times/day, P<0.05]. (3) No significant difference was found in oro-cecal transit time (OCTT) among IBS-P, IBS-N and healthy controls. The hydrogen concentration in small intestinal and colonic sections in breath of the IBS-P group was higher than that of both healthy controls and the IBS-N group, while methane concentration in small intestinal and colonic sections (160 min) was higher than that of the IBS-N group (all P<0.05). (4) There was no linear relationship between mean hydrogen and methane concentrations in LBT among the IBS-P, the IBS-N and healthy control groups (all r<0.35, P>0.05). (5) Totally 13 IBS-P patients received rifaximin therapy, in whom the symptoms of abdomen pain, bloating, fecal consistency, stool frequency, and stool satisfactory were significantly improved after treatment (all P<0.05); 8 IBS-N patients received rifaximin therapy, in whom fecal consistency, stool frequency, and satisfactory were significantly improved (all P<0.05). (6) And 5/13 of the IBS-P patients receiving rifaximin presented negative LBT results after rifaximin therapy, with lower hydrogen concentration at all the time points, especially in colonic section (120 min) [(34.54+/-7.32) x10(-6) vs (52.23+/-9.40) x10(-6,) P<0.05] and lower methane concentration especially in small intestinal section (80 min) [(8.54+/-0.95) x10(-6) vs (11.31+/-0.94) x10(-6,) P<0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: About 41.67% of the IBS-D patients meeting Rome criteria have SIBO, which can be better screened by combining hydrogen and methane in LBT compared with only hydrogen in LBT. SIBO can affect nutritional status in IBS-D patients. Rifaximin can improve the systematic symptoms of IBS-D patients with SIBO, also reduce hydrogen and methane concentration in breath, while only improving diarrhea in IBS-D patients without SIBO. Some differences in gut microbiota may exist between IBS-D with and without SIBO.},

   abstract = {Faecalibacterium prausnitzii depletion in intestinal diseases has been extensively reported, but little is known about intraspecies variability. This work aims to determine if subjects with gastrointestinal disease host mucosa-associated F. prausnitzii populations different from those hosted by healthy individuals. A new species-specific PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) method targeting the 16S rRNA gene was developed to fingerprint F. prausnitzii populations in biopsy specimens from 31 healthy control (H) subjects and 36 Crohn's disease (CD), 23 ulcerative colitis (UC), 6 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and 22 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The richness of F. prausnitzii subtypes was lower in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients than in H subjects. The most prevalent operational taxonomic units (OTUs) consisted of four phylotypes (OTUs with a 99% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity [OTU99]), which were shared by all groups of patients. Their distribution and the presence of some disease-specific F. prausnitzii phylotypes allowed us to differentiate the populations in IBD and CRC patients from that in H subjects. At the level of a minimum similarity of 97% (OTU97), two phylogroups accounted for 98% of the sequences. Phylogroup I was found in 87% of H subjects but in under 50% of IBD patients (P = 0.003). In contrast, phylogroup II was detected in >75% of IBD patients and in only 52% of H subjects (P = 0.005). This study reveals that even though the main members of the F. prausnitzii population are present in both H subjects and individuals with gut diseases, richness is reduced in the latter and an altered phylotype distribution exists between diseases. This approach may serve as a basis for addressing the suitability of F. prausnitzii phylotypes to be quantified as a putative biomarker of disease and depicting the importance of the loss of these subtypes in disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii comprises 2 phylogroups, whose abundance in healthy and diseased gut and in conjunction with Escherichia coli has not yet been studied. This work aims to determine the contribution of F. prausnitzii phylogroups I and II in intestinal disease and to assess their potential diagnostic usefulness as biomarkers for gut diseases. METHODS: Total F. prausnitzii, its phylogroups, and E. coli loads were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction targeting the 16S rRNA gene on biopsies from 31 healthy controls (H), 45 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 25 patients with ulcerative colitis, 10 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and 20 patients with colorectal cancer. Data were normalized to total bacterial counts and analyzed according to patients' disease location and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Lower levels of both total F. prausnitzii and phylogroup I were found in subjects with CD, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer (P < 0.001) compared with H subjects. Phylogroup I load was a better biomarker than total F. prausnitzii to discriminate subjects with gut disorders from H. Phylogroup II depletion was observed only in patients with CD (P < 0.001) and can be potentially applied to differentiate ulcerative pancolitis from colonic CD. No statistically significant correlation between E. coli and any of the 2 F. prausnitzii phylogroups was found in any group of patients or by inflammatory bowel disease location. Phylogroup I was lower in active patients with CD, whereas those CD with intestinal resection showed a reduction in phylogroup II. Treatments with mesalazine and immunosuppressants did not result in the recovery of F. prausnitzii phylogroups abundance. CONCLUSIONS: F. prausnitzii phylogroup I was depleted in CD, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer, whereas phylogroup II was specifically reduced in CD. Quantification of F. prausnitzii phylogroups and E. coli may help to identify gut disorders and to classify inflammatory bowel disease location.},

   abstract = {Inflammation is involved in the pathophysiology of many chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have evidenced important anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFAs). This review illustrates current knowledge about the efficacy of n-3 LC-PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), particularly) in preventing and/or treating several chronic inflammatory conditions (inflammatory bowel diseases and rheumatoid arthritis) as well as their potential benefits on neurodegenerative diseases. It is well established that n-3 LC-PUFAs are substrates for synthesis of novel series of lipid mediators (e.g., resolvins, protectins, and maresins) with potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties, which have been proposed to partly mediate the protective and beneficial actions of n-3 LC-PUFAs. Here, we briefly summarize current knowledge from preclinical studies analyzing the actions of EPA- and DHA-derived resolvins and protectins on pathophysiological models of rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer, and irritable bowel syndrome.},

Our aim was to perform a population-based study using Rome III criteria to describe the prevalence of FGIDs in children in Panama. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of children attending three schools in Panama City, Panama. Children with organic medical diseases were excluded. Subjects provided demographic information and completed the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms - Rome III Spanish version. RESULTS: A total of 321 subjects (61.1% female, median age 10 years, range 8-14 years) completed our study. A total of 92 subjects (28.7%) met criteria for an FGID. Gender, age and school type did not differ significantly between subjects with and without FGIDs. The most common FGIDs included functional constipation (15.9%), irritable bowel syndrome (5.6%), and functional abdominal pain or functional abdominal pain syndrome (4.0%). Abdominal pain-related FGIDs were present in 12.1%. CONCLUSION: FGIDs are common in school-aged children in Panama. The prevalence of abdominal pain-related FGIDs in children in Panama is similar to that described in other parts of the world. Further population-based studies utilising Rome III criteria to measure FGID prevalence in children are needed to advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of FGIDs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The etiology of small intestinal cancer (SIC) is largely unknown, and there are very few epidemiological studies published to date. No studies have investigated abdominal adiposity in relation to SIC. METHODS: We investigated overall obesity and abdominal adiposity in relation to SIC in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), a large prospective cohort of approximately half a million men and women from ten European countries. Overall obesity and abdominal obesity were assessed by body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Stratified analyses were conducted by sex, BMI, and smoking status. RESULTS: During an average of 13.9 years of follow-up, 131 incident cases of SIC (including 41 adenocarcinomas, 44 malignant carcinoid tumors, 15 sarcomas and 10 lymphomas, and 21 unknown histology) were identified. WC was positively associated with SIC in a crude model that also included BMI (HR per 5-cm increase = 1.20, 95 % CI 1.04, 1.39), but this association attenuated in the multivariable model (HR 1.18, 95 % CI 0.98, 1.42). However, the association between WC and SIC was strengthened when the analysis was restricted to adenocarcinoma of the small intestine (multivariable HR adjusted for BMI = 1.56, 95 % CI 1.11, 2.17). There were no other significant associations. CONCLUSION: WC, rather than BMI, may be positively associated with adenocarcinomas but not carcinoid tumors of the small intestine. IMPACT: Abdominal obesity is a potential risk factor for adenocarcinoma in the small intestine.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder with multifactorial pathophysiology. Intestinal barrier may be altered, especially in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Several mediators may contribute to increased intestinal permeability in IBS. AIM: We aimed to assess effects of tryptase and LPS on in vitro permeability using a 3-dimensional cell model after basolateral cell exposure. Furthermore, we assessed the extent to which these mediators in IBS plasma play a role in intestinal barrier function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Caco-2 cells were grown in extracellular matrix to develop into polarized spheroids and were exposed to tryptase (10 - 50 mU), LPS (1 - 50 ng/mL) and two-fold diluted plasma samples of 7 patients with IBS-D, 7 with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) and 7 healthy controls (HC). Barrier function was assessed by the flux of FITC-dextran (FD4) using live cell imaging. Furthermore, plasma tryptase and LPS were determined. RESULTS: Tryptase (20 and 50 mU) and LPS (6.25 - 50 ng/mL) significantly increased Caco-2 permeability versus control (all P< 0.05). Plasma of IBS-D only showed significantly elevated median tryptase concentrations (7.1 [3.9 - 11.0] vs. 4.2 [2.2 - 7.0] vs. 4.2 [2.5 - 5.9] mug/mL; P<0.05) and LPS concentrations (3.65 [3.00 - 6.10] vs. 3.10 [2.60-3.80] vs. 2.65 [2.40 - 3.40] EU/ml; P< 0.05) vs. IBS-C and HC. Also, plasma of IBS-D increased Caco-2 permeability versus HC (0.14450 +/- 0.00472 vs. 0.00021 +/- 0.00003; P < 0.001), which was attenuated by selective inhibition of tryptase and LPS (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Basolateral exposure of spheroids to plasma of IBS-D patients resulted in a significantly increased FD4 permeation, which was partially abolished by selective inhibition of tryptase and LPS. These findings point to a role of systemic tryptase and LPS in the epithelial barrier alterations observed in patients with IBS-D.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Emerging data on the gut microbiome in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggest that altered host-microbe interactions may contribute to disease symptoms. Although gut microbial communities in children with ASD are reported to differ from individuals with neurotypical development, it is not known whether these bacteria induce pathogenic neuroimmune signals. METHODS: Because commensal clostridia interactions with the intestinal mucosa can regulate disease-associated cytokine and serotonergic pathways in animal models, we evaluated whether microbiome-neuroimmune profiles (from rectal biopsy specimens and blood) differed in ASD children with functional gastrointestinal disorders (ASD-FGID, n = 14) compared with neurotypical (NT) children with FGID (NT-FGID, n = 15) and without abdominal pain (NT, n = 6). Microbial 16S ribosomal DNA community signatures, cytokines, and serotonergic metabolites were quantified and correlated with gastrointestinal symptoms. RESULTS: A significant increase in several mucosa-associated Clostridiales was observed in ASD-FGID, whereas marked decreases in Dorea and Blautia, as well as Sutterella, were evident. Stratification by abdominal pain showed multiple organisms in ASD-FGID that correlated significantly with cytokines (interleukin [IL]6, IL1, IL17A, and interferon-gamma). Group comparisons showed that IL6 and tryptophan release by mucosal biopsy specimens was highest in ASD children with abdominal pain, whereas serotonergic metabolites generally were increased in children with FGIDs. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines correlated significantly with several Clostridiales previously reported to associate with ASD, as did tryptophan and serotonin. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify distinctive mucosal microbial signatures in ASD children with FGID that correlate with cytokine and tryptophan homeostasis. Future studies are needed to establish whether these disease-associated Clostridiales species confer early pathogenic signals in children with ASD and FGID.},

   abstract = {Elevated basal serum tryptase levels are present in 4-6% of the general population, but the cause and relevance of such increases are unknown. Previously, we described subjects with dominantly inherited elevated basal serum tryptase levels associated with multisystem complaints including cutaneous flushing and pruritus, dysautonomia, functional gastrointestinal symptoms, chronic pain, and connective tissue abnormalities, including joint hypermobility. Here we report the identification of germline duplications and triplications in the TPSAB1 gene encoding alpha-tryptase that segregate with inherited increases in basal serum tryptase levels in 35 families presenting with associated multisystem complaints. Individuals harboring alleles encoding three copies of alpha-tryptase had higher basal serum levels of tryptase and were more symptomatic than those with alleles encoding two copies, suggesting a gene-dose effect. Further, we found in two additional cohorts (172 individuals) that elevated basal serum tryptase levels were exclusively associated with duplication of alpha-tryptase-encoding sequence in TPSAB1, and affected individuals reported symptom complexes seen in our initial familial cohort. Thus, our findings link duplications in TPSAB1 with irritable bowel syndrome, cutaneous complaints, connective tissue abnormalities, and dysautonomia.},

   abstract = {AIM: To determine the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and quality of life (QoL). METHODS: In this randomized triple-blind trial, adult IBS volunteers who were recruited according to Rome III criteria received 109 or 1010 colony-forming units of NCFM or placebo daily for 12 wk. IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS), which constituted the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes, including individual IBS symptoms, IBS-related QoL questionnaire, anxiety and depression, defecation frequency, and stool consistency, were assessed at baseline at the end of the 8-wk run-in period, after 4 and 12 wk of intervention, and after a 4-wk washout. RESULTS: A total of 340 of 391 randomized volunteers completed the trial. IBS-SSS improved over 12 wk of treatment in all treatment groups, decreasing by a mean +/- SD of 44.0 +/- 80.2, 50.8 +/- 82.4, and 48.3 +/- 72.2 in the placebo, active low-dose, and active high-dose groups, respectively. Similarly, secondary outcomes did not differ between treatment groups. However, in a post hoc analysis of volunteers with moderate to severe abdominal pain at baseline (VAS > 35/100), the treatment significantly reduced the sensation of abdominal pain. Pain scores fell by 20.8 +/- 22.8, 29.4 +/- 17.9, and 31.2 +/- 21.9 in the placebo, active low-dose, and active high-dose groups, respectively (P value for placebo vs combined active doses = 0.0460). CONCLUSION: NCFM alleviates moderate to severe abdominal pain, consistent with earlier observations of this strain mitigating visceral pain through increased analgesic receptor expression.},

   abstract = {Importance: An improved model for risk stratification can be useful for guiding public health strategies of breast cancer prevention. Objective: To evaluate combined risk stratification utility of common low penetrant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and epidemiologic risk factors. Design, Setting, and Participants: Using a total of 17171 cases and 19862 controls sampled from the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) and 5879 women participating in the 2010 National Health Interview Survey, a model for predicting absolute risk of breast cancer was developed combining information on individual level data on epidemiologic risk factors and 24 genotyped SNPs from prospective cohort studies, published estimate of odds ratios for 68 additional SNPs, population incidence rate from the National Cancer Institute-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program cancer registry and data on risk factor distribution from nationally representative health survey. The model is used to project the distribution of absolute risk for the population of white women in the United States after adjustment for competing cause of mortality. Exposures: Single nucleotide polymorphisms, family history, anthropometric factors, menstrual and/or reproductive factors, and lifestyle factors. Main Outcomes and Measures: Degree of stratification of absolute risk owing to nonmodifiable (SNPs, family history, height, and some components of menstrual and/or reproductive history) and modifiable factors (body mass index [BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], menopausal hormone therapy [MHT], alcohol, and smoking). Results: The average absolute risk for a 30-year-old white woman in the United States developing invasive breast cancer by age 80 years is 11.3%. A model that includes all risk factors provided a range of average absolute risk from 4.4% to 23.5% for women in the bottom and top deciles of the risk distribution, respectively. For women who were at the lowest and highest deciles of nonmodifiable risks, the 5th and 95th percentile range of the risk distribution associated with 4 modifiable factors was 2.9% to 5.0% and 15.5% to 25.0%, respectively. For women in the highest decile of risk owing to nonmodifiable factors, those who had low BMI, did not drink or smoke, and did not use MHT had risks comparable to an average woman in the general population. Conclusions and Relevance: This model for absolute risk of breast cancer including SNPs can provide stratification for the population of white women in the United States. The model can also identify subsets of the population at an elevated risk that would benefit most from risk-reduction strategies based on altering modifiable factors. The effectiveness of this model for individual risk communication needs further investigation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical improvement and safety with use of cyproheptadine in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in children. METHODS: Retrospectively evaluating the efficacy and safety of the use for indications including Rome III-defined FGIDs: functional abdominal pain, functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), abdominal migraine, cyclic vomiting syndrome. Response categories were as follows: no improvement group/partial improvement group; requiring intervention, or complete improvement group (CIG); warranting discontinuation; ongoing use; or parental unwillingness to stop medication. RESULTS: Among 307 patients, 151 included; 58% girls, ages 1 to 18 years (median 9); 110 (72.8%) reported complete symptom improvement; 41 (27.2%) reported no or partial improvement. Mean initial and final doses in the CIG were 4.85 mg/day (0.14 mg . kg . day) and 5.34 mg/day (0.14 mg . kg . day), respectively. A total of 102/151 (68%) reported no adverse effects. Adverse effects shown were as sleepiness in 19/151 (13%) and weight gain in 15/151 (10%). Cyproheptadine was effective in improving symptoms of functional abdominal pain, functional dyspepsia, in a relatively larger number of patients. Patients in smaller numbers had significant improvement 13/18 (72%) abdominal migraine, 10/10 (100%) IBS, and 6/8 (75%) cyclic vomiting syndrome. This is the first time report of improvement in IBS. Other pharmacodynamics had been as follows: the lower the body weight, the higher are the odds of no to partial improvement; patients in no improvement group/partial improvement group experience more adverse effects as compared to the CIG; the single best predictor of clinical improvement was body mass index. A 1 unit increase in body mass index with cyproheptadine use increased the odds of clinical improvement by 1.5-fold (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Cyproheptadine effectively improves symptoms of Rome III-defined FGIDs and has a good safety profile when used for these indications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 has been marketed as a dietary ingredient, but its efficacy in diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) condition has not been clinically elucidated till date. Thus, a double blind placebo controlled multi-centered trial was planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of B. coagulans MTCC 5856 in diarrhea predominant IBS patients. METHODS: Thirty six newly diagnosed diarrhea predominant IBS patients were enrolled in three clinical centres. Along with standard care of treatment, 18 patients in group one received placebo while in group two 18 patients received B. coagulans MTCC 5856 tablet containing 2 x 10(9) cfu/day as active for 90 days. Clinical symptoms of IBS were considered as primary end point measures and were evaluated through questionnaires. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used for abdominal pain. Physician's global assessment and IBS quality of life were considered as secondary efficacy measures and were monitored through questionnaires. RESULTS: Laboratory parameters, anthropometric and vital signs were within the normal clinical range during the 90 days of supplementation in placebo and B. coagulans MTCC 5856 group. There was a significant decrease in the clinical symptoms like bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and stool frequency in a patient group receiving B. coagulans MTCC 5856 when compared to placebo group (p < 0.01). Similarly, disease severity also decreased and the quality of life increased in the patient group receiving B. coagulans MTCC 5856 when compared to placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that the B. coagulans MTCC 5856 at a dose of 2 x 10(9) cfu/day along with standard care of treatment was found to be safe and effective in diarrhea predominant IBS patients for 90 days of supplementation. Hence, B. coagulans MTCC 5856 could be a potential agent in the management of diarrhea predominant IBS patients.},

   abstract = {The spectrum of gluten-related disorders has widened in recent times and includes celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy. The complex of symptoms associated with these diseases, such as diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain may overlap for the gluten related diseases, and furthermore they can be similar to those caused by various other intestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The mechanisms underlying symptom generation are diverse for all these diseases. Some patients with celiac disease may remain asymptomatic or have only mild gastrointestinal symptoms and thus may qualify for the diagnosis of IBS in the general clinical practice. Similarly, the overlap of symptoms between IBS and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) often creates a dilemma for clinicians. While the treatment of NCGS is exclusion of gluten from the diet, some, but not all, of the patients with IBS also improve on a gluten-free diet. Both IBS and NCGS are common in the general population and both can coexist with each other independently without necessarily sharing a common pathophysiological basis. Although the pathogenesis of NCGS is not well understood, it is likely to be heterogeneous with possible contributing factors such as low-grade intestinal inflammation, increased intestinal barrier function and changes in the intestinal microbiota. Innate immunity may also play a pivotal role. One possible inducer of innate immune response has recently been reported to be amylase-trypsin inhibitor, a protein present in wheat endosperm and the source of flour, along with the gluten proteins.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a condition characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, flatus, and altered bowel habits. The role of dietary components in inducing IBS symptoms is difficult to explore. To date, foods are not considered a cause but rather symptom-triggering factors. Particular interest has been given to the so-called FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols). We aimed to summarize the evidence from the most common approaches to manage suspected food intolerance in IBS, with a particular interest in the role of FODMAPs and the effects of a low FODMAP diet. We reviewed literature, consulting PubMed and Medline by using the search terms FODMAP(s), fructose, lactose, fructans, galactans, polyols (sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, xylitol, erythritol, polydextrose, and isomalt), irritable bowel syndrome, and functional gastrointestinal symptoms. FODMAP-restricted diets have been used for a long time to manage patients with IBS. The innovation in the so-called FODMAP concept is that a global restriction should have a more consistent effect than a limited one in preventing abdominal distension. Even though all the potential low FODMAP diets provide good relief of symptoms in many patients, there is just a little relief in others. Several studies highlight the role of low FODMAP diets to improve symptoms in patients with IBS. The evidence on this dietary approach supports the hypothesis that a low FODMAP diet should be the first dietary approach. However, many points remain to be clarified, including the evaluation of possibly significant nutrition concerns.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, distension, constipation, diarrhea and flatulence have been noted in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The diversity of symptoms has meant that finding an effective treatment has been challenging with most treatments alleviating only the primary symptom. A novel treatment option for IBS and IBD currently generating much excitement is the low fermentable, oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyol (FODMAP) diet. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the evidence of the efficacy of such a diet in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched through to March 2015 to identify relevant studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for the effect of a low FODMAP diet on the reduction in IBS [Symptoms Severity Score (SSS)] score and increase in IBS quality of life (QOL) score for both randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and non-randomized interventions using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Six RCTs and 16 non-randomized interventions were included in the analysis. There was a significant decrease in IBS SSS scores for those individuals on a low FODMAP diet in both the RCTs (OR 0.44, 95 % CI 0.25-0.76; I (2) = 35.52, p = 0.00) and non-randomized interventions (OR 0.03, 95 % CI 0.01-0.2; I (2) = 69.1, p = 0.02). In addition, there was a significant improvement in the IBS-QOL score for RCTs (OR 1.84, 95 % CI 1.12-3.03; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.39) and for non-randomized interventions (OR 3.18, 95 % CI 1.60-6.31; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.89). Further, following a low FODMAP diet was found to significantly reduce symptom severity for abdominal pain (OR 1.81, 95 % CI 1.13-2.88; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.56), bloating (OR 1.75, 95 % CI 1.07-2.87; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.45) and overall symptoms (OR 1.81, 95 % CI 1.11-2.95; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.4) in the RCTs. In the non-randomized interventions similar findings were observed. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis supports the efficacy of a low FODMAP diet in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Further research should ensure studies include dietary adherence, and more studies looking at greater number of patients and long-term adherence to a low FODMAP diet need to be conducted.},

   abstract = {Probiotics and prebiotics, mainly commercialised as food ingredients and also as supplements, are considered highly profitable niche markets. However, in recent years, the food industry has suffered from a series of health claim restrictions on probiotics and prebiotics in many parts of the world, including those made by the European Food Safety Authority. Therefore, we reviewed the core benefits of probiotic and prebiotic consumption on health. A number of studies have examined the prevention and/or management of intestinal infections, respiratory tract infections, CVD, osteoporosis, urogenital infections, cavities, periodontal disease and halitosis, allergic reactions, inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori gastric infections. In fact, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in human microbiota and immune system modulation by probiotics and prebiotics relies on continuous efforts to establish suitable biomarkers of health and diseases risk factors for the design of clinical trials required for health claim approval. In spite of the promising results, the performance of large, long-term, well-planned, well-aligned clinical studies is crucial to provide more reliability and a more solid basis for the outcomes achieved and to support the potential use of probiotics and prebiotics in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that are widespread in nature, and consumed as part of the human diet in significant amounts. The aim of the present study was to test the intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of apigenin K, a soluble form of apigenin, in two models of rat colitis, namely the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) model and the dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) model. Apigenin K (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg; by the oral route; n 4-6 per group) was administered as a pre-treatment to rats with TNBS and DSS colitis, and colonic status was checked by macroscopic and biochemical examination. Apigenin K pre-treatment resulted in the amelioration of morphological signs and biochemical markers in the TNBS model. The results demonstrated a reduction in the inflamed area, as well as lower values of score and colonic weight:length ratio compared with the TNBS group. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was reduced by 30 % (P< 0.05). Moreover, apigenin K pre-treatment ameliorated morphological signs and biochemical markers in the DSS model. Thus, macroscopic damage was significantly reduced and the colonic weight:length ratio was lowered by approximately 10 %, while colonic MPO and alkaline phosphatase activities were decreased by 35 and 21 %, respectively (P< 0.05). Apigenin K pre-treatment also tended to normalise the expression of a number of colonic inflammatory markers (e.g. TNF-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta, IL-6, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 or chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2). In conclusion, apigenin K is found to have anti-inflammatory effects in two preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease.},

Physical activity is advocated for patients with FGIDs, although the evidence is insufficient. We investigated the association between the intensity of regular exercise and gastric emptying to determine the effect of physical activity on dyspeptic symptoms. Thirty healthy individuals were selected and divided into three groups (low, moderate, and high) using the index of total exercise intensity in a week. Gastric emptying was evaluated by the 13C-acetate breath test. Gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, dyspeptic symptoms, stool forms, scores of anxiety and depression, and scores of sleep quality were also compared. Baseline scores of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, anxiety, depression, and sleep quality were not different among the three groups. Gastric emptying was significantly faster in low-intensity exercise group than the moderate-intensity exercise group. Although the presence of loose stool and alcohol consumption were also associated with the intensity of regular exercise, these variables were not confounders. In conclusion, the intensity of regular exercise was independently associated with gastric emptying in healthy individuals. These baseline data would be useful for consideration of an optimal exercise intervention for the treatment of FD.},

   abstract = {The emergence of multiparental mapping populations enabled plant geneticists to gain deeper insights into the genetic architecture of major agronomic traits and to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling the expression of these traits. Although the investigated mapping populations are similar, one open question is whether genotype data should be modelled as identical by state (IBS) or identical by descent (IBD). Whereas IBS simply makes use of raw genotype scores to distinguish alleles, IBD data are derived from parental offspring information. We report on comparing IBS and IBD by applying two multiple regression models on four traits studied in the barley nested association mapping (NAM) population HEB-25. We observed that modelling parent-specific IBD genotypes produced a lower number of significant QTLs with increased prediction abilities compared with modelling IBS genotypes. However, at lower trait heritabilities the IBS model produced higher prediction abilities. We developed a method to estimate multiallelic QTL effects in multiparental populations from simple biallelic IBS data. This method is based on cumulating IBS-derived single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effect estimates in a defined genetic region surrounding a QTL. Comparing the resulting parent-specific QTL effects with those obtained from IBD approaches revealed high accordance that could be confirmed through simulations. The method turned out to be also applicable to a barley multiparent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) population. The 'cumulation method' represents a universal approach to differentiate parent-specific QTL effects in multiparental populations, even if no IBD information is available. In future, the method could further benefit from the availability of much denser SNP maps.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To determine the large intestinal endocrine cell types affected following dietary guidance in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study included 13 IBS patients and 13 control subjects. The patients received three sessions of individualized dietary guidance. Both the control subjects and the patients were scheduled for colonoscopies at baseline and again for the patients at 3-9 months after dietary guidance. Biopsy samples were taken from the colon and rectum and were immunostained for all types of large intestinal endocrine cells. The endocrine cells were quantified using computerized image analysis. RESULTS: The daily total consumption (mean+/-s.e.m. values) of fruits and vegetables rich in FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) decreased significantly from 16.2+/-5.3 g before receiving dietary guidance to 9.2+/-3.2 g after receiving dietary guidance (P=0.02). In the total colon, the densities of serotonin cells were 46.8+/-8.9, 10.5+/-2.1 and 22.6+/-3.2 cells/mm(2) in control subjects and in IBS patients before and after receiving dietary guidance, respectively (P=0.007); the corresponding densities of peptide YY cells were 11.6+/-1.8, 10.8+/-1.7 and 16.8+/-2.1 cells/mm(2), respectively (P=0.06). The cell densities for both serotonin and peptide YY did not change significantly in the rectum. The densities of somatostatin cells in the rectum were 13.5+/-3.0, 13.2+/-3.0, and 22.3+/-3.2 cells/mm(2) for control subjects and for IBS patients before and after receiving dietary guidance, respectively (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The densities of the large intestinal endocrine cells tend to normalize following dietary guidance that may have contributed to the improvement of the patients with IBS symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The first British Dietetic Association (BDA) guidelines for the dietary management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults were published in 2012. Subsequently, there has been a wealth of new research. The aim of this work was to systematically review the evidence for the role of diet in the management of IBS and to update the guidelines. METHODS: Twelve questions relating to diet and IBS were defined based on review of the previous guideline questions, current evidence and clinical practice. Chosen topics were on healthy eating and lifestyle (alcohol, caffeine, spicy food, elimination diets, fat and fluid intakes and dietary habits), milk and dairy, dietary fibre, fermentable carbohydrates, gluten, probiotics and elimination diets/food hypersensitivity. Data sources were CINAHL, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science up to October 2015. Studies were assessed independently in duplicate using risk of bias tools specific to each included study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria for each question. National Health and Medical Research Council grading evidence levels were used to develop evidence statements and recommendations, in accordance with Practice-based Evidence in Nutrition Global protocol used by the BDA. RESULTS: Eighty-six studies were critically appraised to generate 46 evidence statements, 15 clinical recommendations and four research recommendations. The IBS dietary algorithm was simplified to first-line (healthy eating, provided by any healthcare professional) and second-line [low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) to be provided by dietitian] dietary advice. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide updated comprehensive evidence-based details to achieve the successful dietary management of IBS in adults.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Probiotics are often taken by individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Which products are effective is unclear, despite an increasing research base. This project will systematically review which strain- and dose- specific probiotics can be recommended to adults with IBS to improve symptoms and quality of life (QoL). It is part of a broader systematic review to update British Dietetic Association guidelines for the dietary management of IBS in adults. METHODS: CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for systematic reviews (SRs) of randomised controlled trial (RCT)s recruiting adults with IBS comparing probiotic intervention with placebo. AMSTAR, risk of bias and diet bias tools were used to appraise methodological quality. Symptom and QoL data were appraised to develop probiotic-specific evidence statements on clinically meaningful and marginal outcomes in various settings, graded clinical practice recommendations and practical considerations. RESULTS: Nine systematic reviews and 35 RCTs were included (3406 participants) using 29 dose-specific probiotic formulations. None of the RCTs were at low risk of bias. Twelve out of 29 probiotics (41%) showed no symptom or QoL benefits. Evidence indicated that no strain or dose specific probiotic was consistently effective to improve any IBS symptoms or QoL. Two general clinical practice recommendations were made. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom outcomes for dose-specific probiotics were heterogeneous. Specific probiotic recommendations for IBS management in adults were not possible at this time. More data from high-quality RCTs treating specific symptom profiles are needed to support probiotic therapy in the management of IBS.},

   abstract = {Functional bowel disorders are highly prevalent disorders found worldwide. These disorders have the potential to affect all members of society, regardless of age, gender, race, creed, color or socioeconomic status. Improving our understanding of functional bowel disorders (FBD) is critical as they impose a negative economic impact to the global health care system in addition to reducing quality of life. Research in the basic and clinical sciences during the past decade has produced new information on the epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of FBDs. These important findings created a need to revise the Rome III criteria for FBDs, last published in 2006. This manuscript classifies the FBDs into five distinct categories: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); functional constipation (FC); functional diarrhea (FDr); functional abdominal bloating/distention (FAB/D); and unspecified FBD (U-FBD). Also included in this article is a new sixth category, opioid induced constipation (OIC) which is distinct from the functional bowel disorders (FBDs). Each disorder will first be defined, followed by sections on epidemiology, rationale for changes from prior criteria, clinical evaluation, physiologic features, psychosocial features and treatment. It is the hope of this committee that this new information will assist both clinicians and researchers in the decade to come.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reproductive events are associated with important physiologic changes, yet little is known about how reproductive factors influence long-term health in women. Our objective was to assess the relation of reproductive characteristics with all-cause and cause-specific mortality risk. METHODS: The analysis was performed within the European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition prospective cohort study, which enrolled >500,000 women and men from 1992 to 2000, who were residing in a given town/geographic area in 10 European countries. The current analysis included 322,972 eligible women aged 25-70 years with 99 % complete follow-up for vital status. We assessed reproductive characteristics reported at the study baseline including parity, age at the first birth, breastfeeding, infertility, oral contraceptive use, age at menarche and menopause, total ovulatory years, and history of oophorectomy/hysterectomy. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for menopausal status, body mass index, physical activity, education level, and smoking status/intensity and duration. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 12.9 years, 14,383 deaths occurred. The HR (95 % CI) for risk of all-cause mortality was lower in parous versus nulliparous women (0.80; 0.76-0.84), in women who had ever versus never breastfed (0.92; 0.87-0.97), in ever versus never users of oral contraceptives (among non-smokers; 0.90; 0.86-0.95), and in women reporting a later age at menarche (>/=15 years versus <12; 0.90; 0.85-0.96; P for trend = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Childbirth, breastfeeding, oral contraceptive use, and a later age at menarche were associated with better health outcomes. These findings may contribute to the development of improved strategies to promote better long-term health in women.},

   abstract = {Data on the role of dietary factors in endometrial cancer development are limited and inconsistent. We applied a "nutrient-wide association study" approach to systematically evaluate dietary risk associations for endometrial cancer while controlling for multiple hypothesis tests using the false discovery rate (FDR) and validating the results in an independent cohort. We evaluated endometrial cancer risk associations for dietary intake of 84 foods and nutrients based on dietary questionnaires in three prospective studies, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC; N = 1,303 cases) followed by validation of nine foods/nutrients (FDR </= 0.10) in the Nurses' Health Studies (NHS/NHSII; N = 1,531 cases). Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI). In multivariate adjusted comparisons of the extreme categories of intake at baseline, coffee was inversely associated with endometrial cancer risk (EPIC, median intake 750 g/day vs. 8.6; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.97, Ptrend = 0.09; NHS/NHSII, median intake 1067 g/day vs. none; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.96, Ptrend = 0.04). Eight other dietary factors that were associated with endometrial cancer risk in the EPIC study (total fat, monounsaturated fat, carbohydrates, phosphorus, butter, yogurt, cheese, and potatoes) were not confirmed in the NHS/NHSII. Our findings suggest that coffee intake may be inversely associated with endometrial cancer risk. Further data are needed to confirm these findings and to examine the mechanisms linking coffee intake to endometrial cancer risk to develop improved prevention strategies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies of the role of dietary factors in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) development have been limited, and no specific dietary factors have been consistently associated with EOC risk. OBJECTIVE: We used a nutrient-wide association study approach to systematically test the association between dietary factors and invasive EOC risk while accounting for multiple hypothesis testing by using the false discovery rate and evaluated the findings in an independent cohort. DESIGN: We assessed dietary intake amounts of 28 foods/food groups and 29 nutrients estimated by using dietary questionnaires in the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study (n = 1095 cases). We selected 4 foods/nutrients that were statistically significantly associated with EOC risk when comparing the extreme quartiles of intake in the EPIC study (false discovery rate = 0.43) and evaluated these factors in the NLCS (Netherlands Cohort Study; n = 383 cases). Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs. RESULTS: None of the 4 dietary factors that were associated with EOC risk in the EPIC study (cholesterol, polyunsaturated and saturated fat, and bananas) were statistically significantly associated with EOC risk in the NLCS; however, in meta-analysis of the EPIC study and the NLCS, we observed a higher risk of EOC with a high than with a low intake of saturated fat (quartile 4 compared with quartile 1; overall HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.41). CONCLUSION: In the meta-analysis of both studies, there was a higher risk of EOC with a high than with a low intake of saturated fat.},

In this study, a decrease of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii presence has been observed in an IBS-like rodent model induced by a neonatal maternal separation (NMS) stress. Moreover, it was investigated whether F. prausnitzii may have an impact on colonic sensitivity. The A2-165 reference strain, but not its supernatant, significantly decreased colonic hypersensitivity induced by either NMS in mice or partial restraint stress in rats. This effect was associated with a reinforcement of intestinal epithelial barrier. Thus, F. prausnitzii exhibits anti-nociceptive properties, indicating its potential to treat abdominal pain in IBS patients.},

   abstract = {Diet is considered an important triggering factor for gastrointestinal symptoms whose physiopathology includes not only measurable, inflammatory reactions, but also functional disorders, where no organic effects may be measured or demonstrated. Moreover, the prevalence of the perceived intolerance to certain foods ranges from 20-25% (within the general population) to 50-70% in diseases like irritable bowel syndrome. This intolerance has been observed particularly after the consumption of milk and dairy products, which are frequently considered as causative of gastrointestinal symptoms, thus limiting their ingestion. However, this behavior reduces the dietary sources of calcium and consequently may lead to malnutrition and bone decalcification, amongst other complications. The true dairy intolerance (intestinal lactase deficiency) explains most of the symptoms ensuing their consumption, but the frequency of such alteration on the different gastrointestinal diseases has not been determined. This review focuses on the most frequent gastrointestinal diseases and the existing evidence regarding the alterations and symptoms related to the consumption of milk or dairy products.},

   abstract = {Despite the potential cancer preventive effects of flavonoids and lignans, their ability to reduce pancreatic cancer risk has not been demonstrated in epidemiological studies. Our aim was to examine the association between dietary intakes of flavonoids and lignans and pancreatic cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. A total of 865 exocrine pancreatic cancer cases occurred after 11.3 years of follow-up of 477,309 cohort members. Dietary flavonoid and lignan intake was estimated through validated dietary questionnaires and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Phenol Explorer databases. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using age, sex and center-stratified Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for energy intake, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol and diabetes status. Our results showed that neither overall dietary intake of flavonoids nor of lignans were associated with pancreatic cancer risk (multivariable-adjusted HR for a doubling of intake = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.95-1.11 and 1.02; 95% CI: 0.89-1.17, respectively). Statistically significant associations were also not observed by flavonoid subclasses. An inverse association between intake of flavanones and pancreatic cancer risk was apparent, without reaching statistical significance, in microscopically confirmed cases (HR for a doubling of intake = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.00). In conclusion, we did not observe an association between intake of flavonoids, flavonoid subclasses or lignans and pancreatic cancer risk in the EPIC cohort.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Much of the current literature on diet-colorectal cancer (CRC) associations focused on studies of single foods/nutrients, whereas less is known about nutrient patterns. We investigated the association between major nutrient patterns and CRC risk in participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. METHODS: Among 477 312 participants, intakes of 23 nutrients were estimated from validated dietary questionnaires. Using results from a previous principal component (PC) analysis, four major nutrient patterns were identified. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for the association of each of the four patterns and CRC incidence using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for established CRC risk factors. RESULTS: During an average of 11 years of follow-up, 4517 incident cases of CRC were documented. A nutrient pattern characterised by high intakes of vitamins and minerals was inversely associated with CRC (HR per 1 s.d.=0.94, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98) as was a pattern characterised by total protein, riboflavin, phosphorus and calcium (HR (1 s.d.)=0.96, 95% CI: 0.93-0.99). The remaining two patterns were not significantly associated with CRC risk. CONCLUSIONS: Analysing nutrient patterns may improve our understanding of how groups of nutrients relate to CRC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bile acid diarrhoea results from imbalances in the homoeostasis of bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation. It can be a consequence of ileal disease/dysfunction, associated with other GI pathology or can be idiopathic. AIMS: To summarise the different types of bile acid diarrhoea and discuss the currently available diagnostic methods and treatments. RESULTS: Bile acid diarrhoea is found in up to 40% of patients diagnosed as having functional diarrhoea/IBS-D, and in up to 80% of patients who have undergone ileal resection. It is likely under-diagnosed and under-treated. In idiopathic disease, errors in regulation feedback of fibroblast growth factor 19 contribute to the development of the condition. Clinical therapeutic trials for bile acid diarrhoea have been used to diagnose it, but the 75 SeHCAT test is the primary current method. It is sensitive, specific and widely available, though not in the USA. Other diagnostic methods (such as serum measurement of the bile acid intermediate 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, or C4) have less widespread availability and documentation, and some (such as faecal measurement of bile acids) are significantly more complex and costly. First-line treatment of bile acid diarrhoea is with the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine, which can be difficult to administer and dose due to gastrointestinal side effects. These side effects are less prominent in newer agents such as colesevelam, which may provide higher efficacy, tolerability and compliance. CONCLUSION: Bile acid diarrhoea is common, and likely under-diagnosed. Bile acid diarrhoea should be considered relatively early in the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhoea.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Smoking is known to be a major cause of death among middle-aged adults, but evidence on its impact and the benefits of smoking cessation among older adults has remained limited. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the influence of smoking and smoking cessation on all-cause mortality in people aged >/=60 years. METHODS: Relative mortality and mortality rate advancement periods (RAPs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models for the population-based prospective cohort studies from Europe and the U.S. (CHANCES [Consortium on Health and Ageing: Network of Cohorts in Europe and the U.S.]), and subsequently pooled by individual participant meta-analysis. Statistical analyses were performed from June 2013 to March 2014. RESULTS: A total of 489,056 participants aged >/=60 years at baseline from 22 population-based cohort studies were included. Overall, 99,298 deaths were recorded. Current smokers had 2-fold and former smokers had 1.3-fold increased mortality compared with never smokers. These increases in mortality translated to RAPs of 6.4 (95% CI=4.8, 7.9) and 2.4 (95% CI=1.5, 3.4) years, respectively. A clear positive dose-response relationship was observed between number of currently smoked cigarettes and mortality. For former smokers, excess mortality and RAPs decreased with time since cessation, with RAPs of 3.9 (95% CI=3.0, 4.7), 2.7 (95% CI=1.8, 3.6), and 0.7 (95% CI=0.2, 1.1) for those who had quit <10, 10 to 19, and >/=20 years ago, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking remains as a strong risk factor for premature mortality in older individuals and cessation remains beneficial even at advanced ages. Efforts to support smoking abstinence at all ages should be a public health priority.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Consensus on standard methods to assess chronic abdominal pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is currently lacking. AIM: To systematically review the literature with respect to instruments of measurement of chronic abdominal pain in IBS patients. METHODS: Systematic literature search was performed in PubMed/Medline databases for studies using pain measurement instruments in patients with IBS. RESULTS: One hundred and ten publications were reviewed. A multitude of different instruments is currently used to assess chronic abdominal pain in IBS patients. The single-item methods, e.g. the validated 10-point numeric rating scale (NRS), and questionnaires assessing gastrointestinal symptoms severity, focus mostly on the assessment of only the intensity of abdominal pain. Of these questionnaires, the validated IBS-Symptom Severity Scale includes the broadest measurement of pain-related aspects. General pain questionnaires and electronic momentary symptom assessment tools have been used to study abdominal pain in IBS patients, but have not yet been validated for this purpose. The evidence for the use of provocation tests, e.g. the rectal barostat with balloon distention, for measurement of abdominal pain in IBS is weak, due to the poor correlation between visceral pain thresholds assessed by provocation tests and abdominal pain as assessed by retrospective questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: The multitude of different instruments to measure chronic abdominal pain in IBS makes it difficult to compare endpoints of published studies. There is need for validated instruments to assess chronic abdominal pain in IBS patients, that overcome the limitations of the currently available methods.},

   abstract = {Biological markers that measure gut health and diagnose functional gastro-intestinal (GI) disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are lacking. The objective was to identify and validate a biomarker panel associated with the pathophysiology of IBS that discriminates IBS from healthy controls (HC), and correlates with GI symptom severity. In a case-control design, various plasma and fecal markers were measured in a cohort of 196 clinical IBS patients and 160 HC without GI symptoms. A combination of biomarkers, which best discriminates between IBS and HC was identified and validated in an independent internal validation set and by permutation testing. The correlation between the biomarker panel and GI symptom severity was tested in IBS patients and in a general population cohort of 958 subjects. A set of 8 biomarker panel was identified to discriminate IBS from HC with high sensitivity (88.1%) and specificity (86.5%). The results for the IBS subtypes were comparable. Moreover, a moderate correlation was found between the biomarker panel and GI symptom scores in the IBS (r = 0.59, p < 0.001) and the general population cohorts (r = 0.51, p = 0.003). A novel multi-domain biomarker panel has been identified and validated, which correlated moderately to GI symptom severity in IBS and general population subjects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poorly absorbed fermentable carbohydrates can provoke irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms by escaping absorption in the small bowel and being rapidly fermented in the colon in some susceptible subjects. IBS patients often are anxious and stressed, and stress accelerates small bowel transit, which may exacerbate malabsorption. OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the effect of an intravenous injection of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) on fructose malabsorption and the resulting volume of water in the small bowel. DESIGN: We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of CRF compared with saline injection in 11 male and 10 female healthy subjects, examining the effect on the malabsorption of a 40-g fructose test meal and its transit through the gut, which was assessed by serial MRI and breath hydrogen measurement. Orocecal transit was assessed with the use of the lactose [(13)C]ureide breath test and the adrenal response to CRF was assessed by serial salivary cortisol measurements. RESULTS: CRF injection caused a significant increase in salivary cortisol, which lasted for 135 min. Small bowel water content (SBWC) rose from baseline, peaking at 45 min after fructose ingestion, whereas breath hydrogen peaked later, at 75 min. The area under the curve for SBWC from -15 min to 135 min was significantly lower after CRF compared with saline [mean difference: 5911 mL . min (95% CI: 18.4, 11,803 mL . min), P = 0.049]. Considering all subjects, the percentage change in ascending colon volume rose significantly after CRF. This increase was significant for male (P = 0.026), but not female, volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: CRF constricts the small bowel and increases fructose malabsorption, as shown by increased ascending colon volumes. This mechanism may help to explain the increased sensitivity of some stressed individuals to fructose malabsorption. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01763281.},

   abstract = {This review summarizes the published clinical studies concerning the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) using restriction of Fermentable Oligosaccharide, Disaccharide, Monosaccharide, and Polyols in the diet (low FODMAP diet). In recent years, the data supporting low FODMAP diet for the management of IBS symptoms have emerged, including several randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, and other observational studies. Unlike most dietary manipulations tried in the past to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms of IBS, all studies on low FODMAP diet have consistently shown symptomatic benefits in the majority of patients with IBS. However, dietary adherence by the patients and clear dietary intervention led by specialized dietitians appear to be vital for the success of the diet. Up to 86% of patients with IBS find improvement in overall gastrointestinal symptoms as well as individual symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal distention, and flatulence following the diet. FODMAP restriction reduces the osmotic load and gas production in the distal small bowel and the proximal colon, providing symptomatic relief in patients with IBS. Long-term health effects of a low FODMAP diet are not known; however, stringent FODMAP restriction is not recommended owing to risks of inadequate nutrient intake and potential adverse effects from altered gut microbiota. In conclusion, the evidence to date strongly supports the efficacy of a low FODMAP diet in the treatment of IBS. Further studies are required to understand any potential adverse effects of long-term restriction of FODMAPs.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) belongs to functional gastrointestinal disorders and is characterized by abdominal pain and change in stool consistency and/or bowel habits. Etiological factors include gastrointestinal peristalsis disturbances, visceral hypersensitivity, chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane, dysbacteremia, intestinal infections, psychosomatic and nutritional factors. Gastrointestinal motility disturbances in case of IBS are manifested by the inhibition of the intestinal passage, which favors the development of constipation or occurrence of diarrhea. The aim of the study was to evaluate IBS symptoms and demonstrate the relationship between physical activity and place of residence amongst Warsaw University students. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted in march, 2014 using a specific questionnaire, amongst Warsaw University students. The study group comprised 120 female patients, aged between 19 and 27 years (M=23.43; SD=1.29). The chi-square test was used for analysis, p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: The BMI of investigated patients ranged between 16.30-31.22 kg/m2 (M=21.27; SD=2.71). The majority of respondents (76.6%) weighed within the normal limits. Abdominal pain or discomfort occurred more frequently in the group of students who considered their physical activity as low. In case of respondents with a low physical activity bowel movement disorders and stool continence changes occurred more often, as compared to those with moderate physical activity. The most common symptom was rectal tenesmus, the least common-presence of mucous in the stool. Analysis showed that students with low physical activity were more frequently absent from school/work, due to abdominal symptoms. The respondents with moderate activity more often considered their abdominal symptoms, being associated with stress. CONCLUSIONS: IBS symptoms are common amongst Warsaw University students. In case of respondents with low physical activity, abdominal pain or discomfort occurred more often. It has been demonstrated that diet and stress might contribute to the occurrence of abdominal symptoms, being evidence of IBS.},

   abstract = {Fetuin-A, also referred to as alpha2-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG), is a liver protein known to inhibit insulin actions. Hyperinsulinemia is a possible risk factor for colorectal cancer; however, the role of fetuin-A in the development of colorectal cancer is unclear. We investigated the association between circulating fetuin-A and colorectal cancer risk in a nested case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Fetuin-A concentrations were measured in prediagnostic plasma samples from 1,367 colorectal cancer cases and 1,367 matched controls. In conditional logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders, the estimated relative risk (95% confidence interval) of colorectal cancer per 40 microg/mL higher fetuin-A concentrations (approximately one standard deviation) was 1.13 (1.02-1.24) overall, 1.21 (1.05-1.39) in men, 1.06 (0.93-1.22) in women, 1.13 (1.00-1.27) for colon cancer and 1.12 (0.94-1.32) for rectal cancer. To improve causal inference in a Mendelian Randomization approach, five tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms of the AHSG gene were genotyped in a subset of 456 case-control pairs. The AHSG allele-score explained 21% of the interindividual variation in plasma fetuin-A concentrations. In instrumental variable analysis, genetically raised fetuin-A was not associated with colorectal cancer risk (relative risk per 40 microg/mL genetically determined higher fetuin-A was 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.73-1.33). The findings of our study indicate a modest linear association between fetuin-A concentrations and risk of colorectal cancer but suggest that fetuin-A may not be causally related to colorectal cancer development.},

To assess the effects of PHGG on clinical symptoms of IBS patients in a prospective randomized double blind placebo-controlled study. METHODS: Suitable IBS patients were recruited into an 18-week-long study (2 weeks of run-in, 12 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks of follow-up). They were blindly randomized to receive 6 gr of PHGG or placebo. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by the Francis Severity IBS score, the IBS quality-of-life scores and scored parameters of weekly journal of symptoms. Deltas of changes between the final and baseline scores were compared between two groups. RESULTS: Of 121 patients who underwent randomization, 108 patients (49 in the PHGG group and 59 in the placebo group) had all the data needed for intention-to-treat analysis. A 12-week administration of PHGG led to a significant improvement of journal bloating score in the PHGG group versus placebo (-4.1+/-13.4 versus -1.2+/-11.9, P=0.03), as well as in bloating+gasses score (-4.3+/-10.4 versus -1.12+/-10.5, P = 0.035). The effect lasted for at least 4 weeks after the last PHGG administration. PHGG had no effect on other journal reported IBS symptoms or on Severity and Quality of life scores. There were no significant side effects associated with PHGG ingestion. The rate of dropouts was significantly higher among patients in the placebo group compared with the PHGG group (49.15% versus 22.45%, respectively, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the administration of 6 g/day PHGG for IBS patients with bloating. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01779765.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) is a common disorder and accounts for a large number of ambulatory visits. Sensory abnormalities, that is, presence of abdominal pain and discomfort, distinguish IBS-C from chronic idiopathic constipation. AREA COVERED: This review focuses on the pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and future of prucalopride, YKP-10811, DSP-6952, dexloxiglumide, linaclotide, plecanatide, tenapanor, and elobixibat. EXPERT OPINION: It is now well established that treatment focusing only on bowel transit provides incomplete relief to patients with IBS-C. Improved understanding of pathophysiology of IBS-C has led to use of sensory end points like complete spontaneous bowel movements and the FDA combined end point (abdominal pain and complete spontaneous bowel movements) in clinical trials. A number of drugs are in development and provide hope for this challenging group of patients. However, because of recent failures secondary to ineffectiveness and/or adverse events, we cautiously await how clinical data play out in larger studies and in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Acrylamide, classified in 1994 by IARC as "probably carcinogenic to humans," was discovered in 2002 in some heat-treated, carbohydrate-rich foods. Four prospective studies have evaluated the association between dietary acrylamide intake and endometrial cancer (EC) risk with inconsistent results. The purpose of this nested case-control study, based on the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, was to evaluate, for the first time, the association between hemoglobin adducts of acrylamide (HbAA) and glycidamide (HbGA) and the risk of developing EC in non-smoking postmenopausal women. Hemoglobin adducts were measured in red blood cells by HPLC/MS/MS. Four exposure variables were evaluated: HbAA, HbGA, their sum (HbAA+HbGA), and their ratio (HbGA/HbAA). The association between hemoglobin adducts and EC was evaluated using unconditional multivariable logistic regression models, and included 383 EC cases (171 were type-I EC), and 385 controls. Exposure variables were analyzed in quintiles based on control distributions. None of the biomarker variables had an effect on overall EC (HRHbAA;Q5vsQ1 : 0.84, 95%CI: 0.49-1.48; HRHbGA;Q5vsQ1 : 0.94, 95%CI: 0.54-1.63) or type-I EC risk. Additionally, none of the subgroups investigated (BMI < 25 vs. >/=25 kg m(-2) , alcohol drinkers vs. never drinkers, oral contraceptive users vs. non-users) demonstrated effect measure modification. Hemoglobin adducts of acrylamide or glycidamide were not associated with EC or type-I EC risk in 768 nonsmoking postmenopausal women from the EPIC cohort.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Acrylamide was classified as 'probably carcinogenic' to humans in 1994 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. In 2002, public health concern increased when acrylamide was identified in starchy, plant-based foods, processed at high temperatures. The purpose of this study was to identify which food groups and lifestyle variables were determinants of hemoglobin adduct concentrations of acrylamide (HbAA) and glycidamide (HbGA) in 801 non-smoking postmenopausal women from eight countries in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. METHODS: Biomarkers of internal exposure were measured in red blood cells (collected at baseline) by high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS) . In this cross-sectional analysis, four dependent variables were evaluated: HbAA, HbGA, sum of total adducts (HbAA + HbGA), and their ratio (HbGA/HbAA). Simple and multiple regression analyses were used to identify determinants of the four outcome variables. All dependent variables (except HbGA/HbAA) and all independent variables were log-transformed (log2) to improve normality. Median (25th-75th percentile) HbAA and HbGA adduct levels were 41.3 (32.8-53.1) pmol/g Hb and 34.2 (25.4-46.9) pmol/g Hb, respectively. RESULTS: The main food group determinants of HbAA, HbGA, and HbAA + HbGA were biscuits, crackers, and dry cakes. Alcohol intake and body mass index were identified as the principal determinants of HbGA/HbAA. The total percent variation in HbAA, HbGA, HbAA + HbGA, and HbGA/HbAA explained in this study was 30, 26, 29, and 13 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary and lifestyle factors explain a moderate proportion of acrylamide adduct variation in non-smoking postmenopausal women from the EPIC cohort.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acrylamide was classified as "probably carcinogenic to humans (group 2A)" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fourth cause of cancer mortality in women. Five epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between EOC risk and dietary acrylamide intake assessed using food frequency questionnaires, and one nested case-control study evaluated hemoglobin adducts of acrylamide (HbAA) and its metabolite glycidamide (HbGA) and EOC risk; the results of these studies were inconsistent. METHODS: A nested case-control study in nonsmoking postmenopausal women (334 cases, 417 controls) was conducted within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between HbAA, HbGA, HbAA+HbGA, and HbGA/HbAA and EOC and invasive serous EOC risk. RESULTS: No overall associations were observed between biomarkers of acrylamide exposure analyzed in quintiles and EOC risk; however, positive associations were observed between some middle quintiles of HbGA and HbAA+HbGA. Elevated but nonstatistically significant ORs for serous EOC were observed for HbGA and HbAA+HbGA (ORQ5vsQ1, 1.91; 95% CI, 0.96-3.81 and ORQ5vsQ1, 1.90; 95% CI, 0.94-3.83, respectively); however, no linear dose-response trends were observed. CONCLUSION: This EPIC nested case-control study failed to observe a clear association between biomarkers of acrylamide exposure and the risk of EOC or invasive serous EOC. IMPACT: It is unlikely that dietary acrylamide exposure increases ovarian cancer risk; however, additional studies with larger sample size should be performed to exclude any possible association with EOC risk.},

   abstract = {Acrylamide, classified in 1994 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as "probably carcinogenic" to humans, was discovered in 2002 in some heat-treated, carbohydrate-rich foods. The association between dietary acrylamide intake and epithelial ovarian cancer risk (EOC) has been previously studied in one case-control and three prospective cohort studies which obtained inconsistent results and could not further examine histologic subtypes other than serous EOC. The present study was carried out in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) subcohort of women (n = 325,006). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between questionnaire-based acrylamide intake and EOC risk. Acrylamide was energy-adjusted using the residual method and was evaluated both as a continuous variable (per 10 mug/d) and in quintiles; when subgroups by histologic EOC subtypes were analyzed, acrylamide intake was evaluated in quartiles. During a mean follow-up of 11 years, 1,191 incident EOC cases were diagnosed. At baseline, the median acrylamide intake in EPIC was 21.3 mug/d. No associations and no evidence for a dose-response were observed between energy-adjusted acrylamide intake and EOC risk (HR10mug/d,1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.09; HRQ5vsQ1, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.76-1.23). No differences were seen when invasive EOC subtypes (582 serous, 118 endometrioid, and 79 mucinous tumors) were analyzed separately. This study did not provide evidence that acrylamide intake, based on food intake questionnaires, was associated with risk for EOC in EPIC. Additional studies with more reliable estimates of exposure based on biomarkers may be needed.},

   abstract = {The aetiology and pathology of IBS, a functional bowel disorder thought to lack an organic cause, is largely unknown. However, studies suggest that various features, such as altered composition of the gut microbiota, together with increased intestinal permeability, a changed balance in the enteroendocrine system and a dysregulated immune system in the gut, most likely have an important role in IBS. Exactly how these entities act together and give rise to symptoms is still unknown, but an altered gut microbiota composition could lead to dysregulation of the intestinal barrier as well as the enteroendocrine and the immune systems, which (through interactions with the nervous system) might generate symptoms. This Review highlights the crosstalk between the gut microbiota, the enteroendocrine system, the immune system and the role of intestinal permeability in patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {Background Inadequate maternal nutrition is regarded as one of the most important indicators of fetal growth. The aim of this study was to analyze the associated risk of having a small for gestational age (SGA) infant according to the mother's dairy intake during the first half of pregnancy. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed using 1175 healthy pregnant women selected from the catchment area of Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital, Granada (Spain). SGA was defined as neonates weighing less than the 10th percentile, adjusted for gestational age. Factors associated with SGA were analyzed using logistic regression models. Population attributable fractions of SGA according to dairy intake were estimated. Results Dairy intake among women who gave birth to SGA infants was 513.9, versus 590.3 g/day for women with appropriate size for gestational age infants (P = 0.003). An increased intake of dairy products by 100 g/day during the first half of pregnancy decreased the risk of having a SGA infant by 11.0 %, aOR = 0.89 (0.83, 0.96). A dose-response gradient between dairy intake and SGA was observed. Conclusions An inadequate intake of dairy products is associated with a higher risk of SGA. Our results suggest a possible causal relation between dairy intake during pregnancy and the weight of the newborn, although we cannot discard residual confounding. These results should be further supported by properly designed studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests an etiologic role for inflammation in ovarian carcinogenesis and heterogeneity between tumor subtypes and anthropometric indices. Prospective studies on circulating inflammatory markers and epithelial invasive ovarian cancer (EOC) have predominantly investigated overall risk; data characterizing risk by tumor characteristics (histology, grade, stage, dualistic model of ovarian carcinogenesis) and anthropometric indices are sparse. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort to evaluate C-reactive protein (CRP), IL6, and EOC risk by tumor characteristics. A total of 754 eligible EOC cases were identified; two controls (n = 1,497) were matched per case. We used multivariable conditional logistic regression to assess associations. RESULTS: CRP and IL6 were not associated with overall EOC risk. However, consistent with prior research, CRP >10 versus CRP </=1 mg/L was associated with higher overall EOC risk [OR, 1.67 (1.03-2.70)]. We did not observe significant associations or heterogeneity in analyses by tumor characteristics. In analyses stratified by waist circumference, inflammatory markers were associated with higher risk among women with higher waist circumference; no association was observed for women with normal waist circumference [e.g., IL6: waist </=80: ORlog2, 0.97 (0.81-1.16); waist >88: ORlog2, 1.78 (1.28-2.48), Pheterogeneity </= 0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that high CRP is associated with increased risk of overall EOC, and that IL6 and CRP may be associated with EOC risk among women with higher adiposity. IMPACT: Our data add to global evidence that ovarian carcinogenesis may be promoted by an inflammatory milieu.},

   abstract = {Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels initiate action potentials in most neurons, including primary afferent nerve fibres of the pain pathway. Local anaesthetics block pain through non-specific actions at all Nav channels, but the discovery of selective modulators would facilitate the analysis of individual subtypes of these channels and their contributions to chemical, mechanical, or thermal pain. Here we identify and characterize spider (Heteroscodra maculata) toxins that selectively activate the Nav1.1 subtype, the role of which in nociception and pain has not been elucidated. We use these probes to show that Nav1.1-expressing fibres are modality-specific nociceptors: their activation elicits robust pain behaviours without neurogenic inflammation and produces profound hypersensitivity to mechanical, but not thermal, stimuli. In the gut, high-threshold mechanosensitive fibres also express Nav1.1 and show enhanced toxin sensitivity in a mouse model of irritable bowel syndrome. Together, these findings establish an unexpected role for Nav1.1 channels in regulating the excitability of sensory nerve fibres that mediate mechanical pain.},

   abstract = {The probiotic definition requires the administration of an 'adequate amount' in order to obtain a health benefit. What that amount should be is not indicated. Here, an overview is given of studies that investigated the dose-response relation of probiotics in human interventions. Studies were divided in; meta-analyses, meta-analyses on specific probiotic strains, and studies testing two or more doses of a probiotic (combination) in the same study. Meta-analyses on the effect of probiotics on antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD) suggest a dose-response effect; for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea on the other hand no dose-response was observed. For other end-points; such as necrotising enterocolitis, prevention of atopic dermatitis and slow intestinal transit, no dose-response relation was identified in meta-analyses. For prophylaxis in colorectal cancer and relief of irritable bowel syndrome, no dose-response relation was determined. However, for blood pressure, a meta-analysis observed that higher doses (greater than 1011 cfu) were more effective than lower doses. Meta-analyses of specific strains suggest a break-point for effectiveness of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children; no dose-response was observed for two other probiotics assessed. Studies comparing two or more doses indicate that faecal recovery and risk reduction of AAD follow a positive dose-response relationship. Other end-points such as immune markers, general health, and bowel function did not exhibit clear dose-response relations. For AAD, the findings are very compelling; both meta-analyses and dedicated dose-response studies observe a positive correlation between dose and AAD risk. These findings do not allow for extrapolation, but suggest that studying higher doses for this end-point would be worthwhile. The lack of a clear dose-response for other end-points, does not mean it does not exist; present data does just not allow drawing any conclusions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: In fecal samples from patients with chronic constipation, the microbiota differs from that of healthy subjects. However, the profiles of fecal microbiota only partially replicate those of the mucosal microbiota. It is not clear whether these differences are caused by variations in diet or colonic transit, or are associated with methane production (measured by breath tests). We compared the colonic mucosal and fecal microbiota in patients with chronic constipation and in healthy subjects to investigate the relationships between microbiota and other parameters. METHODS: Sigmoid colonic mucosal and fecal microbiota samples were collected from 25 healthy women (controls) and 25 women with chronic constipation and evaluated by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing (average, 49,186 reads/sample). We assessed associations between microbiota (overall composition and operational taxonomic units) and demographic variables, diet, constipation status, colonic transit, and methane production (measured in breath samples after oral lactulose intake). RESULTS: Fourteen patients with chronic constipation had slow colonic transit. The profile of the colonic mucosal microbiota differed between constipated patients and controls (P < .05). The overall composition of the colonic mucosal microbiota was associated with constipation, independent of colonic transit (P < .05), and discriminated between patients with constipation and controls with 94% accuracy. Genera from Bacteroidetes were more abundant in the colonic mucosal microbiota of patients with constipation. The profile of the fecal microbiota was associated with colonic transit before adjusting for constipation, age, body mass index, and diet; genera from Firmicutes (Faecalibacterium, Lactococcus, and Roseburia) correlated with faster colonic transit. Methane production was associated with the composition of the fecal microbiota, but not with constipation or colonic transit. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for diet and colonic transit, the profile of the microbiota in the colonic mucosa could discriminate patients with constipation from healthy individuals. The profile of the fecal microbiota was associated with colonic transit and methane production (measured in breath), but not constipation.},

   abstract = {SCOPE: 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a furanic compound produced in heat-processed foods by nonenzymatic browning reactions. HMF has been demonstrated to be hepato- and nephrotoxic in animals with a link to its metabolite 5-sulfooxymethylfurfural (SMF). To date little is known about either the formation of SMF from ingested HMF or the formation of DNA adducts in animals or human beings. METHODS AND RESULTS: To assess SMF in vivo formation, we first performed a study in mice treated with high/low doses of oral HMF. We found increased concentrations of SMF in plasma and DNA SMF-adducts in leukocytes, hepatic tissue, and kidneys by means of LC-MS/MS, but no spatial formation in such tissues was observed by MALDI-MS imaging technology due to low sensitivity. In a second experiment, we measured the exposure to HMF in a Spanish preadolescent population. We analyzed the concentration of HMF metabolites (plasma, urine) and measured, for the first time, the presence of SMF in plasma and DNA SMF-adducts in leukocytes. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence that oral HMF is readily transformed into SMF in vivo, giving rise to the formation of DNA adducts in a direct relation with HMF intake, both in animals and human beings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are considered to be serious public health problems. In pediatric populations, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension associated with obesity occur with increased frequencies. Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent that has been demonstrated to be efficacious in the treatment of diabetic and non-diabetic obese adults. A considerable amount of pharmacogenetic research has demonstrated that genetic variation is one of the major factors affecting metformin response. Additionally, potential microbiota-mediated mechanisms of metformin effect have been recently described. However, scant work has been conducted in children, with no attention being paid to the potential effects of pubertal development. Thus, the main objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of metformin treatment together with lifestyle recommendations in a randomized control trial (RCT) of obese children according to pubertal stage, genetic variants and signature of gut microbiota. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, which is stratified by puberty and sex. Eighty pre-pubertal (40 boys and 40 girls) and 80 pubertal non-diabetic obese children (40 boys and 40 girls) are being recruited in four Spanish Clinical Hospitals. The inclusion criteria to participate in the RCT include a Body Mass Index (BMI) above the 95th percentile and age 7-14 years. The pubertal stage is determined based on the Tanner criteria. Participants are assigned to two groups in accordance with a randomization schedule and receive 1 g of metformin or placebo for six months in combination with healthy lifestyle recommendations in both groups. The primary outcomes include changes in the BMI Z score and the biomarkers associated with the early appearance of insulin resistance syndrome, inflammation, cardiovascular risk according of the presence of genetic determinants of metformin response, as well as possible modifications in microbiota. DISCUSSION: This study will assess the differential response of metformin treatment at six months in pre-pubertal and pubertal obese children.

In this review, we examine the medical evidence for three such compounds: chili, a culinary spice; curcumin, another spice and active derivative of a root bark; and prebiotics, which are nondigestible food products. Chili may affect the pathogenesis of abdominal pain especially in functional dyspepsia and cause other symptoms. It may have a therapeutic role in FGIDs through desensitization of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 receptor. Curcumin, the active ingredient of turmeric rhizome, has been shown in several preclinical studies and uncontrolled clinical trials as having effects on gut inflammation, gut permeability and the brain-gut axis, especially in FGIDs. Prebiotics, the non-digestible food ingredients in dietary fiber, may serve as nutrients and selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of certain colonic bacteria. The net effect of this change on colonic microbiota may lead to the production of acidic metabolites and other compounds that help to reduce the production of toxins and suppress the growth of harmful or disease-causing enteric pathogens. Although some clinical benefit in IBS has been shown, high dose intake of prebiotics may cause more bloating from bacterial fermentation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lactase is an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of lactose. Deficiency of the enzyme (hypolactasia) may be determined genetically or arise secondarily to disease of small intestine. Under this condition, lactose enters the colon where it is fermented by intestinal microflora and turns to gases and short-chain fatty acids, causing gastrointestinal symptoms known as lactose intolerance (LI). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of lactose malabsorption (LM), LI and the coexistence of these two conditions in children with upper gastrointestinal tract diseases (UGTD), malabsorption syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hydrogen breath test (HBT) was conducted in 387 pediatric patients in years 2010-2013. Two hundred thirty two children with gastrointestinal tract diseases were selected and assigned to groups - UGTD, malabsorption syndrome, IBD or FGID. For each group the frequency of LM, frequency and severity of LI and the frequency of their co-occurrence were calculated. RESULTS: Lactose malabsorption was observed in 37.08% of patients with gastrointestinal diseases. Positive HBT result was the most common in children with malabsorption syndrome (52.50%) and less common in UGTD (30.85%), especially in ulcer disease (23.53%). Symptoms after lactose ingestion affected 36.64% of the subjects, and were more specific to lactose malabsorbers than to lactose absorbers (72.10% vs. 15.75%). The higher frequency of LI was noted in children with FGID, especially in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (65.22%). The lowest incidence of symptoms was obtained in children with UGTD, especially in those with ulcer disease (27.44%). The incidence of LM with LI was noted in 27.16% of all patients and was the highest in IBS (47.83%) and the lowest in ulcer disease (15.78%). CONCLUSIONS: Lactose malabsorption is a common problem in children with gastrointestinal diseases, especially in children with bowel diseases. Lactose intolerance is related to LM, but does not affect all malabsorbers.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is uncertainty about the direction and magnitude of the associations between parity, breastfeeding and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). We examined the separate and combined associations of parity and breastfeeding practices with the incidence of CHD later in life among women in a large, pan-European cohort study. METHODS: Data were used from European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-CVD, a case-cohort study nested within the EPIC prospective study of 520,000 participants from 10 countries. Information on reproductive history was available for 14,917 women, including 5138 incident cases of CHD. Using Prentice-weighted Cox regression separately for each country followed by a random-effects meta-analysis, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CHD, after adjustment for age, study centre and several socioeconomic and biological risk factors. RESULTS: Compared with nulliparous women, the adjusted HR was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.01-1.41) among parous women; HRs were higher among women with more children (e.g., adjusted HR: 1.95 (95% CI: 1.19-3.20) for women with five or more children). Compared with women who did not breastfeed, the adjusted HR was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.52-0.98) among women who breastfed. For childbearing women who never breastfed, the adjusted HR was 1.58 (95% CI: 1.09-2.30) compared with nulliparous women, whereas for childbearing women who breastfed, the adjusted HR was 1.19 (95% CI: 0.99-1.43). CONCLUSION: Having more children was associated with a higher risk of CHD later in life, whereas breastfeeding was associated with a lower CHD risk. Women who both had children and breastfed did have a non-significantly higher risk of CHD.},

   abstract = {A variety of human disease conditions are associated with chronic intestinal disorders or enteropathies that are characterized by intestinal inflammation, increased gut permeability, and reduced capacity to absorb nutrients. Such disruptions in the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can lead to symptoms of abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating, abnormal bowel function, and malabsorption of nutrients. While significant advances have been made in understanding the factors that influence the complex and fragile balance between the gut microbiota, intestinal epithelial cell integrity, and the underlying immune system, effective therapies for restoring intestinal balance during enteropathy are still not available. Numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of oral immunoglobulins to improve weight gain, support gut barrier function, and reduce the severity of enteropathy in animals. More recently, studies in humans provide evidence that serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate is safe and improves nutritional status and GI symptoms in patients with enteropathy associated with irritable bowel syndrome or infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. This review summarizes studies showing the impact of enteropathy on nutritional status and how specially formulated bovine immunoglobulins may help restore intestinal homeostasis and nutritional status in patients with specific enteropathies. Such protein preparations may provide distinct nutritional support required for the dietary management of patients who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, have limited or impaired capacity to digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or other special medically determined nutrient requirements that cannot be satisfied by changes to the normal diet alone.},

   abstract = {Physical and psychological stress have been shown to modulate multiple aspects of gastrointestinal (GI) physiology, but its molecular basis remains elusive. We therefore characterized the stress-induced metabolic phenotype (metabotype) in soldiers during high-intensity combat training and correlated the metabotype with changes in GI symptoms and permeability. In a prospective, longitudinal study, urinary metabotyping was conducted on 38 male healthy soldiers during combat training and a rest period using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The urinary metabotype during combat training was clearly distinct from the rest period (partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) Q(2) = 0.581), confirming the presence of a unique stress-induced metabotype. Differential metabolites related to combat stress were further uncovered, including elevated pyroglutamate and fructose, and reduced gut microbial metabolites, namely, hippurate and m-hydroxyphenylacetate (p < 0.05). The extent of pyroglutamate upregulation exhibited a positive correlation with an increase in IBS-SSS in soldiers during combat training (r = 0.5, p < 0.05). Additionally, the rise in fructose levels was positively correlated with an increase in intestinal permeability (r = 0.6, p < 0.005). In summary, protracted and mixed psychological and physical combat-training stress yielded unique metabolic changes that corresponded with the incidence and severity of GI symptoms and alteration in intestinal permeability. Our study provided novel molecular insights into stress-induced GI perturbations, which could be exploited for future biomarker research or development of therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {The colon microbiota plays a crucial role in human gastrointestinal health. Current attempts to manipulate the colon microbiota composition are aimed at finding remedies for various diseases. We have recently described the immunomodulatory effects of three probiotic strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-4036, Lactobacillus paracasei CNCM I-4034, and Bifidobacterium breve CNCM I-4035). The goal of the present study was to analyze the compositions of the fecal microbiota of healthy adults who received one of these strains using high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Bacteroides was the most abundant genus in the groups that received L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036 or L. paracasei CNCM I-4034. The Shannon indices were significantly increased in these two groups. Our results also revealed a significant increase in the Lactobacillus genus after the intervention with L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036. The initially different colon microbiota became homogeneous in the subjects who received L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036. While some orders that were initially present disappeared after the administration of L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036, other orders, such as Sphingobacteriales, Nitrospirales, Desulfobacterales, Thiotrichales, and Synergistetes, were detected after the intervention. In summary, our results show that the intake of these three bacterial strains induced changes in the colon microbiota.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Observational studies show an association between ferritin and type 2 diabetes (T2D), suggesting a role of high iron stores in T2D development. However, ferritin is influenced by factors other than iron stores, which is less the case for other biomarkers of iron metabolism. We investigated associations of ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum iron, and transferrin with T2D incidence to clarify the role of iron in the pathogenesis of T2D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-InterAct study includes 12,403 incident T2D cases and a representative subcohort of 16,154 individuals from a European cohort with 3.99 million person-years of follow-up. We studied the prospective association of ferritin, TSAT, serum iron, and transferrin with incident T2D in 11,052 cases and a random subcohort of 15,182 individuals and assessed whether these associations differed by subgroups of the population. RESULTS: Higher levels of ferritin and transferrin were associated with a higher risk of T2D (hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI] in men and women, respectively: 1.07 [1.01-1.12] and 1.12 [1.05-1.19] per 100 mug/L higher ferritin level; 1.11 [1.00-1.24] and 1.22 [1.12-1.33] per 0.5 g/L higher transferrin level) after adjustment for age, center, BMI, physical activity, smoking status, education, hs-CRP, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Elevated TSAT (>/=45% vs. <45%) was associated with a lower risk of T2D in women (0.68 [0.54-0.86]) but was not statistically significantly associated in men (0.90 [0.75-1.08]). Serum iron was not associated with T2D. The association of ferritin with T2D was stronger among leaner individuals (Pinteraction < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of association of TSAT and transferrin with T2D suggests that the underlying relationship between iron stores and T2D is more complex than the simple link suggested by the association of ferritin with T2D.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) patients still require effective treatment. The anti-inflammatory property of curcumin and the antispasmodic and carminative effect of fennel suggests that combination of these nutraceutical compounds would be useful in functional bowel disorders including IBS. We assessed the efficacy and tolerability of a combination of curcumin and fennel essential oil (CU-FEO) in IBS symptoms relief. METHODS: 121 patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms of IBS defined by an Irritable Bowel Syndrome- symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) 100-300 and abdominal pain score 30-70 on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), were randomly assigned to CU-FEO or placebo (2 capsules b.d. for 30 days). Primary endpoint was the mean decrease of IBS-SSS at the end of the treatment corrected for the mean baseline score (relative decrease). The impact of the treatment on quality of life was assessed through IBS-QoL questionnaire. RESULTS: CU-FEO was safe, well-tolerated and induced symptom relief in patients with IBS; a significant decrease in the mean relative IBS-SSS was observed after 30 days of treatment (50.05 +/- 28.85% vs 26.12 +/- 30.62%, P<0.001). This result matched the reduction of abdominal pain and all the other symptoms of IBS-SSS. The percentage of symptom-free patients was significantly higher in the CU-FEO than in the placebo group (25.9% vs. 6.8%, P = 0.005). All domains of IBS-QoL improved consistently. CONCLUSION: CU-FEO significantly improved symptoms and quality of life in IBS patients over 30 days.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience functional-like gastrointestinal symptoms (FGS) even during remission. Research suggests that dietary restriction of fermentable carbohydrates (low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet) can improve FGS, albeit in irritable bowel syndrome. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet delivered in routine clinical practice in patients with IBD and coexisting FGS. METHODS: Gastrointestinal symptom scores were compared in consecutive patients with IBD referred for low FODMAP dietary education for symptom management (n = 88). Symptoms were assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale, and stool output was assessed using the Bristol Stool Form Scale at both baseline and follow-up (minimum of 6 weeks). RESULTS: There was a significant and large increase in the numbers of patients reporting satisfactory relief of symptoms between baseline (14/88, 16%) and low FODMAP diet (69/88, 78%; P < 0.001). Following dietary intervention, there was also a significant decrease in severity for most symptoms and a reduction in composite symptom score (baseline mean: 1.2, SD: 0.5 versus low FODMAP diet mean: 0.7, SD: 0.5; P < 0.001). Improvements in stool consistency and frequency were observed, including an increase in "normal" stool form (P = 0.002) and "normal" stool frequency (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The low FODMAP diet delivered in routine clinical practice seems effective in improving satisfaction with, and severity of, FGS in IBD. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to definitively establish effectiveness.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to determine whether psychological well-being and weight-teasing history of young adults with bowel conditions (i.e. coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome) differed from those without bowel conditions. METHODS: Young adults (aged 18-26 years) completed an online survey that collected demographic information and assessed psychological well-being (mentally and physically unhealthy days, self-esteem, and depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder severity) and weight-teasing history (Perception of Teasing Scale). Each bowel condition participant (cases = 135) was matched to four healthy participants (controls = 504) based on sex and body mass index (BMI) (+/-0.50 BMI units). Conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted and odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were presented for all measures and demographics. RESULTS: Cases were significantly more likely to have poorer overall psychological well-being. Specifically, cases were significantly (P </= 0.05) more likely to have more mentally and physical unhealthy days, depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms than controls. Cases were also significantly more likely to recall being weight teased as a child (P = 0.02, OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.04-1.53) and being more upset from the weight-teasing insults (P = 0.006, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05-1.35) than controls. Cases were also more than 1.5 times more likely to be made fun of (P = 0.03, OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.09-2.43) or laughed at (P = 0.01, OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.15-2.73) because of their weight than controls. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that healthcare providers should monitor the psychological well-being of young adults with bowel conditions and incorporate opportunities for them to develop skills and strategies for coping.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous functional disorder with a multifactorial etiology that involves the interplay of both host and environmental factors. Among environmental factors relevant for IBS etiology, the diet stands out given that the majority of IBS patients report their symptoms to be triggered by meals or specific foods. The diet provides substrates for microbial fermentation, and, as the composition of the intestinal microbiota is disturbed in IBS patients, the link between diet, microbiota composition, and microbial fermentation products might have an essential role in IBS etiology. In this review, we summarize current evidence regarding the impact of diet and the intestinal microbiota on IBS symptoms, as well as the reported interactions between diet and the microbiota composition. On the basis of the existing data, we suggest pathways (mechanisms) by which diet components, via the microbial fermentation, could trigger IBS symptoms. Finally, this review provides recommendations for future studies that would enable elucidation of the role of diet and microbiota and how these factors may be (inter)related in the pathophysiology of IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a global health problem and its prevalence is underestimated, especially in Latin American populations. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical features, psychological factors, and health-related quality of life (QoL), before and after diagnosis, in a representative sample of adult Mexican Mestizo patients presenting with CD. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on patients seen at two tertiary referral centers in Mexico. QoL before and after CD diagnosis was evaluated using the EuroQoL 5D, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the disease-specific Celiac Symptom Index (CSI) questionnaires. RESULTS: We included 80 patients (80% were women, with a mean age of 48.6 +/- 14.1 years). The most common symptoms were diarrhea (86%), bloating (77.5%), and abdominal pain (71.3%). Mean symptom duration was 10.33 +/- 6.3 years. Fifty-one patients (63.8%) had a previous diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 23 (28.8%) had one of functional dyspepsia. Questionnaire respondents rated their health status at 50% before diagnosis (0 = worst imaginable state, 100 = best imaginable state) and there was a significant improvement of 26% after diagnosis. Thirty-nine percent of the patients had a CSI score > 45 and they were the ones that had been previously diagnosed most often with IBS (p = 0.13) or dyspepsia (p = .036). CONCLUSIONS: At the time of diagnosis, Mexican Mestizo patients with CD had poor QoL. Long-standing symptoms and a previous diagnosis of functional disorders were associated with worse QoL. As in other populations, our results support the need for a detailed examination of cost-effective strategies for increasing CD awareness in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary fibre supplements have been advocated for the management of chronic constipation (CC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Recently, a fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) restricted diet has been recommended for IBS. AIM: To systematically examine recent evidence for dietary interventions with fibre in CC and IBS and FODMAP-restricted diet in IBS, and provide recommendations. METHODS: We searched PUBMED, MEDLINE, OVID and COCHRANE databases from 2004 to 2014. Published studies in adults with CC and IBS and constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) that compared fibre with placebo/alternative and FODMAP-restricted diet with alternative were included. RESULTS: Of 550 potentially eligible clinical trials on fibre, 11 studies were found and of 23 potentially eligible studies on FODMAPs, six were found. A meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity and methodological quality. Fibre was beneficial in 5/7 studies in CC and 3/3 studies in IBS-C. FODMAP-restricted diet improved overall IBS symptoms in 4/4 and IBS-C symptoms in 1/3 studies and three studies did not meet inclusion criteria. There were significant disparities in subject selection, interventions and outcome assessments in both fibre and FODMAPs studies. CONCLUSIONS: Fibre supplementation is beneficial in mild to moderate CC and IBS-C, although larger, more rigorous and long-term RCTs are needed (Fair evidence-Level II, Grade B). Although the FODMAP-restricted diet may be effective in short-term management of selected patients with IBS (Fair evidence-Level II, Grade C) and IBS-C (Poor evidence-Level III, Grade C), more rigorous trials are needed to establish long-term efficacy and safety, particularly on colonic health and microbiome.},

   abstract = {Despite the clinical significance of balanced chromosomal abnormalities (BCAs), their characterization has largely been restricted to cytogenetic resolution. We explored the landscape of BCAs at nucleotide resolution in 273 subjects with a spectrum of congenital anomalies. Whole-genome sequencing revised 93% of karyotypes and demonstrated complexity that was cryptic to karyotyping in 21% of BCAs, highlighting the limitations of conventional cytogenetic approaches. At least 33.9% of BCAs resulted in gene disruption that likely contributed to the developmental phenotype, 5.2% were associated with pathogenic genomic imbalances, and 7.3% disrupted topologically associated domains (TADs) encompassing known syndromic loci. Remarkably, BCA breakpoints in eight subjects altered a single TAD encompassing MEF2C, a known driver of 5q14.3 microdeletion syndrome, resulting in decreased MEF2C expression. We propose that sequence-level resolution dramatically improves prediction of clinical outcomes for balanced rearrangements and provides insight into new pathogenic mechanisms, such as altered regulation due to changes in chromosome topology.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: About half of adult irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients report symptoms with eating and disordered eating habits. However, little is known about eating in adolescent IBS patients, a common age at which eating disorders develop. The aim of the study was to investigate if adolescents with IBS are more likely than healthy controls (HCs) to experience eating-associated symptoms (EAS), report disordered eating patterns, and show differences in diet composition. METHODS: A total of 99 adolescents between 15 and 21 years-of-age participated (n = 48 IBS; n = 51 HCs). All subjects completed three 24-h dietary recalls and questionnaires on EAS and disordered eating. KEY RESULTS: IBS patients were more likely to report EASs than HC (91.7% vs 28%, p < 0.001). Eating-associated symptoms were controlled by avoiding the offending food (97.7%), not eating any food even when hungry (43.2%), or vomiting after eating (13.6%). Compared to HC, IBS patients reported reduced daily intake of overall calories (1828 vs 2139; p < 0.05), fat (65.4 g vs 81.4 g, p < 0.05), and lactose (8.2 g vs 12.8 g, p < 0.01). No differences were found between IBS and HC in screening for disordered eating patterns or BMI, though IBS patients endorsed using potentially unhealthy eating behaviors in an attempt to control symptoms. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Eating-associated symptoms are very common in adolescents with IBS and associated with changes in eating behaviors and dietary composition. They do not appear to change BMI and risk for eating disorders. More research is needed to guide adolescents with IBS in making appropriate dietary changes to control EASs.},

   abstract = {Women with a diagnosis of breast cancer are at increased risk of second primary cancers, and the identification of risk factors for the latter may have clinical implications. We have followed-up for 11 years 10,045 women with invasive breast cancer from a European cohort, and identified 492 second primary cancers, including 140 contralateral breast cancers. Expected and observed cases and Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIR) were estimated using Aalen-Johansen Markovian methods. Information on various risk factors was obtained from detailed questionnaires and anthropometric measurements. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the role of risk factors. Women with breast cancer had a 30% excess risk for second malignancies (95% confidence interval-CI 18-42) after excluding contralateral breast cancers. Risk was particularly elevated for colorectal cancer (SIR, 1.71, 95% CI 1.43-2.00), lymphoma (SIR 1.80, 95% CI 1.31-2.40), melanoma (2.12; 1.63-2.70), endometrium (2.18; 1.75-2.70) and kidney cancers (2.40; 1.57-3.52). Risk of second malignancies was positively associated with age at first cancer, body mass index and smoking status, while it was inversely associated with education, post-menopausal status and a history of full-term pregnancy. We describe in a large cohort of women with breast cancer a 30% excess of second primaries. Among risk factors for breast cancer, a history of full-term pregnancy was inversely associated with the risk of second primary cancer.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Dysbiosis leading to abnormal intestinal fermentation has been suggested as a possible etiological mechanism in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We aimed to investigate the location and magnitude of altered intestinal bacterial fermentation in IBS and its clinical subtypes. METHODS: IBS patients who satisfied the Rome III criteria (114) and 33 healthy controls (HC) were investigated. Intestinal fermentation was assessed using two surrogate measures: intestinal intraluminal pH and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Intraluminal pH and intestinal transit times were measured in the small and large bowel using a wireless motility capsule (SmartPill) in 47 IBS and 10 HC. Fecal SCFAs including acetate, propionate, butyrate, and lactate were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography in all enrolled subjects. Correlations between intestinal pH, fecal SCFAs, intestinal transit time, and IBS symptom scores were analyzed. RESULTS: Colonic intraluminal pH levels were significantly lower in IBS patients compared with HC (total colonic pH, 6.8 for IBS vs. 7.3 for HC, P=0.042). There were no differences in total and segmental pH levels in the small bowel between IBS patients and HC (6.8 vs. 6.8, P=not significant). The intraluminal colonic pH differences were consistent in all IBS subtypes. Total SCFA level was significantly lower in C-IBS patients than in D-IBS and M-IBS patients and HC. The total SCFA level in all IBS subjects was similar with that of HC. Colonic pH levels correlated positively with colon transit time (CTT) and IBS symptoms severity. Total fecal SCFAs levels correlated negatively with CTT and positively with stool frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Colonic intraluminal pH is decreased, suggesting higher colonic fermentation, in IBS patients compared with HC. Fecal SCFAs are not a sensitive marker to estimate intraluminal bacterial fermentation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The probiotic mixture VSL#3 has proven efficacious in inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome; however, its efficacy in microscopic colitis (MC) is being investigated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a multistrain probiotic, VSL#3, in inducing clinical remission and achieving clinical response, as compared with mesalamine, in patients with active MC. METHODS: A randomised, open labelled study comparing the efficacy of 900 billion colony-forming units/day of VSL#3 (group (Gp) A) or 1.6 g of mesalamine/day (Gp B) for 8 weeks in 30 patients with MC was conducted. After a washout period of 2 weeks, Gp B received 8 weeks of VSL#3 and Gp A was off medication for the next 8 weeks. The primary end points were clinical remission and clinical response at 8 weeks. RESULTS: Of 30 patients, 15 were randomised in each arm. 11 patients in Gp A and 13 patients in Gp B completed 8 weeks of treatment. 5 (46%) of 11 patients in Gp A and 1 (8%) of 13 patients in Gp B attained clinical remission (p=0.022). Clinical response was seen in Gp A, as evidenced by a lower stool weight (377.6+/-104.5 g) as compared with Gp B (507+/-168.2 g; p=0.03). VSL#3 was effective in maintaining clinical response up to 10 weeks, even after discontinuation of therapy. Secondary end points like stool parameters, histology and well-being improved in both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic VSL#3 was found to offer the benefit of inducing as well as maintaining short-term clinical response in patients with active MC. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The clinical trial is registered with CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY INDIA; http://ctri.nic.in, CTRI No. "CTRI/2008/091/000086" (registered on: 23/06/2008).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors are advised to follow lifestyle recommendations on diet, physical activity, and body fatness proposed by the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute of Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) for cancer prevention. Previous studies have demonstrated that higher concordance with these recommendations measured using an index score (the WCRF/AICR score) was associated with lower cancer incidence and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between pre-diagnostic concordance with WCRF/AICR recommendations and mortality in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. METHODS: The association between the WCRF/AICR score (score range 0-6 in men and 0-7 in women; higher scores indicate greater concordance) assessed on average 6.4 years before diagnosis and CRC-specific (n = 872) and overall mortality (n = 1,113) was prospectively examined among 3,292 participants diagnosed with CRC in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort (mean follow-up time after diagnosis 4.2 years). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality. RESULTS: The HRs (95% CIs) for CRC-specific mortality among participants in the second (score range in men/women: 2.25-2.75/3.25-3.75), third (3-3.75/4-4.75), and fourth (4-6/5-7) categories of the score were 0.87 (0.72-1.06), 0.74 (0.61-0.90), and 0.70 (0.56-0.89), respectively (P for trend <0.0001), compared to participants with the lowest concordance with the recommendations (category 1 of the score: 0-2/0-3). Similar HRs for overall mortality were observed (P for trend 0.004). Meeting the recommendations on body fatness and plant food consumption were associated with improved survival among CRC cases in mutually adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: Greater concordance with the WCRF/AICR recommendations on diet, physical activity, and body fatness prior to CRC diagnosis is associated with improved survival among CRC patients.},

   abstract = {In humans, 2 functionally different types of adipose tissue coexist: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). WAT is involved in energy storage, whereas BAT is involved in energy expenditure. Increased amounts of WAT may contribute to the development of metabolic disorders, such as obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, the thermogenic function of BAT allows high consumption of fatty acids because of the activity of uncoupling protein 1 in the internal mitochondrial membrane. Interestingly, obesity reduction and insulin sensitization have been achieved by BAT activation-regeneration in animal models. This review describes the origin, function, and differentiation mechanisms of BAT to identify new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metabolic disorders related to obesity. On the basis of the animal studies, novel approaches for BAT regeneration combining stem cells from the adipose tissue with active components, such as melatonin, may have potential for the treatment of metabolic disorders in humans.},

   abstract = {As defined by Rome III, there are 4 abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders in children: irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia (FD), abdominal migraine, and functional abdominal pain. Dyspepsia is a constellation of symptoms referable to the gastroduodenal region of the upper gastrointestinal tract. FD refers to dyspeptic symptoms that cannot currently be explained by an organic cause, and affects 25% to 40% of the adult population over a lifetime. In children, this condition results in increased specialist consultations, with reported prevalence between 3% and 27%. The Rome III criteria for pediatric FD include the presence or persistence of recurrent pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen, without evidence of organic disease or change in frequency of stools. Symptoms must be chronic, occurring at least weekly and over a period of at least 6 months. The goal of this article is to provide a narrative review of diagnosis and management of the FD in the pediatric population. A comprehensive search of published literature using the PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) database was carried out to identify all articles published in English from 1998 to November 2015, using 3 key terms; "FD," "functional gastrointestinal disorders," and "children."},

   abstract = {Alcohol intake has been associated to breast cancer in pre and postmenopausal women; however results are inconclusive regarding tumor hormonal receptor status, and potential modifying factors like age at start drinking. Therefore, we investigated the relation between alcohol intake and the risk of breast cancer using prospective observational data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Up to 334,850 women, aged 35-70 years at baseline, were recruited in ten European countries and followed up an average of 11 years. Alcohol intake at baseline and average lifetime alcohol intake were calculated from country-specific dietary and lifestyle questionnaires. The study outcomes were the Hazard ratios (HR) of developing breast cancer according to hormonal receptor status. During 3,670,439 person-years, 11,576 incident breast cancer cases were diagnosed. Alcohol intake was significantly related to breast cancer risk, for each 10 g/day increase in alcohol intake the HR increased by 4.2% (95% CI: 2.7-5.8%). Taking 0 to 5 g/day as reference, alcohol intake of >5 to 15 g/day was related to a 5.9% increase in breast cancer risk (95% CI: 1-11%). Significant increasing trends were observed between alcohol intake and ER+/PR+, ER-/PR-, HER2- and ER-/PR-HER2- tumors. Breast cancer risk was stronger among women who started drinking prior to first full-time pregnancy. Overall, our results confirm the association between alcohol intake and both hormone receptor positive and hormone receptor negative breast tumors, suggesting that timing of exposure to alcohol drinking may affect the risk. Therefore, women should be advised to control their alcohol consumption.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The frequency and the perceived intensity of life stressors, coping strategies, and social supports are very important in everybody's well-being. This study intended to estimate the relation of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and these factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in Isfahan on 2013. Data were extracted from the framework of the study on the epidemiology of psychological, alimentary health, and nutrition. Symptoms of IBS were evaluated by Talley bowel disease questionnaire. Stressful life event, modified COPE scale, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support were also used. About 4763 subjects were completed questionnaires. Analyzing data were done by t-test and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Of all returned questionnaire, 1024 (21.5%) were diagnosed with IBS. IBS and clinically-significant IBS (IBS-S) groups have significantly experienced a higher level of perceived intensity of stressors and had a higher frequency of stressors. The mean score of social supports and the mean scores of three coping strategies (problem engagement, support seeking, and positive reinterpretation and growth) were significantly lower in subjects with either IBS-S or IBS than in those with no IBS. Multivariate logistic regression revealed a significant association between frequency of stressors and perceived intensity of stressors with IBS (odds ratio [OR] =1.09 and OR = 1.02, respectively) or IBS-S (OR = 1.09 and OR = 1.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: People with IBS had higher numbers of stressors, higher perception of the intensity of stressors, less adaptive coping strategies, and less social supports which should be focused in psychosocial interventions.},

   abstract = {Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is a chronic, generalised pain condition usually accompanied by several associated symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, headache, irritable bowel syndrome and mood disorders. Different medical treatments are used to treat fibromyalgia and the recent guidelines suggest that the optimal treatment consists in a multidisciplinary approach with a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment modalities. Among non-pharmacological treatment, nutrition is a promising tool for FM patients. The aim of this review is to update the present knowledge about fibromyalgia and nutrition by means of a systematic search performed on Medline from January 2000 to December 2014. Nutritional deficiencies have been described in FM patients and the benefits of specific diet and nutritional supplementation are shown. Obesity and overweight, often present in FM patients, are related to the severity of FM worsening the quality of life in terms of higher pain, fatigue, worsened sleep quality and higher incidence of mood disorders. Weight control is thus an effective tool to improve the symptoms. Moreover, it seems reasonable to eliminate some foods from the diet of FM patients, for example excitotoxins. Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity is increasingly recognised as a frequent condition with similar manifestations which overlap with those of FM. The elimination of gluten from the diet of FM patients is recently becoming a potential dietary intervention for clinical improvement. In summary, this review reveals the potential benefit of specific dietary interventions as non-pharmacological tools as part of a multidisciplinary treatment for FM patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In addition to HPV, high parity and hormonal contraceptives have been associated with cervical cancer (CC). However, most of the evidence comes from retrospective case-control studies. The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate associations between hormonal factors and risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3)/carcinoma in situ (CIS) and invasive cervical cancer (ICC). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We followed a cohort of 308,036 women recruited in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Study. At enrollment, participants completed a questionnaire and provided serum. After a 9-year median follow-up, 261 ICC and 804 CIN3/CIS cases were reported. In a nested case-control study, the sera from 609 cases and 1,218 matched controls were tested for L1 antibodies against HPV types 11,16,18,31,33,35,45,52,58, and antibodies against Chlamydia trachomatis and Human herpesvirus 2. Multivariate analyses were performed to estimate hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). The cohort analysis showed that number of full-term pregnancies was positively associated with CIN3/CIS risk (p-trend = 0.03). Duration of oral contraceptives use was associated with a significantly increased risk of both CIN3/CIS and ICC (HR = 1.6 and HR = 1.8 respectively for >/= 15 years versus never use). Ever use of menopausal hormone therapy was associated with a reduced risk of ICC (HR = 0.5, 95%CI: 0.4-0.8). A non-significant reduced risk of ICC with ever use of intrauterine devices (IUD) was found in the nested case-control analysis (OR = 0.6). Analyses restricted to all cases and HPV seropositive controls yielded similar results, revealing a significant inverse association with IUD for combined CIN3/CIS and ICC (OR = 0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Even though HPV is the necessary cause of CC, our results suggest that several hormonal factors are risk factors for cervical carcinogenesis. Adherence to current cervical cancer screening guidelines should minimize the increased risk of CC associated with these hormonal risk factors.},

We used Rome 3 diagnostic criteria to determine the prevalence of FGIDs in pediatric gastroenterology clinic. In the process, we developed a diagnostic questionnaire for infants and toddlers. METHODS: We enrolled new patients </=18 years referred during 19 months to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Subjects or parents completed a demographic survey and a the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal symptoms, Rome 3 Version (if >/=4 years, or a new infant-toddler questionnaire) before their appointment. RESULTS: We acquired data from 976 subjects: 476 boys, 592 white. Of 332 subjects <4 years, 172 (52%) met diagnostic criteria for >/=1 FGIDs. Of 644 subjects >/=4 years, 486 (75%) met diagnostic criteria for >/=1 FGIDs. Thirty one (9%) subjects <4 years and 170 (26%) subjects >/=4 years met the criteria for >/=2 FGIDs. Of the total sample of subjects <4 years, common FGIDs included functional constipation (29%), infant regurgitation (13%), and cyclic vomiting syndrome (10%). Of the total sample of subjects >/=4 years, common FGIDs included irritable bowel syndrome (36%), abdominal migraine (19%), functional constipation (17%), cyclic vomiting syndrome (8%), functional abdominal pain syndrome (7%), aerophagia (7%), and functional dyspepsia (7%). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of new pediatric gastrointestinal clinic patients met the Rome 3 criteria for >/=1 FGIDs. Satisfying the criteria may facilitate diagnosis on the first visit.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elobixibat is a minimally absorbed ileal bile acid (BA) transporter (IBAT) inhibitor in development against chronic constipation (CC) and constipation-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-C). CC is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and type2 diabetes mellitus. The objectives of this study were to evaluate metabolic effects of elobixibat. Effects on plasma lipids and BA synthesis were evaluated utilizing a 4-week, placebo-controlled study in patients with dyslipidemia while changes of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) by elobixibat was assayed in samples from a 14 day high-dose elobixibat study in patients with CC. METHODS: Thirty-six dyslipidemic patients, 21 females, mean age 63 years, were randomized to 2.5 mg or 5 mg elobixibat or placebo once daily for four weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Secondary endpoints included other lipid parameters and serum 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a marker of BA (bile acid) synthesis. Another study, in 36 patients with CC treated with high dose elobixibat; 15 mg or 20 mg/day or placebo for 14 days, was evaluated for changes in GLP-1. RESULTS: In the dyslipidemia study LDL cholesterol was reduced by 7.4 % (p = 0.044), and the LDL/HDL ratio was decreased by 18 % (p = 0.004). Serum C4 increased, indicating that BA synthesis was induced. No serious adverse events were recorded. In the CC study, GLP-1 increased significantly in both the 15 mg (20.7 +/- 2.4 pmol/L; p = 0.03) and the 20 mg group (25.6 +/- 4.9 pmol/L; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Elobixibat reduces LDL cholesterol and LDL/HDL ratio and increase circulating peak GLP-1 levels, the latter in line with increased intestinal BA mediated responses in humans.

AIMS: To evaluate quality of life in patients with functional constipation and irritable bowel disease in accordance with the Rome III criteria, using the PAC-QOL and SF-36 questionnaires. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using self-administered questionnaires. The PAC-QOL, SF-36, and Rome III constipation module questionnaires were applied to patients that complained of constipation at the outpatient clinic of a tertiary care hospital. The constipation subtypes were: functional constipation (no pain), irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (pain and/or discomfort >/=3 days/month), and unclassifiable constipation (pain </=2 days/month). Data were summarized in proportions, and group comparisons were made between the scores of each of the areas of the PAC-QOL and SF-36 questionnaires using parametric tests (Student's t test and ANOVA). RESULTS: A total of 43 PAC-QOL surveys were analyzed, resulting in cases of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (14%), functional constipation (37%), and unclassifiable constipation (49%). There were statistically significant differences (P<.05) in Physical discomfort (irritable bowel syndrome with constipation vs. functional constipation and unclassifiable constipation vs. irritable bowel syndrome with constipation), Worries and concerns (irritable bowel syndrome with constipation vs. functional constipation), and Treatment satisfaction (irritable bowel syndrome with constipation vs. functional constipation and unclassifiable constipation vs. irritable bowel syndrome with constipation). A total of 93 SF-36 questionnaires were analyzed, describing cases of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (23%), functional constipation (27%), and unclassifiable constipation (51%). Lower physical energy was found in relation to irritable bowel syndrome with constipation vs. functional constipation (P<.0221) and unclassifiable constipation (P<.0086), respectively, and there was greater physical pain in the cases of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation vs. unclassifiable constipation (P<.0362). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in quality of life of patients presenting with constipation subtypes were identified using the PAC-QOL and SF-36 questionnaires. The patients that had the irritable bowel syndrome with constipation subtype experienced poorer quality of life in all the evaluated domains.},

The levels of lipolysis and glucose uptake were also determined. C-ANP4-23 treatment significantly increased the intracellular cAMP levels and the gene expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase, AMP-activated, alpha 1 catalytic subunit (AMPK). Western blot showed a significant increase in GLUT4 and phosphor-AMPKalpha levels. Importantly, the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 abolished these effects. Additionally, C-ANP4-23 increased glucose uptake by 2-fold. Our results show that C-ANP4-23 enhances glucose metabolism and might contribute to the development of new peptide-based therapies for metabolic diseases.},

   abstract = {Obesity is characterized by an excessive accumulation of fat in adipose tissue, which is associated with oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Excessive H2O2 levels are degraded by catalase (CAT), the activity of which is decreased in obesity. We investigated the effects of inhibition of catalase activity on metabolism and inflammation by incubating human differentiated adipocytes with 10 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) for 24 h. As expected, the treatment decreased CAT activity and increased intracellular H2O2 levels significantly. Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity was also reduced, and the gene expression levels of the antioxidant enzymes GPX4 and peroxiredoxins (1, 3 and 5) were inhibited. Interestingly, this occurred along with lower mRNA levels of the transcription factors nuclear factor (erythroid 2-like 2) and forkhead box O, which are involved in redox homeostasis. However, superoxide dismutase activity and expression were increased. Moreover, 3-AT led to nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) activation and increased tumor necrosis alpha and interleukin 6 protein and gene expression levels, while lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) mRNA and protein levels. These alterations were accompanied by an altered glucose and lipid metabolism. Indeed, adipocytes treated with 3-AT showed reduced basal glucose uptake, reduced glucose transporter type 4 gene and protein expression, reduced lipolysis, reduced AMP-activated protein kinase activation and reduced gene expression of lipases. Our results indicate that increased H2O2 levels caused by 3-AT treatment impair the antioxidant defense system, lower PPARgamma expression and initiate inflammation, thus affecting glucose and lipid metabolism in human differentiated adipocytes.},

   abstract = {Over the last several years, the increasing prevalence of obesity has favored an intense study of adipose tissue biology and the precise mechanisms involved in adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis. Adipocyte commitment and differentiation are complex processes, which can be investigated thanks to the development of diverse in vitro cell models and molecular biology techniques that allow for a better understanding of adipogenesis and adipocyte dysfunction associated with obesity. The aim of the present work was to update the different animal and human cell culture models available for studying the in vitro adipogenic differentiation process related to obesity and its co-morbidities. The main characteristics, new protocols, and applications of the cell models used to study the adipogenesis in the last five years have been extensively revised. Moreover, we depict co-cultures and three-dimensional cultures, given their utility to understand the connections between adipocytes and their surrounding cells in adipose tissue.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Various nonpharmacologic treatments are available for pediatric abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (AP-FGIDs). Data on efficacy and safety are scarce. The goal of this study was to summarize the evidence regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for pediatric AP-FGIDs: lifestyle interventions, dietary interventions, behavioral interventions, prebiotics and probiotics, and alternative medicine. METHODS: Searches were conducted of the Medline and Cochrane Library databases. Systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning nonpharmacologic therapies in children (aged 3-18 years) with AP-FGIDs were included, and data were extracted on participants, interventions, and outcomes. The quality of evidence was assessed by using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Twenty-four RCTs were found that included 1390 children. Significant improvement of abdominal pain was reported after hypnotherapy compared with standard care/wait-list approaches and after cognitive behavioral therapy compared with a variety of control treatments/wait-list approaches. Written self-disclosure improved pain frequency at the 6-month follow-up only. Compared with placebo, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and VSL#3 were associated with significantly more treatment responders (LGG relative risk: 1.31 [95% confidence interval: 1.08 to 1.59]; VSL#3: P < .05). Guar gum significantly improved irritable bowel syndrome symptom frequency; however, no effect was found for other fiber supplements (relative risk: 1.17 [95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 1.81]) or a lactose-free diet. Functional disability was not significantly decreased after yoga compared with a wait-list approach. No studies were found concerning lifestyle interventions; gluten-, histamine-, or carbonic acid-free diets; fluid intake; or prebiotics. No serious adverse effects were reported. The quality of evidence was found to be very low to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Although high-quality studies are lacking, some evidence shows efficacy of hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and probiotics (LGG and VSL#3) in pediatric AP-FGIDs. Data on fiber supplements are inconclusive.},

   abstract = {The use of probiotics and synbiotics in the prevention and treatment of different disorders has dramatically increased over the last decade. Both probiotics and synbiotics are well known ingredients of functional foods and nutraceuticals and may provide beneficial health effects because they can influence the intestinal microbial ecology and immunity. The present study reviews the effects of probiotics and synbiotics on obesity, insulin resistance syndrome (IRS), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in human randomized clinical trials. Select probiotics and synbiotics provided beneficial effects in patients with obesity, mainly affecting the body mass index and fat mass. Some probiotics had beneficial effects on IRS, decreasing the cell adhesion molecule-1 levels, and the synbiotics decreased the insulin resistance and plasma lipid levels. Moreover, select probiotics improved the carbohydrate metabolism, fasting blood glucose, insulin sensitivity and antioxidant status and also reduced metabolic stress in subjects with T2D. Some probiotics and synbiotics improved the liver and metabolic parameters in patients with NAFLD. The oral intake of probiotics and synbiotics as co-adjuvants for the prevention and treatment of obesity, IRS, T2D and NAFLD is partially supported by the data shown in the present review. However, further studies are required to understand the precise mechanism of how probiotics and synbiotics affect these metabolic disorders.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Fiber definition includes all those carbohydrates which are not digested nor absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract allowing them to reach the colon with no previous processing. Traditionally fiber has been classified according to their solubility into soluble and insoluble and different physiological properties have been defined for each type. The physiologic role of the fiber intake has been studied in diabetes, dyslipidemia or obesity. Fiber intake has also demonstrated to be beneficial in the prevention of many neoplastic diseases like colorectal cancer. It s also known that fiber plays an important role in the faecal excretion of nitrogen. AIM: To evaluate the current evidence that fiber intake plays in the management and prevention of several different diseases, being able to determine, if possible, the most recommended fiber type for each clinical condition. METHODS: A non-systematic review by searching the Medline and Pubmed was made and studies which met the inclusion criteria were identified and selected for analysis. RESULTS: Different fiber types can be useful for the treatment of several gastrointestinal diseases like constipation, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis remission or short bowel syndrome. Patients diagnosed with diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and other cardiometabolic diseases can get a clinical improvement with soluble fiber intake. Dietary fiber has demonstrated to play a role in the prevention of colorrectal cancer and other neoplastic diseases. Patients with hepatic encephalopathy or chronic kidney disease will also benefit from fermentable fiber intake. DISCUSSION: Fiber plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of many clinical conditions. However further investigations are needed to establish specific fiber intake recommendations.},

The aim of this study was to know the lifestyles of university students in the following dimensions: diet, exercise, consumption of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs, sex and road safety. We made a literature review in electronic databases: PubMed, SCIELO and CUIDEN, between 2002-2014; using as keywords habits, lifestyle, health behaviors, young adult and university students. From articles found, stand out as most relevant data that university students have a high presence of favorable beliefs about healthy lifestyles and nevertheless not put into practice. We could conclude that according to different authors, university students in general have not a good eating habits, eating unbalanced diets high in calories. Besides the physical exercise is null, knowing that a good diet and doing exercise have beneficial effects on health. To this must be added the high consumption of alcohol, tobacco and marijuana among university students.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended >/=30% decrease on patient-reported outcomes for pain be considered clinically significant in clinical trials for adults with irritable bowel syndrome. This percent change approach may not be appropriate for children. We compared three alternate approaches to determining clinically significant reductions in pain among children. METHODS: 80 children with functional abdominal pain participated in a study of the efficacy of amitriptyline. Endpoints included patient-reported estimates of feeling better, and pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The minimum clinically important difference in pain report was calculated as (i) mean change in VAS score for children reporting being 'better'; (ii) percent changes in pain (>/=30% and >/=50%) on the VAS; and (iii) statistically reliable changes on the VAS for 68% and 95% confidence intervals. KEY RESULTS: There was poor agreement between the three approaches. 43.6% of the children who met the FDA >/=30% criterion for clinically significant change did not achieve a reliable level of improvement (95% confidence interval). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Children's self-reported ratings of being better may not be statistically reliable. A combined approach in which children must report improvement as better and achieve a statistically significant change may be more appropriate for outcomes in clinical trials.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that children with celiac disease (CD) on gluten-free diet are at increased risk of abdominal pain (AP) associated-functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). STUDY DESIGN: This was a multinational cross-sectional study performed from 2014 to 2015. Patients 4-18 years of age with CD on gluten-free diet for longer than 6 months were recruited from pediatric CD clinics in US and Italy. Control groups included siblings of children with CD (with normal tissue transglutaminase levels) and unrelated controls. Subjects or parents completed the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III. RESULTS: Children (n = 289) were recruited (55% US, 45% Italy): 96 children with CD, 96 sibling controls, and 97 unrelated controls. Chronic AP was present in 30 (30.9%) subjects with CD, 22 (22.7%) sibling controls, and 21 (21.6%) unrelated controls (P = .26 patients with CD vs siblings; P = .18 patients with CD vs unrelated; P = .96 siblings vs unrelated). AP-FGIDs were present in 8 (8.2%) subjects with CD, 8 (8.2%) sibling controls, and 2 (2.1%) unrelated controls (P = 1.00 subjects with CD vs sibling controls; P = .06 subjects with CD vs unrelated controls; P = .06 sibling controls vs unrelated controls). CONCLUSION: This multinational study evaluated the prevalence of chronic abdominal pain and AP-FGIDs in the pediatric population with CD. We found that subjects with CD and controls have a similar prevalence of chronic AP and AP-FGIDs. This suggests that not all types of gastrointestinal inflammation result in AP-FGIDs in children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is little published evidence of efficacy for the most commonly used treatments. Thus, there is an urgent need to conduct clinical trials on existing and novel therapies. PURPOSE: In order to address these issues the Rome Foundation and members of the Pediatric Committee of the European Medicines Agency formed a subcommittee on clinical trials to develop guidelines for the design of clinical trials in children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The following recommendations are based on evidence from published data when available and expert opinion. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: The subcommittee recommends randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trials to assess the efficacy of new drugs. The combined endpoints for abdominal pain are a decrease in intensity of at least 30% compared with baseline and to meet or exceed the Reliable Change Index (RCI) for the sample. Stool consistency is measured with the Bristol Stool Scale Form (BSFS). The subcommittee recommends as entry criteria for abdominal pain a weekly average of worst abdominal pain in past 24 h of at least 3.0 on a 0-10 point scale or at least 30 mm in 100 mm Visual Analog Scale. For stool endpoints the committee recommends an average stool consistency lower than 3 in the BSFS during the run-in period for clinical trials on IBS-C and an average stool consistency greater than 5 in the BSFS during the run-in period for clinical trials on IBS-D. Changes in stool consistency are the primary endpoints for both IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) and IBS with constipation (IBS-C).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota composition varies between healthy and diseased individuals for numerous diseases. Although any cause or effect relationship between the alterations in the gut microbiota and disease is not always clear, targeting the intestinal microbiota might offer new possibilities for prevention and/or treatment of disease. OBJECTIVE: Here we review some examples of manipulating the intestinal microbiota by prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbial transplants. RESULTS: Prebiotics are best known for their ability to increase the number of bifidobacteria. However, specific prebiotics could potentially also stimulate other species they can also stimulate other species associated with health, like Akkermansia muciniphila, Ruminococcus bromii, the Roseburia/Enterococcus rectale group, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Probiotics have beneficial health effects for different diseases and digestive symptoms. These effects can be due to the direct effect of the probiotic bacterium or its products itself, as well as effects of the probiotic on the resident microbiota. Probiotics can influence the microbiota composition as well as the activity of the resident microbiota. Fecal microbial transplants are a drastic intervention in the gut microbiota, aiming for total replacement of one microbiota by another. With numerous successful studies related to antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile infection, the potential of fecal microbial transplants to treat other diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and metabolic and cardiovascular disorders is under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Improved knowledge on the specific role of gut microbiota in prevention and treatment of disease will help more targeted manipulation of the intestinal microbiota. Further studies are necessary to see the (long term) effects for health of these interventions.},

   abstract = {Regulatory authorities have indicated that new drugs to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) should not be associated with an unacceptable increase in cardiovascular risk. Human genetics may be able to guide development of antidiabetic therapies by predicting cardiovascular and other health endpoints. We therefore investigated the association of variants in six genes that encode drug targets for obesity or T2D with a range of metabolic traits in up to 11,806 individuals by targeted exome sequencing and follow-up in 39,979 individuals by targeted genotyping, with additional in silico follow-up in consortia. We used these data to first compare associations of variants in genes encoding drug targets with the effects of pharmacological manipulation of those targets in clinical trials. We then tested the association of those variants with disease outcomes, including coronary heart disease, to predict cardiovascular safety of these agents. A low-frequency missense variant (Ala316Thr; rs10305492) in the gene encoding glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R), the target of GLP1R agonists, was associated with lower fasting glucose and T2D risk, consistent with GLP1R agonist therapies. The minor allele was also associated with protection against heart disease, thus providing evidence that GLP1R agonists are not likely to be associated with an unacceptable increase in cardiovascular risk. Our results provide an encouraging signal that these agents may be associated with benefit, a question currently being addressed in randomized controlled trials. Genetic variants associated with metabolic traits and multiple disease outcomes can be used to validate therapeutic targets at an early stage in the drug development process.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In functional gastrointestinal disorders, patient recall of symptoms drives diagnostic decisions and evaluation of treatment response, and research conclusions about potential treatments. In pediatrics, parent report also impacts assessment and care. Hence, identifying methods for accurately capturing patient and parent report of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms is important. This study evaluated correspondence between retrospective questionnaire (parent and child report) and prospective diary data for children and adolescents with IBS. METHODS: Participants included 50 children/adolescents with IBS per Rome III criteria. Children completed a 2-week pain and stool diary. Children and parents subsequently completed a 2-week recall questionnaire, reporting number of pain days, maximum pain, days without bowel movement, and days with diarrhea during the diary interval. Intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots assessed agreement. KEY RESULTS: For pain and days without bowel movement, overall agreement between child recall questionnaire and child diary was strong, although under conditions likely to facilitate agreement and with individual variation observed. Parent recall and child diary were less concordant, and agreement about diarrhea was poor for parent and child. Age did not significantly correlate with agreement. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Child questionnaire with short recall interval may be a reasonable approximation for diary data, although this varies by individual and replication/investigation of lengthier recall are needed. Relying on parent questionnaire does not appear a suitable proxy, and recall of stool form by both parent and child appears more problematic. These results combined with existing literature support use of diary data whenever possible.},

   abstract = {Several studies have shown that a large number of patients who are fulfilling the criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are sensitive to gluten. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a gluten-free diet on gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS. In this double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 148 IBS patients fulfilling the Rome III criteria were enrolled between 2011 and 2013. However, only 72 out of the 148 commenced on a gluten-free diet for up to six weeks and completed the study; clinical symptoms were recorded biweekly using a standard visual analogue scale (VAS). In the second stage after six weeks, patients whose symptoms improved to an acceptable level were randomly divided into two groups; patients either received packages containing powdered gluten (35 cases) or patients received placebo (gluten free powder) (37 cases). Overall, the symptomatic improvement was statistically different in the gluten-containing group compared with placebo group in 9 (25.7%), and 31 (83.8%) patients respectively (p < 0.001). A large number of patients labelled as irritable bowel syndrome are sensitive to gluten. Using the term of IBS can therefore be misleading and may deviate and postpone the application of an effective and well-targeted treatment strategy in gluten sensitive patients.},

This study aimed to investigate the relationship among gluten-related disorders, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and uninvestigated dyspepsia in Indian patients. METHODS: Patients with IBS and uninvestigated dyspepsia (using Rome III criteria) were tested for immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody and anti-gliadin antibody (AGA). Those with positive anti-tTG antibody were evaluated for the presence of villous abnormalities. Patients who were only IgA AGA-positive were considered to have gluten sensitivity and those with positive anti-tTG antibody and villous atrophy were considered to have CeD. RESULTS: Of 362 patients with IBS, 22 (6.1%) had positive anti-tTG antibody, among whom 3 (0.8%) had CeD and 19 had potential CeD. Of 358 patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia, 18 (5.0%) were anti-tTG antibody-positive and among them 4 (1.1%) had CeD and 14 had potential CeD. AGA was positive in 104 (28.7%) patients with IBS and 68 (19.0%) with uninvestigated dyspepsia, suggesting the presence of gluten sensitivity. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the relationship between IBS or dyspepsia and CeD or gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of nutritional formulas in a rat model of TNBS-induced IBD. METHODS: IBD was induced with TNBS in 4-week-old rats that were then fed different exclusive enteral nutrition diets for 7 days. The length of the tibia and the number of chondrocytes in the proximal tibias were analyzed at 7 days after supplementation. Immunohistochemical analysis, ELISA and real-time PCR were performed to evaluate the levels of growth hormone receptor (GHR) and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), the growth factors IGF-I and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) , bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and BMP-6 respectively. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the tibia length of the peptide formula group was longer than that of the IBD-Modulen((R)) formula and normal diet groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the number of chondrocytes of the proximal tibial was more pronounced in the peptide formula group compared to the other groups (P < 0.05). The peptide formula was also more effective in increasing the expression of GHR compared to the other groups (P < 0.05), while the expression of IGF-IR was not significantly different (P > 0.05). In addition, the IGF-I and IGFBP3 levels were more pronounced in the peptide formula supplement group (P < 0.05), and the expression of BMP-2 and BMP-6 mRNA in the proximal tibia growth plate from the peptide formula group was higher than that in the ordinary formula and normal diet groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EEN, and particularly a peptide formula, exerted protective effects on the proximal tibial epiphyseal growth plate in a TNBS-induced IBD model.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: We sought to determine the efficacy of psyllium fiber treatment on abdominal pain and stool patterns in children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We evaluated effects on breath hydrogen and methane production, gut permeability, and microbiome composition. We also investigated whether psychological characteristics of children or parents affected the response to treatment. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind trial of 103 children (mean age, 13 +/- 3 y) with IBS seen at primary or tertiary care settings. After 2 weeks on their habitual diet, children began an 8-day diet excluding carbohydrates thought to cause symptoms of IBS. Children with >/=75% improvement in abdominal pain were excluded (n = 17). Children were assigned randomly to groups given psyllium (n = 37) or placebo (maltodextrin, n = 47) for 6 weeks. Two-week pain and stool diaries were compared at baseline and during the final 2 weeks of treatment. We assessed breath hydrogen and methane production, intestinal permeability, and the composition of the microbiome before and after administration of psyllium or placebo. Psychological characteristics of children were measured at baseline. RESULTS: Children in the psyllium group had a greater reduction in the mean number of pain episodes than children in the placebo group (mean reduction of 8.2 +/- 1.2 after receiving psyllium vs mean reduction of 4.1 +/- 1.3 after receiving placebo; P = .03); the level of pain intensity did not differ between the groups. Psychological characteristics were not associated with response. At the end of the study period, the percentage of stools that were normal (Bristol scale scores, 3-5), breath hydrogen or methane production, intestinal permeability, and microbiome composition were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Psyllium fiber reduced the number of abdominal pain episodes in children with IBS, independent of psychological factors. Psyllium did not alter breath hydrogen or methane production, gut permeability, or microbiome composition. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT00526903.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fecal incontinence (FI) is a prevalent but poorly recognized problem in the general population with profound negative effects on daily life. The prevalence of FI in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and its association with clinical, demographic, and pathophysiological factors remain largely unknown. METHODS: One US (n=304) and one Swedish (n=168) patient cohort fulfilling Rome III criteria for IBS completed Rome III diagnostic questions on FI and IBS symptoms, and questionnaires on IBS symptom severity, quality of life, anxiety and depression, and work productivity impairment. The patients also underwent assessments of colorectal sensitivity and motility. KEY RESULTS: Fecal incontinence >/= one day per month was reported by 19.7% (USA) and 13.7% (Sweden) of IBS patients. These proportions rose to 43.4% and 29.8% if patients with less frequent FI were included. Fecal incontinence prevalence was higher in older age groups, with a clear increase above age 40. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with FI reported greater overall IBS symptom severity, more frequent and loose stools, and greater urgency. Negative effects of FI on quality of life, psychological distress, and work productivity were demonstrated. No associations were found between colorectal physiology and FI. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Fecal incontinence is common in IBS patients, and similar to previous general population reports, the major risk factors for FI in IBS are older age, rectal urgency, and loose, frequent stools. When IBS patients have comorbid FI, the impact on quality of life, psychological symptoms, and work impairment appears greater.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The condition non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is clinically similar to coeliac disease, but lack objective diagnostic criteria. Symptom relief on gluten-free diet followed by gluten containing food challenge may confirm the condition in clinical settings. AIM: To describe the results of an open bread challenge in patients with suspected NCGS, and to compare the results with recently suggested cut-offs for symptom change. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-six patients (12 males) self-instituted on gluten-free diet with negative coeliac disease diagnostics were examined for NCGS by an open bread challenge. Symptoms were reported by Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, IBS-version (GSRS-IBS) and visual analogue scale (VAS). Results were retrospectively compared to the Salerno and Monash cut-offs for symptom change. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were diagnosed with NCGS. Total GSRS-IBS score and overall symptoms by VAS increased significantly in NCGS (p < .001), but not in non-NCGS patients (p < .12 and p = .08, respectively). Total GSRS-IBS challenge score and overall symptoms by VAS were significantly higher in NCGS than in non-NCGS patients (53 vs. 37, p = .004 and 76 vs. 39 mm, p = .02, respectively). Applying the Salerno and Monash cut-offs, 63 and 75% would be classified with NCGS, respectively. According to total GSRS-IBS absolute agreement was lowest between clinician's diagnosis and Salerno cut-off (63%) and highest between Salerno and Monash cut-offs (88%). CONCLUSION: Clinician diagnosed 85% with NCGS. The proportion of NCGS was lower according to the Salerno and Monash cut-offs. The Salerno cut-off should be the starting point for a common definition of symptom change.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The differential associations of beer, wine, and spirit consumption on cardiovascular risk found in observational studies may be confounded by diet. We described and compared dietary intake and diet quality according to alcoholic beverage preference in European elderly. METHODS: From the Consortium on Health and Ageing: Network of Cohorts in Europe and the United States (CHANCES), seven European cohorts were included, i.e. four sub-cohorts from EPIC-Elderly, the SENECA Study, the Zutphen Elderly Study, and the Rotterdam Study. Harmonized data of 29,423 elderly participants from 14 European countries were analyzed. Baseline data on consumption of beer, wine, and spirits, and dietary intake were collected with questionnaires. Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI). Intakes and scores across categories of alcoholic beverage preference (beer, wine, spirit, no preference, non-consumers) were adjusted for age, sex, socio-economic status, self-reported prevalent diseases, and lifestyle factors. Cohort-specific mean intakes and scores were calculated as well as weighted means combining all cohorts. RESULTS: In 5 of 7 cohorts, persons with a wine preference formed the largest group. After multivariate adjustment, persons with a wine preference tended to have a higher HDI score and intake of healthy foods in most cohorts, but differences were small. The weighted estimates of all cohorts combined revealed that non-consumers had the highest fruit and vegetable intake, followed by wine consumers. Non-consumers and persons with no specific preference had a higher HDI score, spirit consumers the lowest. However, overall diet quality as measured by HDI did not differ greatly across alcoholic beverage preference categories. DISCUSSION: This study using harmonized data from ~30,000 elderly from 14 European countries showed that, after multivariate adjustment, dietary habits and diet quality did not differ greatly according to alcoholic beverage preference.},

   abstract = {AIM: Because of increasing awareness of variations in the use of pancreatic exocrine replacement therapy, the Australasian Pancreatic Club decided it was timely to re-review the literature and create new Australasian guidelines for the management of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI). METHODS: A working party of expert clinicians was convened and initially determined that by dividing the types of presentation into three categories for the likelihood of PEI (definite, possible and unlikely) they were able to consider the difficulties of diagnosing PEI and relate these to the value of treatment for each diagnostic category. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Recent studies confirm that patients with chronic pancreatitis receive similar benefit from pancreatic exocrine replacement therapy (PERT) to that established in children with cystic fibrosis. Severe acute pancreatitis is frequently followed by PEI and PERT should be considered for these patients because of their nutritional requirements. Evidence is also becoming stronger for the benefits of PERT in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. However there is as yet no clear guide to help identify those patients in the 'unlikely' PEI group who would benefit from PERT. For example, patients with coeliac disease, diabetes mellitus, irritable bowel syndrome and weight loss in the elderly may occasionally be given a trial of PERT, but determining its effectiveness will be difficult. The starting dose of PERT should be from 25,000-40,000 IU lipase taken with food. This may need to be titrated up and there may be a need for proton pump inhibitors in some patients to improve efficacy.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterised by abdominal pain or discomfort with disordered defecation. This review describes the role of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS and how dietary strategies to manage symptoms impact on the microbial community. Evidence suggests a dysbiosis of the luminal and mucosal colonic microbiota in IBS, frequently characterised by a reduction in species of Bifidobacteria which has been associated with worse symptom profile. Probiotic supplementation trials suggest intentional modulation of the GI microbiota may be effective in treating IBS. A smaller number of prebiotic supplementation studies have also demonstrated effectiveness in IBS whilst increasing Bifidobacteria. In contrast, a novel method of managing IBS symptoms is the restriction of short-chain fermentable carbohydrates (low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet). Studies consistently demonstrate clinical effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet in patients with IBS. However, one unintentional consequence of this dietary intervention is its impact on the microbiota. This leads to an interesting paradox; namely, increasing luminal Bifidobacteria through probiotic supplementation is associated with a reduction in IBS symptoms while in direct conflict to this, the low FODMAP diet has clinical efficacy but markedly reduces luminal Bifidobacteria concentration. Given the multifactorial aetiology of IBS, the heterogeneity of symptoms and the complex and diverse nature of the microbiome, it is probable that both interventions are effective in patient subgroups. However combination treatment has never been explored and as such, presents an exciting opportunity for optimising clinical management, whilst preventing potentially deleterious effects on the GI microbiota.},

The aim of this study is to develop, deploy and evaluate an interactive application for Windows and Android operating systems, which could serve as a digital diet diary and as an analysis and a prediction tool both for the patient and the doctor. The software is gathering details about patients' diet and associated fettle in order to estimate fettle change after future meals, specifically for an individual patient. In this paper we have described the process of idea development and application design, feasibility assessment using a phone survey, a preliminary evaluation on 6 healthy individuals and early results of a clinical trial, which is still an ongoing study. Results suggest that applied approximative approach (Shepard's method of 6-dimensional metric interpolation) has a potential to predict the fettle accurately; as shown in leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).},

   abstract = {Perturbations in levels of amino acids (AA) and their derivatives are observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Yet, it is unclear whether these alterations precede or are a consequence of the disease, nor whether they pertain to anatomically related cancers of the intrahepatic bile duct (IHBC), and gallbladder and extrahepatic biliary tract (GBTC). Circulating standard AA, biogenic amines and hexoses were measured (Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ-p180Kit) in a case-control study nested within a large prospective cohort (147 HCC, 43 IHBC and 134 GBTC cases). Liver function and hepatitis status biomarkers were determined separately. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (OR; 95%CI) for log-transformed standardised (mean = 0, SD = 1) serum metabolite levels and relevant ratios in relation to HCC, IHBC or GBTC risk. Fourteen metabolites were significantly associated with HCC risk, of which seven metabolites and four ratios were the strongest predictors in continuous models. Leucine, lysine, glutamine and the ratio of branched chain to aromatic AA (Fischer's ratio) were inversely, while phenylalanine, tyrosine and their ratio, glutamate, glutamate/glutamine ratio, kynurenine and its ratio to tryptophan were positively associated with HCC risk. Confounding by hepatitis status and liver enzyme levels was observed. For the other cancers no significant associations were observed. In conclusion, imbalances of specific AA and biogenic amines may be involved in HCC development.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Serum liver biomarkers (gamma-glutamyl transferase, GGT; alanine aminotransferase, ALT; aspartate aminotransferase, AST; alkaline phosphatase, ALP; total bilirubin) are used as indicators of liver disease, but there is currently little data on their prospective association with risk of hepatobiliary cancers. METHODS: A nested-case control study was conducted within the prospective EPIC cohort (>520,000 participants, 10 European countries). After a mean 7.5 mean years of follow-up, 121 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 34 intrahepatic bile duct (IHBC) and 131 gallbladder and biliary tract (GBTC) cases were identified and matched to 2 controls each. Circulating biomarkers were measured in serum taken at recruitment into the cohort, prior to cancer diagnosis. Multivariable adjusted conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (OR; 95%CI). RESULTS: In multivariable models, 1SD increase of each log-transformed biomarker was positively associated with HCC risk (OR(GGT)=4.23, 95%CI:2.72-6.59; OR(ALP)=3.43, 95%CI:2.31-5.10;OR(AST)=3.00, 95%CI:2.04-4.42; OR(ALT)=2.69, 95%CI:1.89-3.84; OR(Bilirubin)=2.25, 95%CI:1.58-3.20). Each liver enzyme (OR(GGT)=4.98; 95%CI:1.75-14.17; OR(AST)=3.10, 95%CI:1.04-9.30; OR(ALT)=2.86, 95%CI:1.26-6.48, OR(ALP)=2.31, 95%CI:1.10-4.86) but not bilirubin (OR(Bilirubin)=1.46,95%CI:0.85-2.51) showed a significant association with IHBC. Only ALP was significantly associated with GBTC risk (OR(ALP)=1.59, 95%CI:1.20-2.09). CONCLUSION: This study shows positive associations between circulating liver biomarkers in sera collected prior to cancer diagnoses and the risks of developing HCC or IHBC, but not GBTC.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders in children include functional dyspepsia, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and abdominal migraine. We aimed to evaluate a possible association between functional abdominal pain disorders and Helicobacter pylori infection and faecal calprotectin level. METHODS: Prospective observational study including consecutive children with functional gastrointestinal disorders fulfilling Rome III criteria (cases) and age/sex-matched healthy controls. H pylori has been detected by biopsy-based tests and stool-antigen detection, faecal calprotectin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: A total of 56 cases (27 with functional dyspepsia) and 56 controls were enrolled. H pylori being detected in 17 of 56 cases (30.4%) and 4 of 56 controls (7.1%, odds ratio: 5.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8-18.2, P = 0.003). H pylori was detected significantly more frequently in cases with functional dyspepsia (14/27, 51.9% odds ratio: 14.0; 95% CI: 3.9-49.7, P = 0.00001) than in controls and not in cases with other well-recognized functional gastrointestinal complaints (3/29, 10.3%). The median faecal calprotectin level was similar in cases (7.8 mug/g, 95% CI: 7.8-8.4) including those with gastritis, and controls (9.1 mug/g, 95% CI: 7.8-11.3). Gastritis features were more frequent in H pylori-infected and noninfected cases with functional dyspepsia (27/27, 100%) than in cases with other abdominal functional complaints (15/29, 51.7%, P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: H pylori gastritis and noninfectious gastritis were associated with functional dyspepsia in children referred for abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders while faecal calprotectin is not a predictor of gastritis and is similar in children with functional abdominal pain symptoms and in controls.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: To determine the proportion of T-regulatory cells (CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ cells) in peripheral blood and the number of FOXP3+ cells in intestinal mucosa of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to verify whether these parameters correlate with the activity of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 24 patients newly diagnosed for IBD were included in the study: ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 13) and Crohn's disease (CD; n = 11). Seventeen healthy controls (HC) and 16 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) served as a control group for peripheral and intestinal Tregs assessment, respectively. The disease activity was assessed by Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI). Quantification of regulatory T cells of CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ phenotype in peripheral blood was based on three-color flow cytometry. Mucosal Tregs represented by FOXP3+ cells were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Median proportion of CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ cells among CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood (5.1%, range 1.7-84% vs. 4.3%, range 2-8.1%, p = 0.023) and median number of intestinal FOXP3+ cells (115.33 per high-power field, hpf, range 39.33-375.67 vs. 10.16 per hpf, range 5-30, p = 0.0001) were significantly higher in children with IBD than in the controls. The proportion of circulating Tregs and the number of intestinal FOXP3+ cells did not correlate with clinical activity of the disease, as well as with endoscopic and histopathologic scoring. No significant correlation was found between the percentage of peripheral CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ cells and the number of intestinal FOXP3+cells. CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBD likely do not present with a quantitative deficiency of circulating and intestinal Tregs at the moment of diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Different from other epithelia, the intestinal epithelium has the complex task of providing a barrier impeding the entry of toxins, food antigens, and microbes, while at the same time allowing for the transfer of nutrients, electrolytes, water, and microbial metabolites. These molecules/organisms are transported either transcellularly, crossing the apical and basolateral membranes of enterocytes, or paracellularly, passing through the space between enterocytes. Accordingly, the intestinal epithelium can affect energy metabolism, fluid balance, as well as immune response and tolerance. To help accomplish these complex tasks, the intestinal epithelium has evolved many sensing receptor mechanisms. Yet, their roles and functions are only now beginning to be elucidated. This article explores one such sensing receptor mechanism, carried out by the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). In addition to its established function as a nutrient sensor, coordinating food digestion, nutrient absorption, and regulating energy metabolism, we present evidence for the emerging role of CaSR in the control of intestinal fluid homeostasis and immune balance. An additional role in the modulation of the enteric nerve activity and motility is also discussed. Clearly, CaSR has profound effects on many aspects of intestinal function. Nevertheless, more work is needed to fully understand all functions of CaSR in the intestine, including detailed mechanisms of action and specific pathways involved. Considering the essential roles CaSR plays in gastrointestinal physiology and immunology, research may lead to a translational opportunity for the development of novel therapies that are based on CaSR's unique property of using simple nutrients such as calcium, polyamines, and certain amino acids/oligopeptides as activators. It is possible that, through targeting of intestinal CaSR with a combination of specific nutrients, oral solutions that are both inexpensive and practical may be developed to help in conditioning the gut microenvironment and in maintaining digestive health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: We have limited knowledge about the association between the composition of the intestinal microbiota and clinical features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We collected information on the fecal and mucosa-associated microbiota of patients with IBS and evaluated whether these were associated with symptoms. METHODS: We collected fecal and mucosal samples from adult patients who met the Rome III criteria for IBS at a secondary/tertiary care outpatient clinics in Sweden, as well as from healthy subjects. The exploratory set comprised 149 subjects (110 with IBS and 39 healthy subjects); 232 fecal samples and 59 mucosal biopsy samples were collected and analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA targeted pyrosequencing. The validation set comprised 46 subjects (29 with IBS and 17 healthy subjects); 46 fecal samples, but no mucosal samples, were collected and analyzed. For each subject, we measured exhaled H2 and CH4, oro-anal transit time, and the severity of psychological and gastrointestinal symptoms. Fecal methanogens were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Numerical ecology analyses and a machine learning procedure were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Fecal microbiota showed covariation with mucosal adherent microbiota. By using classic approaches, we found no differences in fecal microbiota abundance or composition between patients with IBS vs healthy patients. A machine learning procedure, a computational statistical technique, allowed us to reduce the 16S ribosomal RNA data complexity into a microbial signature for severe IBS, consisting of 90 bacterial operational taxonomic units. We confirmed the robustness of the intestinal microbial signature for severe IBS in the validation set. The signature was able to discriminate between patients with severe symptoms, patients with mild/moderate symptoms, and healthy subjects. By using this intestinal microbiota signature, we found IBS symptom severity to be associated negatively with microbial richness, exhaled CH4, presence of methanogens, and enterotypes enriched with Clostridiales or Prevotella species. This microbiota signature could not be explained by differences in diet or use of medications. CONCLUSIONS: In analyzing fecal and mucosal microbiota from patients with IBS and healthy individuals, we identified an intestinal microbiota profile that is associated with the severity of IBS symptoms.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated or implicated with the pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal conditions inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer, as well as with depression. No trials or epidemiology studies to date have investigated a link with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A single case report has suggested a benefit in IBS of vitamin D supplementation. We hypothesised that IBS participants with vitamin D insufficiency would benefit from repletion in terms of their IBS symptoms. We undertook a pilot trial to provide data to support a power calculation and to justify a full trial. METHODS: This was a randomised, double blinded, three-arm parallel design trial of vitamin D, placebo or a combination of vitamin D and probiotics. Participants were further stratified according to whether they were vitamin D replete or insufficient. Vitamin D status was determined by blood test at baseline and exit; IBS symptoms were assessed by validated questionnaire; dietary intakes were assessed by food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: A significant proportion of the IBS population were vitamin D deficient, such that the replete stratum could not be adequately recruited. There was a significant association in the baseline data between circulating vitamin D level and quality of life ("How much has IBS affected your life?"). Supplementation significantly improved vitamin D level versus placebo. IBS symptoms were not significantly improved in this pilot, although a power calculation was enabled from the intervention data. CONCLUSIONS: The IBS population exhibits significant levels of vitamin D insufficiency and would benefit from screening and possible supplementation. The impact of IBS on quality of life may be reduced by vitamin D level. Future trials should have a sample size of over 97. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ICTRN 6116003917.},

Adequate sampling strategies are required to limit bias due to shifts in microbial communities during sampling and storage. Therefore, we examined the impact of different sampling and storage conditions on the stability of fecal microbial communities in healthy and diseased subjects. Fecal samples from 10 healthy controls, 10 irritable bowel syndrome and 8 inflammatory bowel disease patients were collected on site, aliquoted immediately after defecation and stored at -80 degrees C, -20 degrees C for 1 week, at +4 degrees C or room temperature for 24 hours. Fecal transport swabs (FecalSwab, Copan) were collected and stored for 48-72 hours at room temperature. We used pyrosequencing of the 16S gene to investigate the stability of microbial communities. Alpha diversity did not differ between all storage methods and -80 degrees C, except for the fecal swabs. UPGMA clustering and principal coordinate analysis showed significant clustering by test subject (p < 0.001) but not by storage method. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and (un)weighted UniFrac showed a significant higher distance between fecal swabs and -80 degrees C versus the other methods and -80 degrees C samples (p < 0.009). The relative abundance of Ruminococcus and Enterobacteriaceae did not differ between the storage methods versus -80 degrees C, but was higher in fecal swabs (p < 0.05). Storage up to 24 hours (at +4 degrees C or room temperature) or freezing at -20 degrees C did not significantly alter the fecal microbial community structure compared to direct freezing of samples from healthy subjects and patients with gastrointestinal disorders.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: About 60% of ovarian cancers are diagnosed at late stage, when 5-year survival is less than 30% in contrast to 90% for local disease. This has prompted search for early detection biomarkers. For initial testing, specimens taken months or years before ovarian cancer diagnosis are the best source of information to evaluate early detection biomarkers. Here we evaluate the most promising ovarian cancer screening biomarkers in prospectively collected samples from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We measured CA125, HE4, CA72.4, and CA15.3 in 810 invasive epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 1,939 controls. We calculated the sensitivity at 95% and 98% specificity as well as area under the receiver operator curve (C-statistic) for each marker individually and in combination. In addition, we evaluated marker performance by stage at diagnosis and time between blood draw and diagnosis. RESULTS: We observed the best discrimination between cases and controls within 6 months of diagnosis for CA125 (C-statistic = 0.92), then HE4 (0.84), CA72.4 (0.77), and CA15.3 (0.73). Marker performance declined with longer time between blood draw and diagnosis and for earlier staged disease. However, assessment of discriminatory ability at early stage was limited by small numbers. Combinations of markers performed modestly, but significantly better than any single marker. CONCLUSIONS: CA125 remains the single best marker for the early detection of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer, but can be slightly improved by combining with other markers. Identifying novel markers for ovarian cancer will require studies including larger numbers of early-stage cases. Clin Cancer Res; 22(18); 4664-75.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations in serotonin (5-HT) metabolism have been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, previous reports regarding 5-HT metabolism in IBS are contradicting. AIM: To compare platelet poor plasma (PPP) 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) levels and their ratio in a large cohort of IBS patients and healthy controls (HC), including IBS-subgroup analysis. METHODS: Irritable bowel syndrome patients and HC were evaluated for fasting PPP 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels. Furthermore, GI-symptom diary, GSRS, quality of life, anxiety and depression scores were assessed in the 2 weeks before blood sampling. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty four IBS patients and 137 HC were included. No differences were detected in plasma 5-HT between groups. The 5-HIAA concentrations and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio were significantly lower in IBS compared to HC: 24.6 +/- 21.9 vs. 39.0 +/- 29.5 mug/L (P < 0.001) and 8.4 +/- 12.2 vs. 13.5 +/- 16.6 (P < 0.01), respectively. Subtype analysis for 5-HIAA showed all IBS subtypes to be significantly different from HC. The 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was significantly lower in the IBS-M subtype vs. HC. Linear regression analysis points to an influence of gender but not of GI-symptoms, psychological scores or medication use. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that fasting 5-HT plasma levels are not significantly different in IBS patients compared to controls. However, decreased 5-HIAA levels and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in IBS patients may reflect altered serotonin metabolism in IBS. Gender affects 5-HIAA levels in IBS patients, but no effects of drugs, such as SSRIs, or higher GI-symptom or psychological scores were found.},

The panel considered the nutritional and lifestyle advice that could be given by nurses relating to conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, vulnerability to common infections, elderly care, recurrent urinary tract infection, antibiotic use, and risk of type 2 diabetes. A general conclusion was the importance of motivational interviewing techniques in achieving full understanding of patients' concerns and to determine the best health strategy. As well as specific guidance appropriate for each disorder, a range of information sources for both health professionals and patients are listed in the paper. The panel noted that, although general nutritional advice can be given by nurses working at GP surgeries and in the community, patients should always be referred to registered dietitians or nutritionists if significant dietary changes are considered.},

   abstract = {This report summarises talks given at the 8th International Yakult Symposium, held on 23-24 April 2015 in Berlin. Two presentations explored different aspects of probiotic intervention: the small intestine as a probiotic target and inclusion of probiotics into integrative approaches to gastroenterology. Probiotic recommendations in gastroenterology guidelines and current data on probiotic efficacy in paediatric patients were reviewed. Updates were given on probiotic and gut microbiota research in obesity and obesity-related diseases, the gut-brain axis and development of psychobiotics, and the protective effects of equol-producing strains for prostate cancer. Recent studies were presented on probiotic benefit for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and people with HIV, as well as protection against the adverse effects of a short-term high-fat diet. Aspects of probiotic mechanisms of activity were discussed, including immunomodulatory mechanisms and metabolite effects, the anti-inflammatory properties of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the relationship between periodontitis, microbial production of butyrate in the oral cavity and ageing, and the pathogenic mechanisms of Campylobacter. Finally, an insight was given on a recent expert meeting, which re-examined the probiotic definition, advised on the appropriate use and scope of the term and outlined different probiotic categories and the prevalence of different mechanisms of activity.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The relationship between circulating prolactin and invasive breast cancer has been investigated previously, but the association between prolactin levels and in situ breast cancer risk has received less attention. METHODS: We analysed the relationship between pre-diagnostic prolactin levels and the risk of in situ breast cancer overall, and by menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) at blood donation. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess this association in a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, including 307 in situ breast cancer cases and their matched control subjects. RESULTS: We found a significant positive association between higher circulating prolactin levels and risk of in situ breast cancer among all women [pre-and postmenopausal combined, ORlog2=1.35 (95% CI 1.04-1.76), Ptrend=0.03]. No statistically significant heterogeneity was found between prolactin levels and in situ cancer risk by menopausal status (Phet=0.98) or baseline HT use (Phet=0.20), although the observed association was more pronounced among postmenopausal women using HT compared to non-users (Ptrend=0.06 vs Ptrend=0.35). In subgroup analyses, the observed positive association was strongest in women diagnosed with in situ breast tumors<4 years compared to >/=4 years after blood donation (Ptrend=0.01 vs Ptrend=0.63; Phet=0.04) and among nulliparous women compared to parous women (Ptrend=0.03 vs Ptrend=0.15; Phet=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Our data extends prior research linking prolactin and invasive breast cancer to the outcome of in situ breast tumours and shows that higher circulating prolactin is associated with increased risk of in situ breast cancer.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. This common disorder is managed by varying clinical styles as no dominant therapeutic strategy has emerged. The pathophysiology of IBS remains unknown, but several lines of evidence link this disorder with the gut microbiota. Although controversy exists, gut microbiota is likely contributing to symptoms of IBS, at least in some patients, through an altered fermentation process, an impaired intestinal barrier function, a harmful modulation of enteric sensorimotor function, a promotion of low-grade inflammation without tissue damage, and a harmful modulation of the brain-gut axis. Probiotic therapy has a modest effect on IBS symptomatic relief, but the actual evidence is not strong enough to support a general recommendation of use. The best results are achieved, in children, with Lactobacillus rhamnusus GG, which moderately improves abdominal pain, while in adults the benefit appears to be greatest employing Bifidobacterium species.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In healthy individuals, the absorption of fructose in excess of glucose in solution is enhanced by the addition of glucose. The present study aimed to assess the effects of glucose addition to fructose or fructans on absorption patterns and genesis of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with functional bowel disorders. METHODS: Randomised, blinded, cross-over studies were performed in healthy subjects and functional bowel disorder patients with fructose malabsorption. The area-under-the-curve (AUC) was determined for breath hydrogen and symptom responses to: (i) six sugar solutions (fructose in solution) (glucose; sucrose; fructose; fructose + glucose; fructan; fructan + glucose) and (ii) whole foods (fructose in foods) containing fructose in excess of glucose given with and without additional glucose. Intake of fermentable short chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs; fermentable, oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols) was controlled. RESULTS: For the fructose in solution study, in 26 patients with functional bowel disorders, breath hydrogen was reduced after glucose was added to fructose compared to fructose alone [mean (SD) AUC 92 (107) versus 859 (980) ppm 4 h-1 , respectively; P = 0.034). Glucose had no effect on breath hydrogen response to fructans (P = 1.000). The six healthy controls showed breath hydrogen patterns similar to those with functional bowel disorders. No differences in symptoms were experienced with the addition of glucose, except more nausea when glucose was added to fructose (P = 0.049). In the fructose in foods study, glucose addition to whole foods containing fructose in excess of glucose in nine patients with functional bowel disorders and nine healthy controls had no significant effect on breath hydrogen production or symptom response. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of a favourable response on symptoms does not support the concomitant intake of glucose with foods high in either fructose or fructans in patients with functional bowel disorders.},

   abstract = {The mucosal immune system (including airway, intestinal, oral and cervical epithelium) is an integrated network of tissues, cells and effector molecules that protect the host from environmental insults and infections at mucous membrane surfaces. Dysregulation of immunity at mucosal surfaces is thought to be responsible for the alarming global increase in mucosal inflammatory diseases such as those affecting the gastrointestinal (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome) and respiratory (asthma, allergy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder) system. Although immune regulation has been well-studied in isolated mucosal sites, the extent of the immune interaction between anatomically distant mucosal sites has been mostly circumstantial and the focus of much debate. With novel technology and more precise tools to examine histological and functional changes in tissues, today there is increased appreciation of the 'common mucosal immunological system' originally proposed by Bienenstock nearly 40 years ago. Evidence is amounting which shows that stimulation of one mucosal compartment can directly and significantly impact distant mucosal site, however the mechanisms are unknown. Today, we are only beginning to understand the complexity of relationships and communications that exist between different mucosal compartments. A holistic approach to studying the mucosal immune system as an integrated global organ is imperative for future advances in understanding mucosal immunology and for future treatment of chronic diseases. In this review, we particularly focus on the latest evidence and the mechanisms operational in driving the lung-gut cross-talk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abnormal gut barrier function is the basis of gut inflammatory disease. It is known that house dust mite (HDM) aero-allergens induce inflammation in respiratory mucosa. We have recently reported allergen from Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p1) to be present in rodent gut. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether Der p1 is present in human gut and to assess its effect on gut barrier function and inflammation. DESIGN: Colonic biopsies, gut fluid, serum and stool were collected from healthy adults during endoscopy. Der p1 was measured by ELISA. Effect of HDM was assessed on gut permeability, tight-junction and mucin expression, and cytokine production, in presence or absence of cysteine protease inhibitors or serine protease inhibitors. In vivo effect of HDM was examined in mice given oral HDM or protease-neutralised HDM. Role of HDM in low-grade inflammation was studied in patients with IBS. RESULTS: HDM Der p1 was detected in the human gut. In colonic biopsies from healthy patients, HDM increased epithelial permeability (p<0.001), reduced expression of tight-junction proteins and mucus barrier. These effects were associated with increased tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-10 production and were abolished by cysteine-protease inhibitor (p<0.01). HDM effects did not require Th2 immunity. Results were confirmed in vivo in mice. In patients with IBS, HDM further deteriorated gut barrier function, induced TNF-alpha but failed to induce IL-10 secretion (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HDM, a ubiquitous environmental factor, is present in the human gut where it directly affects gut function through its proteolytic activity. HDM may be an important trigger of gut dysfunction and warrants further investigation.},

However, this statement has not been validated yet. GOALS: The aim of this study was to assess whether prolonged left lower-quadrant pain is the best symptom characterizing SUDD and be able to differentiate SUDD from IBS-like symptoms in diverticulosis, and to compare the location of abdominal pain with fecal calprotectin (FC) expression. STUDY: Seventy-two patients suffering from abdominal pain and having diverticula at colonoscopy were enrolled. Patients were classified according to SUDD definition (abdominal pain for at least 24 consecutive hours in left lower abdomen) (42 patients) and IBS-like symptoms fulfilling Rome III criteria (30 patients). Abdominal pain was assessed using a 10-point visual scale, assigning numerical values from 0 (absence of pain) to 10 (severe pain). FC expression was assessed by a rapid test in all patients enrolled. RESULTS: FC test was positive in 27 (64.3%) patients in the SUDD group and in no patient in the IBS-like group (P<0.0001). In patients with SUDD, there was a significant correlation between the severity of the abdominal pain and the FC score (P=0.0015). Extension of diverticulosis correlated with FC score (P=0.022) and the severity of diverticulosis (P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Severe and prolonged left lower-abdominal pain seems to be the best symptom characterizing SUDD, and it can differentiate these patients from those harboring diverticula but suffering from IBS-like according to Rome III criteria.},

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2 states in the southern part of Nigeria in June 2014. Adolescents of age 10 to 18 years were recruited from 11 secondary schools using a stratified random sampling technique. A validated self-administered questionnaire on Rome III criteria for diagnosing AP-FGIDs and its determinants were filled by the participants in a classroom setting. RESULTS: A total of 874 participants filled the questionnaire. Of this, 818 (93.4%) filled it properly and were included in the final analysis. The mean age of the participants was 14.6 +/- 2.0 years with 409 (50.0%) being boys. AP-FGIDs were present in 81 (9.9%) participants. Forty six (5.6%) of the study participants had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 21 (2.6%) functional abdominal pain, 15 (1.8%) abdominal migraine while 3 (0.4%) had functional dyspepsia. The difference in AP-FGIDs between adolescents residing in rural and urban areas was not statistically significant (P = 0.22). Intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms occurred more frequently in those with AP-FGIDs. Nausea was the only symptom independently associated with AP-FGIDs (p = 0.015). Multiple regression analysis showed no significant association between stressful life events and AP-FGIDs. CONCLUSIONS: AP-FGIDs are a significant health problem in Nigerian adolescents. In addition to the intestinal symptoms, most of the affected children and others also had extraintestinal symptoms. None of the stressful life events evaluated was significantly associated with FGIDs.},

Treated groups received orally PSE (15 g/kgday), or AF-PSE (1.5 g/kgday), or pure soy Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI; 50 mg/kgday), starting 2 wk before colitis induction, and maintained for 9 days after. All treated groups showed intestinal anti-inflammatory effect, evidenced by reduced microscopic histological damage in comparison with untreated colitic mice. The treatments ameliorated the colonic mRNA expression of different proinflammatory markers: cytokines, inducible enzymes, metalloproteinases, adhesion molecules, and toll-like receptors, as well as proteins involved in maintaining the epithelial barrier function. Furthermore, the administration of PSE, AF-PSE, or soy BBI restored bacterial counts, partially or totally, to values in healthy mice. CONCLUSION: PSE and AF-PSE ameliorated DSS-induced damage to mice, their effects being due, at least partially, to the presence of active BBI.},

   abstract = {Twenty years ago, there was profound, international interest in developing oral human, bovine, or chicken egg-derived immunoglobulin (Ig) for the prevention and nutritional treatment of childhood malnutrition and gastrointestinal disease, including acute diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis. Although such Ig products were shown to be effective, with both nutritional and antidiarrheal benefits, interest waned because of their cost and because of the perceived risk of bovine serum encephalitis (BSE). BSE is no longer considered a barrier to use of oral Ig, because the WHO has declared the United States to be BSE-free since the early 2000s. Low-cost bovine-derived products with high Ig content have been developed and are regulated as medical foods. These new products, called serum bovine Igs (SBIs), facilitate the management of chronic or severe gastrointestinal disturbances in both children and adults and are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. Well-established applications for use of SBIs include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated enteropathy and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. However, SBIs and other similar products could potentially become important components of the treatment regimen for other conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, by aiding in disease control without immunosuppressive side effects. In addition, SBIs may be helpful in conditions associated with the depletion of circulating and luminal Igs and could potentially play an important role in critical care nutrition. The rationale for their use is to facilitate intraluminal microbial antibody coating, an essential process in immune recognition in the gut which is disturbed in these conditions, thereby leading to intestinal inflammation. Thus, oral Ig may emerge as an important "add-on" therapy for a variety of gastrointestinal and nutritional problems during the next decade.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although never evaluated for efficacy, n-3 (omega-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) are commercially offered as treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate, in a mast cell-dependent model for visceral hypersensitivity, whether this pathophysiologic mechanism can be reversed by dietary LCPUFA treatment via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) activation. METHODS: Maternally separated rats were subjected to hypersensitivity-inducing acute stress at adult age. Reversal was attempted by protocols with tuna oil-supplemented diets [4% soy oil (SO) and 3% tuna oil (SO-T3) or 3% SO and 7% tuna oil (SO-T7)] and compared with control SO diets (7% or 10% SO) 4 wk after stress. The PPARG agonist rosiglitazone was evaluated in a 1 wk preventive protocol (30 mg . kg(-)(1) . d(-)(1)). Erythrocytes were assessed to confirm LCPUFA uptake and tissue expression of lipoprotein lipase and glycerol kinase as indicators of PPARG activation. Colonic mast cell degranulation was evaluated by toluidine blue staining. In vitro, human mast cell line 1 (HMC-1) cells were pretreated with rosiglitazone, eicosapentaenoic acid, or docosahexaenoic acid, stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and calcium ionophore or compound 48/80 and evaluated for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and beta-hexosaminidase release. RESULTS: Stress led to visceral hypersensitivity in all groups. Hypersensitivity was not reversed by SO-T3 or control treatment [prestress vs. 24 h poststress vs. posttreatment area under the curve; 76 +/- 4 vs. 128 +/- 12 (P < 0.05) vs. 115 +/- 14 and 82 +/- 5 vs. 127 +/- 16 (P < 0.01) vs. 113 +/- 19, respectively]. Comparison of SO-T7 with its control showed similar results [74 +/- 6 vs. 103 +/- 13 (P < 0.05) vs. 115 +/- 17 and 66 +/- 3 vs. 103 +/- 10 (P < 0.05) vs. 117 +/- 11, respectively]. Erythrocytes showed significant LCPUFA uptake in the absence of colonic PPARG activation. Rosiglitazone induced increased PPARG target gene expression, but did not prevent hypersensitivity. Mast cell degranulation never differed between groups. Rosiglitazone and LCPUFAs significantly reduced PMA/calcium ionophore-induced TNF-alpha release but not degranulation of HMC-1 cells. CONCLUSION: Dietary LCPUFAs did not reverse stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity in maternally separated rats. Although further research is needed, claims concerning LCPUFAs as a treatment option in IBS cannot be confirmed at this point and should be regarded with caution.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A growing number of individuals reports symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in the absence of celiac disease. Yet the actual prevalence is not well established. METHODS: Between April 2015 and March 2016, unselected adults visiting marketplaces, dental practices and a university in The Netherlands were asked to complete a modified validated questionnaire for self-reported gluten sensitivity (srGS). RESULTS: Among the 785 adults enquired, two had celiac disease. Forty-nine (6.2%) reported symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food. These individuals were younger, predominantly female and lived more frequently in urban regions compared with the other respondents. Symptoms reported included bloating (74%), abdominal discomfort (49%) and flatulence (47%). A total of 23 (47%) srGS individuals reported having had tried a gluten-free or gluten-restricted diet. Abdominal discomfort related to fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP)-containing food was more often reported in srGS individuals compared with the other respondents (73.5% vs. 21.7%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Self-reported GS is common in The Netherlands, especially in younger individuals, females and urban regions, although the prevalence was lower than in a comparable recent UK study. It cannot be excluded that FODMAPs are in part responsible for these symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have increased postprandial symptom responses and more psychosocial morbidities than healthy individuals. However, the relationship between psychosocial status and postprandial symptom responses in patients with IBS is unclear. We investigated this relationship in a prospective study of patients with IBS. METHODS: A total of 193 IBS patients, diagnosed according to Rome II (n = 126) or Rome III (n = 67) criteria, consumed a standard breakfast (540 kcal: 36% fat, 15% proteins, 49% carbohydrates, and 8.9 g fiber). They completed visual analogue scales assessing the severity of 5 gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, gas, and fullness) before breakfast and every 30 minutes, up to 240 minutes after eating. All patients completed validated self-report questionnaires for their current levels of anxiety and depression; patients diagnosed based on Rome II criteria also completed a somatization questionnaire. The relationship between these variables and the course of gastrointestinal symptom scores over time was analyzed using linear mixed models, controlling for comorbid functional dyspepsia. RESULTS: We observed a main effect of anxiety levels on fullness and bloating (P < .04), and of depression levels on abdominal pain (P = .007), reflecting a general upward shift of the entire symptom curve. Depression-by-time interactions were seen for nausea and gas (P < .03). Somatization levels had a main effect on all 5 symptoms (P < .0001), independent of anxiety and depression. We observed somatization-by-time interaction effects for bloating (P = .005), and nausea (P = .02), and a nonsignificant trend was found for pain (P = .054), reflecting a steeper early postprandial increase in symptoms among subjects with higher levels of somatization. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a prospective study of patients with IBS, psychosocial morbidities are associated with increased levels of gastrointestinal symptoms in general. Depression and somatization levels are associated specifically with increased postprandial symptoms.},

STUDY DESIGN: The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 689 families. Patients had 1 of 7 physician-diagnosed GI disorders: chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The healthy control sample included 1114 families. School days missed, days in bed and needing care, parent missed workdays, work impact, and healthcare utilization were compared as well. RESULTS: Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrated lower HRQOL than the healthy controls across all dimensions (physical, emotional, social, and school; P < .001 for all), with larger effect sizes for patients with an FGID. Patients with an FGID manifested lower HRQOL than those with an organic GI disease. Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease missed more school, spent more days in bed and needing care, had greater healthcare utilization, and had parents who missed more workdays with greater work impact (P < .001 for most), with larger effect sizes for the patients with an FGID. CONCLUSION: Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrate impaired HRQOL compared with healthy children. HRQOL can be used as a common metric to compare patient outcomes in clinical research and practice both within and across groups of patients with FGIDs and organic GI diseases.},

Study objectives were to compare the gastrointestinal symptom profile of pediatric patients with functional constipation with matched healthy controls with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Gastrointestinal Worry Scales and to establish clinical interpretability in functional constipation through identification of minimal important difference (MID) scores. The secondary objective compared the symptom profile of patients with functional constipation with patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 116 pediatric patients with functional constipation and 188 parents. Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea were administered along with Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. A total of 341 families with healthy children and 43 families with patients with IBS completed the scales. RESULTS: A broad profile of gastrointestinal symptoms and worry were reported by patients with functional constipation in comparison with healthy controls (P < 0.001) with large effect sizes (>0.80) across the majority of symptom domains. Patients with IBS manifested a broader symptom profile than functional constipation, with differences for stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, and worry about stomachaches, with similar constipation scores. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with functional constipation report a broad gastrointestinal symptom profile in comparison with healthy controls and only somewhat fewer symptoms than patients with IBS, highlighting the critical need for more efficacious interventions to achieve healthy functioning.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the patient-reported multidimensional gastrointestinal symptoms predictors of generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in pediatric patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). METHODS: The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales and PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 259 pediatric patients with functional constipation, functional abdominal pain (FAP), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea were identified as clinically important symptom differentiators from healthy controls based on prior findings, and subsequently tested for bivariate and multivariate linear associations with overall HRQOL. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal symptoms were differentially associated with decreased HRQOL in bivariate analyses for the three FGIDs. In predictive models utilizing hierarchical multiple regression analyses controlling for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, gastrointestinal symptoms differentially accounted for an additional 47, 40, and 60 % of the variance in patient-reported HRQOL for functional constipation, FAP, and IBS, respectively, reflecting large effect sizes. Significant individual gastrointestinal symptoms predictors were identified after controlling for the other gastrointestinal symptoms in the FGID-specific predictive models. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms represent potentially modifiable predictors of generic HRQOL in pediatric patients with FGIDs. Identifying the condition-specific gastrointestinal symptoms that are the most important predictors from the patient perspective facilitates a patient-centered approach to targeted interventions designed to ameliorate impaired overall HRQOL.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder of uncertain etiology. Several studies have proposed the possible role of intestinal parasites in the pathogenesis of IBS. We aimed to summarize the epidemiological studies that describe a possible link between intestinal parasites and IBS, with special interest in endemic areas for intestinal parasitism such as South America. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted by using the keywords: irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal parasites, protozoan infection, soil-transmitted helminths and South America. Giardia lamblia may cause IBS symptoms that can persist several years after effective treatment. Dientamoeba fragilis can cause IBS-like symptoms, but low sensitive parasitological techniques may fail to detect it. Entamoeba histolytica can cause a chronic non-dysenteric colitis, but several studies have failed to find an association with IBS. The role of Blastocystis hominis in IBS remains controversial. In addition, epidemiological studies evaluating the effect of soil-transmitted helminths in IBS are scant. Symptoms elicited by intestinal parasites may resemble to those in IBS, especially in endemic areas such as South America, where both the prevalence of IBS and intestinal parasitism are high. Whether these organisms are the cause or contributing factors in IBS remains a subject of study. Routine parasitologicalexamination of stools in individuals who full-fit the criteria for IBS should be included upon initial assessment in endemic countries.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is insufficient data on diagnostic delay and associated factors in celiac disease (CeD) as well as on its potential impact on the course of disease. METHODS: Specifically taking its two components - patients' and doctors' delay - into account, we performed a large systematic patient survey study among unselected CeD patients in Switzerland. RESULTS: We found a mean/median total diagnostic delay of 87/24 months (IQR 5-96), with a range from 0 up to 780 months and roughly equal fractions of patients' and doctors' delay. Both mean/median total (93.1/24 vs. 60.2/12, p<0.001) and doctors' (41.8/3 vs. 23.9/2, p<0.001) diagnostic delay were significantly higher in female vs. male patients, whereas patients' delay was similar, regardless of preceding irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis. Patients with a diagnostic delay shorter than 2 years were significantly less often in need of steroids and/or immunosuppressants, substitution for any nutritional deficiency but more often free of symptoms 6 and 12 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial diagnostic delay in CeD, which is associated with a worse clinical outcome and significantly longer in female patients. This increased diagnostic delay in women is due to doctors' but not patients' delay and cannot be explained by antecedent IBS prior to establishing the CeD diagnosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is evidence that patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have a low degree of inflammation in the intestinal mucosa. The aim of the study was to evaluate the profile of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in plasma in Mexican pediatric patients with IBS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with IBS according to Rome III criteria for childhood and 15 healthy children, matched by age and sex, were included in the study. Plasma levels of tumoral necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukins 10 and 12 (IL-10, IL-12) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) were quantified and compared between groups. RESULTS: Plasma levels of IL-10 were lower in patients with IBS (86.07+21.3 pg/mL vs. 118.71+58.62 pg/mL: P=.045) and IL-12 levels were higher in patients with IBS compared to the control group of healthy children (1,204.2+/-585.9 pg/mL vs. 655.04+/-557.80 pg/mL; P=.011). The IL-10/IL-12 index was lower in patients with IBS (0.097+/-0.07 vs. 0.295+/-0.336; P=.025). Plasma concentration of TGF-beta was higher in patients with IBS (545.67+/-337.69 pg/mL vs. 208.48+/-142.21 pg/mL; P=.001). There was no difference in plasma levels of TNF-alpha between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that children with IBS have a state of altered immune regulation. This is consistent with the theory of low-grade inflammatory state in these patients. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role played by these cytokines, specifically TGF-beta in the pathogenesis of IBS.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet is one of the main drivers of the composition and function of the gut microbiota. The scope of this review is to summarize recent studies assessing the role of gut microbiota in clinical pediatric conditions and to review studies using nutritional approaches to favorably modify the gut microbiota to improve health outcomes in children. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies underscore that breastfeeding and infant diet impact the gut microbiome and metagenome. A comprehensive study using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, suggests that the cessation of breastfeeding rather than the introduction of solid foods, drives the functional maturation of the infant gut microbiome toward an adult-like state. There is further support for the view that a disturbed early gut microbiota is implicated in allergic and autoimmune diseases. New studies using prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in various pediatric disorders have yielded promising results, yet the evidence for specific guidelines on their use is still low. SUMMARY: Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with several pediatric disorders but a cause-effect relationship remains to be clearly demonstrated in most conditions. Future studies using new systems biology approaches are anticipated to provide further insight into the functional capacities of the gut microbiome and its establishment in childhood. This may then lay the ground for improved treatment and prevention strategies targeting the gut microbiota.},

   abstract = {Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is an undefined syndrome with gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal manifestations triggered by gluten in patients without celiac disease and wheat allergy. The pathogenesis involves immune-mediated mechanisms requiring further research. Symptoms disappear in a few hours or days after gluten withdrawal and recur rapidly after gluten ingestion. Besides gluten, other wheat proteins as well as fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) may contribute to this syndrome. This syndrome occurs mainly in young women, being rare in children. Its prevalence ranges from 0.6% to 6%, based on primary or tertiary care center estimates. No biomarker is available, but half of patients tests positive for IgG anti-gliadin antibodies, which disappear quickly after gluten-free diet together with symptoms. Also, genetic markers are still undefined. Although currently limited to a research setting, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial strategy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is based on dietary restriction with special care to nutrient intake.},

   abstract = {Improvements in colorectal cancer (CRC) detection and treatment have led to greater numbers of CRC survivors, for whom there is limited evidence on which to provide dietary guidelines to improve survival outcomes. Higher intake of red and processed meat and lower intake of fibre are associated with greater risk of developing CRC, but there is limited evidence regarding associations with survival after CRC diagnosis. Among 3789 CRC cases in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, pre-diagnostic consumption of red meat, processed meat, poultry and dietary fibre was examined in relation to CRC-specific mortality (n 1008) and all-cause mortality (n 1262) using multivariable Cox regression models, adjusted for CRC risk factors. Pre-diagnostic red meat, processed meat or fibre intakes (defined as quartiles and continuous grams per day) were not associated with CRC-specific or all-cause mortality among CRC survivors; however, a marginal trend across quartiles of processed meat in relation to CRC mortality was detected (P 0.053). Pre-diagnostic poultry intake was inversely associated with all-cause mortality among women (hazard ratio (HR)/20 g/d 0.92; 95 % CI 0.84, 1.00), but not among men (HR 1.00; 95 % CI 0.91, 1.09) (P for heterogeneity=0.10). Pre-diagnostic intake of red meat or fibre is not associated with CRC survival in the EPIC cohort. There is suggestive evidence of an association between poultry intake and all-cause mortality among female CRC survivors and between processed meat intake and CRC-specific mortality; however, further research using post-diagnostic dietary data is required to confirm this relationship.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Restriction of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) is an effective dietary treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patient dietary education is essential but labour intensive. Group FODMAP education may alleviate this somewhat but has not previously been investigated. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical effectiveness of low FODMAP group education in patients with IBS and to explore the cost of a group pathway. METHODS: Patients with IBS (n = 364) were assessed for their suitability to attend dietitian-led group education or traditional one-to-one education in a novel group pathway. Clinical effectiveness (global symptom question, symptom prevalence, stool output) were compared at baseline and follow-up using the chi-squared test. The costs of the novel group pathway were assessed using a decision model. RESULTS: The global symptom question indicated more patients were satisfied with their symptoms following dietary advice, in both group education [baseline 48/263 (18%) versus follow-up 142/263 (54%), P < 0.001] and one-to-one education [baseline 5/101 (5%) versus follow-up 61/101 (60%), P < 0.001], with no difference between group and one-to-one education at follow-up (P = 0.271). Overall, there was a significant decrease in symptom severity from baseline to follow-up (P < 0.001 for both groups) but no difference in symptom response between group and one-to-one education. The cost for the group education pathway for all 364 patients was pound31 713.36. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that dietitian-led FODMAP group education is clinically effective and the costs associated with a FODMAP group pathway are worthy of further consideration for routine clinical care.},

   abstract = {Treatments for functional constipation (FC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) differ, but symptom criteria do not reliably distinguish between them; some regard FC and IBS-C as parts of a single constipation spectrum. Our goal was to review studies comparing FC and IBS-C to identify possible biomarkers that separate them. A systematic review identified 15 studies that compared physiologic tests in FC vs IBS-C. Pain thresholds were lower in IBS-C than FC for 3/5 studies and not different in 2/5. Colonic motility was decreased more in FC than IBS-C for 3/3 studies, and whole gut transit was delayed more in FC than IBS-C in 3/8 studies and not different in 5/8. Pelvic floor dyssynergia was unrelated to diagnosis. Sympathetic arousal, measured in only one study, was greater in IBS-C than FC. The most reliable separation of FC from IBS-C was shown by a novel new magnetic resonance imaging technique described in this issue of the journal. These authors showed that drinking one liter of polyethylene glycol laxative significantly increased water content in the small intestine, volume of contents in the ascending colon, and time to first evacuation in FC vs IBS-C; and resulted in less colon motility and delayed whole gut transit in FC compared to IBS-C. Although replication is needed, this well-tolerated, non-invasive test promises to become a new standard for differential diagnosis of FC vs IBS-C. These data suggest that FC and IBS-C are different disorders rather than points on a constipation spectrum.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) costs the National Health Service almost pound12 million per annum. Despite national guidelines advising primary care management, these have failed to stem secondary care referrals of patients with likely IBS for unnecessary and costly assessment and investigation without necessarily achieving resolution of their symptoms. METHODS: In 2011, an integrated team from primary and secondary care developed a business case using baseline data to create a Somerset-wide IBS pathway using Clinical Commissioning Group funding. This provided face-to-face general practitioners (GP) education, developed a diagnostic pathway and funded faecal calprotectin (FC) testing to exclude inflammatory pathology for patients aged 16-45 years with likely IBS and no alarm symptoms. For those with FC</=50 mug/g, we provided a management algorithm and community-based dietetic treatment. Audit results measured usage and outcomes from FC testing, changes in patterns and costs of new patients reviewed in gastroenterology outpatients and dietetic IBS treatment outcomes. RESULTS: The proportion of new patient slots used reduced from 14.3% to 8.7% over 10 months while overall costs reduced by 25% for patients with no alarm symptoms and likely IBS aged 16-45 years. FC results confirmed research findings with no inflammatory pathology, if FC</=50 mug/g over 2 years. 63% of patients had satisfactory control of their IBS after specialist dietetic input with 74% reporting improved quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of GP education, providing diagnosis and management pathways, using FC to exclude inflammatory pathology and providing an effective treatment for patients with likely IBS appeared successful in our pilot. This proved cost-effective, reduced secondary care involvement and improved patient care.},

   abstract = {Plant leaves, harvesting light energy and fixing CO2, are a major source of foods on the earth. Leaves undergo developmental and physiological shifts during their lifespan, ending with senescence and death. We characterized the key regulatory features of the leaf transcriptome during aging by analyzing total- and small-RNA transcriptomes throughout the lifespan of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves at multidimensions, including age, RNA-type, and organelle. Intriguingly, senescing leaves showed more coordinated temporal changes in transcriptomes than growing leaves, with sophisticated regulatory networks comprising transcription factors and diverse small regulatory RNAs. The chloroplast transcriptome, but not the mitochondrial transcriptome, showed major changes during leaf aging, with a strongly shared expression pattern of nuclear transcripts encoding chloroplast-targeted proteins. Thus, unlike animal aging, leaf senescence proceeds with tight temporal and distinct interorganellar coordination of various transcriptomes that would be critical for the highly regulated degeneration and nutrient recycling contributing to plant fitness and productivity.},

Eighty-one IBS patients were randomly assigned to receive either probiotic mixture (n = 39; containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium breve, B. actis, B. longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus) or placebo (n = 42) for 4 weeks. A questionnaire regarding general symptom relief was administered. The change in total symptom scores (sum of 10 IBS symptoms) and subtotal scores in 4 domains (pain, constipation, diarrhea, and bloating/gas) were evaluated. The change in fecal flora was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The concentration of probiotic strains significantly increased after ingestion in probiotics group (B. bifidum, p = 0.043; B. lactis, p<0.001; L. acidophilus, p = 0.016; L. rhamnosus, p<0.001). The proportion of patients with adequate symptom relief was higher in probiotics group than in placebo group (74.4% vs 61.9%, p = 0.230). The decrease in total symptom score over time was not significantly different between the groups (p = 0.703). Among subtotal scores of 4 IBS symptom domains, the time effect was significantly different for diarrhea-symptom score between the groups (p = 0.017). A 4-week administration of multi-species probiotic mixture significantly increased the fecal concentration of most probiotic strains and improved diarrhea-symptom scores in IBS patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) are poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates that play an important role in inducing functional gut symptoms. A low-FODMAP diet improves abdominal symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. However, there were no study for the effect of FODMAP content on gastrointestinal intolerance and nutritional status in patients receiving enteral nutrition (EN). METHODS: In this randomized, multicenter, double-blind, 14-day clinical trial, eligible hospitalized patients receiving EN (n = 100) were randomly assigned to three groups; 84 patients completed the trial (low-FODMAP EN, n = 30; moderate-FODMAP EN, n = 28; high-FODMAP EN, n = 26). Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured; stool assessment was performed using the King's Stool Chart and clinical definition. RESULTS: Baseline values were not significantly different among the three groups. After the 14-day intervention, diarrhea significantly improved in the low-FODMAP group than in the moderate- and high-FODMAP groups (P < 0.05). King's Stool scores in diarrhea subjects were significantly and steadily reduced in the low-FODMAP group compared with the other two groups (P for time and EN type interaction <0.05). BMI increased significantly in the low- and high-FODMAP groups during the intervention (P < 0.05 for both), and showed a trend toward increasing in the moderate-FODMAP group (P < 0.10). Serum prealbumin increased significantly in all groups by 14-day; by 3-day, it had increased to the levels at 14-day in the low-FODMAP group. At 14-day, serum transferrin had increased significantly in the moderate-FODMAP group. In addition, subjects were classified by final condition (unimproved, normal maintenance, diarrhea only improved, constipation only improved, and recurrent diarrhea/constipation improved). Seventy-five percent of the diarrhea improved group consumed the low-FODMAP EN formula. 38.5 and 46.2% of recurrent diarrhea/constipation improved group consumed the low- and moderate-FODMAP EN respectively. BMI significantly increased in all groups except the unimproved. Prealbumin levels significantly increased in the diarrhea-improved and recurrent diarrhea/constipation groups at 3-day and continued by 14-day, and in the constipation-improved group at 14-day. Transferrin levels significantly increased in the diarrhea-improved and recurrent diarrhea/constipation groups at 14-day. CONCLUSION: Low-FODMAP EN may improve diarrhea, leading to improved nutritional status and facilitating prompt recovery from illness.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a common tear film and ocular surface disease that results in discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. Systemic diseases associated with DES include diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, anxiety, thyroid disease, allergic diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pain syndrome, and hyperlipidemia. Interestingly, it has been found that most of these are associated with low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) or inadequate sunlight exposure. METHODS: In this cross-sectional data analysis, noninstitutionalized adults aged >/=19 years (N = 17,542) who participated in Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2012 were included. Information regarding duration of sunlight exposure was collected from the survey participants. Serum 25(OH)D and zinc levels were measured. The confounding variables were age, gender, sunlight exposure time, region of residence, obesity, serum 25(OH)D level, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, thyroid disorder, atopic dermatitis, history of ocular surgery, regular exercise, and walking exercise. RESULTS: Mean serum 25(OH)D levels of subjects with and without DES were 16.90 +/- 6.0 and 17.52 +/- 6.07 (p<0.001). Inadequate sunlight exposure time (odds ratio [OR], 1.554; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.307-1.848), urban residence (OR, 1.669; 95% CI, 1.456-1.913), indoor occupation (OR, 1.578; 95% CI, 1.389-1.814), and low serum 25(OH)D level (OR, 1.158; 95% CI, 1.026-1.308) were the risk factors for DES. After adjusting for age, sex, obesity, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, thyroid disorder, atopic dermatitis, history of ocular surgery, regular exercise, and occupation, low serum 25(OH)D level (OR, 1.178; 95% CI, 1.010-1.372) and deficient sunlight exposure time (OR, 1.383; 95% CI, 1.094-1.749) were the risk factors for diagnosed DES. CONCLUSION: Low serum 25(OH)D levels and inadequate sunlight exposure are associated with DES in Korean adults. These results suggest that sufficient sunlight exposure or vitamin D supplementation may be useful in DES treatment.},

   abstract = {Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are predominantly distributed in both somatic and visceral sensory nervous systems and play a crucial role in sensory transduction. As the largest visceral organ system, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract frequently accommodates external inputs, which stimulate sensory nerves to initiate and coordinate sensory and motor functions in order to digest and absorb nutrients. Meanwhile, the sensory nerves in the GI tract are also able to detect potential tissue damage by responding to noxious irritants. This nocifensive function is mediated through specific ion channels and receptors expressed in a subpopulation of spinal and vagal afferent nerve called nociceptor. In the last 18 years, our understanding of TRP channel expression and function in GI sensory nervous system has been continuously improved. In this review, we focus on the expressions and functions of TRPV1, TRPA1, and TRPM8 in primary extrinsic afferent nerves innervated in the esophagus, stomach, intestine, and colon and briefly discuss their potential roles in relevant GI disorders.},

AIMS: To determine the prevalence of FGIDs in school-aged children in El Salvador. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 395 children participated in the study (one public school and one private school). School children completed the Spanish version of the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III (QPGS-III), an age-appropriate and previously validated instrument for diagnosing FGIDs according to the Rome III criteria. Sociodemographic (age, sex, type of school) and familial (family structure and size, family history of gastrointestinal disorders) data were obtained. RESULTS: The mean age of the sample was 11.8 years +/- 1.6 SD (median 10, range 8-15) and 59% of the participants were female. Eighty-one children met the diagnostic criteria for a FGID (20%). Defecation disorders were the most common group of FGIDs. Functional constipation was diagnosed in 10% of the children and 9.25% were diagnosed with abdominal pain-related FGIDs (most commonly IBS, 3.75%). IBS overlapped with functional dyspepsia in 11% of the cases. Children with FGIDs frequently reported nausea. Children attending private school and older children had significantly more FGIDs than children in public school and younger children. CONCLUSIONS: FGIDs are common in school-aged Salvadoran children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Polyphenols are plant secondary metabolites with a large variability in their chemical structure and dietary occurrence that have been associated with some protective effects against several chronic diseases. To date, limited data exist on intake of polyphenols in populations. The current cross-sectional analysis aimed at estimating dietary intakes of all currently known individual polyphenols and total intake per class and subclass, and to identify their main food sources in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. METHODS: Dietary data at baseline were collected using a standardized 24-h dietary recall software administered to 36,037 adult subjects. Dietary data were linked with Phenol-Explorer, a database with data on 502 individual polyphenols in 452 foods and data on polyphenol losses due to cooking and food processing. RESULTS: Mean total polyphenol intake was the highest in Aarhus-Denmark (1786 mg/day in men and 1626 mg/day in women) and the lowest in Greece (744 mg/day in men and 584 mg/day in women). When dividing the subjects into three regions, the highest intake of total polyphenols was observed in the UK health-conscious group, followed by non-Mediterranean (non-MED) and MED countries. The main polyphenol contributors were phenolic acids (52.5-56.9 %), except in men from MED countries and in the UK health-conscious group where they were flavonoids (49.1-61.7 %). Coffee, tea, and fruits were the most important food sources of total polyphenols. A total of 437 different individual polyphenols were consumed, including 94 consumed at a level >1 mg/day. The most abundant ones were the caffeoylquinic acids and the proanthocyanidin oligomers and polymers. CONCLUSION: This study describes the large number of dietary individual polyphenols consumed and the high variability of their intakes between European populations, particularly between MED and non-MED countries.},

   abstract = {Incidence rates of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (TC) have increased in many countries. Adiposity and dietary risk factors may play a role, but little is known on the influence of energy intake and macronutrient composition. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between TC and the intake of energy, macronutrients, glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. The study included 477,274 middle-age participants (70.2% women) from ten European countries. Dietary data were collected using country-specific validated dietary questionnaires. Total carbohydrates, proteins, fats, saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (PUFA), starch, sugar, and fiber were computed as g/1,000 kcal. Multivariable Cox regression was used to calculate multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) by intake quartile (Q). After a mean follow-up time of 11 years, differentiated TC was diagnosed in 556 participants (90% women). Overall, we found significant associations only with total energy (HRQ4 vs .Q1 , 1.29; 95% CI, 1.00-1.68) and PUFA intakes (HRQ4 vs .Q1 , 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.95). However, the associations with starch and sugar intake and GI were significantly heterogeneous across body mass index (BMI) groups, i.e., positive associations with starch and GI were found in participants with a BMI >/= 25 and with sugar intake in those with BMI < 25. Moreover, inverse associations with starch and GI were observed in subjects with BMI < 25. In conclusion, our results suggest that high total energy and low PUFA intakes may increase the risk of differentiated TC. Positive associations with starch intake and GI in participants with BMI >/= 25 suggest that those persons may have a greater insulin response to high starch intake and GI than lean people.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Seventy percent of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) identify certain foods as triggers for their symptom flare-ups. To help identify potential trigger foods, practitioners often rely on patient food and gastrointestinal (GI) symptom journaling. The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and usability of a novel food and symptom journal app, specifically designed for patients with IBS. Secondary aims were to explore the effect of using the app on GI symptoms and to describe associations between diet and GI symptoms suggested by individual patient data. METHODS: The feasibility and usability of the novel app was studied in 11 IBS patients (8 women), aged 21-65 years. Participants were asked to log GI symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation) using a 100-point color-graded sliding scale (green=none, red=severe) four times a day and to log every meal/snack they ate (at least three times a day) over a 2-week period. The app's feasibility as a data collection tool was evaluated by daily completion, compliance, data hoarding, and fatigability rates. Usability was evaluated with the System Usability Scale (SUS). To explore potential impact of using the app on bowel distress, we compared before and after intervention IBS-Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) scores. Meal entries were analyzed for nutrients using the Nutrition Data System for Research. Regression analyses were conducted for each participant journal to explore relationships between meal nutrients and subsequent GI symptoms. RESULTS: Daily average completion rates of the minimum requested entries for meal and GI symptoms were 112+/-47% and 78+/-44%, respectively. Average 24-h compliance rates were 90+/-19% and 94+/-12%, respectively. The SUS score was above average (mean 83, range 65-97.5; n=10). Most participants did not have a clinically significant decrease in IBS-SSS. At least one strong association (P</=0.05) between GI symptoms and a meal nutrient was found in 73% of participants. The mean number of associations was 2 (range 0-7; n=11). Patterns of associations differed between individual participants. CONCLUSIONS: Our app appeared to be a feasible and usable tool for IBS patients. Our findings are in line with anecdotes that most IBS patients have food triggers and that these vary by individual. Future studies can explore whether individualized dietary changes guided by an app can result in IBS symptom improvement.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paper food and gastrointestinal (GI) symptom journals are used to help irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients determine potential trigger foods. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, usability, and clinical utility of such journals as a data collection tool. A secondary aim was to explore a method for analyzing journal data to describe patterns of diet and symptoms. METHODS: Participants (N=17) were asked to log three sets of 3-day food and symptom journals over a 15-day period. Feasibility was evaluated by journal completion rates, symptom logging compliance, and logging fatigability. The feasibility, usability, and clinical utility of journaling were also assessed by a customized evaluation and exit interview. For each journal, regression analyses were conducted to examine relationships between key meal nutrients and subsequent symptoms. KEY RESULTS: Most participants were young (mean age 35+/-12) Caucasian (N=13) women (N=14). Journal completion rates were 100% for all participants with no logging fatigability. Over half perceived paper journaling of food and symptoms as feasible, usable, and clinically useful. Thirteen participants demonstrated a strong association with at least one symptom and meal nutrient. Patterns of associations differed among participants. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Paper journaling of food and GI symptoms for 9 days over a 15-day period appeared to be a feasible and usable data collection tool for IBS patients. Over half perceived journaling as at least somewhat clinically useful. Findings from this study support the anecdote that food trigger(s) and associated symptom(s) vary for each individual.},

This model of diet was developed by a multidisciplinary team from the Monash University in Melbourne and became well-known after the publication of a study in 2008 showing that dietary FODMAPs acted as causing factors in patients with IBS. Since then there have been several randomized controlled trials which, although with small sample sizes, have again shown the benefits of this dietary pattern.},
