   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This preliminary study aimed to investigate the effects of the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii on proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in patients with diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). The other objectives were to document any clinical improvement as judged by symptoms, quality of life, and histology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial in which S. boulardii, 750 mg/day, or placebo was administered for 6 weeks in IBS-D patients, in addition to ispaghula husk standard treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients received S. boulardii and 35 patients received the placebo. As compared with placebo, the S. boulardii group showed a significant decrease in blood and tissue levels of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P<0.001) and an increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels, as well as an increase in the tissue IL-10/IL-12 ratio (P<0.001). No significant change in the blood and tissue levels of cytokines was found in the placebo group. Bowel-related IBS-D symptoms reported in the patients' daily diary improved in both groups. However, overall improvement in the quality of life was more marked in the S. boulardii group. Although baseline histological findings were mild, an improvement was observed in the probiotic group in the lymphocyte and neutrophil infiltrates (P=0.017 and 0.018), epithelial mitosis (P=0.003), and intraepithelial lymphocytes (P=0.024). No serious adverse events were found in either group. CONCLUSION: S. boulardii with ispaghula husk was superior to placebo with ispaghula husk in improving the cytokine profile, histology, and quality of life of patients with IBS-D. These preliminary results need to be confirmed in a well-powered trial.},

The condition is characterized by both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms that respond to gluten withdrawal. Most of the symptoms are subjective and for many years such patients remain in a diagnostic dilemma. Although symptomalogy is similar to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), NCGS is now regarded as a distinct clinical entity. However, the disease pathology is not well elucidated and our knowledge of NCGS is still very rudimentary. This review highlights the importance of this new clinical entity, outlines its pathological mechanisms and suggests a diagnostic algorithm for its management.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate therapeutic potential of the immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based elimination diet among migraine patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). BACKGROUND: Food elimination has been suggested as an effective and inexpensive therapeutic strategy in patients with migraine and concomitant IBS in the past studies. METHODS: A total of 21 patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 38.0 [11.2] years; 85.7% females) diagnosed with migraine and IBS were included in this double-blind, randomized, controlled, cross-over clinical trial composed of baseline (usual diet), first diet (elimination or provocation diets), and second diet (interchange of elimination or provocations diets) phases and 4 visits. RESULTS: IgG antibody tests against 270 food allergens revealed mean (standard deviation) reaction count to be 23.1 (14.1). Compared with baseline levels, elimination diet per se was associated with significant reductions in attack count (4.8 [2.1] vs 2.7 [2.0]; P < .001), maximum attack duration (2.6 [0.6] vs. 1.4 [1.1] days; P < .001), mean attack duration (1.8 [0.5] vs. 1.1 [0.8] days; P < .01), maximum attack severity (visual analog scale 8.5 [1.4] vs. visual analog scale 6.6 [3.3]; P < .001), and number of attacks with acute medication (4.0 [1.5] vs. 1.9 [1.8]; P < .001). There was a significant reduction in pain-bloating severity (1.8 [1.3] vs. 3.2 [0.8]; P < .05), pain-bloating within the last 10 days (3.2 [2.8] vs. 5.5 [3.1]; P < .05), and improvement obtained in quality of life (3.6 [1.4] vs. 2.9 [1.0]; P < .05) by the elimination diet as compared with provocation diet. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that food elimination based on IgG antibodies in migraine patients who suffer from concomitant IBS may effectively reduce symptoms from both disorders with possible positive impact on the quality of life of the patients as well as potential savings to the health-care system.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reports suggest that gluten sensitivity (GS) exists in the absence of coeliac disease (CD). This clinical entity has been termed noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). OBJECTIVES: To determine the population prevalence of self-reported GS and referral characteristics to secondary care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A UK population-based questionnaire screened for GS and related symptoms. Diagnostic outcomes were also analyzed in patients referred to secondary care with GS. CD diagnosis entailed a positive coeliac serology (endomysial and/or tissue transglutaminase antibodies) plus Marsh 1-3 on duodenal biopsies. NCGS diagnosis was based on exclusion of CD. Clinical comparisons were made between NCGS and CD. RESULTS: A total of 1002 adults in the population (female 55%, mean age 39 years). The self-reported prevalence for GS was 13% (female 79%, mean age 39.5 years, P<0.0001), with 3.7% consuming a gluten-free diet and 0.8% known to have a doctor diagnosis of CD. Individuals with GS had an increased prevalence of fulfilling the Rome III criteria for irritable bowel syndrome, in comparison with those without GS (20 vs. 3.89%, odds ratio 6.23, P<0.0001).In secondary care 200 GS patients (female 84%, mean age 39.6 years) were investigated, in whom 7% were found to have CD and 93% to have NCGS. All CD patients were human leucocyte antigen DQ2 or DQ8 positive compared with 53% of NCGS cases (P=0.0003). Nutritional deficiencies (P</=0.003), autoimmune disorders (23.1 vs. 9.7%, P=0.0001) and a lower mean BMI (23.7 vs. 25.8, P=0.001) were significantly associated with CD compared with NCGS. CONCLUSION: GS is commonly self-reported with symptoms suggesting an association with irritable bowel syndrome. The majority of patients have NCGS, an entity which demonstrates clinical and immunologic difference to CD.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disease characterized by abdominal pain and altered intestinal habits. The pathophysiology of IBS remains unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated that some IBS patients, especially in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), display persistent signs of minor mucosal inflammation and a modified intestinal microflora. The mesalazine has known intestinal anti-inflammatory properties. Saccharomyces boulardii is a probiotic used for a long time in treatment of diarrhea, including infectious diarrhea. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effects of mesalazine alone, combined therapy of mesalazine with liophylised Saccharomyces boulardii or alone on symptoms of IBS-D patients. METHODS: Based on Rome III criteria, 53 IBS-D patients (18 year or more) were included. To exclude organic diseases all patients underwent colonoscopy, stool culture, serum anti-endomisium antibody, lactose tolerance test and ova and parasite exam. Patients were divided in three groups: mesalazine group (MG) - 20 patients received mesalazine 800 mg t.i.d. for 30 days; mesalazine and Saccharomyces boulardii group (MSbG) - 21 patients received mesalazine 800 mg t.i.d. and Saccharomyces boulardii 200 mg t.i.d. for 30 days and; Saccharomyces boulardii group (SbG) - 12 patients received Sb 200 mg t.i.d. for 30 days. Drugs that might have any effect on intestinal motility or secretion were not allowed. Symptom evaluations at baseline and after treatment were performed by means of a 4-point likert scale including: stool frequency, stool form and consistency (Bristol scale), abdominal pain and distension. Paired t test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, there were statistically significant reduction of symptom score after 30 th day therapy in all three groups: MG (P<0.0001); MSbG (P<0.0001) and in SbG (P = 0.003). There were statistically significant differences in the symptom score at 30 th day therapy of the MG, MSbG and SbG groups (P = 0.03). There were no statistical differences between MSbG and MG symptom score at 30th day therapy (P = 0.9). CONCLUSIONS: The use of mesalazine alone, Saccharomyces boulardii alone or combined treatment with mesalasine and Saccaromyces boulardii improved IBS-D symptoms. The improvement of the symptom score was greater with mesalazine alone or combined with Sb as compared with Sb treatment alone. These preliminary results suggest that mezalazine may be useful in treatment of IBS-d patients, and warrant further larger studies.},

A leading theory proposes that wartime exposures initiated prolonged production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and central nervous system injury. The endogenous antioxidant L-carnosine (B-alanyl-L-histidine) is a potential treatment since it is a free radical scavenger in nervous tissue. To determine if nutritional supplementation with L-carnosine would significantly improve pain, cognition and fatigue in GWI, a randomized double blind placebo controlled 12 week dose escalation study involving 25 GWI subjects was employed. L-carnosine was given as 500, 1000, and 1500 mg increasing at 4 week intervals. Outcomes included subjective fatigue, pain and psychosocial questionnaires, and instantaneous fatigue and activity levels recorded by ActiWatch Score devices. Cognitive function was evaluated by WAIS-R digit symbol substitution test. Carnosine had 2 potentially beneficial effects: WAIS-R scores increased significantly, and there was a decrease in diarrhea associated with irritable bowel syndrome. No other significant incremental changes were found. Therefore, 12 weeks of carnosine (1500 mg) may have beneficial cognitive effects in GWI. Fatigue, pain, hyperalgesia, activity and other outcomes were resistant to treatment.},

Many of the current medications used to treat this disorder have distinct properties such as efficacy for different symptoms, safety profiles, contraindications, costs, dosing regimens, treatment duration and long-term data. All of these factors, in addition to patient preference and cognitive, food and environmental triggers, must be considered prior to any medication selection. This review will focus on randomized controlled trials with a general uniformity in study design, a rigorous patient selection and appropriate treatment durations. We will also discuss other exciting emerging treatments for IBS such as the micro-opioid receptor (agonists and antagonists), selective kappa-opioid receptor agonists, anti-inflammatory drugs, serotonergic agents, bile acid modulators and intestinal bile acid transporters, which may prove promising in treating our patients.},

   abstract = {The Monash University low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet is now accepted as an effective strategy for managing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in Australia, with interest expanding across the world. These poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates have been shown to induce IBS symptoms of diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, and flatus due to their poor absorption, osmotic activity, and rapid fermentation. Four clinical trials have been published to date, all with significant symptomatic response to the low FODMAP diet. Up to 86% of patients with IBS have achieved relief of overall gastrointestinal symptoms and, more specifically, bloating, flatus, abdominal pain, and altered bowel habit from the approach. This review provides an overview of the low FODMAP diet and summarizes the research to date, emerging concepts, and limitations. FODMAPs are known to be beneficial to bowel health; the importance of this and how this should be considered in the clinical management of IBS is also discussed. A clinical management flowchart is provided to assist nutrition professionals in the use of this approach.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In Australia, faecal incontinence, the involuntary loss of liquid or solid stool with or without a person's awareness, has been reported in 8% of the South Australian and 11% of the urban New South Wales community-dwelling populations. Studies conducted in 2004 and 2005 reported faecal incontinence in more than 20% of colorectal and urogynaecological clinic patients at Townsville Hospital (a referral centre serving rural North Queensland). This prompted concern regarding the level of faecal incontinence in the community. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of faecal incontinence in the North and Far North Queensland urban and rural communities. METHODS: The sample size was based on the New South Wales postal surveys (11% prevalence). Higher rates were expected in North/Far North Queensland, so prevalence there was estimated at 12.1% (confidence interval +/- 2%, ie the true level to be between 10.1% and 14.1%). The sample for each of the Townsville, Cairns (in Far North Queensland) and rural/remote settings was calculated at 1022. The database for the present study was compiled using a systematic randomised process selecting two private names from each column on each page of the Cairns and Townsville White Pages(R) (Cairns: 1112 urban, 481 rural, 226 remote; Townsville: 1049 urban, 432 rural, 320 remote). The questionnaire covered personal demographics, health/risk factors, bowel habits, nutrition (fibre and fluid intake) and physical activity. Faecal incontinence was defined as accidental leakage of solid or liquid stool in the past 12 months that was not caused by a virus, medication or contaminated food. To improve the response rate a participation incentive of a chance to win a $250 voucher or one of ten $50 vouchers was offered in the initial mail-out. The initial survey was mailed out in July 2007; two follow-up surveys were mailed out to non-responders in September 2007 and January 2008. One hundred randomly selected non-responders were telephoned in February 2008. RESULTS: A total of 1523 responses provided a 48.1% response rate. Faecal incontinence prevalence was 12.7% (174/1366) with no gender or locality differences. Prevalence increased significantly with age in men (p=0.034), but not in women. Only 10 respondents with faecal incontinence consulted their doctor in the previous year for this reason. Incontinent respondents had significantly more medical conditions including urinary incontinence, coeliac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, injury to the anus, bowel cancer, spinal cord disease, neurological disease and psychiatric problems (all, p< 0.05). Stool-related accidental bowel leakage including faecal incontinence (defined), soiling with flatus or urgency, was 18.2%. An additional 3% were possibly incontinent, having disclosed leakage of mucus, bothersome or passive staining. Of the remaining respondents, 16.2% reported incontinent episodes due to an acute illness, 22.9% could not always differentiate between flatus and stool, and only 35.2% reported neither concerns with nor accidental bowel leakage. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high level of untreated faecal incontinence in North/Far North Queensland communities. Demand for treatment will increase because of the ageing population and the expectations of younger, more assertive cohorts.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dyspepsia and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are perhaps one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases universally. The prevalence of dyspepsia ranges from 7-40% while the prevalence of IBS ranges between 3-22% in population based studies worldwide. AIM: This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence, socio-demographic and lifestyle associated risk factors of Dyspepsia and IBS among medical college students of urban Delhi, Northern India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: It is a cross-sectional study and was carried out from January to March 2014 at Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 210 students from a Medical College were asked to complete a semi-structured questionnaire based on identification and socio-demographic data, questions pertaining to lifestyle and Rome III criteria. RESULTS: Of the valid 200 subjects, 90(45%) were males and 110(55%) were females, with a mean age of 20.43+/- 1.05 y. Majority of the subjects (diagnosed with uninvestigated dyspepsia and IBS) were in the age group of 18-20 y with female gender having higher odds for both. The prevalence of dyspepsia was 18% while that of IBS was 16.5%.Consumption of fatty food, cigarettes and low physical activity were observed as most significant correlates. CONCLUSION: Rome III criteria enables symptom based diagnosis of dyspepsia and IBS.The prevalence of dyspepsia and IBS in college students from Delhi is observed to be higher. Association with lifestyle related factors highlights the importance of modifications in their prevention.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE. Meta-analyses have indicated effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, few long-term trials have been conducted and uncertainty remains as to effectiveness and long-term effect in a primary care setting. We aimed to investigate the effect of probiotics compared with placebo in the management of IBS in primary care during a 6-month treatment period and with a 6-month follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS. We randomized IBS patients fulfilling Rome III criteria to receive two capsules twice daily either containing placebo or a probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium Bb12 in an amount of 1.3 x 10(10) CFU per capsule. Primary endpoint was proportion of responders defined as patients reporting adequate relief (AR) at least 50% of the time in the 6-month treatment period. Secondary outcomes were proportions of patients reporting AR at different time points, and change in gastrointestinal symptoms and health-related quality of life (HrQOL) from baseline to 6 and 12 months. RESULTS. A total of 131 patients were included in this study. The proportion of responders in the treatment period was 52% (35/67) in the probiotic group versus 41% (26/64) in the placebo group, p = 0.18. Overall we found no difference between the groups in change in gastrointestinal symptoms after treatment. Patients improved in HrQOL, but with no statistically significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION. During a 6-month treatment period, we were not able to detect a positive effect of probiotic when compared with placebo.},

To investigate the precision of the fructose breath test (FBT) as compared with symptom score reduction on fructose-reduced diet (FRD) in a cohort of patients with Rome II defined irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). DESIGN: IBS patients diagnosed according to the Rome II criteria and with no organic gastrointestinal disease were enrolled. The patients were randomized in an open study design with a 2 week run-in on IBS diet, followed by 4 weeks w/wo additional FRD. FBT was performed in all patients. Dairy registrations of stool frequency and consistency as well as abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating on a visual analog scale (VAS) were performed during the whole study. RESULTS: A total of 182 subjects performed the study according to protocol (88 FRD, 94 controls). The VAS symptom registration performed well in validation procedures, whereas stool data showed less impressive characteristics. FRD improved symptom scores (abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating) significantly whereas no changes were observed in the control group. The effect of FRD on the stool frequency was modest but no effect was observed on the stool consistency. The FBT did not discriminate between patients with and without effect of FRD, and even in the group with a negative FBT significant improvement of symptom scores was observed. CONCLUSION: VAS measures yield reliable symptom evaluation in dairy registrations of IBS. FRD improves symptom scores in IBS patients independent of results from the FBT.},

   abstract = {Background: Nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), occurring in patients without celiac disease yet whose gastrointestinal symptoms improve on a gluten-free diet (GFD), is largely a self-reported diagnosis and would appear to be very common. The aims of this study were to characterize patients who believe they have NCGS. Materials and Methods: Advertising was directed toward adults who believed they had NCGS and were willing to participate in a clinical trial. Respondents were asked to complete a questionnaire about symptoms, diet, and celiac investigation. Results: Of 248 respondents, 147 completed the survey. Mean age was 43.5 years, and 130 were women. Seventy-two percent did not meet the description of NCGS due to inadequate exclusion of celiac disease (62%), uncontrolled symptoms despite gluten restriction (24%), and not following a GFD (27%), alone or in combination. The GFD was self-initiated in 44% of respondents; in other respondents it was prescribed by alternative health professionals (21%), dietitians (19%), and general practitioners (16%). No celiac investigations had been performed in 15% of respondents. Of 75 respondents who had duodenal biopsies, 29% had no or inadequate gluten intake at the time of endoscopy. Inadequate celiac investigation was common if the GFD was initiated by self (69%), alternative health professionals (70%), general practitioners (46%), or dietitians (43%). In 40 respondents who fulfilled the criteria for NCGS, their knowledge of and adherence to the GFD were excellent, and 65% identified other food intolerances. Conclusions: Just over 1 in 4 respondents self-reporting as NCGS fulfill criteria for its diagnosis. Initiation of a GFD without adequate exclusion of celiac disease is common. In 1 of 4 respondents, symptoms are poorly controlled despite gluten avoidance.},

We investigated the specific effects of gluten after dietary reduction of fermentable, poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates (fermentable, oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols [FODMAPs]) in subjects believed to have NCGS. METHODS: We performed a double-blind cross-over trial of 37 subjects (aged 24-61 y, 6 men) with NCGS and irritable bowel syndrome (based on Rome III criteria), but not celiac disease. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given a 2-week diet of reduced FODMAPs, and were then placed on high-gluten (16 g gluten/d), low-gluten (2 g gluten/d and 14 g whey protein/d), or control (16 g whey protein/d) diets for 1 week, followed by a washout period of at least 2 weeks. We assessed serum and fecal markers of intestinal inflammation/injury and immune activation, and indices of fatigue. Twenty-two participants then crossed over to groups given gluten (16 g/d), whey (16 g/d), or control (no additional protein) diets for 3 days. Symptoms were evaluated by visual analogue scales. RESULTS: In all participants, gastrointestinal symptoms consistently and significantly improved during reduced FODMAP intake, but significantly worsened to a similar degree when their diets included gluten or whey protein. Gluten-specific effects were observed in only 8% of participants. There were no diet-specific changes in any biomarker. During the 3-day rechallenge, participants' symptoms increased by similar levels among groups. Gluten-specific gastrointestinal effects were not reproduced. An order effect was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In a placebo-controlled, cross-over rechallenge study, we found no evidence of specific or dose-dependent effects of gluten in patients with NCGS placed diets low in FODMAPs.},

   abstract = {Data are accumulating that emphasize the important role of the intestinal barrier and intestinal permeability for health and disease. However, these terms are poorly defined, their assessment is a matter of debate, and their clinical significance is not clearly established. In the present review, current knowledge on mucosal barrier and its role in disease prevention and therapy is summarized. First, the relevant terms 'intestinal barrier' and 'intestinal permeability' are defined. Secondly, the key element of the intestinal barrier affecting permeability are described. This barrier represents a huge mucosal surface, where billions of bacteria face the largest immune system of our body. On the one hand, an intact intestinal barrier protects the human organism against invasion of microorganisms and toxins, on the other hand, this barrier must be open to absorb essential fluids and nutrients. Such opposing goals are achieved by a complex anatomical and functional structure the intestinal barrier consists of, the functional status of which is described by 'intestinal permeability'. Third, the regulation of intestinal permeability by diet and bacteria is depicted. In particular, potential barrier disruptors such as hypoperfusion of the gut, infections and toxins, but also selected over-dosed nutrients, drugs, and other lifestyle factors have to be considered. In the fourth part, the means to assess intestinal permeability are presented and critically discussed. The means vary enormously and probably assess different functional components of the barrier. The barrier assessments are further hindered by the natural variability of this functional entity depending on species and genes as well as on diet and other environmental factors. In the final part, we discuss selected diseases associated with increased intestinal permeability such as critically illness, inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease, food allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, and--more recently recognized--obesity and metabolic diseases. All these diseases are characterized by inflammation that might be triggered by the translocation of luminal components into the host. In summary, intestinal permeability, which is a feature of intestinal barrier function, is increasingly recognized as being of relevance for health and disease, and therefore, this topic warrants more attention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antibiotic self medication is highly prevalent in the developing countries due to easy availability and poor regulatory controls for selling these drugs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of self-medication with antibiotics for the treatment of various diseases by the peoples of Rajshahi city in Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted to the patient's (n = 1300) at eight locations of Rajshahi city in Bangladesh from March to April, 2014. The locations were selected by convenience and the study population within each study area was randomly selected. The survey was self-administered and included questions pertaining to self medicated drugs and antibiotic usage patterns as well. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: It was found that 347 (26.69%) out of 1300 participants experienced self medication with antibiotics. Over fifty percent of the patients studied were between the ages of 21-30 years with 83.57% of them being males and 16.43% females. The highest percentage of self medicated antibiotics was metronidazole (50.43%) followed by azithromycin (20.75%), ciprofloxacin (11.53%), amoxicillin (10.37%) and tetracycline (7.49%) respectively. The key reasons for the self medication of antibiotics was the pre-experience (45.82%), suggestions from others (28.24%) and knowledgeable of the antibiotics (16.14%). The perceived symptoms to purchase the antibiotics independently was dysentery, diarrhea and food poisoning (36.02%), cold, cough and fever (28.24%), infection (12.97%), dental carries and toothache (9.22%), irritable bowel syndrome (3.46%), acne (4.32%), ear and throat pain (2.31%). The duration of maximum antibiotics usage was ranges between 0-10 years. Only 4.32% patient's used self medicated antibiotics longer than 10 years. The patient's compliance for self medication of antibiotics varies from excellent to no comments whereas only 6.92% patients reported side effects for the self medication of antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirm that antibiotic self-medication is a relatively frequent problem in Bangladesh. Drug Administration of Bangladesh should implement the regulatory controls immediately on the distribution and selling of antibiotics in order to reduce the frequency of antibiotic misuse.},

   abstract = {Food intolerance is a common complaint amongst patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGIDs), including those with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease. Although there has been a longstanding interest in the possible role of food allergy in IBS, there are limited data supporting the association. However, the prevalence of food allergy is sufficiently high that patients with FGID may also have food allergies or hypersensitivities. Food intolerances or sensitivities are reactions to foods, which are not due to immunological mechanisms. Lactose intolerance is common in the general population and can mimic symptoms of FGID or coexist with FGID. As discussed in other articles in this series, other carbohydrate intolerances may be responsible for symptom generation in patients with IBS and perhaps other FGIDs. There is a great interest in the role of a major dietary protein, gluten, in the production of symptoms that are very similar to those of patients with celiac disease without the enteropathy that characterizes celiac disease. Emerging research into a syndrome known as nonceliac gluten sensitivity suggests a heterogeneous condition with some features of celiac disease but often categorized as FGIDs, including IBS. This article summarizes the role of dietary proteins in the symptoms and pathophysiology of FGIDs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food and diet are central issues that concern patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Few studies have thoroughly analyzed dietary intake in IBS. Our aims were to determine the nutrient intake in IBS patients in comparison to the general population, assess nutritional differences between IBS subgroups based on the predominant bowel habit or symptom severity, as well as to evaluate if their nutrient intake meet nutrition recommendations. METHODS: We included 187 IBS patients (mean 40.2 years; 139 women). They completed a 4-days food registration record, which was compared with an age-, and gender-matched control group (n = 374; 278 women) from a nation-wide dietary survey and with Nordic Nutrient Recommendations. KEY RESULTS: Daily nutrient intake in IBS patients was similar to the general population and met national nutrients recommendations. Irritable bowel syndrome patients had similar energy distribution from macronutrients compared to the control group, but the protein percentage tended to be higher. Irritable bowel syndrome patients also had significantly higher daily intake of vitamin E, folate, iron, vitamin C, and dietary fibers, as well as lower intake of vitamin A, riboflavin, calcium, and potassium. There was no association between nutrient intake and IBS subtypes or symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Although many IBS patients state that they avoid food items, this does not seem to influence their intake of nutrients to any large extent. The observed minor differences in nutrient intake indicate a tendency toward higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of meat and dairy products in IBS patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Despite the fact that food and diet are central issues, that concern patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the current understanding about the association between the intake of certain foods/food groups and the gastrointestinal (GI) symptom pattern, psychological symptoms, and quality of life is poor. The aim of this study was to determine which food groups and specific food items IBS patients report causing GI symptoms, and to investigate the association with GI and psychological symptoms and quality of life. METHODS: We included 197 IBS patients (mean age 35 (18-72) years; 142 female subjects) who completed a food questionnaire in which they specified symptoms from 56 different food items or food groups relevant to food intolerance/allergy. The patients also completed questionnaires to assess depression and general anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression), GI-specific anxiety (Visceral Sensitivity Index), IBS symptoms (IBS-Severity Scoring System), somatic symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-15), and quality of life (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life Questionnaire). RESULTS: In all, 84% of the studied population reported symptoms related to at least one of the food items surveyed. Symptoms related to intake of food items with incompletely absorbed carbohydrates were noted in 138 (70%) patients; the most common were dairy products (49%), beans/lentils (36%), apple (28%), flour (24%), and plum (23%). Of these, 58% experienced GI symptoms from foods rich in biogenic amines, such as wine/beer (31%), salami (22%), and cheese (20%). Histamine-releasing foods, such as milk (43%), wine/beer (31%), and pork (21%), were also considered causes of symptoms in IBS patients. GI symptoms were also frequently reported after intake of fried and fatty foods (52%). With increasing IBS symptom severity, patients reported more food items responsible for their GI symptoms (P=0.004), and this was also found in patients with more severe somatic symptoms (P<0.0001). Women tended to report more food items causing symptoms than men (P=0.06). A high number of food items causing GI symptoms was also associated with reduced quality of life and this was significant for the following domains: sleep (r=-0.25; P=0.001), energy (r=-0.21; P=0.005), food (r=-0.29; P<0.001), social functioning (r=-0.23; P=0.001), and physical status (r=-0.16; P<0.05). However, the number of food items reported to provoke GI symptoms was unrelated to body mass index, age, IBS subtype, anxiety, depression, or GI-specific anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of IBS patients believe that certain food items are important triggers of their GI symptoms. This is especially true for foods containing carbohydrates and fat, and also may be relevant for histamine-releasing food items and foods rich in biogenic amines. Self-reported food intolerance is associated with high symptom burden and reduced quality of life.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is a natural reservoir of microbiota. The gut is germ-free at birth, but rapidly becomes host to various bacteria establishing a progressively mutual relationship. The composition of gut microbiota is individual-specific and depends on the genotype of the host and environmental factors. Novel techniques have been used to characterize gastrointestinal microbiota, including genomic approaches. The bacterial profile shows that dominant and minor phyla are present in the gastrointestinal tract. From the proximal to the distal segments of the gut the bacterial density gradually increases, reaching an estimated 10(11) to 10(12) bacteria per gram of colonic content. Dynamic interactions between gut and microbiota play a physiological role in metabolic, protective and structural functions, while dysbiosis contributes to several diseases. Microbiota appear to play a role in IBS, where qualitative and quantitative changes of bacteriaoccur in IBS subtypes. Initial therapeutic approaches in IBS have focused on microbiota. The relationship between perturbations of the microbiota, mucosal inflammation and IBS remains to be further investigated.},

   abstract = {There is increasing evidence that host-microbe interactions play a key role in maintaining homeostasis. Alterations in gut microbial composition is associated with marked changes in behaviors relevant to mood, pain and cognition, establishing the critical importance of the bi-directional pathway of communication between the microbiota and the brain in health and disease. Dysfunction of the microbiome-brain-gut axis has been implicated in stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Bacterial colonization of the gut is central to postnatal development and maturation of key systems that have the capacity to influence central nervous system (CNS) programming and signaling, including the immune and endocrine systems. Moreover, there is now expanding evidence for the view that enteric microbiota plays a role in early programming and later response to acute and chronic stress. This view is supported by studies in germ-free mice and in animals exposed to pathogenic bacterial infections, probiotic agents or antibiotics. Although communication between gut microbiota and the CNS are not fully elucidated, neural, hormonal, immune and metabolic pathways have been suggested. Thus, the concept of a microbiome-brain-gut axis is emerging, suggesting microbiota-modulating strategies may be a tractable therapeutic approach for developing novel treatments for CNS disorders.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, the efficacy of probiotics has received considerable attention in the treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In this regard, a symbiotic mixture (Probinul((R))) has shown beneficial effects. The aim of this study was to extend the previously published 4-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of this symbiotic mixture. METHODS: This is an open-label prospective, partially controlled, 6-month extension period pilot study in which patients continued to receive the symbiotic mixture (Group 1) or were switched from placebo to symbiotic mixture (Group 2) using cyclic administration (last 2 weeks/month). The primary endpoints were the overall satisfactory relief of bloating and flatulence (assessed as proportions of responders). The secondary endpoints were evaluation of the symptom severity scores (bloating, flatulence, pain and urgency) and bowel function scores (frequency, consistency and incomplete evacuation). RESULTS: Twenty-six IBS patients completed the 6-month extension period (13 patients in Group 1 and 13 patients in Group 2). In the per-protocol analysis, the proportions of responders across time were not significantly different in the groups but in Group 2, there was an increased percentage of responders for flatulence (p = 0.07). In addition, the score of flatulence was reduced significantly during the 6-month treatment period in Group 2 (p < 0.05), while no other significant differences were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with this symbiotic mixture was associated with persistence of relief from flatulence or new reduction in flatulence in the present 6-month long extension study. These results need to be more comprehensively assessed in large, long-term, randomized, placebo-controlled studies.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses the structural composition of intestinal microbiota, the functional relationship between the latter and the host, and the role of abnormal microflora in chronic diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: A more complete view of the gut microbiota is being developed following the Human Microbiome Project. The microflora in children is plastic, susceptible to changes in response to diet modifications, antibiotic treatment and other events, providing the opportunity to study its functional role. Increasing evidence highlights the role of nutrition in the age-related development of microflora. Eubiosis, that is, a normal microflora structure, provides protection against infections, educates the immune system, ensures tolerance to foods, and contributes to nutrient digestion and energy harvest. Changes in microflora, consisting in the overpresence of harmful species or underpresence of commensal species, or dysbiosis produce dysfunctions, such as intestinal inflammation or dysmotility. Moreover abnormal pattern of microflora have been consistently detected in specific diseases. SUMMARY: A relationship exists between eubiosis and functions and conversely between dysbiosis and dysfunctions or even diseases. Abnormalities in microflora composition may trigger or contribute to specific diseases. This raises the hypothesis to target microflora in order to restore eubiosis through the use of antibiotics, probiotics or nutrients.},

   abstract = {Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the main pathogenic factor for upper digestive tract organic diseases. In addition to direct cytotoxic and proinflammatory effects, H. pylori infection may also induce abnormalities indirectly by affecting the brain-gut axis, similar to other microorganisms present in the alimentary tract. The brain-gut axis integrates the central, peripheral, enteric and autonomic nervous systems, as well as the endocrine and immunological systems, with gastrointestinal functions and environmental stimuli, including gastric and intestinal microbiota. The bidirectional relationship between H. pylori infection and the brain-gut axis influences both the contagion process and the host's neuroendocrine-immunological reaction to it, resulting in alterations in cognitive functions, food intake and appetite, immunological response, and modification of symptom sensitivity thresholds. Furthermore, disturbances in the upper and lower digestive tract permeability, motility and secretion can occur, mainly as a form of irritable bowel syndrome. Many of these abnormalities disappear following H. pylori eradication. H. pylori may have direct neurotoxic effects that lead to alteration of the brain-gut axis through the activation of neurogenic inflammatory processes, or by microelement deficiency secondary to functional and morphological changes in the digestive tract. In digestive tissue, H. pylori can alter signaling in the brain-gut axis by mast cells, the main brain-gut axis effector, as H. pylori infection is associated with decreased mast cell infiltration in the digestive tract. Nevertheless, unequivocal data concerning the direct and immediate effect of H. pylori infection on the brain-gut axis are still lacking. Therefore, further studies evaluating the clinical importance of these host-bacteria interactions will improve our understanding of H. pylori infection pathophysiology and suggest new therapeutic approaches.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Diets high in saturated and trans fat and low in unsaturated fat may increase type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk, but studies on foods high in fat per unit weight are sparse. We assessed whether the intake of vegetable oil, butter, margarine, nuts and seeds and cakes and cookies is related to incident T2D. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A case-cohort study was conducted, nested within eight countries of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC), with 12,403 incident T2D cases and a subcohort of 16,835 people, identified from a cohort of 340,234 people. Diet was assessed at baseline (1991-1999) by country-specific questionnaires. Country-specific hazard ratios (HRs) across four categories of fatty foods (nonconsumers and tertiles among consumers) were combined with random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: After adjustment not including body mass index (BMI), nonconsumers of butter, nuts and seeds and cakes and cookies were at higher T2D risk compared with the middle tertile of consumption. Among consumers, cakes and cookies were inversely related to T2D (HRs across increasing tertiles 1.14, 1.00 and 0.92, respectively; P-trend <0.0001). All these associations attenuated upon adjustment for BMI, except the higher risk of nonconsumers of cakes and cookies (HR 1.57). Higher consumption of margarine became positively associated after BMI adjustment (HRs across increasing consumption tertiles: 0.93, 1.00 and 1.12; P-trend 0.03). Within consumers, vegetable oil, butter and nuts and seeds were unrelated to T2D. CONCLUSIONS: Fatty foods were generally not associated with T2D, apart from weak positive association for margarine. The higher risk among nonconsumers of cakes and cookies needs further explanation.},

   abstract = {The human gut is a huge complex ecosystem where microbiota, nutrients, and host cells interact extensively, a process crucial for the gut homeostasis and host development with a real partnership. The various bacterial communities that make up the gut microbiota have many functions including metabolic, barrier effect, and trophic functions. Hence, any dysbiosis could have negative consequences in terms of health and many diseases have been associated to impairment of the gut microbiota. These close relationships between gut microbiota, health, and disease, have led to great interest in using probiotics (i.e. live micro-organisms), or prebiotics (i.e. non-digestible substrates) to positively modulate the gut microbiota to prevent or treat some diseases. This review focuses on probiotics, their mechanisms of action, safety, and major health benefits. Health benefits remain to be proven in some indications, and further studies on the best strain(s), dose, and algorithm of administration to be used are needed. Nevertheless, probiotic administration seems to have a great potential in terms of health that justifies more research.},

   abstract = {After a short overview of the history of probiotics, the author presents the development of human intestinal microflora based on the newest genetic data and the microbiological features of main probiotics. The indications of probiotic administration have been defined and extended in recent years. The author reviews significant results of probiotic treatment in some gastrointestinal diseases based on meta-analytical data. Probiotics are useful in preventing and treating diarrhoea caused by antibiotics and Clostridium difficile caused diarrhoea. In the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, preparations containing certain Lactobacillus,Bifidobacterium strains or Saccaromyces boulardii could enhance by 5-10% the rate of successful eradication and reduce the incidence and severity of the side effects. Some symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and thus the quality of life can be improved by probiotics. Their beneficial effect in ulcerative colitis was proven, while in Crohn's disease has not yet been defined. The use of probiotics is not included in guidelines, with the exception of the Maastricht IV/Florence consensus. For each disease it is advisable to use probiotics containing strains only with proven beneficial effect. The efficiency of preparations containing mixed strains has not yet been properly investigated. The author reviews the rare but potentially serious side effects of probiotics. In Hungary, there are many probiotic preparations available which can be purchased in pharmacies without prescription: their use is more empirical than evidence-based. The European Food Safety Authority has recently rejected claims for probiotics to be classed as medicines given the lack of convincing evidence on the effects of probiotics on human health and well-being. Clearly, further research is needed to collect evidence which could be incorporated into the international guidelines.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to test in a double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled study the effects of a commercially available multi-strain symbiotic mixture on symptoms, colonic transit and quality of life in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients who meet Rome III criteria. BACKGROUND: There is only one other double-blinded RCT on a single-strain symbiotic mixture in IBS. METHODS: This is a double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled study of a symbiotic mixture (Probinul, 5 g bid) over 4 weeks after 2 weeks of run-in. The primary endpoints were global satisfactory relief of abdominal flatulence and bloating. Responders were patients who reported at least 50 % of the weeks of treatment with global satisfactory relief. The secondary endpoints were change in abdominal bloating, flatulence, pain and urgency by a 100-mm visual analog scale, stool frequency and bowel functions on validated adjectival scales (Bristol Scale and sense of incomplete evacuation). Pre- and post-treatment colonic transit time (Metcalf) and quality of life (SF-36) were assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-four IBS patients (symbiotic n = 32, 64 % females, mean age 38.7 +/- 12.6 years) were studied. This symbiotic mixture reduced flatulence over a 4-week period of treatment (repeated-measures analysis of covariance, p < 0.05). Proportions of responders were not significantly different between groups. At the end of the treatment, a longer rectosigmoid transit time and a significant improvement in most SF-36 scores were observed in the symbiotic group. CONCLUSIONS: This symbiotic mixture has shown a beneficial effect in decreasing the severity of flatulence in IBS patients, a lack of adverse events and a good side-effect profile; however, it failed to achieve an improvement in global satisfactory relief of abdominal flatulence and bloating. Further studies are warranted.},

   abstract = {It is unknown whether children with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders identify specific foods that exacerbate their GI symptoms. The objectives of this study were to determine the perceived role of food on GI symptoms and to determine the impact of food-induced symptoms on quality of life (QOL) in children with functional GI disorders. Between August and November 2010, 25 children ages 11 to 17 years old with functional GI disorders and a parent completed a food symptom association questionnaire and validated questionnaires assessing FGID symptoms and QOL. In addition, children completed a 24-hour food recall, participated in focus groups to identify problematic foods and any coping strategies, and discussed how their QOL was affected. Statistical analyses were conducted using chi2, t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank, and Spearman's rho. Children identified a median of 11 (range=2 to 25) foods as exacerbating a GI symptom, with the most commonly identified foods being spicy foods, cow's milk, and pizza. Several coping strategies were identified, including consuming smaller portions, modifying foods, and avoiding a median of 8 (range=1 to 20) foods. Children reported that food-induced symptoms interfered with school performance, sports, and social activities. Although the parent's assessment of their child's QOL negatively correlated with the number of perceived symptom-inducing foods in their child, this relationship was not found in the children. Findings suggest that specific foods are perceived to exacerbate GI symptoms in children with functional GI disorders. In addition, despite use of several coping strategies, food-induced symptoms can adversely impact children's QOL in several important areas.},

The aims of our study were to: 1) evaluate the frequency of FH in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like clinical presentation; and 2) compare the diagnostic accuracy of two different methods of in vitro basophil activation tests. METHODS: Three hundred and five patients (235 females, age range 18-66 years) were included and underwent a diagnostic elimination diet and successive double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) challenges. Two different methods of in vitro basophil activation tests (BAT) (CD63 expression after in vitro wheat or cow's milk proteins stimulation) were evaluated: one was performed on separated leukocytes, and the other on whole blood. RESULTS: Ninety patients of the 305 studied (29.5%) were positive to the challenges and were diagnosed as suffering from FH. BAT on separate leukocytes showed a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 91% in FH diagnosis. BAT on whole blood showed a sensitivity of 15%-20% and a specificity of 73% in FH diagnosis (p<0.0001 compared to the other method). CONCLUSIONS: About one third of the IBS patients included in the study were suffering from FH and were cured on the elimination diet. The BAT based on CD63 detection on whole blood samples did not work in FH diagnosis and showed a significantly lower sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy than the assay based on separated leukocytes.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) is a newly described clinical entity characterized by symptoms, which can involve the gastrointestinal tract, the nervous system, the skin, and other organs. There is little data on the pathogenesis of NCWS and it is probable that different pathogenic mechanisms are involved in the different clinical manifestations of the disease. The only common denominator of NCWS "syndrome" is wheat consumption: the symptoms disappear on exclusion of wheat from the diet, and reappear on wheat consumption. The objective of this study was to review our prior data regarding NCWS and to review relevant medical literature regarding NCWS, with particular attention to the hypothesis that NCWS patients could suffer from non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated wheat allergy. METHODS: We reviewed our data on 276 patients diagnosed with NCWS by means of double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) wheat challenge. The data indicating a possible wheat allergy diagnosis were examined and other data in the literature were reviewed; we review the role of serum immunoglobulin G antibodies and the basophil activation assay in food allergy, and the histology findings in the food allergy diagnosis. RESULTS: The comparison between patients suffering from NCWS and presenting with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and controls with IBS not due to NCWS showed that NCWS was characterized by: a personal history of food allergy in the pediatric age (0.01), coexistent atopic diseases (0.0001), positive serum anti-gliadin (0.0001) and anti-betalactoglobulin (0.001) antibodies, positive cytofluorimetric assay revealing in vitro basophil activation by food antigens (0.0001), and a presence of eosinophils in the intestinal mucosa biopsies (0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NCWS and multiple food sensitivity show several clinical, laboratory, and histological characteristics that suggest they might be suffering from non-IgE-mediated food allergy. However, other pathogenic mechanisms need to be considered.},

No data are available on the prevalence of low bone mass density (BMD) in NCWS. Our study aims to evaluate the prevalence of low BMD in NCWS patients and search for correlations with other clinical characteristics. METHODS: This prospective observation study included 75 NCWS patients (63 women; median age 36 years) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms, 65 IBS and 50 celiac controls. Patients were recruited at two Internal Medicine Departments. Elimination diet and double-blind placebo controlled (DBPC) wheat challenge proved the NCWS diagnosis. All subjects underwent BMD assessment by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA), duodenal histology, HLA DQ typing, body mass index (BMI) evaluation and assessment for daily calcium intake. RESULTS: DBPC cow's milk proteins challenge showed that 30 of the 75 NCWS patients suffered from multiple food sensitivity. Osteopenia and osteoporosis frequency increased from IBS to NCWS and to celiac disease (CD) (P <0.0001). Thirty-five NCWS patients (46.6%) showed osteopenia or osteoporosis. Low BMD was related to low BMI and multiple food sensitivity. Values of daily dietary calcium intake in NCWS patients were significantly lower than in IBS controls. CONCLUSIONS: An elevated frequency of bone mass loss in NCWS patients was found; this was related to low BMI and was more frequent in patients with NCWS associated with other food sensitivity. A low daily intake of dietary calcium was observed in patients with NCWS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the potential role of probiotics and antimicrobials for management of functional bowel disorders (FBDs), with a focus on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Relevant adult data were identified via PubMed, with additional references obtained by reviewing bibliographies from selected articles. RESULTS: Probiotic treatment involves colonizing the intestines with beneficial microorganisms, whereas antimicrobial therapy involves modulation of the bacterial load and/or host response. A meta-analysis reported that all probiotic species evaluated improved flatulence compared with placebo; some, but not all, species improved abdominal pain and abdominal bloating/distension; and no species evaluated improved stool frequency or consistency, straining during stool evacuation, sense of incomplete evacuation, or fecal urgency. Two additional meta-analyses reported that probiotics significantly improved overall IBS symptoms. Individual studies have demonstrated potential benefits of probiotics for functional constipation symptoms. The nonsystemic antimicrobials neomycin and rifaximin have been evaluated in patients with IBS and other FBDs. Neomycin may improve global IBS symptoms and provide bowel normalization versus placebo, but the risk of ototoxicity and the development of clinically relevant bacterial resistance may limit its use for recurrent symptoms. In phase 3 randomized studies, rifaximin-treated patients were significantly more likely than placebo-treated patients to achieve adequate relief of global IBS symptoms and abdominal bloating. Although preliminary data suggest that development of clinically relevant bacterial resistance is unlikely with rifaximin, prospective data are needed, and a phase 3 study is ongoing. Limitations of evidence for probiotics include small populations analyzed and lack of clarity in optimal dosing regimen; antimicrobial evidence would benefit from better understanding of the effects of repeated treatment in patients with IBS. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics and nonsystemic antibiotics have a place in IBS management. Additional studies are needed to establish optimal regimens and identify subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from these therapies.},

   abstract = {Non Celiac Gluten sensitivity (NCGS) was originally described in the 1980s and recently a "re-discovered" disorder characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, in subjects that are not affected with either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). Although NCGS frequency is still unclear, epidemiological data have been generated that can help establishing the magnitude of the problem. Clinical studies further defined the identity of NCGS and its implications in human disease. An overlap between the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and NCGS has been detected, requiring even more stringent diagnostic criteria. Several studies suggested a relationship between NCGS and neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly autism and schizophrenia. The first case reports of NCGS in children have been described. Lack of biomarkers is still a major limitation of clinical studies, making it difficult to differentiate NCGS from other gluten related disorders. Recent studies raised the possibility that, beside gluten, wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors and low-fermentable, poorly-absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates can contribute to symptoms (at least those related to IBS) experienced by NCGS patients. In this paper we report the major advances and current trends on NCGS.},

   abstract = {Various disease states are associated with an imbalance of protective and pathogenic bacteria in the gut, termed dysbiosis. Current evidence reveals that dietary factors affect the microbial ecosystem in the gut. Changes to community structure of the intestinal microbiota are not without consequence considering the wide effects that the microbes have on both local and systemic immunity. The goal of this review is to give insight into the importance of gut microbiota in disease development and the possible therapeutic interventions in clinical settings. We introduce the complex tripartite relationship between diet, microbes and the gut epithelium. This is followed by a summary of clinical evidence of diet-induced dysbiosis as a contributing factor in the development of gastrointestinal diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome and colorectal cancer, as well as systemic diseases like obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Finally, the current dietary and microbial interventions to promote a healthy microbial profile will be reviewed.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common in the society. Among the putative pathogeneses, gut dysmotility results in pain and disturbed defecation. The latter is probably caused by the effect of abnormal gut water secretion. The interaction between abnormal gas accumulation, abdominal pain and bloating remains controversial. Visceral hypersensitivity and its modification along with the central transmission are the characteristics of IBS patients. The identification of biologic markers based on genetic polymorphisms is undetermined. Imbalanced gut microbiota may alter epithelial permeability to activate nociceptive sensory pathways which in turn lead to IBS. Certain food constituents may exacerbate bowel symptoms. The impact of adult and childhood abuses on IBS is underestimated. Using the concept of biopsychosocial dysfunction can integrate multidimensional pathogeneses. Antispasmodics plus stool consistency modifiers to treat the major symptoms and defecation are the first-line drug treatment. New drugs targeting receptors governing bowel motility, sensation and secretion can be considered, but clinicians must be aware of their potential serious side effects. Psychiatric drugs and modalities may be the final options for treating intractable subjects. Probiotics of multi-species preparations are safe and worth to be considered for the treatment. Antibiotics are promising but their long-term safety and effectiveness are unknown. Diet therapy including exclusion of certain food constituents is an economic measure. Using relatively safe complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) may be optional to those patients who failed classical treatment. In conclusion, IBS is a heterogeneous disorder with multidimensional pathogeneses. Personalized medicines with multidisciplinary approaches using different classes of drugs, psychiatric measures, probiotics and antibiotics, dietary therapy, and finally CAMs, can be considered.},

There is, however, a growing body of evidence of stress-induced corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) release causing bowel dysfunction through multiple pathways, either through the HPA axis, the autonomic nervous systems, or directly on the bowel itself. In addition, recent findings of CRF influencing the composition of gut microbiota lend support for the use of probiotics, antibiotics, and other microbiota-altering agents as potential therapeutic measures in stress-induced bowel dysfunction.},

   abstract = {Certain randomized, placebo-controlled trials of oral supplementation with B. infantis 35624 have demonstrated the amelioration of symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Potential GI colonization by B. infantis 35624 or effects of supplementation on resident GI microbiota may pertain to these clinical observations. In this study, fecal excretion of B. infantis 35624 before, during and after 8 weeks of daily treatment was compared in subjects with IBS who received either the encapsulated oral supplement (n = 39) or placebo (n = 37) and in healthy subjects who received the supplement (n = 41). Secondarily, changes in assessed fecal microbiota and IBS symptoms were determined. Supplementation significantly increased fecal B. infantis 35624 excretion vs. placebo in IBS subjects; excretion in healthy subjects receiving supplement was quantitatively similar. Fecal levels of the probiotic declined and approached baseline once dosing ceased, documenting that colonization is transient. Although supplementation increased numbers of B infantis 35624 within the GI tract, limited changes in 10 other fecal taxa were observed either in healthy subjects or those with IBS. No impact on IBS symptoms was observed. Detection of bacterial DNA in fecal samples suggests that the probiotic is able to survive transit through the GI tract, although strain selective culture techniques were not performed to confirm viability of B. infantis 35624 in the feces. Continuous probiotic administration was necessary to maintain steady-state transit. Given the complex spectrum of GI microbiota, however, monitoring perturbations in selected taxa may not be not a useful indicator of probiotic function.},

   abstract = {Ghrelin is a 28-amino-acid peptide that plays multiple roles in humans and other mammals. The functions of ghrelin include food intake regulation, gastrointestinal (GI) motility, and acid secretion by the GI tract. Many GI disorders involving infection, inflammation, and malignancy are also correlated with altered ghrelin production and secretion. Although suppressed ghrelin responses have already been observed in various GI disorders, such as chronic gastritis, Helicobacter pylori infection, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, and cachexia, elevated ghrelin responses have also been reported in celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Moreover, we recently reported that decreased fasting and postprandial ghrelin levels were observed in female patients with functional dyspepsia compared with healthy subjects. These alterations of ghrelin responses were significantly correlated with meal-related symptoms (bloating and early satiation) in female functional dyspepsia patients. We therefore support the notion that abnormal ghrelin responses may play important roles in various GI disorders. Furthermore, human clinical trials and animal studies involving the administration of ghrelin or its receptor agonists have shown promising improvements in gastroparesis, anorexia, and cancer. This review summarizes the impact of ghrelin, its family of peptides, and its receptors on GI diseases and proposes ghrelin modulation as a potential therapy.},

   abstract = {Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are characterized by the presence of chronic or recurrent symptoms that are felt to originate from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which cannot be attributed to an identifiable structural or biochemical cause. Food is associated with symptom onset or exacerbation in a significant proportion of FGID patients. Despite this, the role of food in the pathogenesis of the FGIDs has remained poorly understood. For this reason, diet has largely played an adjunctive rather than a primary role in the management of FGID patients. In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion in our understanding of the role of food in GI function and sensation and how food relates to GI symptoms in FGID patients. In a series of evidence-based manuscripts produced by the Rome Foundation Working Group on the role of food in FGIDs, comprehensive reviews of the physiological changes associated with nutrient intake, and the respective roles of carbohydrates, fiber, protein, and fats are provided. The series concludes with a manuscript that provides guidance on proper clinical trial design when considering the role of food in FGIDs.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder in children and adults. The pathogenesis and pathophysiology of IBS remains incompletely understood. The biopsychosocial model, which conceptualizes chronic pain as a dysregulation of the gut-brain-homeostasis with peripheral and central factors mutually influencing each other, is the most accepted framework to explain IBS. Twin and family aggregation studies suggest a genetic component that does not exclusively explain the higher prevalence of IBS in certain families. Social learning (environmental factors) and maladaptive coping predispose children to develop IBS with greater disability and more frequent medical consultations. Early-life events constitute an additional risk factor for the development of IBS and other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Children with a history of cow's milk protein hypersensitivity or abdominal surgeries have a higher prevalence of IBS and other FGIDs years later. IBS frequently follows an episode of acute gastrointestinal inflammation (infectious or non-infectious). This article discusses the importance, known pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical approach, and evidence-based therapeutic options for the management of IBS in children and adolescents.},

   abstract = {A chronic continuous or intermittent gastrointestinal tract dysfunction, the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), appears to be due to dysregulation of brain-gut-microbiota communication. Furthermore, the "microbiota" greatly impacts the bi-directional brain-gut axis communication. This article describes IBS in relation to similar diseases, presents the background to osteopathy, and proposes osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) to manage IBS. In IBS, OMT focuses on the nervous and circulatory systems, spine, viscera, and thoracic and pelvic diaphragms in order to restore homeostatic balance, normalize autonomic activity in the intestine, promote lymphatic flow, and address somatic dysfunction. Lymphatic and venous congestion are treated by the lymphatic pump techniques and stimulation of Chapmans reflex points. A simple treatment plan designed to lessen chronic pain and inflammation in IBS is presented based on current evidence-based literature. Since food itself, food allergies, and intolerance could contribute to symptom onset or even cause IBS, this article also provides dietary modifications to consider for patients.},

   abstract = {The past decade has witnessed an explosion of knowledge regarding the vast microbial community that resides within our intestine-the gut microbiota. The topic has generated great expectations in terms of gaining a better understanding of disorders ranging from IBD to metabolic disorders and obesity. IBS is a condition for which investigators have long been in search of plausible underlying pathogeneses and it is inevitable that altered composition or function of the gut microbiota will be considered as a potential aetiological factor in at least a subset of patients with IBS. This Review describes the evidence implicating the gut microbiota in not only the expression of the intestinal manifestations of IBS, but also the psychiatric morbidity that coexists in up to 80% of patients with IBS. The evidence described herein ranges from proof-of-concept studies in animals to observational studies and clinical trials in humans. The gut microbiota is subject to influences from a diverse range of factors including diet, antibiotic usage, infection and stress. These factors have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of IBS and further prompt consideration of a role for the gut microbiota in IBS.},

   abstract = {Trial design and endpoints for the evaluation of drug efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) underwent major changes over the last two decades. A systematic review in the early 1990s concluded that there were few well-designed and well-executed treatment trials in IBS. Over the next decade, the so-called binary endpoints were used in several clinical trials in IBS in the US, Europe and other parts of the world. In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a general guidance for the evaluation of symptom benefit in clinical trials based on patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, which had a major impact on trial design in IBS. In May 2012, the FDA recommended to use as provisional endpoint the quantification of two major IBS aspects, abdominal pain and disordered defecation, to assess the efficacy of pharmacological treatments in IBS. In the present issue of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, the performance of the FDA Responder Endpoint for clinical trials in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation was evaluated using data from two large Phase III clinical trials of linaclotide. The FDA interim endpoints are clinically relevant as they are also able to capture the smallest patient-reported difference in the domain of Abdominal Pain intensity and Abnormal Defecation with good diagnostic accuracy. The FDA responder definition and the European Medicines Agency responder definitions generate similar response rates, while binary endpoints generate higher responder rates. The implications for optimalization and harmonisation are discussed.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Linaclotide is the first member of a novel class of drugs to be extensively evaluated for the treatment of chronic constipation (CC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). AIM: To provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on linaclotide, its pharmacological properties, mode of action and efficacy in clinical trials to date. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature. RESULTS: The survey revealed that linaclotide is a minimally absorbed, 14-amino acid peptide which acts in the intestinal lumen on guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C). This results in generation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which stimulates chloride secretion, resulting in increased luminal fluid secretion and an acceleration of intestinal transit. In animal models, linaclotide also decreased visceral hypersensitivity. Linaclotide softened stool and increased transit in CC and in IBS-C. Phase II and phase III clinical studies established efficacy of linaclotide in CC (linaclotide 145 microg daily approved in the United States for CC) and in IBS-C (linaclotide 290 microg daily US Food and Drug Administration-approved for IBS-C, with favourable recommendation for the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Linaclotide showed a favourable safety profile, and the main treatment-emerging adverse event was diarrhea, leading to discontinuation rates of up to 5%. Linaclotide is an important addition to the therapeutic possibilities for treating IBS-C and CC.},

   abstract = {A variety of foods have been implicated in symptoms of patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) but wheat products are most frequently cited by patients as a trigger. Our aim was to investigate the effects of breads, which were fermented for different lengths of time, on the colonic microbiota using in vitro batch culture experiments. A set of in vitro anaerobic culture systems were run over a period of 24 h using faeces from 3 different IBS donors (Rome Criteria-mainly constipated) and 3 healthy donors. Changes in gut microbiota during a time course were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), whilst the small-molecular weight metabolomic profile was determined by NMR analysis. Gas production was separately investigated in non pH-controlled, 36 h batch culture experiments. Numbers of bifidobacteria were higher in healthy subjects compared to IBS donors. In addition, the healthy donors showed a significant increase in bifidobacteria (P<0.005) after 8 h of fermentation of a bread produced using a sourdough process (type C) compared to breads produced with commercial yeasted dough (type B) and no time fermentation (Chorleywood Breadmaking process) (type A). A significant decrease of delta-Proteobacteria and most Gemmatimonadetes species was observed after 24 h fermentation of type C bread in both IBS and healthy donors. In general, IBS donors showed higher rates of gas production compared to healthy donors. Rates of gas production for type A and conventional long fermentation (type B) breads were almost identical in IBS and healthy donors. Sourdough bread produced significantly lower cumulative gas after 15 h fermentation as compared to type A and B breads in IBS donors but not in the healthy controls. In conclusion, breads fermented by the traditional long fermentation and sourdough are less likely to lead to IBS symptoms compared to bread made using the Chorleywood Breadmaking Process.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acute infectious gastroenteritis increases the risk for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD). Children are particularly vulnerable to gastroenteritis because of the immaturity of their intestinal barrier, enteric nervous system, and immune response to pathogens. We investigated whether acute gastroenteritis in early life increases the risk of IBS and FD throughout adulthood. METHODS: In 1994, we identified and monitored a single culture-proven foodborne Salmonella enteritidis outbreak that involved 1811 patients (mostly pediatric) in Bologna, Italy. Clinical data were collected and a prospective, controlled, cohort study was designed. Long-term effects were assessed by mailing a questionnaire to 757 subjects 16 years after the outbreak (when all of the children were adults). We randomly selected a cohort of 250 adults exposed to Salmonella as children, all 127 individuals exposed as adults, and a cohort of nonexposed participants matched for number, age, sex, and area of residence (controls). RESULTS: Among 198 exposed participants, 64 reported FD (32.3%), compared with 51 of 188 controls (27.1%; P = .268). Among 204 exposed participants, 75 reported having IBS (36.8%) compared with 44 of 189 controls (23.3%; P = .004). The odds ratio for IBS among people exposed to the Salmonella was 1.92 (95% confidence interval: 1.23-2.98). The prevalence of IBS was higher in individuals exposed Salmonella as children than in controls (35.3% vs 20.5%; P = .008), but not in individuals exposed as adults, compared with controls. After multivariate logistic regression, post-infectious IBS was independently associated with anxiety and FD. CONCLUSIONS: Based on data collected from a single culture-proven foodborne Salmonella enteritidis outbreak in 1994, Salmonella-induced gastroenteritis during childhood (but not adulthood) is a risk factor for IBS.},

   abstract = {Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John's Wort) is an important medicinal plant which is widely used in the treatment for depression and irritable bowel syndrome. It is also used as a dietary supplement. Major bioactive phytochemicals of H. perforatum are phenolics and flavonoids. Quality of these phytochemicals is dramatically influenced by environmental and biological factors in the field grown plants. As an alternative, we have developed adventitious root cultures in large-scale bioreactors for the production of useful phytochemicals. Adventitious roots of H. perforatum were cultured in 500 l pilot-scale airlift bioreactors using half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium with an ammonium and nitrate ratio of 5:25 mM and supplemented with 1.0 mg l(-1) indole butyric acid, 0.1 mg l(-1) kinetin, and 3 % sucrose for the production of bioactive phenolics and flavonoids. Then 4.6 and 6.3 kg dry biomass were realized in the 500 l each of drum-type and balloon-type bioreactors, respectively. Accumulation of 66.9 mg g(-1) DW of total phenolics, 48.6 mg g(-1) DW of total flavonoids, 1.3 mg g(-1) DW of chlorogenic acid, 0.01 mg g(-1) DW of hyperin, 0.04 mg g(-1) DW of hypericin, and 0.01 mg g(-1) DW of quercetin could be achieved with adventitious roots cultured in 500 l balloon-type airlift bioreactors. Our findings demonstrate the possibilities of using H. perforatum adventitious root cultures for the production of useful phytochemicals to meet the demand of pharmaceutical and food industry.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders in Western countries. Despite the high prevalence of this disorders, the therapeutic management of these patients is often unsatisfactory. A number of factors have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of IBS, including impaired motility and sensitivity, increased permeability, changes in the gut microbiome and alterations in the brain-gut axis. Also food seems to play a critical role: the most of IBS patients report the onset or the exacerbation of their symptoms after the meals. Recently, an increasing attention has been paid to the role of food in IBS. In this review we summarize the most recent evidences about the role of diet on IBS symptoms. A diet restricted in fermentable, poorly absorbed carbohydrates and sugar alcohols has beneficial effects on IBS symptoms. More studies are needed to improve our knowledge about the relationship between food and IBS. However, in the foreseeable future, dietary strategies will represent one of the key tools in the therapeutic management of patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {Despite well-known intestinal epithelial barrier impairment and visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and IBS-like models, structural and physical changes in the mucus layer remain poorly understood. Using a water avoidance stress (WAS) model, we aimed at evaluating whether 1) WAS modified gut permeability, visceral sensitivity, mucin expression, biochemical structure of O-glycans, and related mucus physical properties, and 2) whether Lactobacillus farciminis treatment prevented these alterations. Wistar rats received orally L. farciminis or vehicle for 14 days; at day 10, they were submitted to either sham or 4-day WAS. Intestinal paracellular permeability and visceral sensitivity were measured in vivo. The number of goblet cells and Muc2 expression were evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Mucosal adhesion of L. farciminis was determined ex situ. The mucin O-glycosylation profile was obtained by mass spectrometry. Surface imaging of intestinal mucus was performed at nanoscale by atomic force microscopy. WAS induced gut hyperpermeability and visceral hypersensitivity but did not modify either the number of intestinal goblet cells or Muc2 expression. In contrast, O-glycosylation of mucins was strongly affected, with the appearance of elongated polylactosaminic chain containing O-glycan structures, associated with flattening and loss of the mucus layer cohesive properties. L. farciminis bound to intestinal Muc2 and prevented WAS-induced functional alterations and changes in mucin O-glycosylation and mucus physical properties. WAS-induced functional changes were associated with mucus alterations resulting from a shift in O-glycosylation rather than from changes in mucin expression. L. farciminis treatment prevented these alterations, conferring epithelial and mucus barrier strengthening.},

It is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, and is associated with changes in stool frequency and/or consistency. The etiopathogenesis of IBS may be multifactorial, as is the pathophysiology, which is attributed to alterations in gastrointestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal microbiota, gut epithelium and immune function, dysfunction of the brain-gut axis or certain psychosocial factors. Current therapeutic strategies are often unsatisfactory. There is now increasing evidence linking alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota and IBS. Probiotics are living organisms which, when ingested in certain numbers, exert health benefits beyond inherent basic nutrition. Probiotics have numerous positive effects in the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, many studies have suggested that probiotics are effective in the treatment of IBS. The mechanisms of probiotics in IBS are very complex. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence and mechanisms for the use of probiotics in the treatment of IBS.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The importance of lactose malabsorption in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is not well defined and these patients often complain of lactose intolerance. To objectively measure lactose malabsorption, a hydrogen breath test (HBT) can be performed, but a discrepancy emerges between the results of the HBT and the symptomatic response during the HBT. AIMS: To determine in a group of IBS patients whether self-perceived lactose intolerance and the symptomatic response to lactose HBT were conditioned by other factors besides the presence of lactose malabsorption. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oral challenge to lactose (50 g) was tested in 51 IBS patients to assess HBT malabsorption and the symptomatic response to lactose intolerance was scored on a validated questionnaire. Allergological screening for common inhalants and food allergens (including cow's milk) was performed. The presence of psychological factors (e.g. anxiety, depression, fatigue) was evaluated using validated questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 21 out of 51 patients (41.1%) were self-perceived to be lactose intolerant, 24/51 (47%) had a positive HBT, and 14/51 (27.4%) presented with symptoms of lactose intolerance during HBT. The serological screening for inhalant and food allergens was positive in 6/21 (28.6%) and 4/21 (19%) of patients who self-perceived lactose intolerance and in 5/14 (37.5%) and 3/14 (21.4%) in intolerant patients symptomatic during HBT. Only 1/51 (1.9%) presented evidence of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to cow's milk. Patients who experienced symptoms of lactose intolerance during HBT presented more severe IBS symptoms [326 (296-398) vs. 215 (126-295) P=0.05] and a higher score of anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Factors influencing the symptoms of lactose intolerance during HBT resulted in an increase in hydrogen produced and in the severity of IBS. CONCLUSION: In a cohort of 51 IBS patients, the symptoms of lactose intolerance during HBT were influenced by the capacity to absorb lactose and the severity of IBS. Other factors, such as the psychological status or an adverse reaction to milk, merit consideration as potential cofactors involved in lactose perception and tolerance.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases. It is characterized by chronic abdominal pain, typically associated with altered bowel habits that cannot be explained by structural abnormalities in routine diagnostic workup. Based on the predominant symptom, IBS can be divided into different subtypes: IBS with predominant constipation, diarrhea, bloating, or pain. Knowledge about the complex and multifactorial IBS pathophysiology has increased tremendously in recent years, e.g., IBS may be related to alterations in gastrointestinal motility, visceral sensitivity, and the mucosal immune system. It is important, both for the patient and the physician, that IBS diagnosis is made quickly and thoroughly based on the typical symptom complex and exclusion of relevant differential diagnoses and to reassure the patient that IBS is a chronic, but benign disease. These components are the fundamental basis for a good patient-physician relationship and for a successful long-term management of this potentially very compromising disorder. IBS therapy is based on general measures as well as symptom-oriented medical therapy, where improvement of abdominal pain is one of the main goals in treating IBS patients. Several pain treatment options are available, which may be used long-term or on demand and which may be combined with other therapies. General medical approaches include antispasmodics, improvement of bowel function, phytotherapy, and probiotics. Especially in patients with psychological comorbidities, antidepressants may be used. Modern drug treatments include the GC-C agonist linaclotide in IBS with predominant constipation, the locally acting antibiotic rifaximin in IBS with bloating, and 5-HT3 antagonists in IBS with predominant diarrhea. Psychotherapy should be included in an interdisciplinary approach in refractory cases or in psychological comorbidity.},

   abstract = {The intestinal mucosa is constantly facing a high load of antigens including bacterial antigens derived from the microbiota and food. Despite this, the immune cells present in the gastrointestinal tract do not initiate a pro-inflammatory immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors expressed by various cells in the gastrointestinal tract, including intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and resident immune cells in the lamina propria. Many diseases, including chronic intestinal inflammation (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), allergic gastroenteritis (e.g., eosinophilic gastroenteritis and allergic IBS), and infections are nowadays associated with a deregulated microbiota. The microbiota may directly interact with TLR. In addition, differences in intestinal TLR expression in health and disease may suggest that TLRs play an essential role in disease pathogenesis and may be novel targets for therapy. TLR signaling in the gut is involved in either maintaining intestinal homeostasis or the induction of an inflammatory response. This mini review provides an overview of the current knowledge regarding the contribution of intestinal epithelial TLR signaling in both tolerance induction or promoting intestinal inflammation, with a focus on food allergy. We will also highlight a potential role of the microbiota in regulating gut immune responses, especially through TLR activation.},

   abstract = {Although it is now known that the human body is colonized by a wide variety of microbial populations in different parts (such as the mouth, pharynx and respiratory system, the skin, the gastro- and urogenital tracts), many effects of the complex interactions between the human host and microbial symbionts are still not completely understood. The dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal tract microbiota is considered to be one of the most important contributing factors in the development of many gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome and colorectal cancer, as well as systemic diseases like obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Fecal microbial transplantations appear to be promising therapies for dysbiosis-associated diseases; however, probiotic microorganisms have been growing in popularity due to increasing numbers of studies proving that certain strains present health promoting properties, among them the beneficial balance of the intestinal microbiota. Inflammatory bowel diseases and obesity are the pathologies in which there are more studies showing this beneficial association using animal models and even in human clinical trials. In this review, the association of the human gut microbiota and human health will be discussed along with the benefits that probiotics can confer on this symbiotic activity and on the prevention or treatment of associated diseases.},

   abstract = {Metabolomics has increasingly been applied in addition to other "omic" approaches in the study of the pathophysiology of different gastrointestinal diseases. Metabolites represent molecular readouts of the cell status reflecting a physiological phenotype. In addition, changes in metabolite concentrations induced by exogenous factors such as environmental and dietary factors which do not affect the genome, are taken into account. Metabolic reactions initiated by the host or gut microbiota can lead to "marker" metabolites present in different biological fluids that allow differentiation between health and disease. Several lines of evidence implicated the involvement of intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Also in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a role of an abnormal microbiota composition, so-called dysbiosis, is supported by experimental data. These compositional alterations could play a role in the aetiology of both diseases by altering the metabolic activities of the gut bacteria. Several studies have applied a metabolomic approach to identify these metabolite signatures. However, before translating a potential metabolite biomarker into clinical use, additional validation studies are required. This review summarizes contributions that metabolomics has made in IBD and IBS and presents potential future directions within the field.},

   abstract = {Human biology can only be fully assessed by combining an analysis of both the host and its surrounding environment. As a part of the environment, the human gastrointestinal tract hosts more than 100 trillion bacteria making up the gut microbiota. The human host provides a nutrient-rich environment while the microbiota provides indispensable functions that humans cannot exert themselves. Shifts in the bacterial makeup of the human gut microbiota have been associated with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome and obesity. However, since most bacteria inhabiting our gut are not cultivable to date, until recently little was known about their individual functions. Metagenomics, i.e. the analysis of the collective genomes present in a defined ecosystem, gives insight into these specific functions. The first extensive catalogue of the intestinal metagenome outnumbers the size of the human genome by a factor of 150. Recently, 3 distinct 'types' of gut composition within the human population have been highlighted. These so-called 'enterotypes' are characterized by the dominant genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella and Ruminococcus) and their co-occurring phylogenetic groups. In accordance with the previously described impact of nutritional behavior (diet, probiotics and prebiotics) on specific bacterial populations, an association has been observed between long-term dietary habits and enterotypes. This recent discovery, i.e. that belonging to one or the other enterotype might be modulated by the diet opens up new perspectives in the fields of IBD, nutrition and therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {Epidemiologic research is fundamental and complementary to our understanding of disease and development of primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions. To put the current evidence into context and identify gaps and research priorities in the areas of disease attribution, burden of disease, clinical characterization, and management of postinfectious functional gastrointestinal disorders (PI-FGDs), we took a multidisciplinary approach from the domains of infectious disease, gastroenterology, epidemiology, and public health. Our review of data from these disciplines found that, despite a complete understanding of pathoetiology, studies continue to accumulate and point toward evidence of a causal association for FGD. For some FGDs, Bradford Hill's criteria for causality yield more certainty than other criteria. In addition, the growing recognition of the impact of acute foodborne illness on economics and society is leading to exploration of the potential long-term health effects and disease burden of PI-FGDs, although a paucity of data exist in terms of pathogen-specific risk, disability duration, and relevant disability weights. Lastly, the understanding of PI-FGDs is changing the way research is approached and suggests a need for a more expansive exploration of biologic mechanisms and how FGDs are categorized. Areas of research priorities are catalogued in this paper and will hopefully provide inspiration for future studies and contributions to the field of gastroenterology.},

   abstract = {Recent progress in unravelling the nutrient-sensing mechanisms in the taste buds of the tongue has triggered studies on the existence and role of chemosensory cells in the gut. Indeed, the gastrointestinal tract is the key interface between food and the human body and can sense basic tastes in much the same way as the tongue, through the use of similar G-protein-coupled taste receptors. These receptors 'taste' the luminal content and transmit signals that regulate nutrient transporter expression and nutrient uptake, and also the release of gut hormones and neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis. Hence, they play a prominent role in the communication between the lumen, epithelium, smooth muscle cells, afferent nerve fibres and the brain to trigger adaptive responses that affect gastrointestinal function, food intake and glucose metabolism. This review summarises how sensing of nutrients by taste receptors along the gut plays a key role in the process of digestion, and how disturbances or adaptations of these chemosensory signalling pathways may contribute to the induction or resolution of a number of pathological conditions related to diabetes, obesity, or diet-induced symptom generation in irritable bowel syndrome. Targeting these receptors may represent a promising novel route for the treatment of a number of these diseases.},

This is particularly true in developing countries. Recent outbreaks of infectious diarrhea in developed countries, including the USA, are often attributed to food handling and distribution practices and highlight the need for continued vigilance in this area. Another common cause of infectious diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), has historically been associated with the use of antibiotics and exposure to a health-care setting but is now increasingly common in the community in persons who lack the typical risk factors. Recent scientific advances have also led to new and proposed new therapies for infectious diarrhea, including fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) for recurrent C. difficile infection (RCDI), probiotics for prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and CDI, and the use of zinc supplementation in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children. Other therapies that have been in use for decades, such as the oral rehydration solution (ORS), continue to be the targets of scientific advancement in an effort to improve delivery and efficacy. Finally, post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is an increasingly recognized occurrence. Attempts to understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon are underway and may provide insight into potential treatment options.},

   abstract = {Here, we define a psychobiotic as a live organism that, when ingested in adequate amounts, produces a health benefit in patients suffering from psychiatric illness. As a class of probiotic, these bacteria are capable of producing and delivering neuroactive substances such as gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin, which act on the brain-gut axis. Preclinical evaluation in rodents suggests that certain psychobiotics possess antidepressant or anxiolytic activity. Effects may be mediated via the vagus nerve, spinal cord, or neuroendocrine systems. So far, psychobiotics have been most extensively studied in a liaison psychiatric setting in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, where positive benefits have been reported for a number of organisms including Bifidobacterium infantis. Evidence is emerging of benefits in alleviating symptoms of depression and in chronic fatigue syndrome. Such benefits may be related to the anti-inflammatory actions of certain psychobiotics and a capacity to reduce hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. Results from large scale placebo-controlled studies are awaited.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Saccharomyces boulardii is a well-known probiotic worldwide, and there are numerous studies including experimental and clinical trials in children and adults by the use of S. boulardii. AREAS COVERED: The objective of the present report is to provide an update on the evidence for the efficacy of S. boulardii CNCM I-745 in different clinical conditions. Saccharomyces boulardii is one of the best-studied probiotics in acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and is shown to be safe and to reduce the duration of diarrhea and hospitalization by about 1 day. Saccharomyces boulardii is one of the recommended probiotics for AGE in children by European Society of Paediatric Infectious Diseases and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). Saccharomyces boulardii is also a recommended probiotic for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and a recent study showed promising results for the treatment of AAD in children. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the long-term use of S. boulardii in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Although some clinical studies showed positive effects of S. boulardii on inflammation, there is no clinical evidence that S. boulardii is useful in inflammatory bowel disease. Saccharomyces boulardii could be used in patients needing Helicobacter pylori eradication because the S. boulardii improves compliance, decreases the side effects and moderately increases the eradication rate. There are new promising results (improving feeding tolerance, shorten the course of hyperbilirubinemia), but we do still not recommend the routine use of S. boulardii in newborns. EXPERT OPINION: Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 is a good example for the statement that each probiotic needs to be taxonomically characterized and its efficacy and safety should be documented individually in different clinical settings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is linked to post-inflammatory and stress-correlated factors that cause changes in the perception of visceral events. Probiotic bacteria may be effective in treating IBS symptoms. Here, we have investigated whether early life administration of VSL#3, a mixture of 8 probiotic bacteria strains, protects against development of visceral hypersensitivity driven by neonatal maternal separation (NMS), a rat model of IBS. METHODS: Male NMS pups were treated orally with placebo or VSL#3 from days 3 to 60, while normal, not separated rats were used as controls. After 60 days from birth, perception of painful sensation induced by colorectal distension (CRD) was measured by assessing the abdominal withdrawal reflex (score 0-4). The colonic gene expression was assessed by using the Agilent Whole Rat Genome Oligo Microarrays platform and confirmed by real time PCR. RESULTS: NMS rats exhibited both hyperalgesia and allodynia when compared to control rats. VSL#3 had a potent analgesic effect on CRD-induced pain without changing the colorectal compliance. The microarray analysis demonstrated that NMS induces a robust change in the expression of subsets of genes (CCL2, NOS3, THP1, NTRK1, CCR2, BDRKRB1, IL-10, TNFRSF1B, TRPV4, CNR1 and OPRL1) involved in pain transmission and inflammation. TPH1, tryptophan hydroxylase 1, a validated target gene in IBS treatment, was markedly upregulated by NMS and this effect was reversed by VSL#3 intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Early life administration of VSL#3 reduces visceral pain perception in a model of IBS and resets colonic expression of subsets of genes mediating pain and inflammation.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Simultaneous agonism of the mu-opioid receptor and antagonism of the delta-opioid receptor can reduce abdominal pain and diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) without constipating side effects. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a minimally absorbed, mu-opioid receptor agonist and delta-opioid receptor antagonist (eluxadoline) in a phase 2 study in patients with IBS-D. METHODS: We randomly assigned 807 patients to groups that received oral placebo twice daily or 5, 25, 100, or 200 mg oral eluxadoline for 12 weeks. The primary end point was clinical response at week 4, defined by a mean reduction in daily pain score from baseline of >/= 30%, and of at least 2 points on 0-10 scale, as well as a stool consistency score of 3 or 4 on the Bristol Stool Scale (1-7) for at least 66% of daily diary entries during that week. RESULTS: Significantly more patients receiving 25 mg (12.0%) or 200 mg (13.8%) eluxadoline met the primary end point of clinical response than patients given placebo (5.7%; P < .05). Patients receiving eluxadoline at 100 mg and 200 mg also had greater improvements in bowel movement frequency and urgency, global symptoms, quality of life, and adequate relief assessments (P < .05). Additionally, patients receiving 100 mg (28.0%) or 200 mg (28.5%) eluxadoline were significantly more likely than those receiving placebo (13.8%; P < .005) to meet the US Food and Drug Administration response end point during the full 12 weeks of the study. Eluxadoline was well tolerated with a low incidence of constipation. CONCLUSIONS: In a phase 2 study of the mixed mu-opioid receptor agonist/delta-opioid receptor antagonist eluxadoline vs placebo in patients with IBS-D, patients given eluxadoline were significantly more likely to be clinical responders, based on a composite of improvement in abdominal pain and stool consistency. Further study of eluxadoline is warranted to assess its potential as a treatment for IBS-D.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disease with a substantial social and economic burden. Treatment options remain limited and research on the aetiology and pathophysiology of this multifactorial disease is ongoing. AIM: To discuss the potential role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of IBS and to identify possible interactions with pathophysiologic targets in IBS. METHODS: Articles were identified via a PubMed database search ['irritable bowel syndrome' AND (anti-bacterial OR antibiotic OR flora OR microbiota OR microflora OR probiotic)]. English-language articles were screened for relevance. Full review of publications for the relevant studies was conducted, including additional publications that were identified from individual article reference lists. RESULTS: The role of gut microbiota in IBS is supported by varying lines of evidence from animal and human studies. For example, post-infectious IBS in humans is well documented. In addition, certain probiotics and nonsystemic antibiotics appear to be efficacious in the treatment of IBS. Mechanisms involved in improving IBS symptoms likely go beyond mere changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, and accumulating animal data support the interplay of microbiota with other IBS targets, such as the gut-brain axis, visceral hypersensitivity, mucosal inflammation and motility. CONCLUSION: The role of the gut microbiota is still being elucidated; however, it appears to be one of several important factors that contributes to the aetiology and pathophysiology of the irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {Several endocrine cell abnormalities have been reported in different segments of the gastrointestinal tract of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These cells have specialized microvilli that project into the lumen; they function as sensors for the gut contents and respond to luminal stimuli (mostly ingested nutrients) by releasing hormones into the lamina propria, where they exert their effects via a paracrine/endocrine mode of action. Certain food items trigger the symptoms experienced by IBS patients, including those rich in fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). In this review, we present the argument that the effects of both FODMAPs and the proportional intake of proteins, fats and carbohydrates on IBS symptoms may be caused by an interaction with the gut endocrine cells. Since the gut hormones control and regulate gastrointestinal motility and sensation, this interaction may be responsible for abnormal gastrointestinal motility and the visceral hypersensitivity observed in these patients. There is no consistent evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy. The role of gluten intolerance in the development of IBS symptoms in these patients remains a matter of controversy. Individual guidance on food management, which includes restrictions in the intake of FODMAP-rich foods and testing diets with different proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates has been found to reduce the symptoms, improve the quality of life, and make the habitual diet of IBS patients more healthy.},

   abstract = {AIM: To explore the association between consumption of spicy foods and prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among Iranian adults. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data from 4763 Iranian adult participants were used. Consumption of spicy foods was estimated using a dietary habits questionnaire that included a question on spicy foods consumption: "how frequently do you use spicy foods (pepper, curry, ginger, cinnamon and turmeric) during a week?" Participants could respond to the question by choosing one of these choices: never, 1-3 times, 4-6 times, 7-9 times, or more than 10 times per week. A modified Persian version of the Rome III questionnaire was used to determine the prevalence of IBS. RESULTS: IBS was prevalent in 21.7% (18.6% of men and 24.1% of women) of the study population. After controlling for potential confounders including dietary behaviors, those consuming spicy foods >/= 10 times per week were 92% more likely to have IBS compared with those who never consumed spicy foods (OR = 1.92; 95%CI: 1.23-3.01, P trend < 0.01). The association remained significant even after taking lactose intolerance into account (OR = 1.85; 95%CI: 1.18-2.90, P trend < 0.01). Stratified analysis by gender revealed that the association between consumption of spicy foods and IBS was not significant in men; however, a significant association was found among women after taking potential cofounders, including meal regularity and lactose intolerance, into account. Women who consumed spicy foods >/= 10 times per week were two times more likely to have IBS compared with those who never consumed spicy foods (OR = 2.03; 95%CI: 1.09-3.77, P trend = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Consumption of spicy foods is directly associated with IBS, particularly in women. Further, prospective studies are warranted to (1) examine this association in other populations; and (2) evaluate whether dietary interventions, for example a reduction in spice consumption, would improve IBS symptoms.},

   abstract = {Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the pathologic role of food in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Nevertheless, healthcare providers often avoid addressing diet with their patients because of a lack of training, guideline consensus, and high-quality data. Recent literature supports the existence of a subgroup of IBS patients with undiagnosed nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), a term that is used to describe individuals who experience gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms as a result of immunologic, morphologic, or symptomatic abnormalities that are precipitated by the ingestion of gluten. NCGS represents an important subgroup of patients with IBS who are highly treatable via dietary modification. Gluten may influence gastrointestinal symptoms through immune activation or alteration of intestinal permeability, but the true role of food in functional gastrointestinal symptomatology remains unclear. For example, gluten is just 1 component of the complex milieu of nutrients found in wheat and related grains, and NCGS likely represents only the tip of the iceberg as it pertains to the role of food in IBS.},

This paper outlines the organization of fiber types and highlights the importance of assessing the fermentation characteristics of each fiber type when choosing a suitable strategy for patients. Fiber undergoes partial or total fermentation in the distal small bowel and colon leading to the production of short-chain fatty acids and gas, thereby affecting gastrointestinal function and sensation. When fiber is recommended for functional bowel disease, use of a soluble supplement such as ispaghula/psyllium is best supported by the available evidence. Even when used judiciously, fiber can exacerbate abdominal distension, flatulence, constipation, and diarrhea.},

   abstract = {The response of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) to ingestion of food is a complex and closely controlled process, which allows optimization of propulsion, digestion, absorption of nutrients, and removal of indigestible remnants. This review summarizes current knowledge on the mechanisms that control the response of the GIT to food intake. During the cephalic phase, triggered by cortical food-related influences, the GIT prepares for receiving nutrients. The gastric phase is dominated by the mechanical effect of the meal volume. Accumulation of food in the stomach activates tension-sensitive mechanoreceptors, which in turn stimulate gastric accommodation and gastric acid secretion through the intrinsic and vago-vagal reflex pathways. After meal ingestion, the tightly controlled process of gastric emptying starts, with arrival of nutrients in the duodenum triggering negative feedback on emptying and stimulating secretion of digestive enzymes through the neural (mainly vago-vagal reflex, but also intrinsic) and endocrine (release of peptides from entero-endocrine cells) pathways. Several types of specialized receptors detect the presence of all main categories of nutrients. In addition, the gastrointestinal mucosa expresses receptors of the T1R and T2R families (taste receptors) and several members of the transient receptor potential channel family, all of which are putatively involved in the detection of specific tastants in the lumen. Activation of nutrient and taste sensors also activates the extrinsic and intrinsic neural, as well as entero-endocrine, pathways. During passage through the small bowel, nutrients are progressively extracted, and electrolyte-rich liquid intestinal content with non-digestible residue is delivered to the colon. The colon provides absorption of the water and electrolytes, storage of non-digestible remnants of food, aboral propulsion of contents, and finally evacuation through defecation.},

Patients with these problems often present with unexplained bloating, belching, distension, gas, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Here, we have examined the most up-to-date research on these food-related intolerances, discussed controversies, and have provided some guidelines for the dietary management of these conditions. Breath testing for carbohydrate intolerance appears to be standardized and essential for the diagnosis and management of these conditions, especially in the Western population. While current research shows that the FODMAP diet may be effective in treating some patients with irritable bowel syndrome, additional research is needed to identify more foods items that are high in FODMAPs, and to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of dietary interventions.},

Furthermore, perturbation of the microbiota-host symbiosis (dysbiosis) is considered a common pathogenic mechanism connecting gastrointestinal, ocular and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Consequently, maintaining or restoring microbiota-host symbiosis represents a new approach to treat these symptoms or to prevent their relapses. Current treatment approach assigned a primary role to live probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics to enhance colonization of beneficial bacteria and to strengthen the symbiosis. However, several papers showed major benefits of heat-killed probiotics as compared to their live counterparts on both intestinal and systemic symptoms. Recently, in addition to killing probiotics, in a proof of concept study lysates (fragments) of probiotics in combination with vitamins A, B, D and omega 3 fatty acids were successfully tested. These findings suggested a conceptual change in the approach addressed to both the microbiota and host as targets for intervention.},

   abstract = {There is convincing evidence that patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) exhibit dysfunctions of the gut involving hypersensitivity and abnormal reflexes, so that physiological, normally unperceived, stimuli induce symptoms. The type of symptoms depends on the specific sensory-reflex pathways and region(s) affected. Fat modulates the responses of the gut to various stimuli, and some of these modulatory mechanisms are abnormal in patients with FGIDs. Indeed, laboratory-based studies have shown that the symptoms experienced by these patients can be induced, or exacerbated, by administration of lipids in amounts that are well tolerated by healthy controls, and, thus, demonstrate a hypersensitivity to lipid. Very few studies have evaluated dietary patterns and eating behavior in these patients, with often-conflicting outcomes, and no studies have been performed to evaluate the role of targeted dietary interventions for the relief of symptoms. Given the evidence from laboratory studies, as well as patient experience, such studies, in large cohorts of patients, are needed with the view to develop personalized, cost-effective treatment approaches.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) are functional bowel disorders. Evidence suggests that disturbance in the gastrointestinal microbiota may be implicated in both conditions. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in IBS and CIC. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched (up to December 2013). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting adults with IBS or CIC, which compared prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics with placebo or no therapy, were eligible. Dichotomous symptom data were pooled to obtain a relative risk (RR) of remaining symptomatic after therapy, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous data were pooled using a standardized or weighted mean difference with a 95% CI. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 3,216 citations. Forty-three RCTs were eligible for inclusion. The RR of IBS symptoms persisting with probiotics vs. placebo was 0.79 (95% CI 0.70-0.89). Probiotics had beneficial effects on global IBS, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence scores. Data for prebiotics and synbiotics in IBS were sparse. Probiotics appeared to have beneficial effects in CIC (mean increase in number of stools per week=1.49; 95% CI=1.02-1.96), but there were only two RCTs. Synbiotics also appeared beneficial (RR of failure to respond to therapy=0.78; 95% CI 0.67-0.92). Again, trials for prebiotics were few in number, and no definite conclusions could be drawn. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics are effective treatments for IBS, although which individual species and strains are the most beneficial remains unclear. Further evidence is required before the role of prebiotics or synbiotics in IBS is known. The efficacy of all three therapies in CIC is also uncertain.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated suspected food intolerances in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) using confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) for real-time visualization of structural/functional changes in the intestinal mucosa after food challenge. Patients with functional changes after food challenge (CLE+) were placed on personalized exclusion diets and followed up for long-term symptom relief. METHODS: Thirty-six IBS patients with suspected food intolerance and 10 patients with Barrett's esophagus (controls) without IBS symptoms were examined by CLE at University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein (Kiel, Germany). Diluted food antigens were administered directly to the duodenal mucosa through the working channel of the endoscope. Epithelial breaks, intervillous spaces, and the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) were measured before and after the food challenge. CLE+ patients were placed on exclusion diets, given symptom score questionnaires, and followed up for 1 year; controls resumed their previous diet. RESULTS: CLE showed a real-time response to food antigens in 22 of 36 patients; no responses were observed in 14 of 36 patients (CLE-) or any of the controls. Baseline IELs were significantly higher in CLE+ than CLE- subjects (P = .004); numbers increased significantly after food challenge (P = .0008). Within 5 minutes of exposure of CLE+ patients to food antigens, IELs increased, epithelial leaks/gaps formed, and intervillous spaces widened. Epithelial leaks and intervillous spaces also increased significantly in CLE+ vs baseline (both P < .001). The concordance of IELs measured by CLE and conventional histology was 70.6%; they did not correlate (P = .89; r(2) = 0.027). Symptom scores improved more than 50% in CLE+ patients after a 4-week exclusion diet and increased to 74% at 12 months; symptoms continued in CLE- patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on CLE analysis of IBS patients with a suspected food intolerance, exposure to candidate food antigens caused immediate breaks, increased intervillous spaces, and increased IELs in the intestinal mucosa. These changes are associated with patient responses to exclusion diets. Registered at clinicaltrials.gov (registration number: NCT01692613).},

   abstract = {Milk is one of the most beneficial aliments and is highly recommended in normal conditions; however, in certain disorders, like irritable bowel syndrome, cow milk and dairy products worsen the gastric symptoms and their use is not recommended. Among the most recognized milk-induced gatrointestinal symptoms are abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, which are processes controlled by cholinergic and serotonergic transmission. Whether the presence of bioavailable ACh and 5-HT in milk may contribute to normal peristalsis, or to the developing of these symptoms, is not known. In this work we attempt to determine whether the content of free ACh and 5-HT is of physiological significance in milk from four different species: cow (bovine), goat, camel and human. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to identify and quantify free ACh and 5-HT in milk, and activation of the serotonergic and cholinergic ionotropic receptors was investigated using electrophysiological experiments. Our principal hypothesis was that milk from these four species had sufficient free ACh and 5-HT to activate their correspondent receptors expressed in a heterologous system. Our results showed a more complex picture, in which free ACh and 5-HT and their ability to activate cholinergic and serotonergic receptors are not correlated. This work is a first step to elucidate whether 5-HT and ACh, at the concentrations present in the milk, can be associated to a direct function in the GI.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lactose malabsorption (LM), diagnosed currently using lactose hydrogen breath and tolerance tests (LHBT, LTT) with a high, nonphysiological dose (50-g), may mimic irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In LM-endemic areas, clinically significant malabsorption (lactose intolerance) may be better diagnosed using a lesser dose, and positive results so obtained may predict response to milk withdrawal more effectively. METHODS: Fifty patients each with IBS (Rome III) were evaluated using LHBT and LTT with 50-g, 25-g, and 12-g lactose. Sensitivity and specificity of LHBT and LTT with different dosages (gold standard: lactase gene C/T-13910 polymorphism) and symptom development were evaluated. Effect of milk withdrawal was studied. RESULT: Of 150 patients, 37/50 (74%) and 28/50 (56%) had LM by LHBT and LTT using 50-g lactose; 41/50 (82%) and 31/50 (62%) had LM using 25-g lactose, and 14/50 (28%) and 29/50 (58%) using 12-g lactose, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of LHBT using 50-g, 25-g, and 12-g lactose were 92.6%, 52.0%, and 94%, 60%, and 36.4%, 88.2%, and those of LTT, 92%, 80.0%, and 84.8%, 82.4%, and 66.7%, 58.8%, respectively. Breath hydrogen correlated with lactose dose. Though patients developing symptoms with 50-g lactose exhaled more hydrogen than those remaining asymptomatic, hydrogen levels did not differ following 25-g and 12-g dosages in relation to symptom development. Patients' milk intake was 335 +/- 92 mL/d ( approximately 16.7 +/- 9.6-g lactose). Positive LHBT using 25-g dose better predicted symptom resolution than by 50-g and 12-g lactose. CONCLUSION: Twenty-five gram is the ideal dose of lactose for LHBT and LTT in LM-endemic areas.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, and altered stool form and passage. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a condition in which there is overgrowth of bacteria in small bowel in excess of 10(5) colony forming units per milliliter on culture of the upper gut aspirate. Frequency of SIBO varied from 4%-78% among patients with IBS and from 1%-40% among controls. Higher frequency in some studies might be due to fallacious criteria [post-lactulose breath-hydrogen rise 20 PPM above basal within 90 min (early-peak)]. Glucose hydrogen breath test (GHBT) has a low sensitivity to diagnose SIBO. Hence, studies based on GHBT might have under-estimated frequency of SIBO. Therefore, it is important to analyze these studies carefully to evaluate whether the reported association between IBS and SIBO is over or under-projected. This review evaluates studies on association between SIBO and IBS, discordance between different studies, their strength and weakness including methodological issues and evidence on therapeutic manipulation of gut flora on symptoms of IBS.},

   abstract = {It is well recognised that ingestion of food is a trigger for functional bowel symptoms, particularly those associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients often use manipulation of diet as a means of controlling symptoms. Despite description of multiple dietary methods, few have scientific backing or quality evidence of efficacy. One approach is to define how specific food components influence the pathophysiology of IBS and then rationally design dietary approaches. For example, short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates (fermentable oligo-, di- and mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAP)) cause luminal distension, which is a major stimulus for the development of symptoms in patients with visceral hypersensitivity. By determining food content of FODMAP, a diet in which foods low in FODMAP are favoured over those high in FODMAP can be designed. Observational, comparative and randomised controlled treatment and rechallenge studies have shown that such an approach is efficacious in the majority of patients with IBS. The low FODMAP diet is now the primary dietary therapy for such patients. Similar approaches can be applied to other food components, including proteins (such as gluten), fats and natural bioactive food chemicals. Such approaches have suggestions of efficacy, but the evidence base remains underdeveloped. An additional and important consideration for any dietary therapy is its nutritional adequacy and potential adverse health effects. Dietary manipulation is now a key management strategy in patients with functional bowel symptoms. Future well-designed interventional studies will lead to refinement of dietary approaches taken and to a better understanding of their long-term safety.},

STUDY DESIGN: Quantitative review of de-identified records from patients in whom IBS was a possible diagnosis. METHODS: Records were selected for analysis if they included any of 13 IBS-related diagnostic codes and laboratory test results of fecal testing for all biomarkers of interest. Data collection was restricted to one 12-month period. Frequency distributions were calculated to identify rates of abnormal results for each biomarker within the total number of tests conducted in the eligible population. RESULTS: Two thousand, two hundred fifty-six records were included in the study, of which 1867 (82.8%) included at least one abnormal value. Quantitative stool culture for beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) indicated low growth suggestive of intestinal dysbiosis in 73.1% of records, followed by abnormally elevated eosinophil protein X (suggestive of food allergy) in 14.3%, elevated calprotectin (suggestive of inflammation) in 12.1%, detection of parasites in 7.5%, and low pancreatic elastase (suggestive of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency) in 7.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal fecal biomarkers are prevalent in patients with diagnoses suggestive of IBS. Abnormal fecal biomarker testing, if confirmed in additional independent clinical trials, could substantially reduce the economic costs associated with diagnosis and management of IBS.},

   abstract = {The effects of antidepressants on the gastrointestinal tract may contribute to their potential efficacy in functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome; buspirone, a prototype 5-HT1A agonist, enhances gastric accommodation and reduces postprandial symptoms in response to a challenge meal. Paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, accelerates small bowel but not colonic transit, and this property may not be relevant to improve gut function in functional gastrointestinal disorders. Venlafaxine, a prototype serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, enhances gastric accommodation, increases colonic compliance and reduces sensations to distension; however, it is associated with adverse effects that reduce its applicability in treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Tricyclic antidepressants reduce sensations in response to food, including nausea, and delay gastric emptying, especially in females. Buspirone appears efficacious in functional dyspepsia; amitriptyline was not efficacious in a large trial of children with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Clinical trials of antidepressants for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome are generally small. The recommendations of efficacy and number needed to treat from meta-analyses are suspect, and more prospective trials are needed in patients without diagnosed psychiatric diseases. Antidepressants appear to be more effective in the treatment of patients with anxiety or depression, but larger prospective trials assessing both clinical and pharmacodynamic effects on gut sensorimotor function are needed.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome is a common gastrointestinal disorder that may affect dietary pattern, food digestion, and nutrient absorption. The nutrition-related factors are closely related to metabolic syndrome, implying that irritable bowel syndrome may be a potential risk factor for metabolic syndrome. However, few epidemiological studies are available which are related to this potential link. The purpose of this study is to determine whether irritable bowel syndrome is related to metabolic syndrome among middle-aged people. We designed a cross-sectional study of 1,096 subjects to evaluate the relationship between irritable bowel syndrome and metabolic syndrome and its components. Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome was based on the Japanese version of the Rome III Questionnaire. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the criteria of the American Heart Association scientific statements of 2009. Dietary consumption was assessed via a validated food frequency questionnaire. Principal-components analysis was used to derive 3 major dietary patterns: "Japanese", "sweets-fruits", and "Izakaya (Japanese Pub) "from 39 food groups. The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome and metabolic syndrome were 19.4% and 14.6%, respectively. No significant relationship was found between the dietary pattern factor score tertiles and irritable bowel syndrome. After adjustment for potential confounders (including dietary pattern), the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of having metabolic syndrome and elevated triglycerides for subjects with irritable bowel syndrome as compared with non-irritable bowel syndrome are 2.01(1.13-3.55) and 1.50(1.03-2.18), respectively. Irritable bowel syndrome is significantly related to metabolic syndrome and it components. This study is the first to show that irritable bowel syndrome was significantly related to a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome and elevated triglycerides among an adult population. The findings suggest that the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome may be a potentially beneficial factor for the prevention of metabolic syndrome. Further study is needed to clarify this association.},

   abstract = {Although much has been published about curcumin, which is obtained from turmeric, comparatively little is known about turmeric itself. Turmeric, a golden spice obtained from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa, has been used to give color and taste to food preparations since ancient times. Traditionally, this spice has been used in Ayurveda and folk medicine for the treatment of such ailments as gynecological problems, gastric problems, hepatic disorders, infectious diseases, and blood disorders. Modern science has provided the scientific basis for the use of turmeric against such disorders. Various chemical constituents have been isolated from this spice, including polyphenols, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenoids, sterols, and alkaloids. Curcumin, which constitutes 2-5% of turmeric, is perhaps the most-studied component. Although some of the activities of turmeric can be mimicked by curcumin, other activities are curcumin-independent. Cell-based studies have demonstrated the potential of turmeric as an antimicrobial, insecticidal, larvicidal, antimutagenic, radioprotector, and anticancer agent. Numerous animal studies have shown the potential of this spice against proinflammatory diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, depression, diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis. At the molecular level, this spice has been shown to modulate numerous cell-signaling pathways. In clinical trials, turmeric has shown efficacy against numerous human ailments including lupus nephritis, cancer, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, acne, and fibrosis. Thus, a spice originally common in the kitchen is now exhibiting activities in the clinic. In this review, we discuss the chemical constituents of turmeric, its biological activities, its molecular targets, and its potential in the clinic.},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea are common complications of enteral nutrition (EN); however, the cause is unclear. Mode of EN delivery that alters digestion and possibly absorption is suggested to contribute to the high incidence of diarrhea; however, enteral formula is frequently blamed. Most research has focused on fiber-supplemented EN, with a meta-analysis showing that fiber reduces the incidence of diarrhea in non-intensive care unit studies. Other hypotheses include formula osmolality and FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) content. FODMAPs are poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates that exert an osmotic effect. Dietary FODMAPs have been shown to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, in those with irritable bowel syndrome and, given a high-enough dose, will induce a laxative effect in most people. As FODMAPs are commonly added to enteral formula and EN is frequently used as the main source of nutrition, it is reasonable to hypothesize that EN provides more FODMAPs than usual dietary intake and increases risk for developing diarrhea. This hypothesis was assessed through a retrospective study showing that the standard-use enteral formula Isosource 1.5 had a protective effect of developing diarrhea. The only characteristic unique to Isosource 1.5 was the lower FODMAP content as determined through methodologies previously validated for food analysis. Methodologies for application to enteral formulas are currently undergoing formal validation. Once confirmed for application in enteral formula, future directions include FODMAP analysis of specific ingredients to increase understanding of potential problems associated with enteral formula and a randomized, controlled trial investigating the role of formula FODMAP content.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) diet reduces symptoms of IBS, but reduction of potential prebiotic and fermentative effects might adversely affect the colonic microenvironment. The effects of a low FODMAP diet with a typical Australian diet on biomarkers of colonic health were compared in a single-blinded, randomised, cross-over trial. DESIGN: Twenty-seven IBS and six healthy subjects were randomly allocated one of two 21-day provided diets, differing only in FODMAP content (mean (95% CI) low 3.05 (1.86 to 4.25) g/day vs Australian 23.7 (16.9 to 30.6) g/day), and then crossed over to the other diet with >/=21-day washout period. Faeces passed over a 5-day run-in on their habitual diet and from day 17 to day 21 of the interventional diets were pooled, and pH, short-chain fatty acid concentrations and bacterial abundance and diversity were assessed. RESULTS: Faecal indices were similar in IBS and healthy subjects during habitual diets. The low FODMAP diet was associated with higher faecal pH (7.37 (7.23 to 7.51) vs. 7.16 (7.02 to 7.30); p=0.001), similar short-chain fatty acid concentrations, greater microbial diversity and reduced total bacterial abundance (9.63 (9.53 to 9.73) vs. 9.83 (9.72 to 9.93) log10 copies/g; p<0.001) compared with the Australian diet. To indicate direction of change, in comparison with the habitual diet the low FODMAP diet reduced total bacterial abundance and the typical Australian diet increased relative abundance for butyrate-producing Clostridium cluster XIVa (median ratio 6.62; p<0.001) and mucus-associated Akkermansia muciniphila (19.3; p<0.001), and reduced Ruminococcus torques. CONCLUSIONS: Diets differing in FODMAP content have marked effects on gut microbiota composition. The implications of long-term reduction of intake of FODMAPs require elucidation.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) often is used to manage functional gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), yet there is limited evidence of its efficacy, compared with a normal Western diet. We investigated the effects of a diet low in FODMAPs compared with an Australian diet, in a randomized, controlled, single-blind, cross-over trial of patients with IBS. METHODS: In a study of 30 patients with IBS and 8 healthy individuals (controls, matched for demographics and diet), we collected dietary data from subjects for 1 habitual week. Participants then randomly were assigned to groups that received 21 days of either a diet low in FODMAPs or a typical Australian diet, followed by a washout period of at least 21 days, before crossing over to the alternate diet. Daily symptoms were rated using a 0- to 100-mm visual analogue scale. Almost all food was provided during the interventional diet periods, with a goal of less than 0.5 g intake of FODMAPs per meal for the low-FODMAP diet. All stools were collected from days 17-21 and assessed for frequency, weight, water content, and King's Stool Chart rating. RESULTS: Subjects with IBS had lower overall gastrointestinal symptom scores (22.8; 95% confidence interval, 16.7-28.8 mm) while on a diet low in FODMAPs, compared with the Australian diet (44.9; 95% confidence interval, 36.6-53.1 mm; P < .001) and the subjects' habitual diet. Bloating, pain, and passage of wind also were reduced while IBS patients were on the low-FODMAP diet. Symptoms were minimal and unaltered by either diet among controls. Patients of all IBS subtypes had greater satisfaction with stool consistency while on the low-FODMAP diet, but diarrhea-predominant IBS was the only subtype with altered fecal frequency and King's Stool Chart scores. CONCLUSIONS: In a controlled, cross-over study of patients with IBS, a diet low in FODMAPs effectively reduced functional gastrointestinal symptoms. This high-quality evidence supports its use as a first-line therapy. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: ACTRN12612001185853.},

   abstract = {PROBLEM/CONDITION: In 2012, the number of international tourist arrivals worldwide was projected to reach a new high of 1 billion arrivals, a 48% increase from 674 million arrivals in 2000. International travel also is increasing among U.S. residents. In 2009, U.S. residents made approximately 61 million trips outside the country, a 5% increase from 1999. Travel-related morbidity can occur during or after travel. Worldwide, 8% of travelers from industrialized to developing countries report becoming ill enough to seek health care during or after travel. Travelers have contributed to the global spread of infectious diseases, including novel and emerging pathogens. Therefore, surveillance of travel-related morbidity is an essential component of global public health surveillance and will be of greater importance as international travel increases worldwide. REPORTING PERIOD: September 1997-December 2011. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: GeoSentinel is a clinic-based global surveillance system that tracks infectious diseases and other adverse health outcomes in returned travelers, foreign visitors, and immigrants. GeoSentinel comprises 54 travel/tropical medicine clinics worldwide that electronically submit demographic, travel, and clinical diagnosis data for all patients evaluated for an illness or other health condition that is presumed to be related to international travel. Clinical information is collected by physicians with expertise or experience in travel/tropical medicine. Data collected at all sites are entered electronically into a database, which is housed at and maintained by CDC. The GeoSentinel network membership program comprises 235 additional clinics in 40 countries on six continents. Although these network members do not report surveillance data systematically, they can report unusual or concerning diagnoses in travelers and might be asked to perform enhanced surveillance in response to specific health events or concerns. RESULTS: During September 1997-December 2011, data were collected on 141,789 patients with confirmed or probable travel-related diagnoses. Of these, 23,006 (16%) patients were evaluated in the United States, 10,032 (44%) of whom were evaluated after returning from travel outside of the United States (i.e., after-travel patients). Of the 10,032 after-travel patients, 4,977 (50%) were female, 4,856 (48%) were male, and 199 (2%) did not report sex; the median age was 34 years. Most were evaluated in outpatient settings (84%), were born in the United States (76%), and reported current U.S. residence (99%). The most common reasons for travel were tourism (38%), missionary/volunteer/research/aid work (24%), visiting friends and relatives (17%), and business (15%). The most common regions of exposure were Sub-Saharan Africa (23%), Central America (15%), and South America (12%). Fewer than half (44%) reported having had a pretravel visit with a health-care provider. Of the 13,059 diagnoses among the 10,032 after-travel patients, the most common diagnoses were acute unspecified diarrhea (8%), acute bacterial diarrhea (5%), postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (5%), giardiasis (3%), and chronic unknown diarrhea (3%). The most common diagnostic groupings were acute diarrhea (22%), nondiarrheal gastrointestinal (15%), febrile/systemic illness (14%), and dermatologic (12%). Among 1,802 patients with febrile/systemic illness diagnoses, the most common diagnosis was Plasmodium falciparum malaria (19%). The rapid communication component of the GeoSentinel network has allowed prompt responses to important health events affecting travelers; during 2010 and 2011, the notification capability of the GeoSentinel network was used in the identification and public health response to East African trypanosomiasis in Eastern Zambia and North Central Zimbabwe, P. vivax malaria in Greece, and muscular sarcocystosis on Tioman Island, Malaysia. INTERPRETATION: The GeoSentinel Global Surveillance System is the largest repository of provider-based data on travel-related illness. Among ill travelers evaluated in U.S. GeoSentinel sites after returning from international travel, gastrointestinal diagnoses were most frequent, suggesting that U.S. travelers might be exposed to unsafe food and water while traveling internationally. The most common febrile/systemic diagnosis was P. falciparum malaria, suggesting that some U.S. travelers to malarial areas are not receiving or using proper malaria chemoprophylaxis or mosquito-bite avoidance measures. The finding that fewer than half of all patients reported having made a pretravel visit with a health-care provider indicates that a substantial portion of U.S. travelers might not be following CDC travelers' health recommendations for international travel. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: GeoSentinel surveillance data have helped researchers define an evidence base for travel medicine that has informed travelers' health guidelines and the medical evaluation of ill international travelers. These data suggest that persons traveling internationally from the United States to developing countries remain at risk for illness. Health-care providers should help prepare travelers properly for safe travel and provide destination-specific medical evaluation of returning ill travelers. Training for health-care providers should focus on preventing and treating a variety of travel-related conditions, particularly traveler's diarrhea and malaria.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food is one of the most commonly reported triggers of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. However, the role of diet in the aetiology and management of IBS has not been clearly established. The present study aimed to examine the dietary practices of Irish patients with IBS and to determine whether these practices increased their vulnerability to nutritional inadequacies. METHODS: A questionnaire was completed by 135 IBS patients on their perceptions of the role of diet in their symptoms and whether they restrict their diet according to the symptoms experienced. A similar questionnaire was used to investigate the perceptions of 111 healthy subjects to the gastrointestinal symptoms experienced on the consumption of food. RESULTS: Food was considered to cause or worsen their gastrointestinal symptoms in 89.6% of IBS patients compared to 55% of healthy subjects (P < 0.001). Cereal-based foods, predominantly bread or its components, were the most frequently cited (53.3%), and spicy foods (39.3%), vegetables and fatty foods (35.6% for both) also featured prominently. A significantly greater number of patients with IBS reported changing their diet to minimise symptoms compared to healthy controls (91.9% versus 45.5%, P < 0.001). In relation to whole food groups, milk products (9.6%), fruit (7.4%) and vegetables (5.2%) were those most commonly restricted, with only a small number of IBS patients seeking professional healthcare advice. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of IBS patients consider their symptoms to be related to food, and change their diet by limiting the foods that they perceive as problematic, with some restricting whole food groups. Few patients sought professional healthcare advice when implementing dietary change, possibly exposing a considerable number to an increased risk of nutritional deficiency.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder that affects approximately 10% to 20% of the general adult population in Europe and the Americas and is characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of reliable biomarkers. The pathophysiology of IBS is poorly understood and is currently thought to represent a complex interplay among the gut microbiota, low-grade inflammation, impaired mucosal barrier function, visceral hypersensitivity, gut motility, and alterations in the gut-brain axis. In any individual patient, 1 or more of these factors may interact to generate symptoms. Although up to 50% of patients report postprandial exacerbation of symptoms, few studies have critically assessed the role of diet in IBS. Furthermore, although many patients with IBS adopt any one of a host of dietary changes in an attempt to alleviate their symptoms, there has been, up until recently little scientific basis for any dietary recommendation in IBS. This review discusses the contribution of diet to the pathophysiology and symptoms of IBS.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder. It is a multifactorial disorder. Intestinal microbiota may cause the pathogenesis of IBS by contributing to abnormal gastrointestinal motility, low-grade inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, communication in the gut-brain axis, and so on. Previous attempts to identify the intestinal microbiota composition in IBS patients have yielded inconsistent and occasionally contradictory results. This inconsistency may be due to the differences in the molecular techniques employed, the sample collection and handling methods, use of single samples that are not linked to fluctuating symptoms, or other factors such as patients' diets and phenotypic characterizations. Despite these difficulties, previous studies found that the intestinal microbiota in some IBS patients was completely different from that in healthy controls, and there does appear to be a consistent theme of Firmicutes enrichment and reduced abundance of Bacteroides. Based on the differences in intestinal microbiota composition, many studies have addressed the roles of microbiota-targeted treatments, such as antibiotics and probiotics, in alleviating certain symptoms of IBS. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the associations between intestinal microbiota and IBS as well as the possible modes of action of intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS. Improving the current level of understanding of host-microbiota interactions in IBS is important not only for determining the role of intestinal microbiota in IBS pathogenesis but also for therapeutic modulation of the microbiota.},

   abstract = {At best, currently available therapies provide symptomatic relief from functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGD). No existing therapy, however, can influence the natural course of any of these disorders, prompting interest in new and safe treatment options. This paper summarizes the clinical evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and their meta-analyses of the effectiveness of probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary fiber in the treatment of FGD in the pediatric population. While it is too soon to recommend the routine use of any probiotics for treating FGD, some of these therapeutic options can provide a health benefit to patients, and therefore can be discussed with patients and/or caregivers. Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 has consistently improved symptoms of infantile colic. The use of Lactobacillus GG moderately increased treatment success in children with abdominal pain-related FGD, particularly among children with irritable bowel syndrome. Also, data from one trial suggest that VSL#3 seems to be effective in ameliorating symptoms and improving the quality of life of children affected by irritable bowel syndrome. L. reuteri DSM 17938 may help infants with constipation. Limited evidence suggests that administration of a fiber supplement is more effective than placebo for the treatment of childhood constipation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Successful treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often remains elusive. Recent studies in Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand have suggested the efficacy of a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) in the management of these patients. The aims of this study were to determine whether a diet low in FODMAPs improves symptoms in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in Spain and to analyze the predictors of a good response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in consecutive patients with FGID type IBS and functioanl abdominal bloating. At inclusion all patients underwent an assessment through a baseline demographic questionnaire of symptoms of anxiety and depression and quality of life. A hydrogen breath test with lactose and fructose was performed and a low FODMAPs diet was indicated for 2 months by expert dietitians. These tests were taken as a reference. A positive response was defined as an improvement of at least 5 points out of a possible 10 in the symptom questionnaire. RESULTS: We included 30 patients (24 women, 39 [12] years). The response to the low FODMAPs diet was positive in controlling overall symptoms and specific symptoms such as functioanl abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea and fatigue in more than 70% of patients (P<.05). By contrast, constipation was controlled in only 48% of patients (P>.05). Adherence to the diet was good in 87% of patients and was a predictor of positive response in the univariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A diet low in FODMAPs is associated with symptom improvement in patients with IBS and functioanl abdominal bloating. Adherence to the diet was a determining factor.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that the gut microbiota play an important role in gastrointestinal problems. AIM: To give clinicians a practical reference guide on the role of specified probiotics in managing particular lower gastrointestinal symptoms/problems by means of a systematic review-based consensus. METHODS: Systematic literature searching identified randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults; evidence for each symptom/problem was graded and statements developed (consensus process; 10-member panel). As results cannot be generalised between different probiotics, individual probiotics were identified for each statement. RESULTS: Thirty seven studies were included; mostly on irritable bowel syndrome [IBS; 19 studies; treatment responder rates: 18-80% (specific probiotics), 5-50% (placebo)] or antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD; 10 studies). Statements with 100% agreement and 'high' evidence levels indicated that: (i) specific probiotics help reduce overall symptom burden and abdominal pain in some IBS patients; (ii) in patients receiving antibiotics/Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy, specified probiotics are helpful as adjuvants to prevent/reduce the duration/intensity of AAD; (iii) probiotics have favourable safety in patients in primary care. Items with 70-100% agreement and 'moderate' evidence were: (i) specific probiotics help relieve overall symptom burden in some patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS, and reduce bloating/distension and improve bowel movement frequency/consistency in some IBS patients and (ii) with some probiotics, improved symptoms have led to improvement in quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Specified probiotics can provide benefit in IBS and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea; relatively few studies in other indications suggested benefits warranting further research. This study provides practical guidance on which probiotic to select for a specific problem.},

These changes are likely controlled by clock genes expressed in the intestine that are probably synchronized by neuronal and humoral signals from the suprachiasmatic nuclei, which constitute a master clock entrained by light signals from the eyes and from the environment, e.g., food availability. Acute changes in circadian rhythms--e.g., due to nonsynchronous work schedules or a transcontinental flight--may trigger intestinal discomfort. Chronic disruptions in circadian control mechanisms may predispose the individual to irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and peptic ulcer disease. A more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying temporal changes in intestinal activity might allow us to identify novel targets for developing therapeutic approaches to these disorders.},

   abstract = {Human beings and gut microbiota are in a symbiotic relationship, and the hypothesis of a "super organism" composed of the human organism and microbes has been recently proposed. The gut microbiota fulfills important metabolic and immunological tasks, and the impairment of its composition might alter homeostasis and lead to the development of microbiota-related diseases. The most common illnesses associated with alterations of the gut microbiota include inflammatory bowel disease, gastroenteric infections, irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal functional diseases, colorectal cancer, metabolic syndrome and obesity, liver diseases, allergic diseases, and neurological diseases such as autism. In theory, every disease associated with the impairment of intestinal microflora might benefit from the therapeutic modulation of the gut microbiota. A number of attempts to manipulate the microbiota have not produced identical results for every disease. Although antibiotics and probiotics have been available for a long time, the so-called fecal microbiota transplantation, which is a very old remedy, was only recently re-evaluated as a promising therapeutic approach for microbiota impairment. A comprehensive understanding of the gut microbiota composition, in states of both health and various diseases, is needed for the development of future approaches for microbiota modulation and for developing targeted therapies. In this review, we describe the role of the microbiota in several diseases and the related treatment options that are currently available.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Microbiota plays an integral part in maintaining organism homeostasis, through eliminat pathogens, anti-cancer activity, synthesis of digestive enzymes and vitamins, maintaining the continuity of the intestinal epithelium and stimulation of the gastrointestinal immune system, and encourage a quicker and more efficient immune response. Changes in the microbiota composition is often observed in patients with allergy, atopy, irritable bowel syndrome and other diseases, which is the reason for a growing interest in methods of identification of the gut microbial complex. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the state of current knowledge about two methods used in the study of intestinal microorganisms complex: the traditional culture method and genetic analysis. DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: Both techniques have advantages and disadvantages. The biggest limitation of the culture method is its inability to detect a significant number of the intestinal microbes. Using the microbiological technique we can only detect identifiable bacteria that can be grown on available substrates. For an accurate quantitative and qualitative investigation of the total microbiota, the more expensive genetic method is required. Due to genetic analysis it is possible to identify the vast number of new microorganisms and identify the dominant bacterial groups in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract. SUMMARY: Each of the presented techniques plays specific role in medicine and science. The combination of both methods may become a critical element for understanding the ecosystem of intestinal bacteria.},

   abstract = {Proteases play a diverse role in health and disease. An excessive concentration of proteases has been found in the feces of patients with inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome and been implicated in the pathogenesis of such disorders. This study examined the effect of the serine protease, trypsin, on intestinal epithelial anion secretion when added to the luminal side. A mucosal-submucosal sheet of the mouse cecum was mounted in Ussing chambers, and the short-circuit current (I sc) was measured. Trypsin added to the mucosal (luminal) side increased I sc with an ED50 value of approximately 10 muM. This I sc increase was suppressed by removing Cl(-) from the bathing solution. The I sc increase induced by 10-100 muM trypsin was substantially suppressed by tetrodotoxin, and partially inhibited by a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, but not by a muscarinic or nicotinic ACh-receptor antagonist. The trypsin-induced I sc increase was also significantly inhibited by a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor (5-HT3) antagonist and substantially suppressed by the simultaneous addition of both 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptor antagonists. We conclude that luminal trypsin activates the enteric reflex to induce anion secretion, 5-HT and substance P playing important mediating roles in this secreto-motor reflex. Luminal proteases may contribute to the cause of diarrhea occurring with some intestinal disorders.},

   abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni is a major cause of food-borne gastroenteritis worldwide. While mortality is low, morbidity imparted by post-infectious sequelae such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, Reiter syndrome/reactive arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome is significant. In addition, the economic cost is high due to lost productivity. Food animals, particularly poultry, are the main reservoirs of C. jejuni. The over-use of antibiotics in the human population and in animal husbandry has led to an increase in antibiotic-resistant infections, particularly with fluoroquinolones. This is problematic because C. jejuni gastroenteritis is clinically indistinguishable from that caused by other bacterial pathogens, and such illnesses are usually treated empirically with fluoroquinolones. Since C. jejuni is naturally transformable, acquisition of additional genes imparting antibiotic resistance is likely. Therefore, an understanding of the antibiotic resistance mechanisms in C. jejuni is needed to provide proper therapy both to the veterinary and human populations.},

   abstract = {Fibromyalgia (FM) syndrome is a disabling clinical condition of unknown cause, and only symptomatic treatment with limited benefit is available. Gluten sensitivity that does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for celiac disease (CD) is increasingly recognized as a frequent and treatable condition with a wide spectrum of manifestations that overlap with the manifestations of FM, including chronic musculoskeletal pain, asthenia, and irritable bowel syndrome. The aim of this report was to describe 20 selected patients with FM without CD who improved when placed on a gluten-free diet. An anti-transglutaminase assay, duodenal biopsy, and HLA typing were performed in all cases. CD was ruled out by negative anti-transglutaminase assay results and absence of villous atrophy in the duodenal biopsy. All patients had intraepithelial lymphocytosis without villous atrophy. Clinical response was defined as achieving at least one of the following scenarios: remission of FM pain criteria, return to work, return to normal life, or the discontinuation of opioids. The mean follow-up period was 16 months (range 5-31). This observation supports the hypothesis that non-celiac gluten sensitivity may be an underlying cause of FM syndrome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder in Iran with challenging treatment. Although trials have suggested that probiotics alleviate the complaints of patients with minimal side effects, they have not been investigated in Iranian adults. METHODS: In a randomized double-blind study, 108 eligible IBS patients (Rome III Criteria) aged 20 - 70 years who referred consecutively to a clinical center in Tehran with abdominal bloating from 2010 to 2012 received a combination probiotics or placebo twice daily for 4 weeks. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a multi-strain probiotics combination. One week prior to and throughout the treatment, the participants recorded their abdominal symptoms on a daily basis, using visual analogue scale and reported satisfactory relief of general symptoms at the end of each week. Adverse events were evaluated by self-reporting and physical examination. Continuous variables were analyzed by independent t-test and chi-square was used for binomials. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were balanced (60% female, mean age 36.7 +/- 11.5). A total of 97 (51 intervention, 46 control) completed the treatment. Intention to treat analysis was done on 108 allocated subjects. 85% of the probiotic group reported satisfactory relief of general symptoms compared with 47% in the control group (P < 0.01). A reduction in abdominal bloating and pain with probiotic was superior to placebo [-13.0 vs. -3.7 (P < 0.01), -8.2 vs. -2.1 (P = 0.02), respectively]. No severe adverse drug reaction was seen in either group. CONCLUSIONS: A 4-week period of treatment with the combination probiotics twice daily was safe, well tolerated, and effective in our patients. Further investigation is recommended for other subgroups of IBS. Trial Registration: IRCT.ir IRCT2012071010230N1.},

   abstract = {It is well established that diet influences the health of an individual and that a diet rich in plant-based foods has many advantages in relation to the health and well-being of an individual. What has been unclear until recently is the large contribution of the gut microbiota to this effect. As well as providing basic nutritional requirements, the long-term diet of an animal modifies its gut microbiota. In adults, diets that have a high proportion of fruit and vegetables and a low consumption of meat are associated with a highly diverse microbiota and are defined by a greater abundance of Prevotella compared to Bacteroides, while the reverse is associated with a diet that contains a low proportion of plant-based foods. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that the effect of the microbial ecology of the gut goes beyond the local gut immune system and is implicated in immune-related disorders, such as IBS, diabetes and inflamm-ageing. In this review, we investigate the evidence that a balanced diet leads to a balanced, diverse microbiota with significant consequences for healthy ageing by focusing on conditions of interest.},

METHODS: Ten high-level wrestlers (age: 19.3 +/- 2.5 years, height: 175.7 +/- 4.9 cm, body mass before dieting: 77.16 +/- 11.94 kg) are included in the present study. Diet was monitored for all the athletes. Athropometric measurements and a variety of functional tests such as isometric hand grip strength (IHG) and isometric back strength (IBS) with dynamometers, dynamic postural control (DPC) with star excursion balance test, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) to a standard exercise of knee pushups, were performed before and after diet completion. RESULTS: The diet was based on food restriction and dehydration. Body mass, lean body mass and body water significantly decreased (P<0.001; P<0.004, P<0.001 respectively). There was no significant decrease in fat mass (P<0.061). Furthermore, IHG and IBS significantly decreased (P<0.001). DPC significantly altered with the left supporting leg in two positions of the right leg (posteromedial, P<0.038; posterior, P<0.012). At last, RPE significantly increased (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Previous studies showed that the rapid decline of body mass affects health and muscular and energetic performance while the present study highlights that it also alters perceived exertion and dynamic postural control.},

METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed to summarize IBS-C and current treatments. MEDLINE and gastrointestinal society congress proceedings were searched to identify data from linaclotide clinical studies in adults with IBS-C published between January 2010 and August 2012. RESULTS: IBS-C patients have chronic, relapsing symptoms. Rome III diagnostic criteria define the presence of chronic abdominal pain that improves with defecation and has onset associated with changes in stool frequency or form as a key element of IBS-C and other IBS subtypes. IBS-C patients generally are not completely satisfied with existing therapies. A therapy that treats bowel and abdominal symptoms effectively and can be taken safely on a chronic basis is a current unmet need for IBS-C patients. The guanylate cyclase-C agonist linaclotide has been shown to reduce visceral hypersensitivity in preclinical studies and to improve abdominal pain and constipation symptoms in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of IBS-C patients. CONCLUSIONS: IBS-C is a functional gastrointestinal disorder with chronic, relapsing abdominal and constipation symptoms. By virtue of its effects in relieving abdominal pain by reducing visceral hypersensitivity and improving constipation symptoms by increasing intestinal secretion and accelerating transit, linaclotide may be uniquely positioned for a role in the management of IBS-C patients.},

   abstract = {Perinatal nutrition is thought to affect the long-term risk of the adult to develop metabolic syndrome. We hypothesized that maternal supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid during pregnancy and lactation would protect offspring fed a high-fat diet from developing metabolic disturbances. Thus, two groups of female hamsters were fed a low-fat control diet, either alone (LC) or enriched with n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) (LO), through the gestational and lactation periods. After weaning, male pups were randomized to separate groups that received either a control low-fat diet (LC) or a high-fat diet (HC) for 16 weeks. Four groups of pups were defined (LC-LC, LC-HC, LO-LC and LO-HC), based on the combinations of maternal and weaned diets. Maternal n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation was associated with reduced levels of basal plasma glucose, hepatic triglycerides secretion and postprandial lipemia in the LO-HC group compared to the LC-HC group. Respiratory parameters were not affected by maternal supplementation. In contrast, n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation significantly enhanced the activities of citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase compared to the offspring of unsupplemented mothers. Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha expression levels were not affected by n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation. These results provide evidence for a beneficial effect of n-3 LC-PUFA maternal supplementation in hamsters on the subsequent risk of metabolic syndrome. Underlying mechanisms may include improved lipid metabolism and activation of the mitochondrial oxidative pathway.},

However, many of the physiological functions of the leaves against oral infection and resultant illness remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a hot-water extract of the leaves of Magnolia obovata on diarrhea induced by rotavirus (RV), a major cause of acute diarrhea. RV strain SA11 was mixed with the M. obovata leaf extract and inoculated orally to neonatal BALB/c mouse pups. Simultaneous inoculation of SA11 with the extract significantly decreased the incidence of diarrhea. In addition, the extract significantly inhibited cytopathic effects and mRNA expression of viral proteins in SA11-infected MA104 cells. Two flavonoid glycosides, quercitrin and rutin, were strongly suggested to be major anti-RV agents in the extract by serial solvent extraction and reversed-phase HPLC-ESI-MS analysis. Our results suggest that the hot-water extract of M. obovata leaves can be used as a medicine or food additive to prevent and ameliorate RV-induced diarrhea in individuals that may have difficulty in benefitting from the RV vaccines.},

STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected that reported the number of E. coli O157 cases that developed reactive arthritis (ReA), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, or Guillain Barre syndrome. METHODS: Three levels of screening and data extraction of articles were conducted using predefined data fields. Meta-analysis was performed on unique outcome measures using a random-effects model, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) value. Meta-regression was used to explore the influence of nine study-level variables on heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 82 studies were identified reporting 141 different outcome measures; 81 reported on HUS and one reported on ReA. Depending on the number of cases of E. coli O157, the estimate for the proportion of E. coli O157 cases that develop HUS ranged from 17.2% in extra-small studies (<50 cases) to 4.2% in extra-large studies (>1000 cases). Heterogeneity was significantly associated with group size (p<0.0001); however, the majority of the heterogeneity was unexplained. CONCLUSIONS: High unexplained heterogeneity indicated that the study-level factors examined had a minimal influence on the variation of estimates reported.},

The objective of the study was to determine via systematic review and meta-analysis the proportion of Campylobacter cases that develop chronic sequelae. METHODS: A systematic review of English language articles published prior to July 2011 located using Pubmed, Agricola, CabDirect, and Food Safety and Technology Abstracts. Observational studies reporting the number of Campylobacter cases that developed reactive arthritis (ReA), Reiter's syndrome (RS), haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ,Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) or Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) were included. Data extraction through independent extraction of articles by four reviewers (two per article). Random effects meta-analysis was performed and heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) value. Meta-regression was used to explore the influence of study level variables on heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 31 studies were identified; 20 reported on ReA, 2 reported on RS, 9 reported on IBS, 3 studies reported on IBD, 8 reported on GBS, 1 reported on MFS and 3 reported on HUS. The proportion of Campylobacter cases that developed ReA was 2.86% (95% CI 1.40% - 5.61%, I(2) = 97.7%), irritable bowel syndrome was 4.01% (95% CI 1.41% - 10.88%, I(2) = 99.2%). Guillain Barre syndrome was 0.07% (95% CI 0.03% - 0.15%, I(2) = 72.7%). CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of Campylobacter cases develop a chronic sequela.

There was insufficient data in the literature to calculate a pooled estimate for RS, HUS, IBD, GBS, or MFS. The pooled estimate of the proportion of cases of NTS that developed ReA and IBS had substantive heterogeneity, limiting the applicability of a single estimate.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, which is involved in visceral pain signalling, has been shown to be up-regulated in IBS. Activation of TRPV1 leads to the release of neuropeptides, such as somatostatin and substance P (SP). We hypothesized that increased pain perception in IBS could be explained by increased transcription in TRPV1 and/or altered levels of neuropeptides. We therefore assessed the transcription of TRPV1 and the mucosal concentration of somatostatin and SP in IBS in comparison to healthy volunteers and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission as disease controls, and to ascertain their relationship to pain symptoms. METHOD: Sigmoid colonic mucosal samples were collected from 12 patients with IBS, 34 patients with UC in remission and 9 healthy volunteers, in which groups TRPV1 mRNA levels were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and neuropeptide concentrations by radioimmunoassay. Pain symptom intensity was determined by questionnaires. RESULTS: Transcription of TRPV1 as well as the concentration of neuropeptides were significantly higher in IBS, but only the former correlated with pain symptom severity. CONCLUSION: Increased transcription of TRPV1 may provide a possible explanation for pain generation in IBS. While the neuropeptides SP and somatostatin were both found to be increased in IBS, these changes are not sufficient to explain pain generation. Pain generation in IBS is probably explained by a complex redundancy in the regulation of local nociceptive mechanisms, which remains a subject of intensive investigation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been associated with psychiatric comorbidity and alterations in serotonergic metabolism. Tryptophan is the precursor of serotonin (5-HT), but it is mainly catabolized through the kynurenine pathway. This pathway may also be involved in the pathogenesis of IBS by virtue of deviating tryptophan from the 5-HT pathway resulting in 5-HT deficiency. We therefore aimed to ascertain the mucosal and systemic concentrations of 5-HT and kynurenic acid (KYNA), a principal kynurenine metabolite. METHODS: Duodenal mucosal biopsy specimens and platelet poor plasma samples were obtained from 15 healthy volunteers and 15 IBS patients. Psychological state was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Symptom Checklist-90. RESULTS: IBS patients showed significantly lower mucosal and higher systemic concentrations of both 5-HT and KYNA compared to healthy controls. Also, significant correlation between mucosal but not plasma concentrations of KYNA and 5-HT and psychological state in IBS was observed. CONCLUSION: The observation that mucosal KYNA and 5-HT are both decreased in IBS does not support the hypothesis that increased activation along the kynurenic pathway results in relative 5-HT deficiency. However, an increased release of these substances from the intestine to the systemic compartment may lead to a decrease in intestinal KYNA and 5-HT levels, resulting in disturbance of intestinal homeostasis. Thus, changes in psychological states observed in IBS patients may be secondary to alterations in gastrointestinal function, and in particular kynurenine and/or 5-HT metabolism.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations in serotonergic (5-HT) metabolism and/or intestinal integrity have been associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIMS: To assess the effects of the precursor of 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), on mucosal 5-HT availability and intestinal integrity, and to assess potential differences between healthy controls and IBS patients. METHODS: Fifteen IBS patients and 15 healthy volunteers participated in this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study. Intestinal integrity was assessed by dual-sugar test and by determining the mucosal expression of tight junction proteins after ingestion of an oral bolus of 100 mg 5-HTP or placebo. Mucosal serotonergic metabolism was assessed in duodenal biopsy samples. RESULTS: 5-HTP administration significantly increased mucosal levels of 5-HIAA, the main metabolite of 5-HT, in both healthy controls (7.1 +/- 1.7 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.7 pmol/mg, 5-HTP vs. placebo, P = 0.02) and IBS patients (20.0 +/- 4.8 vs. 8.1 +/- 1.3 pmol/mg, 5-HTP vs. placebo, P = 0.02), with the latter group showing a significantly larger increase. Lactulose/L-rhamnose ratios were significantly lower after administration of 5-HTP (P < 0.05) in healthy controls and were accompanied by redistribution of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), pointing to reinforcement of the barrier. In IBS, expression of the tight junction proteins was significantly lower compared to healthy controls, and 5-HTP resulted in a further decrease in occludin expression. CONCLUSIONS: Oral 5-HTP induced alterations in mucosal 5-HT metabolism. In healthy controls, a reinforcement of the intestinal barrier was seen whereas such reaction was absent in IBS patients. This could indicate the presence of a serotonin-mediated mechanism aimed to reinforce intestinal barrier function, which seems to dysfunction in IBS patients.},

Its prevalence has been reported to be around 10-15 % in North America and constitutes the most common cause for gastroenterology referral. Unfortunately, the pathophysiology of IBS is not completely understood. Not surprisingly, the management strategies can leave the patients with inadequate symptom control, making IBS a debilitating gastrointestinal syndrome. Dietary interventions as a treatment strategy for IBS have been recently evaluated. One such intervention includes dietary restriction of fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs). FODMAPs define a group of short-chain carbohydrates that are incompletely absorbed in small intestine and later fermented in the colon. Evidence in the form of randomized controlled trials and observational studies have evaluated the mechanism of action and efficacy of low-FODMAP diet. This dietary intervention has showed promising results in symptom reduction in IBS patients. However, latest trials have also shown that the low-FODMAP diet is associated with marked changes in gut microbiota specifically reduction in microbiota with prebiotic properties. Implications of such changes on gastrointestinal health need to be further evaluated in future trials.},

METHODOLOGY: Patients diagnosed with IBS at the study centre were followed for their clinical features, course over the period of time, management and its results. Only those patients were included in the study who completed the follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 292 patients with mean age of 40.44 +/- 13.69 years were inducted. There were 156 (53.4%) males and 136 (46.6%) females. Nearly all male and female patients had abdominal pain and bloating. However, constipation was seen in 79.4% females and 71.6 males. Diarrhea was seen in 46.5% females and 42.7% males. Both constipation and diarrhea were seen in 27.3% female and 15.6% males. A high number of patients had concomitant illnesses and a large proportion of them had sleep disturbances, exacerbations with stress and had food sensitivities. CONCLUSION: This longitudinal follow-up study showed that, in our setting, there were more males suffering from this illness; females had more constipation-dominant features. Prognosis over the course of illness was excellent in all patients.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorders. It is a multifactorial disorder with its pathogenesis attributed to abnormal gastrointestinal motility, low-grade inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, communication in the gut-brain axis, and so on. Traditionally, IBS has been treated with diet and lifestyle modification, fiber supplementation, psychological therapy, and pharmacological treatment. Carbohydrates are intermingled with a wide range of regularly consumed food including grains such as rye and wheat, vegetables, fruits, and legumes. Short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed exert osmotic effects in the intestinal lumen increasing its water volume, and are rapidly fermented by bacteria with consequent gas production. These effects may be the basis for the induction of most of the gastrointestinal symptoms. This has led to the use of lactose-free diets in those with lactose intolerance and of fructose-reduced diets for fructose malabsorption. As all poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates have similar and additive effects in the intestine, a concept has been developed to regard them collectively as FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) and to evaluate a dietary approach that restricts them all. Based on the observational and comparative studies, and randomized-controlled trials, FODMAPs have been shown to trigger gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS. Food choice via the low FODMAPs and potentially other dietary strategies is now a realistic and efficacious therapeutic approach for managing symptoms of IBS.},

An increasing number of disorders are associated with disturbances in this ecosystem. Also patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) show an altered composition of their gut microbiota. IBS is a multifactorial chronic disorder characterised by various abdominal complaints and a worldwide prevalence of 10-20%. Even though its aetiology and pathophysiology are complex and not well understood, it is widely accepted that aberrations along the microbe-gut-brain axis are involved. In this review, it will be discussed how exogenous factors, e.g. antibiotics, can cause disbalance in the intestinal microbiota and thereby contribute to the development of IBS. In addition, several new IBS treatment options that aim at re-establishing a healthy, beneficial ecosystem will be described. These include antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics and faecal transplantation.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: A prospective cohort study using electronic medical records was undertaken to estimate the relative risk (RR) of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) following acute gastroenteritis (GE) in primary-care patients in The Netherlands and explore risk factors. Patients aged 18-70 years who consulted for GE symptoms from 1998 to 2009, met inclusion/exclusion criteria and had at least 1 year of follow-up data were included. Patients with non-GE consultations, matched by age, gender, consulting practice and time of visit, served as the reference group. At 1 year, 1.2% of GE patients (N = 2428) had been diagnosed with IBS compared to 0.3% of the reference group (N = 2354). GE patients had increased risk of IBS [RR 4.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.02-11.63]. For GE patients, concomitant cramps and history of psycho-social consultations were significantly associated with increased risk. GE patients had increased risk of IBS up to 5 years post-exposure (RR 5.40, 95% CI 2.60-11.24), suggesting there may be other contributing factors.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder and affects up to 12% to 15% of adults in the United States, with a higher prevalence among women and those younger than 50 years. IBS adversely impacts quality of life and medical expenditures, with significant costs arising from healthcare visits and reduced workplace productivity. Recent studies have shown that the adverse effects of IBS are so significant that many patients are willing to accept risks of adverse events from effective treatment to gain symptom relief. Alosetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for women with severe diarrhea-predominant IBS that has not responded to traditional therapies. Alosetron yields overall improvements in IBS symptoms in 51% of patients vs 36% treated with placebo, with efficacy continuing undiminished over the course of a 48-week randomized, controlled trial. In real-world clinical practice, patients receiving alosetron had significant improvements in multiple IBS-related clinical parameters, including the new FDA IBS-diarrhea composite endpoint, lower gastrointestinal symptoms, fecal incontinence, and quality of life. Ischemic colitis and complications of constipation have been rare in occurrence. After nearly a decade of alosetron use under the risk management plan, adjudication of ischemic colitis and complications of constipation cases indicate that their incidence rates have remained low and stable.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set a rigorous standard for defining patient responders in irritable bowel syndrome-C (IBS-C; i.e., FDA's Responder Endpoint) for regulatory approval. However, this endpoint's utility for health-care practitioners to assess clinical response has not been determined. We analyzed pooled IBS-C linaclotide trial data to evaluate clinically significant responses in linaclotide-treated patients who did not meet the FDA responder definition. METHODS: Percentages of FDA non-responders reporting improvement in abdominal pain, bowel function and/or global relief measures were determined using pooled data from two linaclotide Phase 3 IBS-C trials. KEY RESULTS: 1602 IBS-C patients enrolled; 34% of linaclotide-treated and 17% of placebo-treated patients met the FDA Responder Endpoint (p < 0.0001). Among FDA non-responders at week 12, 63% of linaclotide-treated patients reported their abdominal pain was at least somewhat relieved, compared with 48% of placebo-treated patients. For stool frequency, 62% of linaclotide-treated patients reported that they were at least somewhat improved at week 12, compared with 46% of placebo-treated patients. For global IBS symptoms, 65% of linaclotide-treated patients reported at least some IBS-symptom relief, 43% reported adequate relief of IBS symptoms, and 57% reported being satisfied with linaclotide treatment, vs placebo rates of 48%, 34%, and 41% respectively. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Most linaclotide-treated IBS-C patients who were FDA non-responders reported some improvement in abdominal pain and stool frequency, and global relief/satisfaction. In addition to the FDA Responder Endpoint, differing response thresholds and symptom-specific change from baseline should be considered by clinicians for a complete understanding of clinical response to linaclotide and other IBS-C therapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) represents a significant burden to patients and healthcare systems due to its prevalence and lack of successful symptomatic resolution with established treatment options. Linaclotide 290 mug has recently been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for moderate-to-severe IBS-C and by the US Food and Drug Administration for IBS-C (290 mug dose) and for chronic constipation (145 mug dose). AIM: To summarise data leading to the approval of linaclotide for IBS-C, with focus on EMA-pre-specified outcome measures. METHODS: Literature search of a peer-review database (PubMed) and review of congress abstracts on linaclotide preclinical and clinical trial data in IBS-C. RESULTS: Preclinical studies suggest that the guanylate cyclase C agonist (GCCA) linaclotide acts through elevation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, leading to accelerated gastrointestinal (GI) transit through increased fluid secretion and reduced visceral hypersensitivity. Clinical trial data demonstrate that linaclotide improves abdominal symptoms (pain, bloating) and bowel symptoms (constipation) compared with placebo in patients with IBS-C. The most frequent side effect, diarrhoea, results from the therapeutic action of linaclotide. Linaclotide acts locally in the GI tract with minimal systemic exposure, resulting in low oral bioavailability and thus a low risk of relevant systemic adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Linaclotide, a first-in-class GCCA, is a promising new drug with a novel, dual mechanism of action that, unlike more well-established agents, can relieve the abdominal pain, bloating and constipation associated with IBS-C and has a low propensity for systemic side effects.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the usefulness of a test meal containing lactulose in the non-invasive assessment of visceral sensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and to identify subsets of IBS patients based on gastrointestinal (GI) symptom generation. METHODS: We included 43 patients with IBS (Rome III) and 29 healthy controls. The fasted subjects were served three test meals consisting of a 400-ml liquid breakfast alone or containing lactulose (15 or 25 g) in a double-blind crossover design. Seven GI symptoms, overall digestive comfort, and exhaled H2/CH4 were assessed at baseline and every 15 min during 4 h after meal intake. Anxiety and depression were assessed only at baseline. A mapping of the seven GI symptoms was done using a Principal Component Analysis (4 h mean area under the curve, AUC). Independently, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on the same parameters to identify GI symptom-based IBS clusters. RESULTS: All three tests were well tolerated. The 25 g lactulose challenge enabled discrimination of IBS from healthy controls according to the symptom response. This challenge also enabled clustering of IBS subjects in two subgroups based mainly on bloating, distension, and discomfort symptoms (2,457 (2,043-2,872), 2,450 (1,910-2,990), 2,602 (2,126-3,079) vs. 537 (383-691), 619 (458-780), 643 (432-854); 4 h mean AUC; P<0.0001), overall digestive comfort (1807 (1318-2295) vs. 3350 (2942-3758); 4 h mean AUC; P<0.0001), and anxiety at baseline (9.2 (7.0-11.5) vs. 5.5 (4.2-6.9); Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale anxiety mean scores; P=0.003). This clustering was independent of the Rome III subtype and the amount of exhaled H2/CH4. CONCLUSIONS: The lactulose challenge test seems to be a promising tool to assess visceral sensitivity in IBS, and to subgroup IBS patients based on their symptom pattern.},

METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The participants took probiotics (Lacidofil) or placebo twice a day for 12 weeks. The cancer-related quality of life (FACT), patient's health-9 (PHQ-9), and bowel symptom questionnaires were completed by each participant. RESULTS: We obtained data for 32 participants in the placebo group and 28 participants in the probiotics group. The mean ages of total participants were 56.18 +/- .86 years and 58.3% were male. Administration of probiotics significantly decreased the proportion of patients suffering from irritable bowel symptoms (0 week vs. 12 week; 67.9% vs. 45.7%, p=0.03), improved colorectal cancer-related FACT (baseline vs. 12 weeks: 19.79 +/- 4.66 vs. 21.18 +/- 3.67, p=0.04) and fatigue-related FACT (baseline vs. 12 weeks: 43.00 (36.50-45.50) vs. 44.50 (38.50-49.00), p=0.02) and PHQ-9 scores (0 weeks vs. 12 weeks; 3.00 (0-8.00) vs. 1.00 (0-3.00), p=0.01). We found significant differences in changes of the proportion of patients with bowel symptoms (p<0.05), functional well-being scores (p=0.04) and cancer-related FACT scores (p=0.04) between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Probiotics improved bowel symptoms and quality of life in colorectal cancer survivors.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder without any structural or metabolic abnormalities that sufficiently explain the symptoms, which include abdominal pain and discomfort, and bowel habit changes such as diarrhea and constipation. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial: visceral hypersensitivity, dysmotility, psychosocial factors, genetic or environmental factors, dysregulation of the brain-gut axis, and altered intestinal microbiota have all been proposed as possible causes. The human intestinal microbiota are composed of more than 1000 different bacterial species and 10(14) cells, and are essential for the development, function, and homeostasis of the intestine, and for individual health. The putative mechanisms that explain the role of microbiota in the development of IBS include altered composition or metabolic activity of the microbiota, mucosal immune activation and inflammation, increased intestinal permeability and impaired mucosal barrier function, sensory-motor disturbances provoked by the microbiota, and a disturbed gut-microbiota-brain axis. Therefore, modulation of the intestinal microbiota through dietary changes, and use of antibiotics, probiotics, and anti-inflammatory agents has been suggested as strategies for managing IBS symptoms. This review summarizes and discusses the accumulating evidence that intestinal microbiota play a role in the pathophysiology and management of IBS.},

   abstract = {The human gastrointestinal tract inhabits a complex microbial ecosystem that plays a vital role in host health through its contributions to nutrient synthesis and digestion, protection from pathogens, and promoting maturation of host innate and adapt immune systems. The development of gut microbiota primarily occurs during infancy and is influenced by multiple factors, including prenatal exposure; gestational age; mode of delivery; feeding type; pre-, pro-, and antibiotic use; and host genetics. In genetically susceptible individuals, changes in the gut microbiota induced by environmental factors may contribute to the development of immune-related disorders in childhood, including atopic diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Pre- and probiotics may be useful in the prevention and treatment of some immune-related diseases by modulating gut microbiota and regulating host mucosal immune function. The review will discuss recent findings on the environmental factors that influence development of gut microbiota during infancy and its potential impact on some immune-related diseases in childhood. The use of pre- and probiotics for prevention and intervention of several important diseases in early life will also be reviewed.},

The aim of the present study was to validate a Norwegian translation of the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), and to assess the impact of fatigue in patients with self-reported food hypersensitivity and IBS, as compared with healthy controls. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with unexplained self-reported food hypersensitivity and IBS, who participated in the validation of the FIS completed the following additional questionnaires: the Short Form of Nepean Dyspepsia Index for assessment of quality of life, the Subjective Health Complaint Inventory, and questionnaires for diagnosis and severity of IBS. Impact of fatigue was studied in 43 patients with unexplained self-reported food hypersensitivity, 70% diagnosed with IBS, and 42 healthy controls. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha for the FIS was 0.98, indicating excellent agreement between individual items. Scores on the FIS correlated with scores on the Short Form of Nepean Dyspepsia Index (r = 0.50, P = 0.001), indicating good convergent validity, and were higher in patients (median 85.0, interquartile range 36.8-105.3) than in controls (median 14.0, interquartile range 3.0-29.0, P </= 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The Norwegian translation of the FIS performed excellently in patients with unexplained self-reported food hypersensitivity and IBS, with patients reporting significantly more impact of chronic fatigue than healthy controls.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common reason for gastroenterology consultations. The diverse in symptomatology of the disease comes from its rich etiopathogenesis. Recently studies talk about infectious etiology of IBS and because of that it is necessary to expand its diagnostics by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) test. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in patients with constipation (IBS-C) and diarrhea (IBS-D) irritable bowel syndrome with regard to nutrition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 46 subjects (33 women and 13 men) in average age of 44 years, which were divided into two groups: diarrhea and constipation IBS. All patients underwent hydrogen breath test studying bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. In addition, each person had fulfilled a feeding questionnaire. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Student's t-test, Pearson test. RESULTS: It has been shown that there is no statistical significances between the prevalence of SIBO in form of diarrheal IBS and constipation IBS and gender. Average value of increments of hydrogen in breath during the test was higher in IBS-C in comparison with IBS-D, which was the highest in the intestine bacterial overgrowth in patients with IBS-C. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS showed that there is no relationship between the type and frequency of consumption of milk, meat, fruit and vegetables, sweets and coffee and the prevalence of SIBO in form of diarrhea and constipation IBS. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of constipation or diarrhea irritable bowel syndrome is not related to gender. SIBO is more common in patients with IBS-C than in IBS-D group. There is no relationship between the type of food consumed and the amount of SIBO in people with IBS. Type of food intake do not affect the status of the intestinal flora of people with IBS.},

METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention clinical trial with three parallel arms was designed. A total of 84 patients (53 female, 31 male; age range 20-70 years) with IBS and diarrhea according to Rome-III criteria were randomly allocated to receive one capsule a day for 6 wk containing: (1) I.31 high dose (n = 28); (2) I.31 low dose (n = 27); and (3) placebo (n = 29). At baseline, and 3 and 6 wk of treatment, patients filled the IBSQoL, Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI), and global symptom relief questionnaires. RESULTS: During treatment, IBS-QoL increased in all groups, but this increment was significantly larger in patients treated with I.31 than in those receiving placebo (P = 0.008). After 6 wk of treatment, IBS-QoL increased by 18 +/- 3 and 22 +/- 4 points in the high and the low dose groups, respectively (P = 0.041 and P = 0.023 vs placebo), but only 9 +/- 3 in the placebo group. Gut-specific anxiety, as measured with VSI, also showed a significantly greater improvement after 6 wk of treatment in patients treated with probiotics (by 10 +/- 2 and 14 +/- 2 points, high and low dose respectively, P < 0.05 for both vs 7 +/- 1 score increment in placebo). Symptom relief showed no significant changes between groups. No adverse drug reactions were reported following the consumption of probiotic or placebo capsules. CONCLUSION: A new combination of three different probiotic bacteria was superior to placebo in improving IBS-related quality of life in patients with IBS and diarrhea.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The pharmacology, pharmaco-kinetics, and clinical efficacy and safety of linaclotide in the management of chronic constipation (CC) and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) are reviewed. SUMMARY: Linaclotide (Linzess, Forest Pharmaceuticals) is a 14-amino acid peptide indicated for the treatment of adults with CC and IBS-C. Linaclotide acts on guanylate cyclase-C receptors on the luminal membrane to increase chloride and bicarbonate secretions into the intestine and inhibit the absorption of sodium ions, thus increasing the secretion of water into the lumen and improving defecation; the drug is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation. Linaclotide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for oral once-daily administration at doses of 145 mug for CC and 290 mug for IBS-C. In placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials, linaclotide significantly increased weekly spontaneous bowel movements and complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) while reducing abdominal pain in patients with CC. In patients with IBS-C, linaclotide was demonstrated to be effective in meeting FDA-recommended endpoints such as reductions of at least 30% from baseline in abdominal pain scores and CSBM frequency. The most common adverse effect of linaclotide is diarrhea, which was reported in 16-20% of clinical trial participants. CONCLUSION: Linaclotide is an important advance in the treatment of CC and IBS-C, with a novel mechanism of action resulting in accelerated intestinal transit. In clinical trials, linaclotide demonstrated efficacy relative to placebo for treatment of both CC and IBS-C. Linaclotide's adverse effects are generally mild and confined to the gastrointestinal tract.},

When the concentration of fructose in certain food is present in excess of glucose concentration some individuals may develop fructose malabsorption. OBJECTIVES: To report the frequency of fructose malabsorption utilizing the hydrogen breath test in children with gastrointestinal and/or nutritional disorders. METHODS: Between July 2011 and July 2012, 43 patients with gastrointestinal and/or nutritional disorders, from both sexes, were consecutively studied, utilizing the hydrogen breath test with loads of the following carbohydrates: lactose, glucose, fructose and lactulose. Fructose was offered in a 10% aqueous solution in the dose of 1 g/kg body weight. Samples were collected fasting and at every 15 minutes after the intake of the aqueous solution for a 2 hour period. Malabsorption was considered when there was an increase of >20 ppm of hydrogen over the fasting level, and intolerance was diagnosed if gastrointestinal symptoms would appear. RESULTS: The age of the patients varied from 3 months to 16 years, 24 were boys. The following diagnosis were established: irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea in 16, functional abdominal pain in 8, short stature in 10, lactose intolerance in 3, celiac disease in 1, food allergy in 1 and giardiasis in 1 patient. Fructose malabsorption was characterized in 13 (30.2%) patients, and intolerance in 1 (2.3%) patient. The most frequent fructose malabsorption was characterized in 7 (16.3%) patients with irritable bowel syndrome and in 4 (9.3%) patients with functional abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain were the main cause of fructose malabsorption.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by heterogeneous pathophysiology and low response to treatment. Up to 60% of IBS patients suffers from visceral hypersensitivity, which is associated with symptom severity and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Recently, positive effects of probiotics in IBS have been reported, but overall the response was modest. We performed a study in IBS patients, characterized by visceral hypersensitivity measured with the rectal barostat, aiming to assess the effect of 6 weeks of multispecies probiotic mix on visceral pain perception. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in forty Rome III IBS patients with visceral hypersensitivity. Prior to intake, patients kept a 2-week symptom diary and underwent a rectal barostat measurement. When hypersensitivity was confirmed, participation was allowed and patients received a multispecies probiotic with in vitro proven potential beneficial effects on mechanisms contributing to visceral hypersensitivity (six different probiotic strains; 10(9) cfu/g), or a placebo product of one sachet (5 g) per day for 6 weeks. At the end of the intervention period, visceroperception and symptoms were reassessed. KEY RESULTS: Thirty-five patients completed the trial. The percentage of patients with visceral hypersensitivity decreased significantly in the probiotic and placebo group (76.5% and 71.4%, respectively; N.S. between groups). Improvement in pain scores and mean symptom score did not differ between the probiotic and placebo group. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: In this placebo-controlled trial in IBS patients with visceral hypersensitivity, no significant effect of a multispecies probiotic on viscerperception was observed. The study has been registered in the US National Library of Medicine (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00702026).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our objective was to evaluate the performance of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Responder Endpoint for clinical trials in IBS-C, using data from two large Phase 3 clinical trials of linaclotide. The FDA interim endpoint requires that, for 50% of trial weeks, patients report >/=30% decrease in Abdominal Pain at its worst and (in the same week) an increase in Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movements (CSBMs) of >/=1 from baseline. METHODS: Anchor-based methodology was used to estimate thresholds of clinically meaningful change using symptom-specific patient rating of change questions (PRCQs) and symptom severity questions. The diagnostic accuracy of the FDA Responder Endpoint was assessed using sensitivity/specificity-based methods. KEY RESULTS: Using anchor-based methods, the estimates of the clinically meaningful improvement thresholds for Abdominal Pain ranged from 25.9% to 32.4% and thresholds for increase in weekly CSBM rate ranged from 1.4 to 1.6 CSBMs per week. Compared with the symptom-specific PRCQs for patient rating of relief, the FDA Responder Endpoint has a sensitivity of 60.7%, a specificity of 93.5%, and an accuracy of 82.0%. Changing the number of weeks required to be a responder or the percentage improvement in the Abdominal Pain criteria did not result in notable improvement in the accuracy of the FDA Responder Endpoint. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The FDA Responder Endpoint for IBS-C clinical trials represents clinically meaningful improvements in IBS-C symptoms for patients with excellent specificity and reasonable sensitivity.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review aims to update the reader on current developments in our understanding of how the gut microbiota impact on inflammatory bowel disease and the irritable bowel syndrome. It will also consider current efforts to modulate the microbiota for therapeutic effect. RECENT FINDINGS: Gene polymorphisms associated with inflammatory bowel disease increasingly suggest that interaction with the microbiota drives pathogenesis. This may be through modulation of the immune response, mucosal permeability or the products of microbial metabolism. Similar findings in irritable bowel syndrome have reinforced the role of gut-specific factors in this 'functional' disorder. Metagenomic analysis has identified alterations in pathways and interactions with the ecosystem of the microbiome that may not be recognized by taxonomic description alone, particularly in carbohydrate metabolism. Treatments targeted at the microbial stimulus with antibiotics, probiotics or prebiotics have all progressed in the past year. Studies on the long-term effects of treatment on the microbiome suggest that dietary intervention may be needed for prolonged efficacy. SUMMARY: The microbiome represents 'the other genome', and to appreciate its role in health and disease will be as challenging as with our own genome. Intestinal diseases occur at the front line of our interaction with the microbiome and their future treatment will be shaped as we unravel our relationship with it.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome is a highly prevalent condition responsible for almost one third of visits to the gastroenterologist and huge expenses for diagnosis, treatment and loss of working days. A unique pathophysiologic mechanism has not been elucidated yet and several possibilities have been proposed such as senso-perception and motor disturbances, the effect of stress and anxiety, serotonin receptor failures, activation of abnormal brain areas and pain modulation differences, among others. The absence of a biological marker has led the investigators to consider this syndrome as an exclusion diagnostic condition, once the organic diseases have been discarded The changes in gut microbiota have recently raised great interest among gastroenterologists. The study of the small intestinal bowel overgrowth syndrome, the effect of antibiotics upon the flora, the recognition of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome and the action of probiotics, together with the effect of malabsortion of diet carbohydrates have brought some new light in our knowledge. The present update will focus on the published evidence about the subject, bearing in mind that the mechanisms elicited here are only suitable for a subgroup of patients.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating. Interestingly, there is now evidence of the presence of a low-grade inflammatory status in many IBS patients, including histopathological and mucosal cytokine levels in the colon, as well as the presence of IBS-like symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The use of a genetically engineered food-grade bacterium, such as Lactococcus lactis, secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has been proven by many pre-clinical studies to be a successful therapy to treat colon inflammation. In this study, we first reproduced the recovery-recurrence periods observed in IBS-patients in a new chronic model characterized by 2 episodes of DiNitro-BenzeneSulfonic-acid (DNBS)-challenge and we tested the effects of a recombinant strain of L. lactis secreting IL-10 under a Stress-Inducible Controlled Expression (SICE) system. In vivo gut permeability, colonic serotonin levels, cytokine profiles, and spleen cell populations were then measured as readouts of a low-grade inflammation. In addition, since there is increasing evidence that gut microbiota tightly regulates gut barrier function, tight junction proteins were also measured by qRT-PCR after administration of recombinant L. lactis in DNBS-treated mice. Strikingly, oral administration of L. lactis secreting active IL-10 in mice resulted in significant protective effects in terms of permeability, immune activation, and gut-function parameters. Although genetically engineered bacteria are, for now, used only as a "proof-of-concept," our study validates the interest in the use of the novel SICE system in L. lactis to express therapeutic molecules, such as IL-10, locally at mucosal surfaces.},

   abstract = {A wide range of food-derived bioactive peptides have been shown to exert health-promoting actions and are therefore considered functional foods or nutraceuticals. Some of these actions are related to the maintenance, reinforcement or repairment of the intestinal barrier function (IBF) whose role is to selectively allow the absorption of water, nutrients and ions while preventing the influx of microorganisms from the intestinal lumen. Alterations in the IBF have been related to many disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease or metabolic syndrome. Components of IBF are the intestinal epithelium, the mucus layer, secretory immunoglobulin A and cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Here we review the effects of food derived bioactive peptides on these IBF components. In vitro and in vivo effects, both in healthy and disease states, have been reviewed. Although limited, the available information indicates a potential for food-derived peptides to modify IBF and to contribute to disease treatment, but further research is needed to better isolate responsible peptides, and to help define their mode of action.},

   abstract = {Active hexose correlated compound (AHCC) is a commercial extract of Basidiomycetes fungi enriched in oligosaccharides that is used as a human nutritional supplement for various purposes in humans. Our aim was to study the anti-inflammatory effect of AHCC in the CD4+ CD62L(+) T cell transfer model of colitis, considered one of the closest to the human disease. Colitis was induced by transfer of CD4(+) CD62L(+) T cells to recombination activating gene 1(-/-) mice. AHCC (75 mg/d) was administered by gavage as a post-treatment. Three groups were established: noncolitic, colitic (CD4(+) CD62L(+) transferred mice treated with vehicle), and AHCC (colitic treated with AHCC). AHCC improved colitis, as evidenced by a 24% lower colonic myeloperoxidase and a 21% lower alkaline phosphatase activity. In addition, a decreased secretion of proinflammatory genes assessed by RT-qPCR was observed, particularly TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. Ex vivo mesenteric lymph node cells obtained from AHCC treated mice exhibited a fully normalized production of IL-6, IL-17, and IL-10 (p < 0.05). Also, AHCC treated mice exhibited decreased STAT4 and IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation in splenic CD4(+) cells. Our data provide validation of AHCC colonic anti-inflammatory activity in a chronic, T cell driven model of inflammatory bowel disease.},

Stressed-HEO rats inhaled hiba essential oil aroma after restraint period. The quantities of food and water intake and the excretion amount of stressed rats were smaller than those of non-stressed control rats. Body weights of stressed rats decreased compared with those of control rats. These physiological variables of stress-HEO rats significantly recovered compared with those of stressed rats (P < 0.001). Stress-related anxiety was assessed using the elevated plus-maze test. Entry times into the open arms of stressed rats were less than those of control rats (P < 0.05). In contrast, the suppression of entry times into the open arms of stressed rats was restored by the inhalation of hiba oil. The results suggest that hiba essential oil inhalation reduced stress-induced growth inhibition and stress-related anxiety.},

   abstract = {Alterations in the bidirectional interactions between the intestine and the nervous system have important roles in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A body of largely preclinical evidence suggests that the gut microbiota can modulate these interactions. A small and poorly defined role for dysbiosis in the development of IBS symptoms has been established through characterization of altered intestinal microbiota in IBS patients and reported improvement of subjective symptoms after its manipulation with prebiotics, probiotics, or antibiotics. It remains to be determined whether IBS symptoms are caused by alterations in brain signaling from the intestine to the microbiota or primary disruption of the microbiota, and whether they are involved in altered interactions between the brain and intestine during development. We review the potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IBS in different groups of patients. Studies are needed to better characterize alterations to the intestinal microbiome in large cohorts of well-phenotyped patients, and to correlate intestinal metabolites with specific abnormalities in gut-brain interactions.},

   abstract = {The gut endocrine cells control and regulate several functions of the gastrointestinal tract. They have been reported to be abnormal in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), with alterations occurring in several functions regulated by these cells. Furthermore, it has been established that gut endocrine cells interact with the gut lumen contents, particularly the nutrients. The present study was undertaken to establish whether the positive outcome of dietary guidance observed in patients suffering from IBS is associated with a change in gastric endocrine cells. A total of 46 patients with IBS participated in the present study, of which 14 completed all aspects. These patients included nine females and five males with a mean age of 34 years (range, 2045 years). In the healthy control group, nine females and five males, with a mean age of 54 years (range 2670 years) were selected. The patients and controls underwent gastroscopy with biopsy samples taken from the corpus and antrum of the stomach. Each patient attended three sessions that lasted ~45 min each, and received individual guidance on their dietary management. The patients followed the diet prescribed for a minimum of three months, then further samples were taken using a method similar to that used for the initial biopsies. The biopsy samples were immunostained using the avidinbiotin complex method for chromogranin A (CgA) and quantified by computerized image analysis. The patients with IBS presented a low density of CgA compared with the controls. The density of CgA increased in these patients following dietary guidance and changes in food intake. The present observations emphasized the interaction between food intake and gut endocrine cells. The current study also suggests that the positive effects of dietary guidance may be attributed to changes in gut endocrine cell density.},

   abstract = {Diet is important in triggering the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This study investigated the impact of dietary guidance on the symptoms, quality of life and habitual diet of patients with IBS. Forty-six patients who fulfilled the Rome III criteria for the diagnosis of IBS were included. Of these patients, 17 completed the entire study. Each patient attended three sessions (~45 min in duration) and received individual guidance on their dietary management. The patients were asked to complete the following questionnaires prior to receiving the dietary guidance, and at least 3 months subsequently: The Birmingham IBS symptom score questionnaire, the IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) questionnaire, the Short-Form Nepean and Dyspepsia Index (SFNDI) and the MoBa Food Frequency Questionnaire (MoBa FFQ). The time at which patients completed the questionnaires following dietary guidance ranged from 3-9 months (median, 4 months). The total IBS symptom scores were reduced once the patients had received dietary guidance (P=0.001). The total score for the quality of life, as assessed by the IBSQOL and the SF-NDI, increased significantly following the dietary guidance sessions (P=0.003 and P=0.002, respectively). There were no statistical differences in the intake of calories, carbohydrate, fiber, protein, fat or alcohol in the patients with IBS following dietary guidance. There were increases in the consumption of dairy products, beta-carotene, retinol equivalents, riboflavin, vitamin B12 and calcium, although only the increase in vitamin B12 consumption was statistically significant. There was a significant reduction in the consumption of certain fruits and vegetables that were rich in highly fermentable short-chain carbohydrates, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, as well as insoluble fibers. In conclusion, three 45-min dietary guidance sessions, administered by a nurse, reduced the symptoms and improved the quality of life of patients with IBS, and resulted in an adequate intake of vitamins and minerals. Individual dietary guidance is a cost-effective option for the management of IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The gastric endocrine cells in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) tend to normalize following dietary guidance. The aim of the present study was to identify the gastric endocrine cell types that are changed following such dietary guidance. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fourteen IBS patients and 14 healthy subjects were included in the study. Patients received three sessions of individual dietary management guidance. Gastroscopy was performed on both the controls and the patients at baseline and then again for the patients at 3-9 months after dietary guidance. Biopsy samples from the corpus and antrum were immunostained for all gastric endocrine cell types. Endocrine cells were quantified by computerized image analysis. RESULTS: The densities of the ghrelin cells for the controls and IBS patients before and after dietary guidance were 149.6 +/- 36.2 (mean +/- s.e.m.; 95% confidence interval (CI) 71.3-227.8), 114.5 +/- 32.7 and 161.8 +/- 37.8 cells/mm(2), respectively. The densities of the gastrin cells in these groups were 155.8 +/- 21.0 (95% CI 110.3-201.2), 159.4 +/- 24.3 and 211.6 +/- 28.0 cells/mm(2), respectively; the corresponding densities of serotonin cells in the corpus were 18.2 +/- 3.9 (95% CI 9.8-26.6), 10.6 +/- 3.4 and 14 +/- 2.0 cells/mm(2) and in the antrum were 44.6 +/- 12.2 (95% CI 18.1-71.1), 1.7 +/- 0.5 and 14.7 +/- 6.3 cells/mm(2). The densities of the somatostatin cells in the corpus were 40.0 +/- 7.7 (95% CI 23.5-56.5), 23.0 +/- 3.0 and 37.3 +/- 4.2 cells/mm(2), respectively, and in the antrum were 138.9 +/- 22.0 (95% CI 91.4-186.3), 95.6 +/- 15.9 and 86.0 +/- 16.9 cells/mm(2), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The densities of all of the gastric endocrine cell types changed towards the healthy control values in the IBS patients following a change in food intake.},

Carbohydrate malabsorption seems to be more frequent in IBS. A low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diet significantly reduces IBS symptoms and has been suggested as a therapeutic option. Serological screening for celiac disease should be done in patients without constipation. Moreover, non-celiac disease gluten sensitivity, defined as gluten intolerance once celiac disease and wheat allergy have been ruled out, should be considered in these patients. There is no specific diet for IBS patients but small and frequent meals, avoiding greasy foods, dairy products, many carbohydrates, caffeine and alcohol, is recommended.},

   abstract = {This article discusses the most interesting studies on functional and motility gastrointestinal disorders presented in Digestive Diseases Week (DDW) in 2013. New data were reported on the clinical importance of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) and on how they can produce numerous disturbances such as inflammatory bowel disease. These disturbances are associated with somatic functional disease and particularly with fatigue. In addition, new data have emerged on the physiopathology of these disorders, with some studies reporting that environmental factors and events in early infancy can favor their development. Data were also presented on how bile acids can increase susceptibility to diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and on how the type of food intake can favor the development of symptoms. More data are available on the presence of underlying celiac disease in patients with IBS, which should prompt us to investigate this disease in our patients. Likewise, indiscriminate application of a gluten-free diet in patients with IBS has been shown not to produce a clear improvement. Regarding the physiopathology of functional dyspepsia (FD), results have been presented on how psychological factors can modify gastric accommodation and how this is in turn related to visceral hypersensitivity and gastric emptying. Regarding therapy, mirtazapine can improve symptoms and lead to weight gain in patients with severe FD and substantial weight loss. Results were presented on new drugs for IBS such as ibodutant and on old drugs with new applications such as mesalazine and ebastine. The antinociceptive effect of linaclotide is now better understood and a meta-analysis has shown its effectiveness in IBS with constipation as the main symptom. In patients with constipation, pelvic floor dysynergy can be diagnosed by a simple clinical interview and rectal touch. More data are available on the efficacy of prucalopride (which has been shown to accelerate colon transit time) and data were provided on plecanatide, a potential new drug that could be useful in constipation. Finally, results were presented on the use of botulinum toxin injection in patients with spastic motility disorders of the esophagus. Also worthy of mention is a study confirming a higher frequency of esophageal cancer patients with achalasia who receive treatment.},

   abstract = {AIM: The purpose of this research is to explore whether general practitioners have experiences with functional foods within their clinical practice. BACKGROUND: Previous research and editorials have suggested that general practitioners should have more involvement and knowledge of functional foods. This is due to the thought that functional foods may be consumed by their patients that could lead to other issues, such as patients not taking their medication. Therefore, research into general practitioners involvement with functional foods needs to be conducted. METHOD: In all, 10 semi-structured open interviews were used with a topic guide. These interviews where digitally audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts where analysed using thematic analysis. FINDINGS: It was found that general practitioners believed they did not have a direct role with functional foods and should not be involved with discussing them with their patients. They felt that if they where to be involved with functional foods then they would need more training and information about them. They also felt that functional foods could be empowering for their patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO) is a key enzyme that catalyses the final step in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone ethylene. Recently, the first ACO homologue gene was isolated in Agaricus bisporus, whereas information concerning the nature of the ethylene-forming activity of this mushroom ACO is currently lacking. METHODS: Recombinant ACO from A. bisporus (Ab-ACO) was purified and characterised for the first time. Molecular modelling combined with site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic and spectral analysis were used to investigate the property of Ab-ACO. RESULTS: Ab-ACO has eight amino acid residues that are conserved in the Fe (II) ascorbate family of dioxygenases, including four catalytic residues in the active site, but Ab-ACO lacks a key residue, S289. In comparison to plant ACOs, Ab-ACO requires ACC and Fe (II) but does not require ascorbate. In addition, Ab-ACO had relatively low activity and was completely dependent on bicarbonate, which could be ascribed to the replacement of S289 by G289. Moreover, the ferrous ion could induce a change in the tertiary, but not the secondary, structure of Ab-ACO. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide crucial experimental support for the ability of Ab-ACO to catalyse ethylene formation in a similar manner to that of plant ACOs, but there are differences between the biochemical and catalytic characteristics of Ab-ACO and plant ACOs. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This work enhances the understanding of the ethylene biosynthesis pathways in fungi and could promote profound physiological research of the role of ethylene in the regulation of mushroom growth and development.},

   abstract = {There are inconsistent and limited data available to assess the relationship between fat intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We examined the consumption of total fat, fat sources and fat subtypes in relation to risk of EOC and its major histologic subtypes in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition which includes incident invasive (n=1095) and borderline (n=96) EOC. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In multivariate models, we observed no association with consumption of total fat, animal or plant fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, monounsaturated fat, or fatty fish and risk of invasive EOC. There was, however, an increased risk of invasive EOC in the highest category of intake (Quartile 4 vs. Quartile 1) of polyunsaturated fat (HR=1.22, 95% CI=1.02-1.48, P(trend)=0.02). We did not observe heterogeneity in the risk associations in comparisons of serous and endometrioid histologic subtypes. This study does not support an etiological role for total fat intake in relation to EOC risk; however, based on observations of a positive association between intake of polyunsaturated fat and invasive EOC risk in the current and previous studies, this fat subtype warrants further investigation to determine its potential role in EOC development.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fiber has been used for many years to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This approach had fallen out of favor until a recent resurgence, which was based on new randomized controlled trial (RCT) data that suggested it might be effective. We have previously conducted a systematic review of fiber in IBS, but new RCT data for fiber therapy necessitate a new analysis; thus, we have conducted a systematic review of this intervention. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched up to December 2013. Trials recruiting adults with IBS, which compared fiber supplements with placebo, control therapy, or "usual management", were eligible. Dichotomous symptom data were pooled to obtain a relative risk (RR) of remaining symptomatic after therapy as well as number needed to treat (NNT) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: We identified 14 RCTs involving 906 patients that had evaluated fiber in IBS. There was a significant benefit of fiber in IBS (RR=0.86; 95% CI 0.80-0.94 with an NNT=10; 95% CI=6-33). There was no significant heterogeneity between results (I(2)=0%, Cochran Q=13.85 (d.f.=14), P=0.46). The benefit was only seen in RCTs on soluble fiber (RR=0.83; 95% CI 0.73-0.94 with an NNT=7; 95% CI 4-25) with no effect seen with bran (RR=0.90; 95% CI 0.79-1.03). CONCLUSIONS: Soluble fiber is effective in treating IBS. Bran did not appear to be of benefit, although we did not uncover any evidence of harm from this intervention, as others have speculated from uncontrolled data.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome is a multisymptom construct, with abdominal pain (AP) acting as the driving symptom of patient-reported severity. The Food and Drug Administration considers a >30% decrease in AP as satisfactory improvement, but this has not been validated in children. We investigated the correspondence of 2 measures for AP assessment, >/=30% improvement in AP and global assessment of improvement. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from 72 children who completed a randomized clinical trial for abdominal pain-associated functional gastrointestinal disorders. Children completed daily assessment of AP intensity, functional disability inventory (FDI), question regarding pain's interference with activities, and 2 global assessment questions. We measured the extent to which >/=30% improvement of AP and global assessment questions correlated with each other and with disability. RESULTS: The global questions correlated with each other (r=0.74; P<0.0001) and with a >/=30% improvement in AP (P<0.01). Global outcomes were satisfaction with treatment was inversely related to the child's report of interference with activities (P<0.01) and symptom relief was positively associated with >/=30% improvement in FDI scores (P<0.009). A 30% change in FDI scores was associated with global questions of symptom relief (P=0.009) but not with satisfaction with treatment (P=0.07). The association of AP improvement with interference with activities (P=0.14) or change in FDI scores (P=0.27) did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: Currently used global assessments are significantly associated with decreased pain intensity, decreased interference with daily activities, and a >/=30% change in FDI scores, whereas recommended 30% improvement in pain intensity is not as comprehensive.},

   abstract = {Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is an emerging disorder characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in non-celiac patients. Its prevalence has been estimated to be six to ten-times higher than that of celiac disease (CD). A gluten-free diet is the most widely recommended therapy, but the causative agent remains unknown and there are no consensus diagnostic criteria. Recent studies on NCGS have included patients with possibly overlooked minor CD and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome without self-reported gluten intolerance, but showing a response to a gluten-free diet. Furthermore, FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) have recently been postulated as the culprit component for NCGS in wheat, instead of gluten. This review updates evidence on the pathophysiology of NCGS and the efficacy of different dietary interventions in its treatment, stressing the need for proper screening for CD before a diagnosis of NCGS is made.},

   abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Diverticulitis is a common disease. Recent changes in understanding its natural history have substantially modified treatment paradigms. OBJECTIVE: To review the etiology and natural history of diverticulitis and recent changes in treatment guidelines. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases for English-language articles pertaining to diagnosis and management of diverticulitis published between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2013. Search terms applied to 4 thematic topics: pathophysiology, natural history, medical management, and indications for surgery. We excluded small case series and articles based on data accrued prior to 2000. We hand searched the bibliographies of included studies, yielding a total of 186 articles for full review. We graded the level of evidence and classified recommendations by size of treatment effect, according to the guidelines from the American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines. FINDINGS: Eighty articles met criteria for analysis. The pathophysiology of diverticulitis is associated with altered gut motility, increased luminal pressure, and a disordered colonic microenvironment. Several studies examined histologic commonalities with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome but were focused on associative rather than causal pathways. The natural history of uncomplicated diverticulitis is often benign. For example, in a cohort study of 2366 of 3165 patients hospitalized for acute diverticulitis and followed up for 8.9 years, only 13.3% of patients had a recurrence and 3.9%, a second recurrence. In contrast to what was previously thought, the risk of septic peritonitis is reduced and not increased with each recurrence. Patient-reported outcomes studies show 20% to 35% of patients managed nonoperatively progress to chronic abdominal pain compared with 5% to 25% of patients treated operatively. Randomized trials and cohort studies have shown that antibiotics and fiber were not as beneficial as previously thought and that mesalamine might be useful. Surgical therapy for chronic disease is not always warranted. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Recent studies demonstrate a lesser role for aggressive antibiotic or surgical intervention for chronic or recurrent diverticulitis than was previously thought necessary.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often associated with psychological distress, is characterized by increased gut permeability and visceral sensitivity. In animals, stress increases intestinal paracellular permeability (IPP), visceral sensitivity and colonic proteolytic activity. Estradiol reduces IPP and affects visceral sensitivity in non-stressed ovariectomized rats, but whether estrogens affect stress-induced hyperpermeability and hypersensitivity in cyclic females remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate (i) the effects of a phytoestrogen-rich soy germ fermented ingredient (SG) on visceral hypersensitivity, hyperpermeability and other symptoms in stressed intact female rats, (ii) the mechanisms of action involved on the basis of both estrogenic and protease inhibitor activities of SG. METHODS: Female rats received orally for 15-d either SG, 17beta-estradiol benzoate (EB), or vehicles, with or without the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI182.780 before stress. Visceral sensitivity, IPP, faecal proteolytic activity, plasma corticosterone, rat mast cell protease II immunostaining, and occludin expression were assessed. RESULTS: Stress increased IPP (concomitantly to a drop in occludin expression), visceral sensitivity, faecal proteolytic activity and plasma corticosterone. Similarly to EB, SG prevented the stress-induced hyperpermeability, and hypersensitivity, without changes in plasma corticosterone. SG inhibited the increase in faecal proteolytic activity, enhanced occludin expression, and reduced the colonic mast cell density. All SG effects, except decrease on faecal proteolytic activity, were blocked by ICI182.780. CONCLUSION: A 2-wk oral treatment with SG prevented the stress-induced hyperpermeability and visceral hypersensitivity in cyclic rats through ER activation, and blocked the increase in colonic proteolytic activity, suggesting that SG can be promising in IBS management.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The high prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, its lack of satisfactory effective drugs and its complicated pathophysiology lead to the demand of new therapeutic agents. During a new drug development process, the pharmacokinetic profiling is of a great considerable importance comparable to drug's efficacy. This involves the drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, all of which are crucial to its usefulness. In addition, the toxicological profile and possible adverse reactions of the drug should be identified. Also its interactions should be identified at different phases of trials. Several pharmacokinetic studies are carried out to achieve drugs with the best absorption and bioavailability and the least adverse effects and lowest toxicity. AREAS COVERED: To make an update on new clinically introduced drugs for IBS and their dynamics and kinetics data, the present systematic review was accomplished. All relevant bibliographic databases were searched from the year 2003 up to May 2012 to identify all clinical trials that evaluated the potential efficacy of a novel agent in IBS. EXPERT OPINION: Some evaluated drugs, such as ramosetron (5-HT3 antagonist) and pexacerfont (CRF1 receptor antagonist), have shown some benefits in diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS), while, prucalopride and mosapride (5-HT4 agonist) with prokinetic effect were found useful in constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS). Besides, dexloxiglumide, lubiprostone and linaclotide have shown beneficial effects in C-IBS patients. Melatonin regulates GI tract motility and, asimadoline, gabapentin and pregabalin show reduction of pain threshold and visceral hypersensitivity. Glucagon-like peptide analog, calcium-channel blockers and neurokinin receptor antagonists have shown benefits in pain attacks. More time is required to indicate both efficacy and safety in long-term treatment due to multifactorial pathophysiology, variations in individual responses and insufficient assessment methods, which limit the right decision-making process about the efficacy and tolerability of these new drugs.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: By targeting different subtypes of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) receptors in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, several drugs have been introduced for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Renzapride is a full agonist for 5HT4 receptor and an antagonist to 5HT2b and 5HT3 receptors which is thought a promising therapeutic agent for constipation predominant IBS (C-IBS) patients due to its accelerating effect on the GI tract. In this meta-analysis, our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of renzapride in the management of IBS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search was done from 1992 to February 2013 for placebo-controlled trials that investigated the efficacy of renzapride in IBS. RESULTS: Relative risk (RR) for clinical efficacy in IBS patients treated for 5 weeks or less comparing renzapride to placebo was 1.07 (95% CI = 0.89-1.29, p = 0.38). This value for IBS patients treated for more than 5 weeks was 1.04 (95% CI = 0.78-1.239, p = 0.77). The RR for clinical efficacy in IBS patients treated with renzapride (4 mg) for 5 weeks or less and more than 5 weeks in comparison to placebo was 1.2 (95% CI = 0.97-1.48, p = 0.1) and 1.16 (95% CI = 0.98-1.37, p = 0.08), respectively, which were statistically non-significant but clinically important. The analysis of tolerability demonstrated that amongst different reported adverse effects, renzapride caused diarrhea more than placebo (RR = 1.61 with a 95% CI = 1.16-2.24, p = 0.004). The RR for withdrawals from renzapride compared to placebo was 1.58 (95% CI = 1.26-2.07, p = 0.0007). CONCLUSIONS: Renzapride is not superior to placebo in relieving IBS symptoms and causes significant incidences of diarrhea and drop-outs due to adverse effects in treated patients vs. placebo. Thus, this medicine might be a cost burden to patients without providing good effectiveness.},

The importance of diet in the management of irritable bowel syndrome has taken center stage in recent times as the literature validates the relationship of certain foods with the provocation of symptoms. Likewise, a number of elimination dietary programs have been successful in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Knowledge of the dietary management strategies for irritable bowel syndrome will help guide nutritionists and healthcare practitioners to deliver optimal outcomes.

   abstract = {Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterraenea (L.) verdc) (BGN) is a legume; its origin have been traced back to Africa, and it is the third important legume; however, it is one of the neglected crops. It is highly nutritious, and has been termed a complete food. Its seed consist of 49%-63.5% carbohydrate, 15%-25% protein, 4.5%-7.4% fat, 5.2%-6.4% fiber, 3.2%-4.4% ash and 2% mineral compared to whole fresh cow milk 88% moisture, 4.8% carbohydrate, 3.2% proteins, 3.4% fat, 0.7% ash, and 0.01% cholesterol. Its chemical composition is comparable to that of soy bean. Furthermore, BGN has been reported to be a potential crop, owing to its nutritional composition, functional properties, antioxidant potential, and a drought resistant crop. Bambara groundnut milk (BGNM) had been rated higher in acceptability than milk from other legumes like soybean and cowpea. Probiotics have been defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amount confer a health benefit on the host. These benefits have been reported to be therapeutic, suppressing the growth and activity in conditions like infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. The nutritional profile of BGNM is high enough to sustain the growth of probiotics. BGNs are normally boiled and salted, eaten as a relish or roasted, and eaten as a snack. Hence, BGNM can also be fermented with lactic acid bacteria to make a probiotic beverage that not only increase the economic value of the nutritious legume but also help in addressing malnutrition.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of the probiotic combination Lactibiane Tolerance((R)) (LT) on epithelial barrier function in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The effect of the multispecies probiotic LT was assessed on several models of epithelial barrier function both in vitro (in basal and inflammatory conditions) and in vivo [visceral hypersensitivity induced by chronic stress or by colonic perfusion of a fecal supernatant (FSN) from patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)]. In vitro, we measured the permeability of confluent T84 cell monolayers incubated with or without LT by evaluating the paracellular flux of macromolecules, in basal conditions and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or with conditioned medium of colonic biopsies from IBS patients (IBS-CM). In vivo, male C57/Bl6 mice received orally NaCl or LT for 15 d and were submitted to water avoidance stress (WAS) before evaluating visceral sensitivity by measuring the myoelectrical activity of the abdominal muscle and the paracellular permeability with (51)Cr-EDTA. Permeability and sensitivity were also measured after colonic instillation of FSN. Tight-junctions were assessed by immunoblotting and TLR-4 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry RESULTS: Incubation of T84 cell monolayers with LT in basal conditions had no significant effect on permeability (P > 0.05 vs culture medium). By contrast, addition of LT bacterial bodies (LT) completely prevented the LPS-induced increase in paracellular permeability (P < 0.01 vs LPS 10 ng/mL (LPS 10); P < 0.01 vs LPS 100 ng/mL (LPS 100), P > 0.05 vs culture medium). The effect was dose dependent as addition of 10(9) LT bacterial bodies induced a stronger decrease in absorbance than 10(6) LT (10(9) LT + LPS 10: -20.1% +/- 13.4, P < 0.01 vs LPS 10; 10(6) LT + LPS 10: -11.6% +/- 6.2, P < 0.01 vs LPS 10; 10(9) LT + LPS 100: -14.4% +/- 5.5, P < 0.01 vs LPS 100; 10(6) LT + LPS 100: -11.6% +/- 7.3, P < 0.05 vs LPS 100). Moreover, the increase in paracellular permeability induced by culturing T84 cells with conditioned medium of colonic biopsies from IBS patients (IBS-CM) was completely inhibited in the presence of 10(9) LT (P < 0.01 vs IBS-CM). LT also significantly prevented the epithelial disruption induced by intracolonic infusion of fecal supernatant from IBS patients (P < 0.01 vs IBS FSN) or water avoidance stress P < 0.01 vs WAS) in C57/Bl6 mice and increased the expression of occludin in vitro and in vivo, as assessed by immnunoblotting. The WAS-induced effect on visceral sensitivity was prevented by LT treatment since values obtained for all steps of colorectal distension were significantly (P < 0.01) different from the WAS group. Finally, LT down-regulated the response mediated through TLR-4 in vitro (decrease in tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion in response to LPS: -65.8% for 10(9) LT and -52.5% for 10(6) LT, P < 0.01 vs LPS) and in vivo (inhibition of WAS induced an increase in TLR-4 expression in the LT treated mice colon, P < 0.01 vs WAS). CONCLUSION: The probiotic LT mix prevented the disruption to the epithelial barrier induced by LPS, stress or colonic soluble factors from IBS patients and prevented visceral hypersensitivity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: In irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the gut microbiota may be altered. Probiotic bacteria appear to be therapeutically effective. We characterized the mucosa-associated microbiota, and determined the clinical and microbiological effects of orally administered probiotic bacteria, in patients with IBS. METHODS: Mucosal microbiota from rectal biopsies of IBS patients and controls were assessed on the V1 and V2 variable regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplified using 454 pyrosequencing. Clinical symptoms and changes in mucosal microbiota were assessed in IBS patients before and after 4 weeks of treatment with probiotic mix VSL#3. RESULTS: Ten IBS subjects (eight female; mean age 46 years) were included. At week 4 of probiotic therapy, six patients showed symptom improvement on global symptom assessment compared with baseline (P = 0.031). Before therapy, intestinal microbiota of IBS subjects differed significantly from that of healthy controls, with less diversity and evenness than controls (n = 9; P < 0.05), increased abundance of Bacteroidetes (P = 0.014) and Synegitestes (P = 0.017), and reduced abundance of Actinobacteria (P = 0.004). The classes Flavobacteria (P = 0.028) and Epsilonproteobacteria (P = 0.017) were less enriched in IBS. Abundance differences were largely consistent from the phylum to genus level. Probiotic treatment in IBS patients was associated with a significant reduction of the genus Bacteroides (all taxonomy levels; P < 0.05) to levels similar to that of controls. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, global and deep molecular analysis demonstrates an altered mucosal microbiota composition in IBS. Probiotic leads to detectable changes in the microbiota. These effects of probiotic bacteria may contribute to their therapeutic benefit.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the small intestine caused by sensitivity to dietary gluten and related proteins in genetically predisposed individuals. Over the past several years, the concept of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has gained significant interest from the scientific community and mass media and the number of individuals embracing a gluten-free diet is rapidly growing. This condition is characterized by gastrointestinal or extraintestinal symptoms that respond to gluten withdrawal without evidence for underlying celiac disease or wheat allergy. Symptoms display significant overlap with the irritable bowel syndrome. Many important factors regarding this relatively novel condition remain to be elucidated; no discriminative markers to support a diagnosis of gluten sensitivity have been identified yet and its pathogenesis remains obscure. Here we review the current knowledge on NCGS, and outline potential pathogenic pathways of different gluten related disorders in order to gain clues about the pathophysiology of this novel condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disturbances in one carbon metabolism may contribute to carcinogenesis by affecting methylation and synthesis of DNA. Choline and its oxidation product betaine are involved in this metabolism and can serve as alternative methyl group donors when folate status is low. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), to investigate plasma concentrations of the methyl donors methionine, choline, betaine (trimethylglycine), and dimethylglycine (DMG) in relation to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Our study included 1367 incident CRC cases (965 colon and 402 rectum) and 2323 controls matched by gender, age group, and study center. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for CRC risk were estimated by conditional logistic regression, comparing the fifth to the first quintile of plasma concentrations. RESULTS: Overall, methionine (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.63-0.99, P-trend = 0.05), choline (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60-0.99, P-trend = 0.07), and betaine (OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.66-1.09, P-trend = 0.06) concentrations were inversely associated with CRC risk of borderline significance. In participants with folate concentration below the median of 11.3 nmol/l, high betaine concentration was associated with reduced CRC risk (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.50-1.00, P-trend = 0.02), which was not observed for those having a higher folate status. Among women, but not men, high choline concentration was associated with decreased CRC risk (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.43-0.88, P-trend = 0.01). Plasma DMG was not associated with CRC risk. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with high plasma concentrations of methionine, choline, and betaine may be at reduced risk of CRC.},

Total combined self-reported weight loss was 1 900 kg (range 5 kg gain to 84 kg loss). The mean +/- standard deviation weight loss of 15 (+/-12) kg is among the largest yet described. Sixteen subjects reported the LCHF 'cured' (i.e. medications no longer required) one or more of their medical conditions, most commonly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n=14), hypertension (n=8) and hypercholesterolaemia (n=7). Another 9 subjects with either type 1 diabetes mellitus or T2DM reduced medications as did 7 patients with hypertension; 8 no longer suffered from irritable bowel syndrome. These data show that significant and rapid weight loss is possible on an unsupervised eating plan that severely restricts daily carbohydrate intake to approximately &lt;75 g/day. Better weight loss on a carbohydrate-restricted LCHF eating plan than on an iso-caloric high-carbohydrate, low-fat (HCLF) diet is well described in the literature, probably due to a paradoxical reduction of hunger by carbohydrate restriction. A randomised controlled clinical trial is urgently required to disprove the hypothesis that the LCHF eating plan can reverse cases of T2DM, metabolic syndrome and hypertension without pharmacotherapy.},

   abstract = {Acrylamide, classified in 1994 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as "probably carcinogenic" to humans, was discovered in 2002 in some heat-treated, carbohydrate-rich foods. The association between dietary acrylamide intake and epithelial ovarian cancer risk (EOC) has been previously studied in one case-control and three prospective cohort studies which obtained inconsistent results and could not further examine histologic subtypes other than serous EOC. The present study was carried out in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) subcohort of women (n = 325,006). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between questionnaire-based acrylamide intake and EOC risk. Acrylamide was energy-adjusted using the residual method and was evaluated both as a continuous variable (per 10 mug/d) and in quintiles; when subgroups by histologic EOC subtypes were analyzed, acrylamide intake was evaluated in quartiles. During a mean follow-up of 11 years, 1,191 incident EOC cases were diagnosed. At baseline, the median acrylamide intake in EPIC was 21.3 mug/d. No associations and no evidence for a dose-response were observed between energy-adjusted acrylamide intake and EOC risk (HR10mug/d,1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.09; HRQ5vsQ1, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.76-1.23). No differences were seen when invasive EOC subtypes (582 serous, 118 endometrioid, and 79 mucinous tumors) were analyzed separately. This study did not provide evidence that acrylamide intake, based on food intake questionnaires, was associated with risk for EOC in EPIC. Additional studies with more reliable estimates of exposure based on biomarkers may be needed.},

The onset of IBS symptoms after a bout of gastroenteritis comprises one of the strongest indications for the importance of gut microbiota for IBS. Moreover, recent studies have identified several susceptibility genes for IBS involved in the innate immunity and recognition of bacteria but also maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier. During recent years, it has also been demonstrated that IBS patients, or subgroups thereof, may have an altered microbiota composition relative to healthy individuals, mainly based on the analysis of fecal microbiota. Moreover, a positive effect of treatment with non-absorbable antibiotics and probiotics in IBS provides further indirect support for the relevance of gut microbiota alterations in IBS.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of IBS using the Rome III criteria in young Japanese women and to assess the effects of mental, physical, dietary and nutritional factors on IBS. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data obtained from self-administered questionnaires, including age, height, weight, lifestyle, food habits, anxiety and depressive states and IBS-related symptoms, were analyzed in 245 participants. An established semiquantitative questionnaire available for clinical investigation (FFQg) was used to obtain a detailed assessment of food intake and the physical activity levels. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS was 12.0%. Of the IBS participants, constipation-predominant IBS (25.0%) was more prevalent than the diarrhea-predominant subtype (17.9%). The IBS participants had lower body mass indices, consumed less eggs and milk and were more physically active than the non-IBS participants. In addition, an anxiety state was more common in the IBS participants. Those who hesitated with evacuation of stool and who thought that there is an association between abdominal symptoms, such as constipation and diarrhea, and menstruation were more predominant among the IBS participants. The percentage of individuals who reported often rushing to the toilet within the past year and experiencing borborygmus (rumbling stomach) was greater among the IBS participants. A logistic regression analysis revealed that milk intake was an independent predictor of IBS. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IBS observed in this study was similar to that reported in previous studies conducted in Japan and other countries. Mental, physical, dietary and nutritional factors have an impact on IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients may be modulated by probiotics. We assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic IBS symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating IBS symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), where appropriate. The random-effects model was employed in cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. RESULTS: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. Probiotics improved pain scores if they contained Bifidobacterium breve (SMD, - 0.34; 95% CI, - 0.66; -0.02), Bifidobacterium longum (SMD, -0.48; 95% CI, - 0.91; -0.06), or Lactobacillus acidophilus (SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.61; -0.01) species. Distension scores were improved by probiotics containing B. breve (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.77; -0.13), Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus plantarum (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.00; -0.06) species. All probiotic species tested improved flatulence: B. breve (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.75;- 0.10), B. infantis, L. casei, L. plantarum (SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -1.07; -0.13), B. longum, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (SMD, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.01; -0.21). There was not a clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for IBS patients, and the effects on each IBS symptom are likely species-specific. Future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Menthol reduces intestinal motility in animal studies, an effect that is probably mediated by transient receptor potential channels. Peppermint oil (PO), with menthol as a major constituent, is widely used as a spasmolytic agent in irritable bowel syndrome. In the current study, we investigated the effect of acute PO administration on intragastric pressure (IGP) profiles and gastric sensorimotor functions in health. METHODS: Healthy volunteers underwent IGP measurement before and during continuous intragastric infusion of a nutrient drink (n = 13), and gastric barostat studies (n = 13). A single capsule of PO (182 mg) or placebo was administered during the studies in a randomized controlled crossover design. Throughout the studies, healthy volunteers scored 11 epigastric symptoms on a visual analogue scale (VAS); satiation was scored on a 6-point Likert scale during intragastric infusion. KEY RESULTS: During fasting, IGP and motility index (MI) of the proximal stomach decreased significantly after PO administration compared with placebo (P < 0.0001 and <0.05, respectively). In contrast, during intragastric infusion of the nutrient drink, no significant differences were detected between PO and placebo in IGP profiles, MI, satiation scores, and epigastric symptoms. The maximum infused volume, gastric compliance or sensitivity to balloon distention did not differ between both treatment arms. However, reduced appetite scores were seen during fasting after PO treatment, as compared with placebo (P = 0.01). Postprandial VAS scores were similar between PO and placebo. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Peppermint oil reduces IGP, proximal phasic contractility, and appetite, with negligible effects on gastric sensitivity, tone, accommodation, and nutrient tolerance in health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, chronic disorder that leads to decreased health-related quality of life and work productivity. Evidence-based treatment guidelines have not been able to give guidance on the effects of homeopathic treatment for IBS because no systematic reviews have been carried out to assess the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for IBS. Two types of homeopathic treatment were evaluated in this systematic review. In clinical homeopathy a specific remedy is prescribed for a specific condition. This differs from individualised homeopathic treatment, where a homeopathic remedy based on a person's individual symptoms is prescribed after a detailed consultation. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of homeopathic treatment for treating IBS. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Specialised Register and the database of the Homeopathic Library (Hom-inform) from inception to February 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort and case-control studies that compared homeopathic treatment with placebo, other control treatments, or usual care, in adults with IBS were considered for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcome was global improvement in IBS. The overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Three RCTs (213 participants) were included. No cohort or case-control studies were identified. Two studies published in 1976 and 1979 compared clinical homeopathy (homeopathic remedy) to placebo for constipation-predominant IBS. One study published in 1990 compared individualised homeopathic treatment (consultation plus remedy) to usual care (defined as high doses of dicyclomine hydrochloride, faecal bulking agents and diet sheets asking the patient to take a high fibre diet) for the treatment of IBS in female patients. Due to the low quality of reporting in the included studies the risk of bias in all three studies was unclear on most criteria and high for some criteria. A meta-analysis of two small studies (129 participants with constipation-predominant IBS) found a statistically significant difference in global improvement between the homeopathic remedy asafoetida and placebo at a short-term follow-up of two weeks. Seventy-three per cent of patients in the homeopathy group improved compared to 45% of placebo patients (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.18). There was no statistically significant difference in global improvement between the homeopathic remedies asafoetida plus nux vomica and placebo. Sixty-eight per cent of patients in the homeopathy group improved compared to 52% of placebo patients (1 study, N = 42, RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.15). GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the outcome global improvement as very low due to high or unknown risk of bias, short-term follow-up and sparse data. There was no statistically significant difference found between individualised homeopathic treatment and usual care (1 RCT, N = 20) for the outcome "feeling unwell", where the participant scored how "unwell" they felt before, and after treatment (MD 0.03; 95% CI -3.16 to 3.22). None of the included studies reported on adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A pooled analysis of two small studies suggests a possible benefit for clinical homeopathy, using the remedy asafoetida, over placebo for people with constipation-predominant IBS. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the low quality of reporting in these trials, high or unknown risk of bias, short-term follow-up, and sparse data. One small study found no statistically difference between individualised homeopathy and usual care (defined as high doses of dicyclomine hydrochloride, faecal bulking agents and diet sheets advising a high fibre diet). No conclusions can be drawn from this study due to the low number of participants and the high risk of bias in this trial. In addition, it is likely that usual care has changed since this trial was conducted. Further high quality, adequately powered RCTs are required to assess the efficacy and safety of clinical and individualised homeopathy compared to placebo or usual care.},

METHODS: Randomised, unblinded controlled trial on the effect of 6-wk treatment with LFD, LGG or a normal Danish/Western diet (ND) in patients with IBS fulfilling Rome III diagnostic criteria, recruited between November 2009 and April 2013. Patients were required to complete on a weekly basis the IBS severity score system (IBS-SSS) and IBS quality of life (IBS-QOL) questionnaires in a specially developed IBS web self-monitoring application. We investigated whether LFD or LGG could reduce IBS-SSS and improve QOL in IBS patients. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-three patients (median age 37 years, range: 18-74 years), 90 (73%) females were randomised: 42 to LFD, 41 to LGG and 40 to ND. A significant reduction in mean +/- SD of IBS-SSS from baseline to week 6 between LFD vs LGG vs ND was revealed: 133 +/- 122 vs 68 +/- 107, 133 +/- 122 vs 34 +/- 95, P < 0.01. Adjusted changes of IBS-SSS for baseline covariates showed statistically significant reduction of IBS-SSS in LFD group compared to ND (IBS-SSS score 75; 95%CI: 24-126, P < 0.01), but not in LGG compared to ND (IBS-SSS score 32; 95%CI: 18-80, P = 0.20). IBS-QOL was not altered significantly in any of the three groups: mean +/- SD in LFD 8 +/- 18 vs LGG 7 +/- 17, LFD 8 +/- 18 vs ND 0.1 +/- 15, P = 0.13. CONCLUSION: Both LFD and LGG are efficatious in patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that many patients with self-reported non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) retain gastrointestinal symptoms on a gluten-free diet (GFD) but continue to restrict gluten as they report 'feeling better'. AIM: To investigate the notion that a major effect of gluten in those with NCGS is on mental state and not necessarily on gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: Twenty-two subjects (24-62 years, five male) with irritable bowel syndrome who had coeliac disease excluded but were symptomatically controlled on a GFD, undertook a double-blind cross-over study. Participants randomly received one of three dietary challenges for 3 days, followed by a minimum 3-day washout before crossing over to the next diet. Challenge gluten-free food was supplemented with gluten (16 g/day), whey (16 g/day) or not supplemented (placebo). End-points included mental state as assessed by the Spielberger State Trait Personality Inventory (STPI), cortisol secretion and gastrointestinal symptoms. RESULTS: Gluten ingestion was associated with higher overall STPI state depression scores compared to placebo [M = 2.03, 95% CI (0.55-3.51), P = 0.010] but not whey [M = 1.48, 95% CI (-0.14 to 3.10), P = 0.07]. No differences were found for other STPI state indices or for any STPI trait measures. No difference in cortisol secretion was identified between challenges. Gastrointestinal symptoms were induced similarly across all dietary challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to gluten specifically induced current feelings of depression with no effect on other indices or on emotional disposition. Gluten-specific induction of gastrointestinal symptoms was not identified. Such findings might explain why patients with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity feel better on a gluten-free diet despite the continuation of gastrointestinal symptoms.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is responsible for a multitude of digestive and immune functions which depend upon the balanced interaction of the intestinal microbiota, diet, gut barrier function, and mucosal immune response. Disruptions in one or more of these factors can lead to intestinal disorders or enteropathies which are characterized by intestinal inflammation, increased gut permeability, and reduced capacity to absorb nutrients. Enteropathy is frequently associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune enteropathy, radiation enteritis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), where pathologic changes in the intestinal tract lead to abdominal discomfort, bloating, abnormal bowel function (e.g., diarrhea, urgency, constipation and malabsorption). Unfortunately, effective therapies for the management of enteropathy and restoring intestinal health are still not available. An accumulating body of preclinical studies has demonstrated that oral administration of plasma- or serum-derived protein concentrates containing high levels of immunoglobulins can improve weight, normalize gut barrier function, and reduce the severity of enteropathy in animal models. Recent studies in humans, using serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate, demonstrate that such protein preparations are safe and improve symptoms, nutritional status, and various biomarkers associated with enteropathy. Benefits have been shown in patients with HIV infection or diarrhea-predominant IBS. This review summarizes preclinical and clinical studies with plasma/serum protein concentrates and describes the effects on host nutrition, intestinal function, and markers of intestinal inflammation. It supports the concept that immunoglobulin-containing protein preparations may offer a new strategy for restoring functional homeostasis in the intestinal tract of patients with enteropathy.},

Such disruptions in the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can lead to symptoms of abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating, abnormal bowel function, and malabsorption of nutrients. While significant advances have been made in understanding the factors that influence the complex and fragile balance between the gut microbiota, intestinal epithelial cell integrity, and the underlying immune system, effective therapies for restoring intestinal balance during enteropathy are still not available. Numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of oral immunoglobulins to improve weight gain, support gut barrier function, and reduce the severity of enteropathy in animals.

This review summarizes studies showing the impact of enteropathy on nutritional status and how specially formulated bovine immunoglobulins may help restore intestinal homeostasis and nutritional status in patients with specific enteropathies. Such protein preparations may provide distinct nutritional support required for the dietary management of patients who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, have limited or impaired capacity to digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or other special medically determined nutrient requirements that cannot be satisfied by changes to the normal diet alone.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Alternative and complementary medical practitioners have long advocated alternative treatments for irritable bowel syndrome. A more recent development has been the use of alternative investigations by these practitioners and, in the era of internet advertising, directly by patients themselves. The aim of the present study was to examine the alternative investigations that are advocated for the assessment of gastrointestinal disease and that are available through mainstream laboratories in Australia. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was undertaken for each investigation, which was then evaluated on the basis of ACCE criteria for diagnostic tests. The ACCE criteria consider the analytical and clinical validity, clinical utility and ethical implications of the test. RESULTS: Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) to food antigens, salivary IgA, intestinal permeability, fecal short-chain fatty acids and fecal microbial analysis were identified as readily available. None of the investigations satisfied the ACCE criteria. The tests were deficient in one or more areas of analytical validity, clinical application, validity and ethical usage standards. CONCLUSION: Alternative investigations lack reliability and direct clinical applications, and should not be recommended for the investigation of gastrointestinal symptoms.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent functional disease of the gastrointestinal tract. This highly prevalent condition is best diagnosed by assessing the constellation of symptoms with which patients present to their physicians. Because some critics have previously questioned whether irritable bowel syndrome and other functional gastrointestinal disorders truly exist because they do not have defining structural features, the Rome Foundation fostered the use of symptom-based criteria for universal use. In most cases treatment is reduced to symptomatic therapy because a lot of unknown in pathogenesis by irritable bowel syndrome. Irritable bowel syndrome leads to decrease of quality of life of the patients and could be one of the reasons of patients' disability. Food is believed by patients promotes symptoms and the diet or avoiding specific food can reduce symptoms. Possible role of different food and microbiota in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome, as well as the data from randomized, controlled clinical trials dedicated to the effects of diet in irritable bowel syndrome are summarized and discussed in this review. The efficacy of the diet, enriched by fiber, prebiotics, probiotics, peppermint oil, curcumin and vitamin B6 in irritable bowel syndrome patients was shown in numerous studies. In some studies restriction in consumption of fermented carbohydrates, coffee and alcohol, as well as diet with elimination IgG-sensed food was also shown to be effective in irritable bowel syndrome. Food intolerances, defined as non-toxic non-immune adverse reactions to food, include reactions to bioactive chemicals in foods and metabolic reactions to poorly absorbed dietary carbohydrates. New dietary approaches like polyunsaturated fatty acids intake correction and the low tryptophan intake are discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate clinical symptoms in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome receiving Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. METHODS: Overall, 179 adults with irritable bowel syndrome (Rome III criteria) were randomized to receive once daily 500 mg of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, delivered by one capsule (n = 86, F: 84%, age: 42.5 +/- 12.5), or placebo (n = 93, F: 88%, age: 45.4 +/- 14) for 8 weeks followed by a 3-week washout period. After a 2-week run-in period, cardinal symptoms (abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/distension, bowel movement difficulty) and changes in stool frequency and consistency were recorded daily and assessed each week. A safety assessment was carried out throughout the study. RESULTS: The proportion of responders, defined by an improvement of abdominal pain/discomfort, was significantly higher (p = 0.04) in the treated group than the placebo group (63% vs 47%, OR = 1.88, 95%, CI: 0.99-3.57) in the last 4 weeks of treatment. A non-significant trend of improvement was observed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the other symptoms. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was well tolerated and did not affect stool frequency and consistency. CONCLUSION: Saccharomyces cerevisiae is well tolerated and reduces abdominal pain/discomfort scores without stool modification. Thus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae may be a new promising candidate for improving abdominal pain in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The US CDC estimates over 2 million foodborne illnesses are annually caused by 4 major enteropathogens: non-typhoid Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Shigella spp. and Yersinia enterocoltica. While data suggest a number of costly and morbid chronic sequelae associated with these infections, pathogen-specific risk estimates are lacking. We utilized a US Department of Defense medical encounter database to evaluate the risk of several gastrointestinal disorders following select foodborne infections. METHODS: We identified subjects with acute gastroenteritis between 1998 to 2009 attributed to Salmonella (nontyphoidal) spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp. or Yersinia enterocolitica and matched each with up to 4 unexposed subjects. Medical history was analyzed for the duration of military service time (or a minimum of 1 year) to assess for incident chronic gastrointestinal disorders. Relative risks were calculated using modified Poisson regression while controlling for the effect of covariates. RESULTS: A total of 1,753 pathogen-specific gastroenteritis cases (Campylobacter: 738, Salmonella: 624, Shigella: 376, Yersinia: 17) were identified and followed for a median of 3.8 years. The incidence (per 100,000 person-years) of PI sequelae among exposed was as follows: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 3.0; dyspepsia, 1.8; constipation, 3.9; gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 9.7. In multivariate analyses, we found pathogen-specific increased risk of IBS, dyspepsia, constipation and GERD. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm previous studies demonstrating risk of chronic gastrointestinal sequelae following bacterial enteric infections and highlight additional preventable burden of disease which may inform better food security policies and practices, and prompt further research into pathogenic mechanisms.},

Meal challenge tests have previously been used to study symptoms and pathophysiology in functional dyspepsia. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to evaluate differences in gastrointestinal (GI) symptom response to a standardized meal test in IBS compared to healthy controls. METHODS: We included 67 patients with IBS and 16 healthy controls. After an overnight fast the subjects were served breakfast (540 kcal; 36% fat, 15% proteins, 49% carbohydrates; 8.9 g fiber). They completed visual analog scales assessing severity of six GI symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, discomfort, nausea, gas, fullness) before breakfast and every 30 minutes up to 240 minutes after breakfast. The patients also completed a questionnaire (IBS-SSS) to assess IBS symptom severity during the preceding week. The course of symptom scores over time was analyzed using mixed models. RESULTS: The meal was well tolerated and all subjects completed the test period. In patients, significant effects of time (initial increase to a maximum, followed by a return to baseline) were found for fullness, bloating, nausea and discomfort (all p values < 0.01 for linear, quadratic and third-order effect of time). In IBS patients, an independent significant association between IBS-SSS scores and all postprandial symptoms, except for nausea, was found (all p < 0.01). In controls, a significant linear, quadratic and third-order effect of time (all p < 0.0001) was found for fullness only. The difference in time course for bloating and discomfort between IBS patients and controls was confirmed when comparing the groups directly (significant time-by-group interaction effects, all p < 0.05), but not for nausea. On average, IBS patients scored significantly higher than controls on all symptoms, except for nausea (significant main effects of group, all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A standardized meal test seems to be a promising tool to study the symptom pattern in IBS and potentially to follow the effect of interventions.},

   abstract = {The human intestine is colonised by 10(1)(3) to 10(1)(4) micro-organisms, the vast majority of which belong to the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Although highly stable over time, the composition and activities of the microbiota may be influenced by a number of factors including age, diet and antibiotic treatment. Although perturbations in the composition or functions of the microbiota are linked to inflammatory and metabolic disorders (e.g. inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome and obesity), it is unclear at this point whether these changes are a symptom of the disease or a contributing factor. A better knowledge of the mechanisms through which changes in microbiota composition (dysbiosis) promote disease states is needed to improve our understanding of the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and disease. While evidence of the preventive and therapeutic effects of probiotic strains on diarrhoeal illness and other intestinal conditions is promising, the exact mechanisms of the beneficial effects are not fully understood. Recent studies have raised the question of whether non-viable probiotic strains can confer health benefits on the host by influencing the immune system. As the potential health effect of these non-viable bacteria depends on whether the mechanism of this effect is dependent on viability, future research needs to consider each probiotic strain on a case-by-case basis. The present review provides a comprehensive, updated overview of the human gut microbiota, the factors influencing its composition and the role of probiotics as a therapeutic modality in the treatment and prevention of diseases and/or restoration of human health.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Fructose malabsorption is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. This review examines new findings on the physiology, assessment and therapy of fructose malabsorption in functional gastrointestinal disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Additional GLUT transport mechanisms that regulate fructose absorption might be involved in symptom adaptation to high-fructose diets. Although glucose is known to facilitate fructose absorption, erythritol promotes malabsorption. The methodologies of fructose breath testing and its clinical utility have been questioned by findings of unrealistic testing dose and poor reproducibility. Although fructose restriction appears to benefit children with functional abdominal pain, fructose restriction itself may not be the key player. In irritable bowel syndrome, fructose restriction within a diet low in other fermentable carbohydrates fermentable, oligosaccharide, disaccharide monosaccharide and polyols produced good symptom control compared with habitual diet, but such therapy resulted in significantly reduced bifidobacteria. Fructose absorption and subsequently, abdominal pain and nausea are improved by a novel enzyme therapy that converts fructose to glucose for absorption. SUMMARY: New insights into factors affecting fructose absorption may have therapeutic applications. Doubts surrounding clinical utility of fructose breath testing are emerging. Although restriction of fructose and other fermentable, oligosaccharide, disaccharide monosaccharide and polyols have efficacy for functional gastrointestinal symptoms, potentially negative effects on microbiota deserve attention.},

   abstract = {AIM: Functional and metabolic effects of dietary fiber are recognized by the scientific, clinical and nutritional experts. Dietary fiber plays a very significant role in modifying the intestinal microbiota, exerting prebiotic effects such as stimulating the growth and/or function of beneficial intestinal microorganisms. Changes in the gut microbiota composition are classically considered as one of the many factors involved in the pathogenesis of either inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. The use of particular food products with a prebiotic effect has thus been tested in clinical trials with the objective to improve the clinical activity and well-being of patients with such disorders. Partially Hydrolyzed Guar Gum (PHGG) is a natural dietary fiber (Benefibra, Novartis CH Italy): it is a white powder, water-soluble, colorless and transparent in water solution and almost tasteless. PHGG is stable and soluble at various pH levels commonly found in foods as well as resistant to heat, acid, salt, high pressure and digestive enzymes. Low viscosity of PHGG provides a distinct advantage for the use of fiber in enteral feeding products to be administered through feeding tubes. It has been studied in adults, both healthy volunteers and patients, in different disorders such as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), enteral nutrition, small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and, very recently, in children suffering from functional abdominal pain according to the Rome III Criteria definition for functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). This review takes stock of the situation concerning what is known to date on PHGG as dietary fiber, in order to give the health care professionals, such as gastroenterologists, dieticians and general practitioners, a complete overview on its intrinsic characteristics, preclinical and clinical evaluations, uses in different situations as supportive therapy in the management of the main intestinal functional disorders both in adults and in children. METHODS: All the papers on PHGG, published from the early 1990s of the Last Century to the Year 2013, have been considered. All types of publications have been included. PubMed, Medline, Ovid were the main sources adopted for data retrieving. RESULTS: PHGG has been studied in both animals and humans; its safety is well known and several clinical uses are well established. Concerning the modulation of metabolism in human, very little has been done to date and the studies have been focused, for the most part, on the functional diseases: PHGG has been proved to be useful in treating both IBS -C and D symptoms, not only in adults but also in children; data on constipation are relatively scarce and what can be deduced from the Literature is that the high concentration of fiber gives the PHGG the possibility of being used effectively in acceptable dosages (up to 22 g/day) even in situations such as chronic constipation. The use in clinical nutrition has revealed the flexibility of the compound which, owing to its peculiar characteristics, does not gel and remains liquid, PHGG can be used successfully in patients in enteral nutrition lowering the incidence of diarrhea. New open horizons can be glimpsed for SIBO treatment, lowering or maximizing the antibiotics use. CONCLUSION: Not all the fibers are the same: this is a fact. Promoting the specific knowledge of their characteristics is very important if healthcare professionals want to give their patients the best options for functional gastrointestinal disorders or nutritional needs. PHGG (Benefiber Novartis CH) has been proved to be safe and effective in promoting gut health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adverse food reactions (AFR) have has recently attracted increased attention from the media and are now more commonly reported by patients. Its classification, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment are complex and present a considerable challenge in clinical practice. Non-immune-mediated types of food intolerance have a cumulative prevalence of 30% to 40%, while true (immune-mediated) food allergies affect only 2% to 5% of the German population. METHOD: We selectively searched the literature for pertinent publications on carbohydrate malabsorption, with special attention to published guidelines and position papers. RESULTS: Carbohydrate intolerance can be the result of a rare, systemic metabolic defect (e.g., fructose intolerance, with a prevalence of 1 in 25,000 persons) or of gastrointestinal carbohydrate malabsorption. The malabsorption of simple carbohydrates is the most common type of non-immune-mediated food intolerance, affecting 20% to 30% of the European population. This condition is caused either by deficient digestion of lactose or by malabsorption of fructose and/or sorbitol. Half of all cases of gastrointestinal carbohydrate intolerance have nonspecific manifestations, with a differential diagnosis including irritable bowel syndrome, intolerance reactions, chronic infections, bacterial overgrowth, drug side effects, and other diseases. The diagnostic evaluation includes a nutritional history, an H2 breath test, ultrasonography, endoscopy, and stool culture. CONCLUSION: The goals of treatment for carbohydrate malabsorption are to eliminate the intake of the responsible carbohydrate substance or reduce it to a tolerable amount and to assure the physiological nutritional composition of the patient's diet. In parallel with these goals, the patient should receive extensive information about the condition, and any underlying disease should be adequately treated.},

   abstract = {Breath tests are non-invasive tests and can detect H(2) and CH(4) gases which are produced by bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed intestinal carbohydrate and are excreted in the breath. These tests are used in the diagnosis of carbohydrate malabsorption, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and for measuring the orocecal transit time. Malabsorption of carbohydrates is a key trigger of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms such as diarrhea and/or constipation, bloating, excess flatulence, headaches and lack of energy. Abdominal bloating is a common nonspecific symptom which can negatively impact quality of life. It may reflect dietary imbalance, such as excess fiber intake, or may be a manifestation of IBS. However, bloating may also represent small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Patients with persistent symptoms of abdominal bloating and distension despite dietary interventions should be referred for H(2) breath testing to determine the presence or absence of bacterial overgrowth. If bacterial overgrowth is identified, patients are typically treated with antibiotics. Evaluation of IBS generally includes testing of other disorders that cause similar symptoms. Carbohydrate malabsorption (lactose, fructose, sorbitol) can cause abdominal fullness, bloating, nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, and diarrhea, which are similar to the symptoms of IBS. However, it is unclear if these digestive disorders contribute to or cause the symptoms of IBS. Research studies show that a proper diagnosis and effective dietary intervention significantly reduces the severity and frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS. Thus, diagnosis of malabsorption of these carbohydrates in IBS using a breath test is very important to guide the clinician in the proper treatment of IBS patients.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate whether palatable sweet foods have a beneficial effect on chronic stress-induced colonic motility and inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: Adult male rats were divided into 3 groups: control (CON, n = 5), chronic variable stress with chow (CVS-A, n = 6), and chronic variable stress with chow and sweet food (CVS-B, n = 6). The rats were fed standard rodent chow as the chow food and/or AIN-76A as the sweet food. A food preference test for AIN-76A was performed in another group of normal rats (n = 10) for twelve days. Fecal pellet output (FPO) was measured for 6 wk during water bedding stress in the CVS groups. The weight of the adrenal glands, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone levels in plasma were measured. The expression levels of transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin (IL)-2, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were measured in the distal part of colonic tissues and plasma using Western blot analysis. RESULTS: In sweet preference test, all rats initially preferred sweet food to chow food. However, the consumption rate of sweet food gradually decreased and reduced to below 50% of total intake eight days after sweet food feeding. Accumulated FPO was higher in the CVS-A group compared with the CVS-B group over time. All stress groups showed significant increases in the adrenal to body weight ratio (CVS-A, 0.14 +/- 0.01; CVS-B, 0.14 +/- 0.01) compared with the control group (0.12 +/- 0.01, P < 0.05). The plasma corticosterone and ACTH levels were significantly higher in the CVS-A (537.42 +/- 32.95, 44.44 +/- 6.54 pg/mL) and CVS-B (655.07 +/- 30.82, 65.46 +/- 4.44 pg/mL) groups than in the control group (46.96 +/- 13.29, 8.51 +/- 1.35 pg/mL, P < 0.05). Notably, the ratio of corticosterone to ACTH was significantly increased in the CVS-A group only. Rats exposed to CVS displayed significantly increased expression of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in the plasma and distal colon compared to the control group, whereas this effect was significantly attenuated in the CVS-B group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that concurrent sweet food ingestion during CVS might have an effect on the reduction of stress-induced colonic hyper-motility and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in rats.},

There is evidence that they are linked - both caused by attenuation of gravitational aid to distal intestinal motility, resulting in damaging chronic intestinal distention. Both irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular formation and subsequent diverticulitis have worsened in recent years owing to excessive dietary fiber intake. Potential solutions include augmenting weight-bearing time, moderating dietary fiber consumption, stimulating distal colon evacuation through chemical means and developing pharmaceuticals to block the reflexive distal colon distention associated with fiber consumption. Amplified intestinal distention commenced when all classes of Renaissance Europeans became the first group in human history to wear shoes, which led to a sedentary lifestyle that moderates gravitational aid to colon motility and evacuation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common condition characterised by pain, distension and altered bowel habit. Evidence suggests functional foods containing probiotics improve gastrointestinal transit, however, data are limited by short follow-up periods and evaluation in selected populations. METHODS: A multi-centre, randomized, double blind, controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a probiotic vs non-probiotic dairy product on symptoms in IBS with a constipation element (IBS-Constipation or IBS-Mixed profile). Set in 13 general practices within central England. Individuals meeting the ROME III criteria for IBS, aged 18-65 completed a pre-study diary. Eligible individuals were randomized to consume dairy 'yoghurt' products which either did or did not contain active probiotics twice daily and to complete a daily diary. Primary outcome was subjective global assessment of symptom relief at week 4. Other outcomes comprised, IBS symptom scores, pain, bloating and flatulence levels, stool frequency, stool consistency, ease of bowel movement and quality of life. RESULTS: 179 were randomized (91 active, 88 placebo). 76 (43 active, 33 placebo) completed the study. No significant between group differences existed at 4 weeks (57% active vs 53% placebo, reported adequate relief (p = 0.71)). By week 8, 46% active vs 68% placebo reported adequate relief (p = 0.03). This was sustained at week 12. CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvements were reported for most outcomes in all trial participants but improvement did not differ by group. This trial does not provide evidence for effectiveness of a probiotic in IBS, in variance with a body of published literature and review conclusions. Differential drop out may however cloud interpretation of data. UK TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN78863629.},

   abstract = {In humans, 2 functionally different types of adipose tissue coexist: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). WAT is involved in energy storage, whereas BAT is involved in energy expenditure. Increased amounts of WAT may contribute to the development of metabolic disorders, such as obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, the thermogenic function of BAT allows high consumption of fatty acids because of the activity of uncoupling protein 1 in the internal mitochondrial membrane. Interestingly, obesity reduction and insulin sensitization have been achieved by BAT activation-regeneration in animal models. This review describes the origin, function, and differentiation mechanisms of BAT to identify new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metabolic disorders related to obesity. On the basis of the animal studies, novel approaches for BAT regeneration combining stem cells from the adipose tissue with active components, such as melatonin, may have potential for the treatment of metabolic disorders in humans.},

   abstract = {AIM: To assess the effects of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) diet supplement in pediatric chronic abdominal pain (CAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: A randomized, double-blind pilot study was performed in sixty children (8-16 years) with functional bowel disorders, such as CAP or IBS, diagnosed according to Rome III criteria. All patients underwent ultrasound, blood and stool examinations to rule out any organic disease. Patients were allocated to receive PHGG at dosage of 5 g/d (n = 30) or placebo (fruit-juice n = 30) for 4 wk. The evaluation of the efficacy of fiber supplement included IBS symptom severity score (Birmingham IBS Questionnaire), severity of abdominal pain (Wong-Baker Face Pain Rating Score) and bowel habit (Bristol Stool Scale). Symptom scores were completed at 2, 4, and 8 wk. The change from baseline in the symptom severity scale at the end of treatment and at 4 wk follow-up after treatment was the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoint was to evaluate compliance to supplementation with the PHGG in the pediatric population. Differences within groups during the treatment period and follow-up were evaluated by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: The results of the study were assessed considering some variables, such as frequency and intensity of symptoms with modifications of the bowel habit. Both groups were balanced for baseline characteristics and all patients completed the study. Group A (PHGG group) presented a higher level of efficacy compared to group B (control group), (43% vs 5%, P = 0.025) in reducing clinical symptoms with modification of Birmingham IBS score (median 0 +/- 1 vs 4 +/- 1, P = 0.025), in intensity of CAP assessed with the Wong-Baker Face Pain Rating Score and in normalization of bowel habit evaluated with the Bristol Stool Scale (40% vs 13.3%, P = 0.025). In IBS subgroups, statistical analysis shown a tendency toward normalization of bowel movements, but there was no difference in the prevalence of improvement in two bowel habit subsets. PHGG was therefore better tolerated without any adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Although the cause of pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders is not known, the results show that complementary therapy with PHGG may have beneficial effects on symptom control.},

   abstract = {In this paper a review of the researches on the role of Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) in gastrointestinal diseases was presented. EcN is a non-pathogenic strain of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which has probiotic properties. In a number of studies conducted among humans and experimental animals the application of EcN in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases was observed. Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo, contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in experimental animals. Based on the presented review it can be concluded that the strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is useful in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, especially in treatment of ulcerative colitis. This probiotic may constitute a part of treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The effectiveness of this strain in treatment of Crohn's disease is not clearly established and further research are require.},

   abstract = {AIM: To estimate the incidence of secondary lactase deficiency (SLD) in patients with postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PIBS) and the value of the small bowel microflora in its development and to elaborate treatment options for SLD. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-eight patients with PIBS, including 112 (81.2%) women and 26 (18.8%) men, were examined. The patients' mean age was 33.9 +/- 9.1 years. The duration of the disease was 2.6 +/- 1.4 years. Lactase deficiency (LD) was diagnosed using the color scale to test biopsy specimens from the duodenal retrobulbar region. The bacterial overgrowth syndrome (BOS) was identified by a 2-hour lactulose (20 ml) hydrogen breath test. Sixty patients with moderate SLD were randomized to 2 groups: 1) 41 patients received basic therapy (mesim forte as one tablet t.i.d., no-spa, 40 mg, t.i.d.) and combined probiotic bifiform (Ferrosan) containing Bifidobacterium longum 107, Enterococcus faecium 107 as one capsule t.i.d. for 14 days. Group 2 patients (n = 19) had basic therapy in combination with placebo. RESULTS: SLD was detected in 59.4% of the patients with PIBS, including 43.5 and 15.9% with moderate and severe forms, respectively. In all cases, SLD was accompanied by BOS in the small bowel lumen, as confirmed by the results of a hydrogen breath test [101 +/- 37 ppm (a normal value of < 20 ppm)]. After a 14-day course of therapy with the combined probiotic bifiform, restoration of eubiosis in the small bowel lumen was achieved in 70.8% of the patients, as shown by the lesser degree of BOS (86.9 +/- 40.9 and 17.4 +/- 6.6 ppm before and after treatment, respectively; p < 0.01) and by normalization of the lactase test (p < 0.01). In the comparative placebo group, 68.4% showed no clear positive changes, SLD and BOS remained. CONCLUSION: The changes in the small bowel intraluminal microflora, which developed after prior intestinal infection, played a great role in the development of SLD. Bifiform belongs to the currently available probiotics and may be recommended to correct SLD in patients with PIBS resulting from the impaired microbiota of the small bowel and to prevent BOS.},

   abstract = {Bats, some species of rodents and some birds are able to save energy during the summer period by decreasing their body temperature and falling into torpor. Some studies indicate that torpor prevents sleeping and causes effects similar to sleep deprivation. Impairment of processes stabilizing memory slows down learning accuracy and speed. We conducted two experiments to test whether greater mouse-eared bats, Myotis myotis, which commonly use torpor during the summer period, experience a trade-off between energy savings and learning abilities. We compared learning speed and accuracy in bats that were exposed to low (7 degrees C) and higher ambient temperatures (22 degrees C) between training and experimental sessions. Tests were conducted in experiments with food reward (food search) and without food reward (perch search). Time spent with the skin temperature above 30 degrees C was significantly longer for bats exposed to 22 degrees C than for those exposed to 7 degrees C, and longer in experiments with food reward than without food reward. We observed only a very weak tendency for better accuracy and shorter search times in bats exposed to 22 degrees C than in those exposed to 7 degrees C. Our data indicate that memory consolidation of bats under natural conditions is not affected by daily torpor when bats are in good condition and may therefore defend against a rapid fall into torpor. We suggest that homeostatic processes connected with the circadian rhythm allow protection of the consolidation of memory for relatively simple tasks despite time spent in torpor.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are derived from traditional fermented foods, from beneficial commensals or from the environment. They act through diverse mechanisms affecting the composition or function of the commensal microbiota and by altering host epithelial and immunological responses. Certain probiotic interventions have shown promise in selected clinical conditions where aberrant microbiota have been reported, such as atopic dermatitis, necrotising enterocolitis, pouchitis and possibly irritable bowel syndrome. However, no studies have been conducted that can causally link clinical improvements to probiotic-induced microbiota changes. Whether a disease-prone microbiota pattern can be remodelled to a more robust, resilient and disease-free state by probiotic administration remains a key unanswered question. Progress in this area will be facilitated by: optimising strain, dose and product formulations, including protective commensal species; matching these formulations with selectively responsive subpopulations; and identifying ways to manipulate diet to modify bacterial profiles and metabolism.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the commonest cause of recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children in both more developed and developing parts of the world. It is defined by the Rome III criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders. It is characterized by abdominal pain that is improved by defecation and whose onset is associated with a change in stool form and or frequency and is not explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. It is estimated that 10%-15% of older children and adolescents suffer from IBS. IBS can be considered to be a brain-gut disorder possibly due to complex interaction between environmental and hereditary factors. The diagnosis of IBS is made based on the Rome III criteria together with ruling out organic causes of RAP in children such as inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. Once the diagnosis of IBS is made, it is important to explain to the parents (and children) that there is no serious underlying disease. This reassurance may be effective treatment in a large number of cases. Lifestyle modifications, stress management, dietary interventions and probiotics may be beneficial in some cases. Although there is limited evidence for efficacy of pharmacological therapies such as antispasmodics and antidiarrheals; these have a role in severe cases. Biopsychosocial therapies have shown encouraging results in initial trials but are beset by limited availability. Further research is necessary to understand the pathophysiology and provide specific focused therapies.},

   abstract = {The aim of this review is to highlight the impact of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in those patients who consult the medical profession and examine the therapeutic potential of probiotics in this condition, where there is a strong need for new treatment options. Traditionally, IBS is frequently regarded as a trivial condition which is certainly not life threatening and mainly psychological in origin. However, these preconceptions are misplaced, as in some patients the condition can be devastating with the pain being as severe as that of childbirth coupled with incapacitating bowel dysfunction. In addition, patients suffer from a variety of non-colonic symptoms such as low backache, constant lethargy, nausea and genito-urinary problems, all of which lead to these patients having extremely poor quality of life. Unfortunately, the treatment of IBS is very unsatisfactory with only one new medication being developed for this condition in the last 25 years. It is now recognised that IBS is a multifactorial condition with symptoms being triggered by a variety of factors, some of which appear to be influenced by probiotics, resulting in speculation that they may have therapeutic potential in this condition. There have been over thirty controlled clinical trials of probiotics in IBS with approximately two-thirds of these studies showing evidence of an improvement in symptoms. However, not all probiotics appear to be effective with different symptoms being improved by different strains and some improving symptoms more than others. Consequently, the ideal probiotic for the treatment of IBS has yet to be defined, but the evidence is good enough to encourage further research with the aim of identifying an optimal strain or strains.},

Probiotics are live microorganisms, which administered in sufficient quantities, have beneficial health effects. The phenomenon of eating probiotic products started 100 years ago, when the first reports showed beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria on human health. Since then, probiotic preparations have become an essential element in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Currently, probiotics are of the utmost importance in supporting the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and autoimmune disorders. Probiotic microorganisms are primarily lactic acid-producing bacteria of the general Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium. Many studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of probiotics, particularly in the treatment of acute diarrhea. This applies in particular to diarrhea of viral etiology, especially in infants and young children.},

CSD proteins are RNA chaperones that destabilize RNA secondary structures to regulate stress tolerance and development. AtCSP2 is one of the four CSD proteins in Arabidopsis and is up-regulated in response to cold. Since AtCSP2 negatively regulates freezing tolerance, it was proposed to be a modulator of freezing tolerance during cold acclimation. Here, we examined the function of AtCSP2 in seed germination. We found that AtCSP2-overexpressing lines demonstrated retarded germination as compared with the wild type, with or without stress treatments. The ABA levels in AtCSP2-overexpressing seeds were higher than those in the wild type. In addition, overexpression of AtCSP2 reduced the expression of an ABA catabolic gene (CYP707A2) and gibberellin biosynthesis genes (GA20ox and GA3ox). These results suggest that AtCSP2 negatively regulates seed germination by controlling ABA and GA levels.},

   abstract = {The brain-gut axis allows bidirectional communication between the central nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS), linking emotional and cognitive centers of the brain with peripheral intestinal functions. Recent experimental work suggests that the gut microbiota have an impact on the brain-gut axis. A group of experts convened by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) discussed the role of gut bacteria on brain functions and the implications for probiotic and prebiotic science. The experts reviewed and discussed current available data on the role of gut microbiota on epithelial cell function, gastrointestinal motility, visceral sensitivity, perception and behavior. Data, mostly gathered from animal studies, suggest interactions of gut microbiota not only with the enteric nervous system but also with the central nervous system via neural, neuroendocrine, neuroimmune and humoral links. Microbial colonization impacts mammalian brain development in early life and subsequent adult behavior. These findings provide novel insights for improved understanding of the potential role of gut microbial communities on psychological disorders, most particularly in the field of psychological comorbidities associated with functional bowel disorders like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and should present new opportunity for interventions with pro- and prebiotics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an inflammatory disease of, the small intestine with a prevalence of roughly 0.5%-1%. Its symptoms arise in response to gluten consumption by genetically predisposed persons (HLA-DQ2/8). The autoantigen tissue transglutaminase (TG2) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. METHOD: Selective review of pertinent literature, including guidelines from Germany and abroad. RESULTS: Celiac disease can present at any age with gastrointestinal or extraintestinal manifestations (e.g., malabsorption or Duhring's dermatitis herpetiformis); it can also be found in association with other (auto-)immune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes. Most cases are oligosymptomatic. The wide differential diagnosis includes food intolerances, intestinal infections, and irritable bowel syndrome, among other conditions. The definitive diagnosis requires the demonstration of celiac disease-specific autoantibody to TG2 (endomysium), which is over 90% sensitive and far over 90% specific, and the characteristic histologic lesions of the small-bowel mucosa and remission on a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSION: An understanding of celiac disease ought to inform everyday clinical practice in all medical disciplines, because this is a common condition with diverse manifestations that can be effectively diagnosed and easily treated for the prevention of both acute and long-term complications. Patients should follow a strictly gluten-free diet for life.},

The diagnosis is based Rome III criteria. Determination of the concentration of serum allergen-IgG-antibodies to food allergens, IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE and immunoregulatory substances IL-5, TGF beta1, IL-10, IL-4 IL-2, IL-13 were determined by enzyme immunoassay. All the patients received rotational diet therapy based on immunoassay data in addition to medical treatment of the basis disease. The control group comprised 15 healthy individuals. RESULTS: Food intolerances basically to foods proteinaceous was diagnosed in 25 patients with IBS (59.5% of cases). The effectiveness of diet therapy was 68% (17 patients). Analysis of clinical and laboratory data revealed that the implementation of food intolerance in patients with IBS reducing the levels of IL-10 and TGFbeta1. An effective rotational diet of food intolerance in IBS patients had significantly (p < 0.05) increase IgA levels. CONCLUSION: Food intolerance in IBS patients characterized an increased synthesis of allergen-specific IgG antibodies, insufficient production of anti-inflammatory immunoregulatory substances IL-10 and TGFbeta1, and intact cytokines IL-2, - 4, - 5, - 13, IgG and IgM in serum. Efficiency rotary diet in patients with IBS is accompanied by positive clinical dynamics, increase levels of anti-inflammatory substances and serum IgA.},

   abstract = {Bacterial inclusion bodies (IBs) have recently been used to generate biocompatible cell culture interfaces, with diverse effects on cultured cells such as cell adhesion enhancement, stimulation of cell growth or induction of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. Additionally, novel applications of IBs as sustained protein delivery systems with potential applications in regenerative medicine have been successfully explored. In this scenario, with IBs gaining significance in the biomedical field, the fine tuning of this functional biomaterial is crucial. In this work, the effect of temperature on fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) IB production and performance has been evaluated. FGF-2 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli at 25 and 37 degrees C, producing IBs with differences in size, particle structure and biological activity. Cell culture topographies made with FGF-2 IBs biofabricated at 25 degrees C showed higher levels of biological activity as well as a looser supramolecular structure, enabling a higher protein release from the particles. In addition, the controlled use of FGF-2 protein particles enabled the generation of functional topographies with multiple biological activities being effective on diverse cell types.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is life-long adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Noncompliance is associated with signs and symptoms of CD, yet long-term adherence rates are poor. It is not known how the burden of the GFD compares with other medical treatments, and there are limited data on the socioeconomic factors influencing treatment adherence. In this study, we compared treatment burden and health state in CD compared with other chronic illnesses and evaluated the relationship between treatment burden and adherence. METHODS: Survey was mailed to participants with CD, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), congestive heart failure, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. Surveys included demographic information and visual analog scales measuring treatment burden, importance of treatment, disease-specific health status, and overall health status. RESULTS: We collected surveys from 341 celiac and 368 non-celiac participants. Celiac participants reported high treatment burden, greater than participants with GERD or HTN and comparable to ESRD. Conversely, patients with CD reported the highest health state of all groups. Factors associated with high treatment burden in CD included poor adherence, concern regarding food cost, eating outside the home, higher income, lack of college education, and time limitations in preparing food. Poor adherence in CD was associated with increased symptoms, income, and low perceived importance of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with CD have high treatment burden but also excellent overall health status in comparison with other chronic medical conditions. The significant burden of dietary therapy for CD argues for the need for safe adjuvant treatment, as well as interventions designed to lower the perceived burden of the GFD.},

   abstract = {There is compelling rationale for manipulating the microbiota to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Although studies of animal models of intestinal inflammation produced promising results, trials in humans have been disappointing. In contrast to IBD, the role of the microbiota in the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) only recently has been considered, but early stage results have been encouraging. As pharmaceutical companies develop fewer truly novel agents for treatment of these disorders, consumers seek safer, long-term strategies to deal with chronic symptoms. We assess the rationale for modulating the microbiota for treatment of IBD and IBS, and discuss whether current concepts are simplistic and overstated or simply under-researched. Are claims exaggerated and expectations unrealistic? Difficulties with microbiota terminology and technologies, as well as differences among patients and the heterogeneity of these diseases, pose additional challenges in developing microbiota-based therapies for IBD and IBS.},

   abstract = {Carbohydrates occur across a range of foods regularly consumed including grains such as wheat and rye, vegetables, fruits, and legumes. Short-chain carbohydrates with chains of up to 10 sugars vary in their digestibility and subsequent absorption. Those that are poorly absorbed exert osmotic effects in the intestinal lumen increasing its water volume, and are rapidly fermented by bacteria with consequent gas production. These two effects alone may underlie most of the induction of gastrointestinal symptoms after they are ingested in moderate amounts via luminal distension in patients with visceral hypersensitivity. This has been the basis of the use of lactose-free diets in those with lactose malabsorption and of fructose-reduced diets for fructose malabsorption. However, application of such dietary approaches in patients with functional bowel disorders has been restricted to observational studies with uncertain efficacy. As all dietary poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates have similar and additive effects in the intestine, a concept has been developed to regard them collectively as FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) and to evaluate a dietary approach that restricts them all. In patients with irritable bowel syndrome, there is now an accumulating body of evidence, based on observational and comparative studies, and on randomized-controlled trials that supports the notion that FODMAPs trigger gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with functional bowel disorders, and that a diet low in FODMAPs offers considerable symptom relief in the majority of patients who use it.},

   abstract = {AIM: To examine beliefs about irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) management among primary care physicians. BACKGROUND: There have been considerable advances in evidence synthesis concerning management of IBS in the last five years, with guidelines for its management in primary care published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional web-based questionnaire survey of 275 primary care physicians. We emailed a link to a SurveyMonkey questionnaire, containing 18 items, to all eligible primary care physicians registered with three clinical commissioning groups in Leeds, UK. Participants were given one month to respond, with a reminder sent out after two weeks. FINDINGS: One-hundred and two (37.1%) primary care physicians responded. Among responders, 70% believed IBS was a diagnosis of exclusion, and >80% checked coeliac serology often or always in suspected IBS. Between >50% and >70% believed soluble fibre, antispasmodics, peppermint oil, and psychological therapies were potentially efficacious therapies. The respondents were less convinced that antidepressants or probiotics were effective. Despite perceived efficacy of psychological therapies, 80% stated these were not easily available. Levels of use of soluble fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil were in the range of 40% to >50%. Most primary care physicians obtained up-to-date evidence about IBS management from NICE guidelines. Most primary care physicians still believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and many are reluctant to use antidepressants or probiotics to treat IBS. More research studies addressing diagnosis and treatment of IBS based in primary are required.},

   abstract = {Full-length cDNA encoding two leptin sequences (tLepA and tLepB) and one leptin receptor sequence (tLepR) were identified in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The full-length cDNA of tLepR was 3423bp, encoding a protein of 1140 amino acid (aa) which contained all functionally important domains conserved among vertebrate leptin receptors. The cDNAs of tLepA and tLepB were 486bp and 459bp in length, encoding proteins of 161 aa and 152 aa, respectively. Modeling the three-dimensional structures of tLepA and tLepB predicted strong conservation of tertiary structure with that of human leptin, comprised of four helixes. Using synteny, the tLeps were found near common genes, such as IMPDH1 and LLRC4. The cDNA for tLepA and tLepB was cloned and synthetic cDNA optimized for expression in Escherichia coli was prepared according to the cloned sequence. The tLepA- and tLepB-expressing plasmids were transformed into E. coli and expressed as recombinant proteins upon induction with nalidixic acid, found almost entirely in insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs). The proteins were solubilized, refolded and purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography. In the case of tLepA, the fraction eluted contained a mixture of monomers and dimers. The purified tLepA and tLepB monomers and tLepA dimer showed a single band of approximately 15kDa on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel in the presence of reducing agent, whereas the tLepA dimer showed one band of approximately 30kDa in the absence of reducing agent, indicating its formation by S-S bonds. The three tLeps were biologically active in promoting proliferation of BAF/3 cells stably transfected with the long form of human leptin receptor (hLepR), but their activity was four orders of magnitude lower than that of mammalian leptin. Furthermore, the three tLeps were biologically active in promoting STAT-LUC activation in COS7 cells transfected with the identified tLepR but not in cells transfected with hLepR. tLepA was more active than tLepB. Low or no activity likely resulted from low identity (9-22%) to mammalian leptins. In an in vivo experiment in which tilapia were fed ad libitum or fasted, there was no significant difference in the expressions of tLepA, tLepB or tLepR in the brain between the two groups examined both by real-time PCR and RNA next generation sequencing. In conclusion, in the present report we show novel, previously unknown sequences of tilapia leptin receptor and two leptins and prepare two biologically active recombinant leptin proteins.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort, in combination with disturbed bowel habits in the absence of identifiable organic cause. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone produced by the pineal gland and also large number by enterochromaffin cells of the digestive mucosa. Melatonin plays an important part in gastrointestinal physiology which includes regulation of gastrointestinal motility, local anti-inflammatory reaction as well as moderation of visceral sensation. Melatonin is commonly given orally. It is categorized by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a dietary supplement. Melatonin treatment has an extremely wide margin of safety though it may cause minor adverse effects, such as headache, rash and nightmares. Melatonin was touted as a potential effective candidate for IBS treatment. Putative role of melatonin in IBS treatment include analgesic effects, regulator of gastrointestinal motility and sensation to sleep promoter. Placebo-controlled studies in melatonin suffered from heterogeneity in methodology. Most studies utilized 3 mg at bedtime as the standard dose of trial. However, all studies had consistently showed improvement in abdominal pain, some showed improvement in quality of life of IBS patients. Melatonin is a relatively safe drug that possesses potential in treating IBS. Future studies should focus on melatonin effect on gut mobility as well as its central nervous system effect to elucidate its role in IBS patients.},

   abstract = {It is increasingly perceived that gut host-microbial interactions are important elements in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). The most convincing evidence to date is the finding that functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may develop in predisposed individuals following a bout of infectious gastroenteritis. There has been a great deal of interest in the potential clinical and therapeutic implications of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in IBS. However, this theory has generated much debate because the evidence is largely based on breath tests which have not been validated. The introduction of culture-independent molecular techniques provides a major advancement in our understanding of the microbial community in FGID. Results from 16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling approaches demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative changes of mucosal and faecal gut microbiota, particularly in IBS. Investigators are also starting to measure host-microbial interactions in IBS. The current working hypothesis is that abnormal microbiota activate mucosal innate immune responses which increase epithelial permeability, activate nociceptive sensory pathways and dysregulate the enteric nervous system. While we await important insights in this field, the microbiota is already a therapeutic target. Existing controlled trials of dietary manipulation, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and non-absorbable antibiotics are promising, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. In this article, the authors provide a critical review of current hypotheses regarding the pathogenetic involvement of microbiota in FGID and evaluate the results of microbiota-directed interventions. The authors also provide clinical guidance on modulation of gut microbiota in IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The importance of interactions between the host and gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is becoming increasingly apparent. Probiotics offer a potential new treatment for IBS, but current results are conflicting, largely as a result of poorly designed trials and nonstandardisation of outcome measures. AIM: To assess the efficacy of a liquid, multi-strain probiotic (Symprove) in IBS. METHODS: A single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adult patients with symptomatic IBS. Patients received 12 weeks of treatment with the probiotic or placebo (1 mL/kg/day). The primary efficacy measure was the difference in change in the IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) between probiotic vs. placebo at week 12. Secondary outcome measures included change in the IBS quality of life (IBS-QOL) score and change in the IBS-SSS symptom component scores. RESULTS: A total of 186 patients were randomised and 152 patients completed the study. The mean change in IBS-SSS was -63.3 probiotic vs. -28.3 placebo. The mean difference in the IBS-SSS was statistically significant [-35.0 (95% CI; -62.03, -7.87); P = 0.01]. There was no significant improvement in the IBS-QOL. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The multi-strain probiotic was associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall symptom severity in patients with IBS, and was well tolerated. These results suggest this probiotic confers benefit in IBS and deserves further investigation (ISRCTN identifier: 77512412).},

   abstract = {Fibromyalgia syndrome is characterized by chronic generalized pain accompanied by a broad symptomatologic spectrum. Besides chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances, headaches and cognitive dysfunction that are extensively described in the literature, a considerable proportion of patients with fibromyalgia experience gastrointestinal symptoms that are commonly overlooked in the studies that are not specifically dedicated to evaluate these manifestations. Nevertheless, various attempts were undertaken to explore the gastrointestinal dimension of fibromyalgia. Several studies have demonstrated an elevated comorbidity of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among patients with fibromyalgia. Other studies have investigated the frequency of presentation of gastrointestinal symptoms in fibromyalgia in a nonspecific approach describing several gastrointestinal complaints frequently reported by these patients such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia and bowel changes, among others. Several underlying mechanisms that require further investigation could serve as potential explanatory hypotheses for the appearance of such manifestations. These include sensitivity to dietary constituents such as gluten, lactose or FODMAPs or alterations in the brain-gut axis as a result of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or subclinical enteric infections such as giardiasis. The gastrointestinal component of fibromyalgia constitutes a relevant element of the multidisciplinary pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying fibromyalgia that need to be unveiled, as this would contribute to the adequate designation of relevant treatment alternatives corresponding to these manifestations.},

   abstract = {Histamine is a biogenic amine with extensive effects on many cell types, mediated by the activation of its four receptors (H1R-H4R). Distinct effects are dependent on receptor subtypes and their differential expression. Within the gastrointestinal tract, histamine is present at relatively high concentrations, particularly during inflammatory responses. In this review, we discuss the immunoregulatory influence of histamine on a number of gastrointestinal disorders, including food allergy, scombroid food poisoning, histamine intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. It is clear that the effects of histamine on mucosal immune homeostasis are dependent on expression and activity of the four currently known histamine receptors; however, the relative protective or pathogenic effects of histamine on inflammatory processes within the gut are still poorly defined and require further investigation.},

   abstract = {The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a replacement diet with organic, semi-whole-grain products derived from Triticum turgidum subsp. turanicum (ancient) wheat on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and inflammatory/biochemical parameters. A double-blinded randomised cross-over trial was performed using twenty participants (thirteen females and seven males, aged 18-59 years) classified as having moderate IBS. Participants received products (bread, pasta, biscuits and crackers) made either from ancient or modern wheat for 6 weeks in a random order. Symptoms due to IBS were evaluated using two questionnaires, which were compiled both at baseline and on a weekly basis during the intervention period. Blood analyses were carried out at the beginning and end of each respective intervention period. During the intervention period with ancient wheat products, patients experienced a significant decrease in the severity of IBS symptoms, such as abdominal pain (P< 0.0001), bloating (P= 0.004), satisfaction with stool consistency (P< 0.001) and tiredness (P< 0.0001). No significant difference was observed after the intervention period with modern wheat products. Similarly, patients reported significant amelioration in the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms only after the ancient wheat intervention period, as measured by the intensity of pain (P= 0.001), the frequency of pain (P< 0.0001), bloating (P< 0.0001), abdominal distension (P< 0.001) and the quality of life (P< 0.0001). Interestingly, the inflammatory profile showed a significant reduction in the circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-17, interferon-gamma, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor after the intervention period with ancient wheat products, but not after the control period. In conclusion, significant improvements in both IBS symptoms and the inflammatory profile were reported after the ingestion of ancient wheat products.},

   abstract = {OPINION STATEMENT: The medical community has only recently started to focus attention on the role of food in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), though the association between food and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms has been recognized by patients for decades. Health care providers receive little formal training in the dietary management of IBS and have traditionally viewed dietary interventions with skepticism. There is mounting evidence that links food to changes in motility, visceral sensation, microbiome, permeability, immune activation, and brain-gut interactions-all key elements in the pathogenesis of IBS. The role of specific dietary modification in the management of IBS has not been rigorously investigated until recently. There is now credible evidence suggesting that targeted dietary carbohydrate exclusion provides clinical benefits to IBS patients. There is emerging evidence to suggest that proteins such as gluten, as well as food chemicals, may play a role in IBS.},

METHODS: The Canterbury Health Ageing and Life Course (CHALICE) study is a study of 50-year-old Cantabrians. A 4-day estimated food and beverage diary (FBD) was completed by 227 participants, 75.7% of those recruited. The Birmingham IBS symptom questionnaire was administered and individual participant scores were calculated for constipation, diarrhoea, pain score, and total symptom score. Associations between symptoms and the intake of fructose and lactose were examined using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Greater mean daily intakes of fructose (P=0.05) and lactose (P=0.04) were associated with a lower prevalence of IBS pain symptoms after adjusting for demographics and social economic status. However there was no evidence of an association with constipation, diarrhoea or total IBS score. CONCLUSIONS: Although our data show inverse relationships between fructose and lactose intakes and IBS pain symptoms, the use of cross-sectional data do not allow us to determine causality in these relationships. However it is possible that participants may have reduced their intake of fructose and lactose in response to IBS related pain. Follow up of this cohort would allow us to determine if this is the case. Future research could also investigate whether people with IBS could benefit from guidance from a dietitian around consumption of high lactose or fructose-containing foods.},

Trials suggest probiotics may be beneficial. The aim of this study was to assess the symptomatic efficacy of Lactobacillus plantarum 299 v (L. plantarum 299 v) for the relief of abdominal pain in patients with IBS fulfilling Rome II criteria. METHODS: This study was conducted in a referral hospital. Trial participants were randomized to receive either two capsules of L. plantarum 299 v at a dosage of 5 x 10(9) cfu per capsule or placebo daily for 8 wk. Severity of abdominal pain was assessed using a visual analog scale at each visit and a quality-of-life IBS (QoL-IBS) questionnaire was also completed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in abdominal pain relief between the study and placebo groups (P = 0.800). There was also no difference in QoL- IBS scores between the groups (P = 0.687). Both groups had a significant improvement in abdominal pain scores over the study period, from an average of 251.55 to 197.90 (P < 0.0001) indicating a large placebo effect. CONCLUSION: An 8-wk treatment with L. plantarum 299 v did not provide symptomatic relief, particularly of abdominal pain and bloating, in patients fulfilling the Rome II criteria.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The traditional classification of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as a functional disorder has been challenged in recent years by evidence of ongoing low-grade gastrointestinal tract inflammation. Inflammation may alter gastrointestinal motility and thus be central to the pathogenesis of IBS. Many foods and food additives are known to cause allergic contact dermatitis. We hypothesize that allergenic foods and food additives may elicit a similar allergic reaction in the gastrointestinal tract, giving rise to symptoms suggestive of IBS. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether skin patch testing to a panel of foods and food additives may identify food allergens that may be responsible for symptoms of IBS. METHODS: We performed skin patch testing to common allergenic foods and food additives on individuals with a history of or symptoms suggestive of IBS. We used patch test-guided avoidance diets to determine whether avoidance alleviates IBS symptoms. RESULTS: Thirty of the 51 study participants showed at least 1 doubtful or positive patch test result. Fourteen of the participants reported symptomatic improvement, ranging from slight to great, upon avoidance of the foods/food additives to which they reacted. LIMITATIONS: Double-blind study design, inclusion of only patients with active IBS, larger sample size, more balanced gender distribution, testing of more foods/food additives, and longer duration of and more precise quantification of response to dietary avoidance are suggested for future studies. CONCLUSION: Allergic contact enteritis to ingested foods, food additives, or both may contribute to IBS symptoms. Patch testing may be useful in identifying the causative foods.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Stress alters brain-gut interactions and could exacerbate intestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome. Alterations in the intestinal microbiota have been associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Maintenance of healthy microbiota requires nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein-like receptors, pyrin-domain containing (NLRP)-6 inflammasomes. We investigated the involvement of NLRP6 in water-avoidance stress (WAS)-induced intestinal disorders in mice. METHODS: B57BL6 mice were subjected to WAS for 1 hour each day for 10 days; body weights and intestinal inflammation and permeability were analyzed. We investigated signaling via the NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasomes, and the role of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in WAS-associated inflammation and NLRP6 inhibition. Mice that were not exposed to stress were co-housed with mice subjected to WAS to determine the effects of WAS-induced dysbiosis, measured by sequencing bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA. We also assessed the effects of a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist and probiotics. RESULTS: WAS-induced small-bowel inflammation (enteritis) was associated with inhibition of NLRP6, but not NLRP3, and was prevented by a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist, which induced epithelial expression of NLRP6. CRH was released during WAS and inhibited NLRP6 expression. WAS induced alterations in the gut microbiota of mice; co-housed nonstressed mice developed enteritis associated with increased CRH and decreased levels of NLRP6. Probiotic therapy reduced intestinal inflammation in mice with WAS-induced enteritis. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of mice to stress inhibits NLRP6 and alters the composition of the gut microbiota, leading to intestinal inflammation. These findings might explain the benefits of probiotics for patients with stress-associated gastrointestinal disorders.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are microorganisms exerting beneficial effects on the host. They can be ingested through foods or supplements and their inclusion in these products is regulated in Canada by the Health Canada Health Products and Food Branch. The aim of this article is to summarize current evidence from randomized controlled trials and guidelines from Health Canada, the World Health Organization, and internationally recognized expert committees in the hope that it will help practitioners and professionals recommending probiotics to healthy and diseased patients, with a focus on the Canadian setting. From a general perspective, probiotics can be recommended for prevention of diseases that are associated to altered intestinal ecology. Specifically, they can be recommended for prevention of upper respiratory tract infections and pouchitis, for prevention and management of necrotizing enterocolitis, bacterial vaginosis and antibiotic associated diarrhea, including Clostridium difficile infection, and for treatment of atopic eczema in cow's milk allergy and of infectious diarrhea. Additional substantiated probiotic benefits include prevention of hypercholesterolemia, management of constipation, reduction of recurrent urinary tract infections, improvement of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, and reduction of antibiotics side effects in Helicobacter pylori eradication. Because probiotics are generally recognized as safe and can be removed with antimicrobial agents, their use should be considered in patients of all ages.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an intestinal functional disorder with the highest prevalence in the industrialized world. The intestinal microbiota (IM) plays a role in the pathogenesis of IBS and is not merely a consequence of this disorder. Previous research efforts have not revealed unequivocal microbiological signatures of IBS, and the experimental results are contradictory. The experimental methodologies adopted to investigate the complex intestinal ecosystem drastically impact the quality and significance of the results. Therefore, to consider the methodological aspects of the research on IM in IBS, we reviewed 29 relevant original research articles identified through a PubMed search using three combinations of keywords: "irritable bowel syndrome + microflora", "irritable bowel syndrome + microbiota" and "irritable bowel syndrome + microbiome". For each study, we reviewed the quality and significance of the scientific evidence obtained with respect to the experimental method adopted. The data obtained from each study were compared with all considered publications to identify potential inconsistencies and explain contradictory results. The analytical revision of the studies referenced in the present review has contributed to the identification of microbial groups whose relative abundance significantly alters IBS, suggesting that these microbial groups could be IM signatures for this syndrome. The identification of microbial biomarkers in the IM can be advantageous for the development of new diagnostic tools and novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of different subtypes of IBS.},

IBS is a functional gut disease with high prevalence and negative impact on patient's quality of life characterized mainly by visceral pain and/or discomfort, representing a good paradigm of chronic gut hypersensitivity. The IBS features are strongly regulated by bidirectional gut-brain interactions and there is increasing evidence for the involvement of gut bacteria and/or their metabolites in these features, including visceral pain. Further, gut microbiota modulation by antibiotics or probiotics has been promising in IBS. Mechanistic data provided mainly by animal studies highlight that commensals or probiotics may exert a direct action through bacterial metabolites on sensitive nerve endings in the gut mucosa, or indirect pathways targeting the intestinal epithelial barrier, the mucosal and/or systemic immune activation, and subsequent neuronal sensitization and/or activation.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Electrogastroenterography (EGEG) is a method of measuring action potentials of the digestive tract. The aim of the study was to evaluate the main features of the gastrointestinal myoelectrical activity (GI MEA) in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with metabolic syndrome (MS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: GI motility function in fasting and postprandial periods by the peripheral EGEG (EGEG system "Gastroenterological GEM-01") were recorded in 33 patients with NAFLD associated with MS, 26 patients with mixed type of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and 10 healthy volunteers aged from 18 to 70 years. RESULTS: Total fasting GI MEA data of patients with NAFLD associated with MS (Me = 40,99 MB) dominated over the same in patients with IBS (Me = 23.84 mV) and healthy volunteers (Me = 11.26 mV), the differences between EGEG parameters was not significant but critical (H = 5.997, p = 0.050). This trend was observed in postprandial period (H = 0.891, p = 0.640). In postprandial period total GI MEA in patients with NAFLD associated with MS was increased in 36.4% patients (95% CI: 24.7-56.3%) only while in IBS patients and healthy volunteers total GI MEA tract were increased in 76.9% patients (95% CI: 58.0-89.0%) and in 90.0% (95% CI: 59.6-98.2%) correspondently (chi2 = 14.12, p = 0.001). Postprandial ratio (PPR) (ratio between total GI MEA in postprandial and fasting periods) of GI MEA were less than 1.0 in patients with NAFLD associated with MS (Me = 0.65) and less then PPRs in patients with IBS and healthy volunteers (H = 10.378, p = 0.006). PPR in patients with IBS was less then this ratio in healthy volunteers (Me = 1.48 vs Me = 1.66) CONCLUSION: The increased total GI MEA is observed in patients with NAFLD associated with MS. Patients with NAFLD associated with MS have abnormal GI MEA in response on food stimulation. This fact may be important in the development of NAFLD and MS.},

   abstract = {The pool of microbes inhabiting our body is known as "microbiota" and their collective genomes as "microbiome". The colon is the most densely populated organ in the human body, although other parts, such as the skin, vaginal mucosa, or respiratory tract, also harbour specific microbiota. This microbial community regulates some important metabolic and physiological functions of the host, and drives the maturation of the immune system in early life, contributing to its homeostasis during life. Alterations of the intestinal microbiota can occur by changes in composition (dysbiosis), function, or microbiota-host interactions and they can be directly correlated with several diseases. The only disease in which a clear causal role of a dysbiotic microbiota has been demonstrated is the case of Clostridium difficile infections. Nonetheless, alterations in composition and function of the microbiota have been associated with several gastrointestinal diseases (inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, or irritable bowel syndrome), as well as extra-intestinal pathologies, such as those affecting the liver, or the respiratory tract (e.g., allergy, bronchial asthma, and cystic fibrosis), among others. Species of Bifidobacterium genus are the normal inhabitants of a healthy human gut and alterations in number and composition of their populations is one of the most frequent features present in these diseases. The use of probiotics, including bifidobacteria strains, in preventive medicine to maintain a healthy intestinal function is well documented. Probiotics are also proposed as therapeutic agents for gastrointestinal disorders and other pathologies. The World Gastroenterology Organization recently published potential clinical applications for several probiotic formulations, in which species of lactobacilli are predominant. This review is focused on probiotic preparations containing Bifidobacterium strains, alone or in combination with other bacteria, which have been tested in human clinical studies. In spite of extensive literature on and research into this topic, the degree of scientific evidence of the effectiveness of probiotics is still insufficient in most cases. More effort need to be made to design and conduct accurate human studies demonstrating the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention, alleviation, or treatment of different pathologies.},

The authors aim to evaluate temporal trends in alosetron postmarketing safety over the 9-year RMP. METHODS: The alosetron safety database was searched to identify cases of IC, CoC, and related AEs from 20 November 2002 to 31 December 2011. Adjudication of IC and CoC cases were based on US Food and Drug Administration-defined criteria. Incidence rates were calculated using the number of AEs and alosetron prescriptions (expressed as cases/1000 patient-years exposure). RESULTS: A total of 29 cases were adjudicated as probable/possible IC and 7 cases were adjudicated as CoC. Cumulative adjudicated incidence rate of IC (1.03 cases/1000 patient-years) is low and stable, while that of CoC (0.25 cases/1000 patient-years) is low, declining progressively over time. Decreases in the incidence rates of potential symptoms of IC (abdominal pain with bloody diarrhea/hematochezia) and CoC (constipation) were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Over the 9-year RMP period, incidence rates of IC and CoC remain rare. Substantial reductions over time were observed in the incidence of CoC and in symptoms suggestive of IC or CoC, while IC incidence has been stable at approximately 1.0 case/1000 patient-years. Decreases in AEs and serious outcomes associated with IC and CoC since the reintroduction of alosetron are likely attributable to the RMP.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients frequently present with multiple and 'unexplained' symptoms, often resulting in complex consultations. To better understand these patients is a challenge to health care professionals, in general, and GPs, in particular. OBJECTIVES: In our research on symptom reporting, we wanted to explore whether patients consider that they may suffer from conditions commonly regarded as unexplained, and we explored associations between these concerns and symptom load, life stressors and socio-demographic factors. METHODS: Consecutive, unselected patients in general practice completed questionnaires addressing eight conditions commonly regarded as unexplained (amalgam poisoning, Candida syndrome, fibromyalgia, food intolerance, electromagnetic hypersensitivity, burnout syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome). With logistic regression, we analysed associations with symptom load, burden of life stressors with negative impact on present health and socio-demographic variables. RESULTS: Out of the 909 respondents (response rate = 88.8%), 863 had complete data. In total, 39.6% of patients had considered that they may suffer from one or more unexplained conditions (UCs). These concerns were strongly and positively associated with recent symptom load and number of life stressors. If we excluded burnout and food intolerance, corresponding associations were found. CONCLUSION: Patients frequently considered that they may suffer from UCs. The likelihood of such concerns strongly increased with an increasing symptom load and with the number of life stressors with negative impact on present health. Hence, the number of symptoms may be a strong indicator of whether patients consider their symptoms part of such often controversial multisymptom conditions.},

   abstract = {Few models currently exist to realistically simulate the complex human intestine's micro-environment, where a variety of interactions take place. Proper homeostasis directly depends on these interactions, as they shape an entire immunological response inducing tolerance against food antigens while at the same time mounting effective immune responses against pathogenic microbes accidentally ingested with food. Intestinal homeostasis is preserved also through various complex interactions between the microbiota (including food-associated beneficial bacterial strains) and the host, that regulate the attachment/degradation of mucus, the production of antimicrobial peptides by the epithelial barrier, and the "education" of epithelial cells' that controls the tolerogenic or immunogenic phenotype of unique, gut-resident lymphoid cells' populations. These interactions have been so far very difficult to reproduce with in vitro assays using either cultured cell lines or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, mouse models differ substantially in components of the intestinal mucosa (mucus layer organization, commensal bacteria community) with respect to the human gut. Thus, studies of a variety of treatments to be brought in the clinics for important stress-related or pathological conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer have been difficult to carry out. To address these issues, we developed a novel system that enables us to stimulate explants of human intestinal mucosa that retain their in situ conditioning by the host microbiota and immune response, in a polarized fashion. Polarized apical stimulation is of great importance for the outcome of the elicited immune response. It has been repeatedly shown that the same stimuli can produce completely different responses when they bypass the apical face of the intestinal epithelium, stimulating epithelial cells basolaterally or coming into direct contact with lamina propria components, switching the phenotype from tolerogenic to immunogenic and causing unnecessary and excessive inflammation in the area. We achieved polarized stimulation by gluing a cave cylinder which delimited the area of stimulation on the apical face of the mucosa as will be described in the protocol. We used this model to examine, among others, differential effects of three different Lactobacilli strains. We show that this model system is very powerful to assess the immunomodulatory properties of probiotics in healthy and disease conditions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although probiotics have been extensively studied in irritable bowel syndrome, data on the impact of probiotics on chronic constipation are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the effects of kefir, which is a probiotic fermented milk product, on the symptoms, colonic transit, and bowel satisfaction scores of patients with chronic constipation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with functional constipation according to the Rome II criteria were divided into two groups based on their colon transit studies: 1. The normal transit (NT) group (n=10); and 2. The slow transit (ST) group (n=10). After a baseline period, 500 mL/day of a probiotic kefir beverage was administered to all patients for 4 weeks. Defecation parameters (stool frequency, stool consistency, degree of straining, laxative consumption) were recorded in diaries daily by the patients. Bowel satisfaction scores were assessed using a visual analog scale. The colon transit study was repeated in the ST group at the end of the study. RESULTS: At the end of the study, the patients showed an increased stool frequency (p<0.001), improved stool consistency (p=0.014), and decreased laxative consumption (p=0.031). The degree of straining during evacuation showed a tendency to improve after kefir administration; however, this was not statistically significant (p=0.18). A repeat transit study showed an acceleration of colonic transit in the ST group (p=0.013). Bowel satisfaction scores also improved (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows that kefir has positive effects on the symptoms of constipation. Our results also suggest that kefir improves bowel satisfaction scores and accelerates colonic transit. Controlled trials are warranted to confirm these findings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adverse reactions to food include immune mediated food allergies and non-immune mediated food intolerances. Food allergies and intolerances are often confused by health professionals, patients and the public. AIM: To critically review the data relating to diagnosis and management of food allergy and food intolerance in adults and children. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database were searched up until May 2014, using search terms related to food allergy and intolerance. RESULTS: An estimated one-fifth of the population believe that they have adverse reactions to food. Estimates of true IgE-mediated food allergy vary, but in some countries it may be as prevalent as 4-7% of preschool children. The most common food allergens are cow's milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, soy, shellfish and finned fish. Reactions vary from urticaria to anaphylaxis and death. Tolerance for many foods including milk and egg develops with age, but is far less likely with peanut allergy. Estimates of IgE-mediated food allergy in adults are closer to 1-2%. Non-IgE-mediated food allergies such as Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome are rarer and predominantly recognised in childhood. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders including eosinophilic oesophagitis are mixed IgE- and non-IgE-mediated food allergic conditions, and are improved by dietary exclusions. By contrast food intolerances are nonspecific, and the resultant symptoms resemble other common medically unexplained complaints, often overlapping with symptoms found in functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. Improved dietary treatments for the irritable bowel syndrome have recently been described. CONCLUSIONS: Food allergies are more common in children, can be life-threatening and are distinct from food intolerances. Food intolerances may pose little risk but since functional disorders are so prevalent, greater efforts to understand adverse effects of foods in functional disorders are warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postprandial discomfort following intake of poorly absorbable, but fermentable carbohydrates is a common complaint in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We used lactulose as a model substance for this group of symptom triggering carbohydrates, aiming to visualize the intestinal response in IBS patients compared to healthy controls. METHODS: Patients with IBS according to Rome III criteria (n = 52) and healthy controls (n = 16) underwent a lactulose challenge test. By using magnetic resonance imaging, we measured small bowel water content (SBWC), and distension (diameter) of the distal ileum and the colon, both in fasting state and 1 h after ingestion of 10 g lactulose. We recorded symptoms after lactulose ingestion. KEY RESULTS: Lactulose provoked significantly more symptoms in IBS patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.0001). SBWC increased more in the patient group compared to the control group (p = 0.0005). The postprandial diameter of the terminal ileum was larger in patients with IBS and the postprandial diameter of the ascending colon was smaller in patients with diarrhea-predominant phenotype (IBS-D). Symptoms were not correlated with change in SBWC (r = 0.05; p = 0.11), nor to the diameters of the terminal ileum or the colon. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Compared to healthy controls, IBS patients developed more symptoms and had an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the small bowel in response to ingestion of the unabsorbable carbohydrate lactulose. This may be due to impaired motor activity of the small intestine or impaired function of the ileocecal segment.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that affects 15-20% of the Western population. BACKGROUND: There are currently few therapeutic options available for the treatment of IBS. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of a medical device containing a combination of Simethicone and Bacillus coagulans in the treatment of IBS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a monocentric double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group clinical trial. Adult subjects suffering from IBS as defined by Rome III criteria were enrolled. Bloating, discomfort, abdominal pain were assessed as primary end point. Subjects received the active treatment or placebo 3 time a day after each meal for 4 weeks of study period. Subjects were submitted to visit at Day 0 (T1), at Days 14 (T2) and 29 (T3). RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were included into the study. Intragroup analysis showed a significant reduction of the bloating, discomfort and pain in Colinox(R) group (CG) compared to placebo group (PG). Between group analysis confirmed, at T1-T3, significant differences between CG and PG in bloating and discomfort. DISCUSSION: Simethicone is an inert antifoaming able to reduce bloating, abdominal discomfort. Literature offers increasing evidence linking alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota and IBS and it is well known that probiotics are important to restore the native gut microbiota. The Colinox medical device is specifically targeted against most intrusive symptom of IBS (bloating) and it is also able to counteract the most accredited ethiopathogenetic factor in IBS (alterations of intestinal microbiota). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a combination of simethicone and Bacillus coagulans in treatment of IBS.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder characterized by abdominal pain, discomfort and bloating. The pathophysiology of IBS is poorly understood, but the presence of psychosocial basis is now known. There is an increasing number of publications supporting the role of genetics in IBS. Most of the variations are found in genes associated with the brain-gut axis, revealing the strong correlation of brain-gut axis and IBS. miRNAs, which play critical roles in physiological processes, are not well studied in IBS. However, so far there is found an involvement of alterations in miRNA expression or sequence, in IBS symptoms. IBS phenotype is affected by epigenetic alteration and environment. Changes in DNA and histone methylation are observed in patients who suffered childhood trauma or abuse, resulting in altered gene expression, such as the glucocorticoid receptor gene. Finally, diet is another factor associated with IBS, which may contribute to symptom onset. Certain foods may affect on bacterial metabolism and epigenetic modifications, predisposing to IBS.},

Many patients report that the make-up of the diet has an effect on their symptoms. The western diet consists of many different molecules. Some of them are small, fermentable and cannot be absorbed (FODMAPs). The low FODMAP diet was recently developed in Australia. In randomised controlled trials 37-45% of IBS patients experience symptom reduction with this diet. The low FODMAP diet starts with a 6-week elimination phase. If symptoms decrease substantially, it is followed by a structured reintroduction phase of the various FODMAPs over several weeks, after which patients are left with a diet that is simpler to follow.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In pediatrics, prebiotics and/or probiotics are added to infant formula, mainly to prevent diseases such as diarrheal disorders. Probiotic food supplements and medication are frequently used in the treatment of diarrheal disorders. This paper reviews the recent published evidence on these topics. AREAS COVERED: Relevant literature published using PubMed and CINAHL was collected and reviewed. Recent review papers were give special attention. EXPERT OPINION: The addition of pre- and/or probiotics to infant formula seems not harmful, but the evidence for benefit is limited. Most probiotics are commercialized as food supplements, and therefore do not qualify for medication legislation. Worldwide, Saccharomyces boulardii is the only strain which is registered as "medication" in the majority of countries. Efficacy data can only be considered if performed with the commercialized product. Some products reduce the risk for antibiotic-associated diarrhea and reduced the duration of acute infectious diarrhea with about 24 h. Overall, data in the other indications (inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome) are disappointing, although there are some recent promising results. The use of food supplements as medication opens the discussion to create a category of "medical food."},

   abstract = {Functional abdominal pain in the context of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a challenging problem for primary care physicians, gastroenterologists and pain specialists. We review the evidence for the current and future non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment options targeting the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Cognitive interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy have demonstrated excellent results in IBS patients, but the limited availability and labor-intensive nature limit their routine use in daily practice. In patients who are refractory to first-line therapy, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are both effective to obtain symptomatic relief, but only TCAs have been shown to improve abdominal pain in meta-analyses. A diet low in fermentable carbohydrates and polyols (FODMAP) seems effective in subgroups of patients to reduce abdominal pain, bloating, and to improve the stool pattern. The evidence for fiber is limited and only isphagula may be somewhat beneficial. The efficacy of probiotics is difficult to interpret since several strains in different quantities have been used across studies. Antispasmodics, including peppermint oil, are still considered the first-line treatment for abdominal pain in IBS. Second-line therapies for diarrhea-predominant IBS include the non-absorbable antibiotic rifaximin and the 5HT3 antagonists alosetron and ramosetron, although the use of the former is restricted because of the rare risk of ischemic colitis. In laxative-resistant, constipation-predominant IBS, the chloride-secretion stimulating drugs lubiprostone and linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase C agonist that also has direct analgesic effects, reduce abdominal pain and improve the stool pattern.},

METHODS: The 74-item PedsQL GI Module and 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 584 patients and 682 parents. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (such as chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease). RESULTS: Fourteen unidimensional scales were derived measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood, diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. The PedsQL GI Module Scales evidenced excellent feasibility, excellent reliability for the Total Scale Scores (patient self-report alpha = 0.97, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.97), and good-to-excellent reliability for the 14 individual scales (patient self-report alpha = 0.67-0.94, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.77-0.95). Intercorrelations with the Generic Core Scales supported construct validity. Individual Symptoms Scales known-groups validity across 7 GI disorders was generally supported. Factor analysis supported the unidimensionality of the individual scales. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL GI Module Scales demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent measurement properties and may be used as common metrics to compare GI-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice both within and across patient groups for FGIDs and organic GI diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and worry of pediatric patients with functional GI disorders (FGIDs) and organic GI diseases to healthy controls utilizing the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales for patient self-reports ages 5-18 years and parent proxy-reports for ages 2-18 years. The secondary objective was to compare FGIDs and organic GI diseases to each other. METHODS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 587 pediatric patients with GI disorders and 685 parents of patients. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease). Ten Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring Stomach Pain, Stomach Discomfort When Eating, Food and Drink Limits, Trouble Swallowing, Heartburn and Reflux, Nausea and Vomiting, Gas and Bloating, Constipation, Blood, and Diarrhea were administered along with two Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. Five hundred and thirteen healthy children and 337 parents of healthy children completed the PedsQL Gastrointestinal Scales in an Internet panel survey. RESULTS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales distinguished between pediatric patients with FGIDs and organic GI diseases in comparison with healthy controls, supporting known-groups validity. Patients with FGIDs reported more GI symptoms and worry than patients with organic GI diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales may be utilized as common metrics across pediatric patient groups with FGIDs and organic GI diseases and healthy samples to measure GI-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice.},

   abstract = {The gut microbiota (GM) consists of resident commensals and transient microbes conveyed by the diet but little is known about the role of the latter on GM homeostasis. Here we show, by a conjunction of quantitative metagenomics, in silico genome reconstruction and metabolic modeling, that consumption of a fermented milk product containing dairy starters and Bifidobacterium animalis potentiates colonic short chain fatty acids production and decreases abundance of a pathobiont Bilophila wadsworthia compared to a milk product in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, n = 28). The GM changes parallel improvement of IBS state, suggesting a role of the fermented milk bacteria in gut homeostasis. Our data challenge the view that microbes ingested with food have little impact on the human GM functioning and rather provide support for beneficial health effects.},

   abstract = {Steady advances in our knowledge of the composition and function of the human microbiome at multiple body sites including the gut, skin and airways will likely contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of probiotic action by beneficial microbes. Microbe:microbe and microbe:human interactions are important considerations as we select probiotics for pediatric patients in the future. Although our knowledge about the composition of the microbiome is progressing rapidly, many gaps exist about the functional capacity and metabolic machinery of the human microbiome. Based on a limited amount of data, probiotics appear capable of altering the composition and function of the microbiome. Probiotics may be part of dietary strategies that combine ways to enhance microbiome function with nutrients that may be converted to active compounds promoting human health. Probiotics have yielded beneficial effects in numerous studies in the context of different diseases in pediatric gastroenterology. These disease states include necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis, acute gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome. In the skin and airways, it is unclear if probiotics can affect the function of the microbiome to reduce the impact of diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. An enhanced understanding of the effects of probiotics on the microbiome should facilitate selection of optimal probiotic strains for specific diseases in the future.},

   abstract = {This study was undertaken to evaluate the influence of treatment with rifaximin followed by the probiotic VSL#3 versus no treatment on the progression of chronic prostatitis toward chronic microbial prostate-vesiculitis (PV) or prostate-vesiculo-epididymitis (PVE). A total of 106 selected infertile male patients with bacteriologically cured chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were randomly prescribed rifaximin (200 mg, 2 tablets bid, for 7 days monthly for 12 months) and probiotic containing multiple strains VSL#3 (450 x 10(9) FU per day) or no treatment. Ninety-five of them (89.6%) complied with the therapeutic plan and were included in this study. Group A = "6Tx/6-": treatment for the initial 6 and no treatment for the following 6 months (n = 26); Group B = "12Tx": 12 months of treatment (n = 22); Group C = "6-/6Tx": no treatment for the initial 6 months and treatment in the last 6 months (n = 23); Group D = "12-": no treatment (n = 24). The patients of Groups A = "6Tx/6-" and B = "12Tx" had the highest frequency of chronic prostatitis (88.5% and 86.4%, respectively). In contrast, group "12-": patients had the lowest frequency of prostatitis (33.4%). The progression of prostatitis into PV in groups "6Tx/6-" (15.5%) and "6-/6Tx" (13.6%) was lower than that found in the patients of group "12-" (45.8%). Finally, no patient of groups "6Tx/6-" and "6-/6Tx" had PVE, whereas it was diagnosed in 20.8% of group "12-" patients. Long-term treatment with rifaximin and the probiotic VSL#3 is effective in lowering the progression of prostatitis into more complicated forms of male accessory gland infections in infertile patients with bacteriologically cured CBP plus IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Linaclotide is a minimally absorbed, 14-amino acid peptide used to treat patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) or chronic constipation (CC). We performed a meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of linaclotide, compared with placebo, for patients with IBS-C or CC. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched for randomized, placebo-controlled trials examining the effect of linaclotide in adults with IBS-C or CC. Dichotomous results were pooled to yield a relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and number needed to treat (NNT). RESULTS: The search identified 7 trials of linaclotide in patients with IBS-C or CC; 6 were included in the analysis. Two of 3 trials of IBS-C used the end point recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration: an increase from baseline of 1 or more complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM)/week and a 30% or more reduction from baseline in the weekly average of daily worst abdominal pain scores for 50% of the treatment weeks. On the basis of this end point, the RR for response to treatment with 290 mug linaclotide, compared with placebo, was 1.95 (95% CI, 1.3-2.9), and the NNT was 7 (95% CI, 5-11). For CC, on the basis of data from 3 trials of patients with CC, the RR for the primary end point (more than 3 CSBMs/week and an increase in 1 or more CSBM/week, for 75% of weeks) was 4.26 for 290 mug linaclotide vs placebo (95% CI, 2.80-6.47), and the NNT was 7 (95% CI, 5-8). Linaclotide also improved stool form and reduced abdominal pain, bloating, and overall symptom severity in patients with IBS-C or CC. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a meta-analysis, linaclotide improves bowel function and reduces abdominal pain and overall severity of IBS-C or CC, compared with placebo.},

   abstract = {The microbiome located in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) comprises the largest community (diverse and dense) of bacteria, and in conjunction with a conducive internal milieu, promotes the development of regulated pro- and anti-inflammatory signals within the GIT that promotes immunological and metabolic tolerance. In addition, host-microbial interactions govern GIT inflammation and provide cues for upholding metabolic regulation in both the host and microbes. Failure to regulate inflammatory responses can increase the risk of developing inflammatory conditions in the GIT. Here, we review clinical studies regarding the efficacy of probiotics/prebiotics and the role they may have in restoring host metabolic homeostasis by rescuing the inflammatory response. The clinical studies reviewed included functional constipation, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, Clostridium difficile diarrhoea, infectious diarrhoea/gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases and necrotizing enterocolitis. We have demonstrated that there was an overall reduction in risk when probiotics were administered over placebo in the majority of GIT inflammatory conditions. The effect size of a cumulative reduction in relative risk for the GIT conditions/diseases investigated was 0.65 (0.61-0.70) (z = 13.3); p < 0.0001 that is an average reduction in risk of 35 % in favour of probiotics. We also progress a hypothesis that the GIT comprises numerous micro-axes (e.g. mucus secretion, Th1/Th2 balance) that are in operational homeostasis; hence probiotics and prebiotics may have a significant pharmacobiotic regulatory role in maintaining host GIT homeostasis in disease states partially through reactive oxygen species signalling.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is still an undefined syndrome with several unsettled issues despite the increasing awareness of its existence. We carried out a prospective survey on NCGS in Italian centers for the diagnosis of gluten-related disorders, with the aim of defining the clinical picture of this new syndrome and to establish roughly its prevalence compared with celiac disease. METHODS: From November 2012 to October 2013, 38 Italian centers (27 adult gastroenterology, 5 internal medicine, 4 pediatrics, and 2 allergy) participated in this prospective survey. A questionnaire was used in order to allow uniform and accurate collection of clinical, biochemical, and instrumental data. RESULTS: In total, 486 patients with suspected NCGS were identified in this 1-year period. The female/male ratio was 5.4 to 1, and the mean age was 38 years (range 3-81). The clinical picture was characterized by combined gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and/or constipation, nausea, epigastric pain, gastroesophageal reflux, aphthous stomatitis) and systemic manifestations (tiredness, headache, fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, 'foggy mind,' dermatitis or skin rash, depression, anxiety, and anemia). In the large majority of patients, the time lapse between gluten ingestion and the appearance of symptoms varied from a few hours to 1 day. The most frequent associated disorders were irritable bowel syndrome (47%), food intolerance (35%) and IgE-mediated allergy (22%). An associated autoimmune disease was detected in 14% of cases. Regarding family history, 18% of our patients had a relative with celiac disease, but no correlation was found between NCGS and positivity for HLA-DQ2/-DQ8. IgG anti-gliadin antibodies were detected in 25% of the patients tested. Only a proportion of patients underwent duodenal biopsy; for those that did, the biopsies showed normal intestinal mucosa (69%) or mild increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (31%). The ratio between suspected NCGS and new CD diagnoses, assessed in 28 of the participating centers, was 1.15 to 1. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective survey shows that NCGS has a strong correlation with female gender and adult age. Based on our results, the prevalence of NCGS seems to be only slightly higher than that of celiac disease.},

Attribution studies identified poultry as the reservoir responsible for up to 80% of the human Campylobacter infections. In the European Union, an estimated 30% of the human infections are associated with consumption and preparation of poultry meat. Until now, interventions in the poultry meat production chain have not been effectively introduced except for targeted interventions in Iceland and New Zealand. Intervention measures (eg, biosecurity) have limited effect or are hampered by economic aspects or consumer acceptance. In the future, a multilevel approach should be followed, aiming at reducing the level of contamination of consumer products rather than complete absence of Campylobacter.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Research has increasingly suggested that gut flora plays an important role in the development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS). Studies of the curative effect of probiotics for IBS have usually been positive but not always. However, the differences of treatment effects and mechanisms among probiotic stains, or mixture of them, are not clear. In this study, we compared the effects of different probiotics (Befidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus or mixture of the three) on intestinal sensation, barrier function and intestinal immunity in PI-IBS mouse model. METHODS: PI-IBS model was induced by Trichinella spiralis infection in mice. Different probiotics were administered to mice after 8 weeks infection. Visceral sensitivity was measured by scores of abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) and the threshold intensity of colorectal distention. Colonic smooth muscle contractile response was assessed by contraction of the longitudinal muscle strips. Plasma diamine oxidase (DAO) and d-lactate were determined by an enzymatic spectrophotometry. Expression of tight junction proteins and cytokines in ileum were measured by Western blotting. RESULTS: Compared to control mice, PI-IBS mice treated either alone with Befidobacterium or Lactobacillus (but not Streptococcus), or the mixture of the three exhibited not only decreased AWR score and contractile response, but also reduced plasma DAO and D-lactate. These probiotic treatments also suppressed the expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and IL-17 and promoted the expression of major tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin. The mixture of the three probiotic strains performed better than the individual in up-regulating these tight junction proteins and suppressing IL-17 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, but not Streptococcus, alleviated visceral hypersensitivity and recovered intestinal barrier function as well as inflammation in PI-IBS mouse model, which correlated with an increase of major tight junction proteins. In addition, Mixture of three species was indicated to be superior to a single one.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem with each human individual hosting at least 160 different bacterial strains. Our understanding of its role is rapidly expanding as a result of the molecular microbiological techniques that can accurately characterise its composition and 'omics' technologies that measure its metabolic activity. Since 1995, extensive research has investigated the prebiotic concept, which describes how supplementation of some non-digestible oligosaccharides can stimulate the growth and/or activity of specific genera including bifidobacteria. However, the vast majority of studies are in healthy human subjects, with few undertaken in patients with disorders relevant to clinical nutrition. Marked alterations of the luminal microbiota have been demonstrated in patients with digestive disorders, highlighting mechanisms through which they might be involved in their pathogenesis, including higher clostridia in patients who develop diarrhoea during enteral nutrition and the influence of bifidobacteria on intestinal dendritic cell phenotype in Crohn's disease. The impact of prebiotics on the intestinal microbiota of healthy people has not been consistently replicated in patients with digestive disorders. For example, a number of studies show that inulin/oligofructose do not increase bifidobacteria in enteral nutrition and Crohn's disease. Indeed, in Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome there is evidence that some prebiotics in high doses worsen functional symptoms. Unlike healthy human subjects, patients experience a number of issues that may alter their gastrointestinal microbiota (disease, antibiotics and inflammation) and the use of microbiota modifying therapies, such as prebiotics, do not always elicit the same effects in patients as they do in healthy people.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic idiopathic constipation are prevalent and burdensome gastrointestinal disorders. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence for probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in IBS and chronic idiopathic constipation has recently been performed. By far, the most convincing evidence was for the use of probiotics in IBS, which reported that overall probiotics reduced the risk of symptom persistence by 21%. However, only a minority of the trials were at a low risk of bias, and some used small sample sizes. Meta-analysis is a powerful tool to combine individual small trials to improve the power to detect the direction, size, and consistency of an effect, but it can do little to overcome the poor design of individual trials. Many debate the use of meta-analysis to combine data from different probiotic species, strains, or combinations. It is recommended that all future meta-analyses of probiotics, in any clinical setting, perform subgroup analysis on specific species/strains and specific combinations. It is hoped that the current meta-analysis will empower clinicians in making evidence-based decisions regarding whether probiotics should be recommended for IBS, which species/strain(s) to use, and for which symptoms.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is direct evidence that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves the gastrointestinal microbiota and some evidence that the microbiota might also play a similar role in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable. There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association of fructose and lactose intolerance and malabsorption with the symptoms of different functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) remains unclear. AIM: To investigate the prevalence of fructose and lactose intolerance (symptom induction) and malabsorption and their association with clinical gastrointestinal (GI) as well as non-GI symptoms in FGID and the outcome of dietary intervention. METHODS: Fructose and lactose intolerance (defined by positive symptom index) and malabsorption (defined by increased hydrogen/methane) were determined in 1372 FGID patients in a single centre using breath testing. Results were correlated with clinical symptoms in different FGID Rome III subgroups. The effectiveness of a targeted saccharide-reduced diet was assessed after 6-8 weeks. RESULTS: Intolerance prevalence across all FGIDs was 60% to fructose, 51% to lactose and 33% to both. Malabsorption occurred in 45%, 32% and 16% respectively. There were no differences in intolerance or malabsorption prevalence between FGID subgroups. FGID symptoms correlated with symptoms evoked during testing (r = 0.35-0.61. P < 0.0001), but not with malabsorption. Non-GI symptoms occurred more commonly in patients with intolerances. Methane breath levels were not associated with constipation using several cut-off thresholds. Adequate symptom relief was achieved in >80% of intolerant patients, irrespective of malabsorption. CONCLUSIONS: Fructose and lactose intolerances are common in FGID and associated with increased non-GI symptoms, but not with specific FGID subtypes. Symptoms experienced during breath testing, but not malabsorption, correlate with FGID symptoms. Effective symptom relief with dietary adaptation is not associated with malabsorption. Mechanisms relating to the generation of GI and non-GI symptoms due to lactose and fructose in FGID need to be explored further.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) is a common, benign, chronic diagnosis that has a significant negative impact on quality of life. FGIDs that develop in childhood can persist into adulthood. Currently, there is no cure and few treatment options are available. OBJECTIVE: This article provides an outline of current research supporting the role of food intolerance in children with FGIDs. DISCUSSION: Food intolerances have long been reported by patients with FGIDs; however, randomised controlled trials are lacking in this area. Food intolerances that have been investigated include intolerance to food chemicals, lactose, fructose and, more recently, fer-mentable carbohydrates, termed FODMAPs. The low-FODMAP diet eliminates poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates and has a clearly defined mechanism of action. Emerging evidence suggests it alleviates symptoms in adults with irritable bowel syndrome and, potentially, also in children. However, more evidence is required for the efficacy of the diet in children and in oth-er subgroups of FGID. Any dietary restriction in growing children should be undertaken with clinical supervision by a dietitian.},

One hypothesis is the mediation of melatonin levels, leading to changes in IBS symptoms. AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic, VSL#3, on symptoms, psychological and sleep parameters, and pain sensitivity in IBS, and relate these parameters to in vivo melatonin levels. METHODS: Forty-two IBS patients were randomly assigned to receive VSL#3 or placebo for 6 weeks. Subjects completed bowel and psychological questionnaires, underwent rectal sensitivity testing and saliva melatonin assays. RESULTS: Abdominal pain duration and distension intensity decreased significantly in the probiotic group, along with an increase in rectal distension pain thresholds. A correlation between increase in pain tolerance and improvement in abdominal pain scores (r = 0.51, p = 0.02) was seen with probiotic. There was an increase in salivary morning melatonin levels in males treated with VSL#3, which correlated (r = 0.61) with improved satisfaction in bowel habits. When grouped based on baseline diurnal melatonin levels, patients with normal diurnal fluctuations showed an increase in morning melatonin levels with VSL#3 treatment, which significantly correlated with improved satisfaction in bowel habits (r = 0.68). They also had reduced symptom severity scores and abdominal pain duration when treated with VSL#3, as well as satisfaction with bowel movements and quality-of-life. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3 improved symptoms and increased rectal pain thresholds. Symptom improvement correlated with a rise in morning melatonin, significant in males and subjects with normal circadian rhythm. This suggests that probiotics may act by influencing melatonin production, hence modulating IBS symptoms, in individuals with a normal circadian rhythm.},

We assessed lactose absorption and tolerance and the intake of dairy products in healthy volunteers (controls) and patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS). METHODS: Sixty patients diagnosed with D-IBS at the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Hangzhou, China and 60 controls were given hydrogen breath tests to detect malabsorption and intolerance after administration of 10, 20, and 40 g lactose in random order 7-14 days apart; participants and researchers were blinded to the dose. We assessed associations between the results and self-reported lactose intolerance (LI). RESULTS: Malabsorption of 40 g lactose was observed in 93% of controls and 92% of patients with D-IBS. Fewer controls than patients with D-IBS were intolerant to 10 g lactose (3% vs 18%; odds ratio [OR], 6.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-30.8; P = .008), 20 g lactose (22% vs 47%; OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.43-7.02; P = .004), and 40 g lactose (68% vs 85%; OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.08-6.42; P = .03). H(2) excretion was associated with symptom score (P = .001). Patients with D-IBS self-reported LI more frequently than controls (63% vs 22%; OR, 6.25; 95% CI, 2.78-14.0; P < .001) and ate fewer dairy products (P = .040). However, self-reported LI did not correlate with results from hydrogen breath tests. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of LI is related to the dose of lactose ingested and intestinal gas production and is increased in patients with D-IBS. Self-reported LI, but not objective results from hydrogen breath tests, was associated with avoidance of dairy products.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sorbitol and mannitol are naturally-occurring polyol isomers. Although poor absorption and induction of gastrointestinal symptoms by sorbitol are known, the properties of mannitol are poorly described. We aimed to expand data on food composition of these polyols, and to compare their absorptive capacities and symptom induction in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and healthy individuals. METHODS: Food samples were analysed for sorbitol and mannitol content. The degree of absorption measured by breath hydrogen production and gastrointestinal symptoms (visual analogue scales) was evaluated in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 21 healthy and 20 IBS subjects after challenges with 10 g of sorbitol, mannitol or glucose. RESULTS: Certain fruits and sugar-free gum contained sorbitol, whereas mannitol content was higher in certain vegetables. Similar proportions of patients with IBS (40%) and healthy subjects (33%) completely absorbed sorbitol, although more so with IBS absorbed mannitol (80% versus 43%; P = 0.02). Breath hydrogen production was similar in both groups after lactulose but was reduced in patients with IBS after both polyols. No difference in mean (SEM) hydrogen production was found in healthy controls after sorbitol [area-under-the-curve: 2766 (591) ppm 4 h(-1) ] or mannitol [2062 (468) ppm 4 h(-1) ] but, in patients with IBS, this was greater after sorbitol [1136 (204) ppm 4 h(-1) ] than mannitol [404 (154) ppm 4 h(-1) ; P = 0.002]. Overall gastrointestinal symptoms increased significantly after both polyols in patients with IBS only, although they were independent of malabsorption of either of the polyols. CONCLUSIONS: Increased and discordant absorption of mannitol and sorbitol occurs in patients with IBS compared to that in healthy controls. Polyols induced gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS independently of their absorptive patterns, suggesting that the dietary restriction of polyols may be efficacious.},

METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 49 IBS patients (probiotics: 25, placebo: 24) diagnosed according to the Rome III criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: either to receive multispecies probiotics (a mixture of Bifidobacterium longum, B. bifidum, B. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, and Streptococcus thermophilus) twice a day for 4 weeks or to receive a placebo twice a day for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy end-point was the proportion of participants whose IBS symptoms were substantially relieved at week 4. Secondary end-points were the intensity of abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, stool frequency/consistency, alterations in fecal microflora over the 4 weeks. Fecal microflora were analyzed in 34 patients (probiotics: 17, placebo: 17) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: The proportion of patients whose IBS symptoms were substantially relieved at week 4 was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group: 68.0% (17/25) versus 37.5% (9/24) (P < 0.05). Secondary end-points such as improvement in abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating occurred in the probiotics group but not in the placebo group. Fecal analysis revealed that B. lactis, L. rhamnosus, and S. thermophilus had increased significantly in the probiotics group after 4 weeks and that B. lactis had increased in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Multispecies probiotics are effective in IBS patients and induce the alterations in the composition of intestinal microbiota.},

Clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of linaclotide, and a platform to better understand the symptomatology of IBS-C. Based on recent clinical evidence, linaclotide should be considered for patients with IBS-C because it improves abdominal pain and bowel symptoms. In phase III trials, linaclotide met the US Food and Drug Administration responder endpoint with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 5.1-7.9, and European Medicines Agency coprimary endpoints at 12 weeks with a NNT of 4.39-7.69, and at 26 weeks with a NNT of 4.93-5.68. It is safe and effective, with diarrhea reported as the most common adverse effect, which leads to discontinuation of the medication in approximately 5% of patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and risk factors for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in China. METHODS: Cross-sectional studies relevant to IBS conducted among Chinese were identified through the databases including PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CBM, CNKI, Wanfang data and VIP. Quality of studies was assessed according to the criteria for cross-sectional studies recommended by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Analysis of data, publication bias and sensitivity were performed with Stata (Version 12.0). RESULTS: A total of twenty-three studies were extracted. No obvious publication bias was detected in all analysis except the effect of depression on IBS prevalence. Pooled prevalence of IBS in China was 6.5%. IBS was more common in women than in men (8.1% vs 6.8%;OR = 1.23, 95%CI 1.09-1.38) and high rate in age group between 30 to 59 years (6.9%; OR = 1.22, 95%CI 1.12-1.32) . Intestinal infection history (OR = 2.39, 95%CI 1.69-3.38), anxiety (OR = 2.95, 95%CI 1.94-4.49), depression (OR = 1.85, 95%CI 1.11-3.09), food allergy (OR = 2.80, 95%CI 2.12-3.67) and alcohol consumption (OR = 1.15, 95%CI 1.07-1.24) might increase the risk for IBS. There were no significant difference of IBS prevalence between urban and rural areas (OR = 0.97, 95%CI 0.72-1.29) , neither in different education classes (OR = 0.85, 95%CI 0.70-1.03) . Sub-group analysis showed IBS prevalence varied apparently with different diagnostic criteria: prevalence defined by Manning was 11.8% and by RomeIIand Rome III prevalence values were 4.4% and 8.9% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled prevalence of IBS in China was 6.5%. IBS is more common in age group between 30 to 59 years. Female, history of intestinal infection, anxiety, depression, food allergy and alcohol consumption were risk factors for IBS in Chinese population.},

   abstract = {To determine the prevalence and risk factors of IBS in children 8-13 years of age in Suzhou city, a cross-sectional study was conducted on children in grades 1 through 6 in public elementary schools in three districts of Suzhou. A multistage stratified random-sampling survey was conducted in a primary investigation using standardized questionnaires. Rome II criteria were used to confirm IBS and their risk factors were analyzed. Of 8,000 questionnaires 7,472 responded satisfactorily for a response rate of 93.4%. IBS was diagnosed in 10.81%. A decrease in the prevalence of IBS was significantly associated with advancing age and grade in school (trend test, P < 0.05). The prevalence of IBS in females was higher but not significantly different than males. The significant risk factors for IBS included young age (OR = 0.94), food allergy (OR = 1.53), gastroenteritis during childhood (OR = 1.29), eating fried food (OR = 1.62), anxiety (OR = 1.49), psychological insults in early childhood (OR = 1.47), and parental history of constipation (OR = 1.81; all P < 0.05). IBS prevalence of 10.81% in study population warrants preventive measures such as encouraging dietary changes, preventing gastroenteritis and childhood psychological insults.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this literature review is to develop a thorough understanding of the research on food intolerance and its relationship to irritable bowel syndrome. Knowledge of the connection between the two conditions will assist allied healthcare professionals in working with patients to better manage their symptoms. Reduced healthcare costs may also result if patients are able to identify problematic foods and experience symptom improvement with diet changes. The review consists of an overview of food intolerance including prevalence, specific foods implicated including an in-depth review of research on bulk sweeteners, as well as methods of diagnosis. In addition, prevalence, specific foods associated with food intolerance in irritable bowel syndrome patients such as carbohydrates and lipids, nutritional consequences of food intolerance, and possible food-related methods of treatment including increased fiber intake are discussed. Finally, suggestions for future research and possible directions allied healthcare professionals can start with in assisting patients are provided.},
