   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The updated Rome III criteria for pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) include new FGID categories and changes to the Rome II criteria for various FGIDs. To our knowledge, the implications of these revisions for patient classification have not been identified. The purpose of this study was to compare classification results using Rome II versus Rome III criteria for FGIDs associated with chronic abdominal pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were 368 pediatric patients whose subspecialty evaluations for chronic abdominal pain yielded no evidence of organic disease. The children's gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed with the parent-report version of the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms (QPGS). RESULTS: More patients met the criteria for a pediatric pain-related FGID according to the Rome III criteria (86.6%) than the Rome II criteria (68.0%). In comparison with the results from the Rome II criteria, the Rome III criteria classified a greater percentage of children as meeting criteria for Abdominal Migraine (23.1% vs 5.7%) and Functional Abdominal Pain (11.4% vs 2.7%). Irritable Bowel Syndrome was the most common diagnosis according to both Rome II (44.0%) and Rome III (45.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Changes to the Rome criteria make the Rome III criteria more inclusive, allowing classification of 86.6% of pediatric patients with medically unexplained chronic abdominal pain.},

STUDY DESIGN: Adolescents 12 to 18 years with newly diagnosed IBS were surveyed with a symptom checklist, pain rating scale, visual analog scale, and IBS quality of life (QOL) questionnaire. Subjects were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive AMI or placebo, and again completed surveys at 2, 6, 10, and 13 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (24 female) were enrolled. Patients receiving AMI were more likely to experience improvement from baseline in overall QOL at 6, 10, and 13 weeks (P = .019, .004, and .013). Patients receiving AMI were also more likely to experience a reduction in IBS-associated diarrhea at 6 and 10 weeks (P = .029 for both), a reduction in periumbilical pain at 10 weeks (P = .018), and a reduction in right lower quadrant pain at 6, 10, and 13 weeks (P = .014, .039, and .004). CONCLUSION: AMI significantly improves overall QOL in adolescents with IBS and should be a therapeutic option for adolescents with this disorder.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neonatal maternal deprivation induces colonic alterations in adult rats, such as hypersensitivity to distension or an increase in paracellular permeability, characteristics of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Recent studies described neuroimmune alterations in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were submitted to maternal deprivation for 3 h daily during postnatal days 2-14, and were sacrificed at 4 or 12 weeks of age. Control pups were left undisturbed with their dam. RESULTS: Colonic mast cell hyperplasia was observed at 4 and 12 weeks in maternally deprived rats, and was associated with an increase in protease content. Mucosal nerve fibre density assessed by protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 immunoreactivity was increased at 12 weeks but not at 4 weeks, while calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP)-immunoreactive fibres remain constant. Synaptogenesis assessed by synaptophysin immunostaining was increased at 4 weeks but not at 12 weeks. The number of mast cells in close proximity to PGP 9.5- or CGRP-immunoreactive fibres was greater at both 4 and 12 weeks. Expression of neurokinin NK(1) receptors in the spinal cord was enhanced at 12 weeks. No significant change in total mast cell number, PGP 9.5 immunoreactivity and mast cells associated with PGP 9.5-immunoreactive fibres was observed in the jejunum. Treatment of pups with anti-nerve growth factor (NGF) antibodies abolished the increases in synaptogenesis and in the number of mast cells in close proximity to nerve fibres observed 4 weeks after maternal deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal maternal deprivation induces closer association of colonic mast cells with nerves, which is similar to that seen in IBS patients. NGF is a possible mediator of this effect.},

   abstract = {Digestive tract proteases are best known for their proteolytic activity in the digestion of alimentary proteins. However, during the last decade, a possible role of proteases as signalling molecules has been emphasized with the discovery of a novel class of G-protein coupled receptors located on cell membranes that may be activated by proteolytic cleavage of their N-terminal extracellular domain. Type 2 protease-activated receptors (PAR-2) are cleaved by serine-proteases such as trypsin and tryptase. PAR-2 is present in many intestinal cell types and particularly on epithelial cells. Multiple functions have been demonstrated in the gut for PAR-2, including epithelial permeability, mainly the intercellular permeability that is of paramount importance in the equilibrium between the external milieu (digestive contents) and the submucosal immune system. Alterations of both tissue and luminal levels of proteases or serine-protease activity may affect gut permeability and subsequently the immune status of the mucosa. Activation of PAR-2 on epithelial cells may directly affect cytoskeleton contraction by triggering phosphorylation of myosin light chain with subsequent changes in tight junction permeability. Enhanced fecal protease level has been recently reported in both organic (ulcerative colitis) and functional (irritable bowel syndrome) intestinal disorders and may play a role in the pathogenesis of such diseases.},

   abstract = {Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that confer a health benefit to the host when administered in adequate amounts. In addition to human health benefits, probiotics can improve various aspects of growth and performance in livestock and poultry, as well as control undesirable microorganisms in food animals. Studies indicate that probiotics can prevent or treat certain conditions, including atopic disease in infants, food allergy, infection after surgery, acute diarrhea, and symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Understanding the complete mechanism, effectiveness, and potential use of probiotics is limited by the availability and sensitivity of current methods (i.e., culturing techniques). In recent years, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarrays have become prominent and promising methods to examine quantitative changes of specific members of the microbial community and the influence of probiotics on the structure and function of human and animal intestinal ecosystems. Culture-independent studies have established that only a fraction of organisms present in feces are cultivable, therefore, results obtained by cultivation are limited. Conversely, in-depth knowledge of microbial genomes has enabled real-time PCR and microarrays to be more sensitive and has resulted in precise methods for comprehensive analysis of the complex gut microbiota. Additionally, these technologies can assess the influence of intestinal microorganisms on host metabolism, nutrient status, and disease. This paper reviews method technologies and applications of real-time PCR and microarray assays as they relate to the effect and use of probiotics on the intestinal microbiota and gastrointestinal disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abdominal pain related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional abdominal pain (FAP) is frequent in children and can be of variable severity. Both IBS and FAP are associated with rectal hypersensitivity. We hypothesized that in children with IBS and FAP, the rectal sensory threshold for pain (RSTP) is associated with symptom severity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 47 patients (34 girls; median age, 14.2 years) with IBS (n = 29) and FAP (n = 18), according to the Rome II criteria, underwent a rectal barostat examination to determine their RSTP. Gastrointestinal symptom severity was assessed by validated questionnaires. During the rectal barostat exam, symptoms were documented using a visual analog scale and by measuring the area coloured on a human body diagram corresponding to painful sensations. RESULTS: The median RSTP was 16 mmHg and was similar in IBS and FAP patients. Eighty-three percent of the patients had rectal hypersensitivity (RSTP < or = 30.8 mmHg, the 5th percentile of control children studied in our laboratory). Fifty-one percent and 36%, respectively, reported missing school and social activities at least once per week. Increased frequency of pain, missed days of school, missed social activities, and pain during the barostat examination were not associated with lower RSTP values in either the whole group or in the subset of children with rectal hypersensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Rectal hypersensitivity is not proportional to the severity of symptoms in children with IBS and FAP, indicating that symptom severity is influenced by other factors in addition to visceral hypersensitivity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common lifelong disorders in western countries. However, most cases remain currently undiagnosed in North America, mostly due to poor awareness of CD by primary care physicians. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were (a) to determine whether an active case-finding strategy in primary care could increase the frequency of CD diagnosis and (b) to determine the most common clinical presentations of the condition. METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective study involving adult subjects during the years 2002-2004, attending one of the participating practices. All individuals with symptoms or conditions known to be associated with CD were tested for immunoglobulin A anti-transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies, and those with elevated anti-tTG were subsequently tested for IgA antiendomysial antibodies (EMA). All subjects who were positive for EMA were advised to undergo an intestinal biopsy and HLA typing. RESULTS: The study group included 737 women and 239 men, with a median age of 54.3 yr. A positive anti-tTG test was found in 30 out of 976 investigated subjects (3.07%, 95% CI 1.98-4.16). CD was diagnosed in 22 patients (18 women, 4 men). The most frequent reasons for CD screening in these 22 cases were bloating (12/22), thyroid disease (11/22), irritable bowel syndrome (7/22), unexplained chronic diarrhea (6/22), chronic fatigue (5/22), and constipation (4/22). The prevalence of CD in the serologically screened sample was 2.25% (95% CI 1.32-3.18). The diagnostic rate was low at baseline (0.27 cases per thousand visits, 95% CI 0.13-0.41) and significantly increased to 11.6 per thousand visits (95% CI 6.8-16.4, P < 0.001) following active screening implementation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that an active case-finding strategy in the primary care setting is an effective means to improve the diagnostic rate of CD in North America.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children ages 10 to 18 years undergoing colonoscopy (general anesthesia) for the first time completed pain and anxiety questionnaires immediately before the procedure and a pain questionnaire 48 hours after colonoscopy. The diagnosis was determined by chart review and physician interview. RESULTS: Children with FGID had a longer duration of pain than those with IBD. Children with FGID endorsed a greater total number of the pain descriptors. The FGID group reported higher usual pain severity and greater postprocedural pain. No differences in anxiety were reported. However, higher levels of anxiety were associated with higher pain scores at the time of colonoscopy in children with IBD. It required significantly more time to perform colonoscopy in the IBD group than in the FGID group. Longer procedure duration was positively correlated with pain in children with FGID but not in children with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Children with FGID report more usual pain symptoms and may describe more pain after a colonoscopy when compared with children with IBD. Anxiety appears to play a role in pain severity after colonoscopy in children presenting with IBD, but not in children with FGID.},

The mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract, a single layer of epithelial cells held together by tight junctions, provides a barrier between the external environment and the body's internal milieu. Any mechanism that breaches the tight junction exposes the body to foreign material be it protein, microorganisms or toxins. Stresses include physiological (exercise), psychological, disease-related or drug-induced factors. Stress associated gastrointestinal disorders include functional dyspepsia irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease peptic ulcer disease, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Some disease states disrupt gastrointestinal barrier function, e.g. infectious diarrhea, IBD, or celiac disease, whilst in others such as eczema it can be indirectly related to antigenic disruption of the barrier. Drugs, e.g. chemotherapy agents and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also disrupt barrier function. Malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies (zinc, folic acid, vitamin A) also predispose to mucosal damage. Assessment of gastrointestinal mucosal health has proved problematic as invasive techniques, whilst useful, provide limited data and no functional assessment. Noninvasive tests particularly breath tests do provide functional assessment and many can be used together as biomarkers to improve our ability to define a stressed mucosa. Therapeutic options include pharmacotherapies, immunomodulation or immunotherapy.},

   abstract = {Relieving abdominal pain is the principal treatment objective for patients with irritable bowel syndrome. No single drug stands out in the treatment strategy for this illness. Antispasmodics, magnesium aluminum silicates, and alverine citrate drugs all remain initial options for treatment, although their prescription is impeded by the fact that an increasing number are no longer approved for reimbursement. Increased dietary fibers often have a harmful effect on symptoms. Some patients are probably intolerant to some foods but there is no satisfactory proof on which to base a restrictive diet. Improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome has made it possible to diversify treatments that act first on one of the key pathophysiologic elements, visceral hypersensitivity. Antidepressants (especially tricyclics) can be used at low doses. Among the serotonergic drugs, serotonin 5-HT4 receptors agonists (tegaserod) may be available soon, but the development of 5-HT3 antagonists (alosetron, cilansetron) has been stopped for safety reasons (ischemic colitis and severe constipation). Non-drug options such as hypnosis, psychotherapy, relaxation, or yoga, may also be proposed to some patients. Probiotics are a possible treatment in the future.},

METHODS: We carried out an open-label, prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter trial on 129 patients meeting Rome II criteria for irritable bowel syndrome who did not have lactose malabsorption, abdominal surgery, overt psychiatric disorders and ongoing psychotropic drug therapy or ethanol abuse. For three months, the patients were treated with a symbiotic preparation and were investigated trough questionnaires on symptoms. Data on bloating and abdominal pain were obtained using the McNemar-Bowker's test, while data on stool frequency were evaluated using the t-test. RESULTS: The administration of a symbiotic preparation to these patients modified the clinical picture and intestinal function, with a significant increase of stool frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Our data, although the study had an open design, represent a further analysis of positive symbiotic effects on clinical manifestations and intestinal function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: From the epidemiological point of view, Lesniowski-Crohn's disease (CD) has become an important medical problem. It is essential to differentiate CD from functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, first of all, from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). There are no simple, non-invasive tests available which could help to identify patients with common symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea who should be referred for further evaluation, including endoscopy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the assessment of fecal calprotectin concentration in patients with CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Stool samples were taken from 31 patients of the Gastroenterology, Human Nutrition and Internal Diseases Department of Poznan Medical University who were diagnosed with CD. Patients suffering from IBS served as the control group. Calprotectin concentration was assessed by means of the immunoenzymatic ELISA method. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration and blood cell count were determined. The clinical activity of CD was assessed by means of Crohn's Disease Activity Index. An appropriate statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Mean calprotectin concentration in CD group was 32.01 +/- 22.58 mg/l and it was statistically higher (p <0.0003) than among IBS patients. A concentration of 16.01 mg/l had 67.7% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity in distinguishing between CD and IBS. There was a positive correlation between calprotectin concentration and CRP, and negative--with hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of fecal calprotectin concentration may be useful in differential diagnoses of CD and monitoring patients with CD.},

Our aim was to examine the occurrence of psychosocial and behavioural factors among patients diagnosed with IBS in primary care. The study had an epidemiological population-based case-control design comparing 347 IBS cases to 1041 age and sex matched controls from the general population. A survey was directed to cases and controls based on validated questions asking for mood status, job strain, family history of IBS, and sleeping habits as well as education, nutritional and exercise habits and medication. In multivariate analyses, independent associations were found between IBS and lack of influence on work planning, a family history of IBS, anxiety, and sleeping disturbances. Important factors associated with IBS diagnosis among females were anxiety as well as family history of IBS and lack of co-determination at work. For males, only lack of influence on working pace and family history of IBS remained independently associated with an IBS diagnosis. The causal associations of the complex risk factor panorama for IBS warrants further study. This study indicates that there should be a special focus on investigating the psychosocial working conditions and their associations to IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) are common in school-aged children; however, there is no reliable treatment. AIM: To determine the efficacy of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for treating FAPD in children. METHODS: A total of 104 children who fulfilled the Rome II criteria for functional dyspepsia (FD), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or functional abdominal pain (FAP) were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in which they received LGG (n = 52), or placebo (n = 52) for 4 weeks. RESULTS: For the overall study population, those in the LGG group were more likely to have treatment success (no pain) than those in the placebo group (25% vs. 9.6%, relative benefit (RB) 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-6.6, number needed to treat (NNT) 7, 95% CI: 4-123). For children with IBS (n = 37), those in the LGG group were more likely to have treatment success than those in the placebo group (33% vs. 5%, RB 6.3, 95% CI: 1.2-38, NNT 4, 95% CI: 2-36) and reduced frequency of pain (P = 0.02), but not pain severity (P = 0.10). For the FD group (n = 20) and FAP group (n = 47), no differences were found. CONCLUSION: The LGG appears to moderately increase treatment success, particularly among children with IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is characterised by elevated colonic lumenal serine protease activity. The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the origin of this elevated serine protease activity, (2) to evaluate if it may be sufficient to trigger alterations in colonic paracellular permeability (CPP) and sensitivity, and (3) to examine the role of the proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) activation and signalling cascade in this process. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Faecal enzymatic activities were assayed in healthy subjects and patients with IBS, ulcerative colitis and acute infectious diarrhoea. Following mucosal exposure to supernatants from control subjects and IBS-D patients, electromyographic response to colorectal balloon distension was recorded in wild-type and PAR-2(-/-) mice, and CPP was evaluated on colonic strips in Ussing chambers. Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and phosphorylated myosin light chain were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The threefold increase in faecal serine protease activity seen in IBS-D patients compared with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) or infectious diarrhoea is of neither epithelial nor inflammatory cell origin, nor is it coupled with antiprotease activity of endogenous origin. Mucosal application of faecal supernatants from IBS-D patients in mice evoked allodynia and increased CPP by 92%, both of which effects were prevented by serine protease inhibitors and dependent on PAR-2 expression. In mice, colonic exposure to supernatants from IBS-D patients resulted in a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and delayed redistribution of ZO-1 in colonocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated colonic lumenal serine protease activity of IBS-D patients evokes a PAR-2-mediated colonic epithelial barrier dysfunction and subsequent allodynia in mice, suggesting a novel organic background in the pathogenesis of IBS.},

   abstract = {OPINION STATEMENT: Lactose malabsorption is a syndrome producing constellation of symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and sometimes nausea and/or vomiting. Primary causes of lactose malabsorption due to loss of intestinal lactase activity include genetic/racial lactase nonpersistence, congenital lactase deficiency, and developmental lactase deficiency. Secondary lactose malabsorption can be caused by any disorder that injures the small intestinal mucosa, such as viral gastroenteritis, celiac disease, allergic (eosinophilic) gastroenteritis, and radiation enteritis. The diagnosis depends on careful clinical evaluation and is customarily confirmed with a lactose breath hydrogen test. As the symptoms are nonspecific, many adults diagnosed with lactose malabsorption actually have irritable bowel syndrome. Treatment consists of a trial of eliminating lactose-containing dairy foods, with supplementation of alternative calcium and protein sources. Commercial enzyme products containing beta-galactosidases can be prescribed to help patients digest dietary lactose. Long-term lactose restriction usually is not necessary and can lead to reduced bone mineral density.},

   abstract = {5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a major transmitter molecule within the gastrointestinal tract. It is contained in enterochromaffin (EC) cells, which form part of the epithelial lining of the gut and in enteric neurones in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses. 5-HT is present in murine mucosal mast cells in the lamina propria and some studies have suggested that human mast cells may also contain 5-HT especially in conditions associated with mastocytosis. The strategic positioning of the enteric and extrinsic sensory innervation in close proximity to these sources of 5-HT, in conjunction with their demonstrated sensitivity to this mediator, suggests the involvement of 5-HT in the transduction of visceral stimuli and reflex responses affecting motor and secretory function. Under physiological conditions, the release of 5-HT from these storage sites may result in the orchestration of reflexes responsible for transit of material along the bowel at a rate that is appropriate for digestion and absorption of nutrients. However, in the pathophysiological state, 5-HT acting together with other inflammatory mediators may cause inappropriate intestinal secretomotor activity and/or initiate sensations such as nausea or discomfort/pain. Current evidence suggests that the bioavailability of 5-HT within the gut wall is altered in a number of post-inflammatory models of gut dysfunction with increased numbers of EC cells and mast cells with increased 5-HT content in proximity to sensory nerve endings, and decreased serotonin reuptake mechanisms. Changes may also occur in the sensory innervation or pathways within the central nervous system. These processes may contribute to pain mechanisms in the irritable bowel syndrome, in which visceral hypersensitivity is a predominant feature and may also contribute to motor dysfunction leading to altered bowel habit.},

The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of phytotherapy on symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee. A previous study of Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, acted as a model in the development of the protocol of this investigation. Twenty adults, previously diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knee, were recruited from two Inner London GP practices into this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study carried out in a primary-care setting. All subjects were seen in consultation three times by a herbal practitioner who was blinded to the randomization coding. Each subject was prescribed treatment and given lifestyle advice according to usual practice: continuation of conventional medication where applicable, healthy-eating advice and nutrient supplementation. Individualized herbal medicine was prescribed for each patient, but only dispensed for those randomized to active treatment-- the remainder were supplied with a placebo. At baseline and outcome (after ten weeks of treatment), subjects completed a food frequency questionnaire and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) knee health and Measure Yourself Outcome Profile (MYMOP) wellbeing questionnaires. Subjects completing the study per protocol (n = 14) reported an increased intake of wholegrain foods (p = 0.045) and oily fish (p = 0.039) compared to baseline, but no increase in fruit and vegetables and dairy products intakes. There was no difference in the primary outcome measure of knee health assessed as the difference in the mean response (baseline-week 10) in WOMAC score between the two treatment groups. However, there was, compared with baseline, improvement in the active group (n = 9) for the mean WOMAC stiffness sub-score at week 5 (p = 0.035) and week 10 (p = 0.060) but not in the placebo group (n = 5). Furthermore, for the active, but not the placebo group, the mean WOMAC total and sub-scores all showed clinically significant improvement (> or = 20%) in knee symptoms at weeks 5 and 10 compared with baseline. Moreover, the mean MYMOP symptom 2 sub-score, mostly relating to osteoarthritis (OA), showed significant improvement at week 5 (p = 0.02) and week 10 (p = 0.008) compared with baseline for the active, but not for the placebo group. This pilot study showed that herbal medicine prescribed for the individual by a herbal practitioner resulted in improvement of symptoms of OA of the knee.},

Loperamide and diphenoxylate are commonly used to treat diarrhea in numerous settings of inflammatory bowel disease. Loperamide has also been observed to increase anal sphincter tone, which may lead to improvement of fecal continence in patients with and without diarrhea. Loperamide is generally well tolerated at recommended nonprescription doses, with the most common side effects related to the impact on bowel motility (abdominal pain, distention, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and constipation).},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional GI disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated with alterations in defecation or stool frequency and consistency. In Western industrialized countries, women seek health care services for their symptoms more frequently than men. The cause of IBS is likely multifactorial involving altered motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. Many patients note that their symptoms are exacerbated by diet and stress, and women frequently report menstrual cycle fluctuations in symptoms. Current approaches to IBS management include behavioral management therapies such as dietary intake changes and stress reduction cognitive restructuring. Drug therapies are targeted at altering pain sensitivity, motility, and secretion. This review provides an overview of the pathogenesis of IBS, factors that contribute to gender differences, and current therapeutic approaches for symptom management.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (-13910 C/T and -22018 G/A) upstream of the lactase gene (LCT) have been found to be associated with lactose tolerance in Europeans. METHODS: In one hundred and twenty Austrian outpatients, who visited the physician's office for symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), hydrogen breath testing (HBT) and LCT genotyping by polymerase chain reaction and reverse-hybridisation were performed in parallel. RESULTS: The coincidence between a genotype suggesting lactase non-persistence (lactose intolerance) and a positive HBT result was almost perfect (97.4% for LCT-13910 C/T and 100% for LCT-22018 G/A). Between a genotype indicating lactase persistence (lactose tolerance) and a negative HBT result the coincidence was lower (72% and 71.4%, respectively). Among heterozygotes, there was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of positive HBT results with age. Both SNPs were in accordance in 117/120 (97.5%) patients. CONCLUSION: Genetic analysis of LCT-13910 C/T and LCT-22018 G/A is a good indicator for the presence of lactose intolerance. Because age, as well as a number of secondary causes (e.g. celiac disease), can influence HBT results, it is useful to combine HBT and genetic analysis in the diagnostic assessment of IBS.},

Adults >or=18 years with a diagnosis of FCC verified by one pediatric gastroenterologist participated in the questionnaire-based study. Controls were comprised of adults who underwent tonsillectomy as otherwise healthy children during the period corresponding to the FCC diagnosis. The prevalence of constipation, IBS, and dyspepsia was determined by the Bowel Disease Questionnaire. Twenty FCC adults (8 females), median age 22 years, were compared with 17 adult controls (10 females), median age 22.9 years. The frequency of constipation in FCC adults was not different from that in controls (25% versus 23.5%). The frequency of IBS in FCC adults was higher than in controls (55% versus 23.5%; P < 0.05). Dyspepsia was reported by 25% of both groups. The median follow-up period of the FCC adults was 14 years. In a long-term follow-up of a small sample, the prevalence of constipation in FCC adults is comparable to that in controls. Childhood constipation appears to be a predictor of IBS in adulthood.},

   abstract = {Modern molecular nutrition focuses on health promotion, disease prevention and performance improvement through diet. In analogy to Pharmacogenetics and -genomics, the disciplines "Nutrigenetics" and "Nutrigenomics" have evolved. Nutrigenetics asks how individual genetic disposition, manifesting as single-nucleotide- and copy-number polymorphisms as well as epigenetic regulation, affects susceptibility to diet. Nutrigenomics addresses the inverse relationship, i.e. how diet influences gene transcription, protein expression and metabolism. The long-term objective of Nutrigenomics is personalised nutrition for maintenance and improvement of individual health and for disease prevention. Transcriptomics can put Proteomics- and Metabonomics-derived markers into a larger biological perspective. Metabonomics is a diagnostic tool for metabolic classification of individuals with the asset of quantitative, non-invasive analysis of easily accessible human body fluids such as urine, blood and saliva. This feature also applies to some extent to Proteomics, with the constraint that the latter discipline is more complex in terms of composition and dynamic range of the sample. Apart from addressing the most complex "Ome", Proteomics represents the only platform that delivers not only markers for disposition and efficacy but also targets of intervention. Application of integrated Omic technologies will drive the understanding of interrelated pathways in healthy and pathological conditions and will help to define molecular 'switchboards', necessary to develop disease related biomarkers. This will contribute to the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies for both pharmacological and nutritional interventions. This paper reviews inflammatory gut disorders, the state-of-the-art of the three Omics platforms and discusses the implication of the latter in biomarker revelation for nutritionally actionable inflammatory disorders in the intestine.},

   abstract = {Beta2-1 fructans are carbohydrate molecules with prebiotic properties. Through resistance to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract, they reach the colon intact, where they selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial members of the gut microbiota. Through this modification of the intestinal microbiota, and by additional mechanisms, beta2-1 fructans may have beneficial effects upon immune function, ability to combat infection, and inflammatory processes and conditions. In this paper, we have collated, summarised and evaluated studies investigating these areas. Twenty-one studies in laboratory animals suggest that some aspects of innate and adaptive immunity of the gut and the systemic immune systems are modified by beta2-1 fructans. In man, two studies in children and nine studies in adults indicate that the adaptive immune system may be modified by beta2-1 fructans. Thirteen studies in animal models of intestinal infections conclude a beneficial effect of beta2-1 fructans. Ten trials involving infants and children have mostly reported benefits on infectious outcomes; in fifteen adult trials, little effect was generally seen, although in specific situations, certain beta2-1 fructans may be beneficial. Ten studies in animal models show benefit of beta2-1 fructans with regard to intestinal inflammation. Human studies report some benefits regarding inflammatory bowel disease (four positive studies) and atopic dermatitis (one positive study), but findings in irritable bowel syndrome are inconsistent. Therefore, overall the results indicate that beta2-1 fructans are able to modulate some aspects of immune function, to improve the host's ability to respond successfully to certain intestinal infections, and to modify some inflammatory conditions.},

   abstract = {Intestinal microflora can be considered as a ''dynamic system'' that actively interacts with the intestinal epithelium and the local immune system. It synthesizes antimicrobial substances (bacteriocins), vitamins (PP, B1, B6, B12), it produces a major intestinal nutrient (butyric acid) and interacts in a competitive fashion with the pathogens. Lactobacilli concentration (Gram+, Gram variable, facultative anaerobes) is generally decreased in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. This syndrome has, until recently been considered to be ''functional'', whereas, in fact, it may result from previous enteritis (in up to 31% of patients), featuring a persistent low-grade intestinal inflammation and a reduction in interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration. Some Lactobacilli strains (e.g. L. paracasei subsp. paracasei) in vitro lead to normalisation of the hypercontractility of the smooth muscle cells. A growing body of clinical findings indicates that some ''genetically stable'' strains of Lactobacilli may be useful in the treatment, even long term, of IBS, and reduce the postoperative infection rate, especially in critically ill patients (orthotopic liver transplant, severe pancreatitis). However, some Lactobacilli, ''not genetically stable'', used in the treatment of neutropenic patients during chemotherapy and in pediatric patients submitted to gastrojejunostomy, have been reported to lead to bacteremia and endocarditis. These effects may be due to transfer of bacteria and genetic material. Therefore, the confirmed genetic stability and the fact that no antibiotic resistance occurs are fundamental requisites for the use of Lactobacilli in certain disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as, for instance, IBS. In conclusion, ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli (L. paracasei subsp. Paracasei F19) have recently become available, representing an exiting new field in clinical studies and for treatment purposes, offering guarantees of safety also for long-term use. Careful personalized evaluation, as always in medical practice, is necessary in order to gain further insight into, and to validate with additional studies, the role of ''genetically stable'' Lactobacilli in the treatment of IBS.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recurrent abdominal pain continues to be one of the most ubiquitous conditions faced by the healthcare team, and has a significant emotional and economic impact. We have moved from considering it a psychological condition to recognizing the physiological and environmental contributions, and considering the condition in the framework of a biopsychosocial model where biology, psychology and social environment interact. Here, we review current studies addressing etiologies, diagnostic techniques and treatment options for recurrent abdominal pain in children. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies continue to highlight the role of visceral hypersensitivity in recurrent abdominal pain. The psychological state of the child and the parent (most often the mother) in terms of their anxiety, somatization and coping skills can, however, modulate the expression of symptoms. Diagnosis still is made by history and physical examination. Newer treatment options include relaxation and distraction therapies as well as medications. The role of probiotics in children remains to be defined. SUMMARY: The approach to the child with recurrent abdominal pain must include the recognition of the physiological contributions, and this information must be relayed to the child and parents. Acknowledgement also must be paid to the role of psychological state in the parent as well as in the child in modulating the severity of symptoms.},

Using plain abdominal radiographs, we studied whether subjective complaints after a lactulose breath test would be quantitatively related to intestinal gas volumes. METHODS: Abdominal symptoms after the breath test were quantified by a written questionnaire and gas volumes were scored in plain abdominal radiographs, in 50 consecutive patients with unexplained, irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms. Breath excretion of hydrogen and methane was determined in all patients. RESULTS: Forty-two (84%) of the patients claimed that their post-breath test symptoms were a true replicate of their customary discomfort. Total symptom scores (sum of scores for pain/discomfort, borborygmi, bloating, diarrhea, constipation) or any specific symptom score were not significantly correlated to gas volume scores (r=-0.04; P=0.8 for total symptom score). The 13 (26%) methane producers had significantly higher mean gas volume scores compared with nonproducers (0.38 vs. 0.24; P=0.0008), but fewer symptoms (total symptom score 11.9 vs. 18.2; P=0.17). CONCLUSION: Intestinal gas volume, as scored in plain abdominal radiographs, is not correlated with abdominal discomfort after lactulose challenge. Intestinal gas may not be the major cause of abdominal discomfort following carbohydrate ingestion in patients with functional gut disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Bacterial overgrowth has been implicated in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The objective of this study was to investigate whether post-infectious IBS following Giardia lamblia infection is related to intestinal bacterial overgrowth, as diagnosed by the lactulose breath test (LBT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with persistent gastrointestinal complaints related to a recent outbreak of G. lamblia infection were included in the study. Despite one or several courses of treatment with metronidazole during the previous months, 23 of the patients were still stool positive for G. lamblia, whereas the remaining 54 patients had cleared the infection. All patients and 42 healthy volunteers underwent a LBT with 10 g lactulose, and their customary and post-LBT abdominal symptoms were scored. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of the patients had IBS. Lactulose-induced hydrogen breath excretion was not significantly different in patients and controls. Customary and post-LBT symptoms were abnormally high in the patients, irrespective of both G. lamblia infection status and LBT results. Furthermore, lactulose challenge replicated the patients' customary complaints in 70% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal complaints in patients with persistent or cleared giardiasis were unrelated to hydrogen breath excretion after lactulose challenge. Post-giardiasis IBS cannot be ascribed to intestinal bacterial overgrowth, as diagnosed by LBT.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Serotonin (5-HT) is among other factors involved in gastrointestinal motility, secretion and visceral sensation. Available data suggest that secretion and metabolism of 5-HT may be disturbed in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Interpretation of these observations have been hampered by the variable methodology used and small numbers of patients involved in the previous studies. Aim of this study was to measure serum 5-TH concentration under fasting condition in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), compared with controls (K). The metabolite of serotonine--5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) in urine was also assessed. METHODS: 71 subjects, aged 19-50 years were included in this study. Three groups were distinguished: group I (n=25)--healthy volunteers, group II (n=23)--patients with constipation predominant (IBS-C), group Ill (n=23)--subjects with diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). IBS was diagnosed according to Rome Ill Criteria. On the day of the experiment, patients received a standard meal (Nutridrink 6 x 300 kcal) and blood samples were collected during fasting. 5-HIAA concentration was determined in 24-hour urine collection. Concentration of 5-HT and 5-HIAA was measured by immunoenzyme ELISA method employing standard kits IBL nr RE59121 i RE59131 and Labsystems Multiscan detector. RESULTS: The average serotonin concentration during fasting was found in group I--156.67 +/- 49.12 ng/ml, in group II--221.73 +/- 91.56 ng/ml (p < 0.05), in group III--3.50 +/- 1.71 mg/24h. 5- HIAA concentration in urine was decreased in group Ill--3.50 +/- 1.71 mg/24 hrs (p < 0.05) and group II--4.37 +/- 2.95 mg/24 hrs compared with healthy volunteers--5.65 +/- 2.31 mg/24 hrs. CONCLUSION: (1) Serotonin concentration is increased in C-IBS and D-IBS patients. (2) Urine 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid excretion is decreased in IBS-subjects. (3) Disturbed metabolism of serotonin probably may play role in pathogenesis of functional bowel diseases.},

Endoscopy is commonly used but is invasive and expensive. Mucosal inflammation in IBD can be detected through fecal biomarkers, though the present enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) tests require laboratory facilities. We validated the diagnostic performance of two new fecal rapid tests (FRTs) for the detection of calprotectin and lactoferrin and assessed their potential to differentiate IBD from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: The calprotectin and lactoferrin FRTs and ELISA tests were performed on the fecal samples of 114 patients referred for endoscopy, 80% of whom had IBS and 20% IBD, and validated against the endoscopic diagnosis. RESULTS: The sensitivity and negative predictive value of the calprotectin FRT were both 100%, whereas they were 78% and 95%, respectively, for the lactoferrin FRT. The specificity and positive predictive value were slightly higher for the lactoferrin FRT. Both FRTs had similar diagnostic accuracy as the corresponding ELISA tests. CONCLUSIONS: The calprotectin and lactoferrin rapid tests are as good as the ELISA tests in detecting colonic inflammation. Given their simple use, FRTs can support the non-invasive exclusion of IBD, notably in primary care.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder characterized by abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, and bloating. It has traditionally been viewed as a disorder of visceral hypersensitivity heavily influenced by stress, and therefore therapeutic strategies to date have largely reflected this. However, more recently, there is good evidence for a role of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in its pathogenesis. Changes in fecal microbiota, the use of probiotics, the phenomenon of postinfectious IBS, and the recognition of an upregulated host immune system response suggest that an interaction between the host and GI microbiota may be important in the pathogenesis of IBS. This article explores the role of the GI microbiota in IBS and how their modification might lead to therapeutic benefit.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A subset of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have an increased number of mast cells (MCs) in the colonic mucosa. Psychological factors are believed to contribute to the course of IBS. AIMS: To examine associations between fatigue, depression and MCs of the colonic mucosa in IBS. METHODS: Colonic biopsies were taken from 50 Rome II IBS patients, 21 healthy controls and 11 depressed/fatigued patients without IBS. The cellularity of the lamina propria was determined as the number of inflammatory cells per high power field (hpf) through a 400x microscope. The Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) and the short form Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) evaluated the severity of fatigue and depression. RESULTS: IBS patients had a significant increase in the cellularity of the lamina propria compared with controls or with depressed patients (mean (SD) 94.5 (48-110) vs 68 (58-82) and 78 (87-90) cells per hpf, p = 0.005 and p = 0.05, respectively), in particular of MCs (9.3 (5.6-11.7) vs 4.0 (2.7-6.8) and 4.3 (2.8-7.8) cells per hpf, p = 0.001 and p = 0.005, respectively). Both the FIS and BDI scores were significantly higher in IBS or in depressed patients than in controls (p<0.001). In IBS, the FIS score correlated significantly with the cellularity of the lamina propria (r = 0.51, p<0.0001) and MCs (r = 0.64, p<0.0001). In IBS, the BDI score correlated significantly with MCs (r = 0.29, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated MCs counts are a key feature of the low-grade inflammatory infiltrate in the caecal mucosa of IBS. Fatigue and depression are associated with mucosal cell counts, in particular MCs, suggesting that psychological factors are associated with the low-grade inflammatory infiltrate in IBS.},

RESULTS: The study cohort included 71 patients with Rome-III IBS evaluated at the State Research Institute of Nutrition of Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (mean age 41,4; mean IBS-QOL = 65,6; 76% women). The mean completion + scoring time for BEST was under 3 minutes vs 25 minutes for IBS-QOL. There was a striking correlation (r = - 0,8) between BEST and IBS-QOL results. CONCLUSIONS: BEST is a concise, rapidly completed, point-of-care IBS severity index that demonstrates large correlation with well-validated instrument for assessing QOL (IBS-QOL) in IBS patients.},

Other modes of action, including bacterial displacement and alterations in luminal contents, are also plausible. While clinical evidence of efficacy is now beginning to emerge, a review of available trials emphasizes the importance of a clear definition of strain selection, dose and viability. The possible roles of co-therapy or sequential therapy with antibiotics, probiotics, prokinetics, or other agents also deserves further study. The role of the enteric flora is evidently an area of great potential in IBS; we are on the threshold of a new era of research and therapy for this common disorder.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Normal sleep is paramount for a healthy lifestyle and high quality of life. Sleep modulates the immune system and thus affects the course of several chronic inflammatory conditions. There are no reported studies that address the role of sleep disturbance in the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to characterize sleep disturbance in IBD using validated measures of sleep and quality of life. METHODS: A self-administered, mail-in questionnaire package was sent to 205 subjects after a brief instruction. The questionnaire package was composed of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a measure of disease severity and the IBD-Quality of Life Questionnaire. A total of 119 subjects were recruited (58% response rate): 80 with inactive IBD, 24 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 15 healthy controls. RESULTS: The IBD subjects reported significantly prolonged sleep latency, frequent sleep fragmentation, higher rate of using sleeping pills, decreased day-time energy, increased tiredness and poor overall sleep quality compared to healthy controls. The abnormal sleep patterns in IBD subjects were similar to IBS subjects. The reported sleep quality was correlated with IBD disease severity score (r(2) = 0.55, P = 0.02). Both IBD and IBS subjects thought that sleep and their disease status were correlated. CONCLUSION: The results show that IBD patients have significant sleep disturbance even when their disease is not active. This problem might affect quality of life, gastrointestinal symptoms and coping ability, and might potentially modify disease severity or increase risk of flare-up. Regardless of the primary or secondary origin of this problem, sleep disturbance should be addressed in the clinical management of patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) phenotyping has emerged as a useful test in intestinal pathology. In celiac disease (CD), a permanent and marked increase of gammadelta+ IELs has been described. However, there is a lack of knowledge about this peculiar IELs population in other intestinal pathologies. AIM: To analyze the percentage of IELs, specifically gammadelta+ IELs subset, present in duodenal mucosa biopsies from patients with CD and compare it with those obtained from patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Twelve patients with untreated CD, 8 patients with SIBO, and 10 patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS were evaluated. All subjects underwent upper endoscopy for mucosal biopsy and jejunal aspirate. From 2 small bowel biopsies, intraepithelial cells were isolated and labeled with the following monoclonal antibodies CD103-PE (phycoerythrin), CD3-FITC (fluoresecein isothio-cynate), CD-7R-PE, CD45RO-APC (allophycocyanin), and TcR gammadelta-FITC. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a standard FACScan. Total and IELs subset counts were expressed as percentage. RESULTS: Mean total IELs percentage was 16.7+/-6% in IBS, 25.4+/-17% in SIBO, and 26+/-13% in CD patients (P=0.2). CD and SIBO patients, had significantly higher percentages of gammadelta+ IELs (15.7+/-13% and 14.6+/-8%) than IBS subjects (4.1+/-2.5%, P<0.05). There was no difference between CD and SIBO (P=0.6). CONCLUSIONS: An increased density of gammadelta+ IELs is typical, but not specific for CD. A similar increase was observed in subjects with SIBO. Our findings suggest that this unique T-cell population might have a key role against intestinal bacterial infections.},

Although corticosteroids are potent inhibitors of inflammatory processes, only one study with corticosteroids in patients with postinfectious IBS exists, which suggests that prednisolone is not an effective treatment for IBS symptoms. AIM: To evaluate whether dexamethasone treatment prevents protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) activation-induced visceral hyperalgesia and increased permeability in rats, and to determine whether the effects involve colonic mast cells. METHODS: Abdominal contractions provoked by rectal distension were recorded in rats equipped with intramuscular electrodes. Changes in visceral hypersensitivity provoked by intracolonic administration of PAR-2-activating peptide (SLIGRL; H-serine-leucine-isoleucine-glycine-arginine-leucine-OH), changes in colonic mucosal rat mast cell protease-II (RMCP-II) content, mast cell count and PAR-2 expression were measured after a 4-day treatment with dexamethasone (1 mg/day/rat intraperitoneally) or its vehicle (water). The effect of mast cell stabiliser (doxantrazole, 1 mg/kg intraperitoneally, 2 h before and 6 h after intracolonic infusion of SLIGRL) on SLIGRL-induced visceral hyperalgesia was also assessed. The effects of SLIGRL and a mast cell degranulator (compound 48/80) on the permeability of colonic strips from vehicle- or dexamethasone-treated rats were investigated in Ussing chambers. RESULTS: 4 days of dexamethasone as well as doxantrazole diminished the SLIGRL-induced hyperalgesia for all volumes of distension. This effect of dexamethasone was accompanied by a reduced responsiveness of colonic permeability to compound 48/80, and decreased RMCP-II content and mast cell number. Dexamethasone treatment did not influence colonic mucosal PAR-2 expression and permeability responsiveness to SLIGRL. CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone treatment improves PAR-2 agonist-induced visceral hypersensitivity but does not prevent PAR-2 agonist-induced increase in colonic permeability in rats. This effect is coupled with a reduction of colonic mast cell number and RMCP-II contents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains only partially understood, and no specific or universally effective patient management procedure has been developed to date. Our study was designed to evaluate if colonic luminal serine-proteases may be a relevant pathophysiologic marker of IBS. METHODS: Fecal samples of 38 IBS patients, 15 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 15 healthy controls were studied. Fecal serine-protease activity was determined photometrically by using azocasein as a proteolytic substrate; fecal pancreatic elastase-1 and mast cell tryptase content were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fecal secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in control subjects and in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. RESULTS: Fecal serine-protease activity was 3-fold higher in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS than in both controls and IBS patients with either constipation or alternating bowel habits. Fecal serine-protease activity was not correlated with the frequency of bowel movements in all groups. Increased serine-protease activity also was detected in stools of UC patients. No significant difference was observed in the fecal mast cell tryptase and pancreatic elastase concentrations between all groups, or in the fecal secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor concentration between controls and diarrhea-predominant IBS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal serine-protease activity is increased markedly in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. This increase, however, is not coupled with changes in either mast cell tryptase or pancreatic elastase concentrations. Thus, serine-protease activity in the colon may be a pathophysiologic factor in the development of diarrhea-predominant IBS.},

STUDY DESIGN: A cohort study of children 3 to 19 years old with a positive result on a bacterial stool culture. 44 patients in each arm (unidirectional alpha of 0.05, power of 0.80). Children presenting at two pediatric hospitals (United States and Italy) for AGE who tested positive for bacteria on stool culture (2001-2005) were contacted at least 6 months after the episode. Exposed children were matched with control subjects of similar age and sex consulting to the same hospitals for trauma or well-child visit within 4 weeks of the index case. Symptoms were evaluated with a validated questionnaire for FGIDs assessing pain, diarrhea, and disability. RESULTS: 88 patients (46 boys; mean age, 8.1 years; age range, 3-19 years) were recruited. Bacteria included Salmonella (54%), Campylobacter (32%), and Shigella (14%). 36% of exposed patients and 11% of control subjects complained of abdominal pain (P < .01). 87% had irritable bowel syndrome and 24% had dyspepsia. 56% reported onset of pain following the AGE. CONCLUSION: There is a significant increase in cases of FGIDs after bacterial infections in children.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To collect symptom data longitudinally from children with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) and control (asymptomatic) children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with RAP (n = 77) and controls (n = 33) 7 to 10 years of age completed daily diaries for 2 weeks tracking pain frequency and severity, how often the pain interfered with activities, and stooling pattern. RESULTS: RAP children reported a greater number of pain episodes and greater pain severity than control children. Pain commonly was reported to be in the periumbilical area and occurred evenly across the day in both groups. However, the pain interfered with activity more often in the RAP group. There was a positive relationship between pain and interference with activities. Both groups reported stool changes, but there were no differences between groups in stool character (eg, hard, mushy). For both groups, the presence of watery stool was related positively to pain. Of children with RAP, 65% could be categorized as having irritable bowel syndrome, whereas 35% were classifiable as having functional abdominal pain according to the pediatric Rome II criteria. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal report of symptoms in children with RAP compared with controls. These data demonstrate that there is considerable overlap between children with RAP and control children on a number of items commonly obtained in the history (eg, pain location, timing, stooling pattern). Most children with RAP could be characterized as having irritable bowel syndrome. The relationship between pain reports and interference with activities substantiates the need to deal specifically with the abdominal pain to decrease disability. The relationship between pain and watery stools requires further study.},

Enhanced colorectal sensitivity after duodenal lipid administration in IBS patients has been demonstrated. However, the effects of a regular meal on colorectal sensitivity in these patients and the importance of the composition of the meal are not known. On two separate days, 10 IBS patients and 11 controls randomly received a liquid meal (800 kcal), containing 60% calories from fat (fatty meal) or carbohydrate (carbohydrate meal). Using a barostat rectal sensitivity was assessed during four separate distension sequences before, immediately after and 30 and 60 min after the meal. In the patients, the discomfort (P = 0.04) and the pain thresholds (P = 0.007) were gradually reduced after the fatty meal, whereas only a tendency in the same direction was seen after the carbohydrate meal. In patients VAS ratings for pain increased after the fatty meal (P = 0.03), but not after carbohydrates. In the controls, sensory thresholds were not affected by the meals. In IBS, a liquid meal enhances rectal sensitivity, and this seems to be partly nutrient dependent as a fatty meal has more pronounced effects than a carbohydrate meal. This might be of relevance for their postprandial symptoms.},

TDF gives the best estimate of fiber content in the diet. Whereas data on intake of crude fibers are available, there is a lack of data on intake of TDF in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIM: We assessed the TDF and its source in the diet of patients with IBS and healthy controls (HC). METHODS: Based on their predominant symptoms, 81 patients with IBS (according to Rome II criteria) were categorized into constipation-predominant (IBS-C, n=48), diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D, n=16) and mixed type (IBS-M, n=17). Information was collected on fiber supplementation and preference for high-fiber food. A pretested, open-ended, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to collect dietary information on food groups and TDF. Age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n=89) were recruited as HC. The mean (SD) age of patients and HC was 36.5 (11.4) years (59 men), and 36 (12) years (62 men), respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (48%) were taking medicinal fiber supplements, of which 28 patients were taking supplements daily (2.10 [0.84] teaspoon full). The mean daily TDF intake was 51.7 (23.1) g vs. 52.3 (21.6) g for patients and HC, respectively (p=0.8). The intake of TDF was similar in patients having less (n=41) or more (n=40) preference for fiber-rich foods (55 [23] g vs. 47 [22] g, p=0.16). The daily mean cereal intake in patients was significantly lower than that in HC (322 g vs. 404 g, p=0.001). However, consumption of fruits (150 g vs. 80 g, p=0.001) and vegetables (348 g vs. 219 g, p=0.006) was higher in patients in comparison with HC. There was a positive correlation between TDF with cereals (p=0.001), pulses (p=0.001), vegetables and fruits (p=0.033) in patients with IBS but only with cereals (p=0.001) in HC. CONCLUSION: The intake of TDF in patients with IBS and HC is much higher than the dietary recommendation for healthy Indians. Patients with IBS consumed more fruits and vegetables rather than cereals as compared with HC.},

   abstract = {Unexplained diarrhoea is a frequent indication for gastroenterologic referral, and after full investigation the most common final diagnosis is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Some patients with IBS describe an acute onset of symptoms following infective gastroenteritis. Postinfective IBS affects 7% to 31% of individuals infected, and appears to be a nonspecific response to injury which has been reported following Salmonella-, Campylobacter-, and Shigella-related IBS. The strongest risk factor for developing postinfective IBS is severity of the initial diarrhoea illness, but toxigenicity of the infected bacteria, age <60 years, and female sex also are important risk factors. Adverse life events, hypochondriasis, and depression are also important, as is increased enteroendocrine cell and lymphocyte numbers in rectal biopsies. Postinfective IBS and IBS with diarrhoea without an infectious onset both show increased postprandial release of serotonin, whilst constipated patients show a depressed release. Several studies suggest impairment of the serotonin transporter in IBS, which in animal studies has been shown to occur following a range of inflammatory insults. Clinical conditions with an inflammatory basis, such as coeliac and Crohn disease, also are characterised by excess postprandial serotonin release. Several studies report evidence of low-grade inflammation in IBS with diarrhoea. However, reliable markers of low-grade inflammation that may predict response to serotonin antagonists or other anti-inflammatory agents remain a goal for future research.},

METHODS: The audit was designed in consultation with the Northern Territory Drug and Therapeutics Committee. Tegaserod was added to the feeding protocol and prokinetic algorithm in the ICU, and a prospective audit was performed of patients receiving the medication between May and September 2006. RESULTS: Over the 5-month period, 40 patients received tegaserod after failing to respond to two doses of metoclopramide. Median daily volume of gastric aspirate was reduced from 1220mL in the 24 hours before tegaserod to 887.5mL in the first 24 hours after its introduction, and to 280mL in the second 24 hours (P=0.01 and P<0.001, respectively). Tegaserod was an effective prokinetic agent in 85% (34) patients. Attributable diarrhoea occurred in 13% (5) patients, but did not require intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Tegaserod is an effective alternative prokinetic agent for ICU patients with a safer side-effect profile. We believe it warrants further investigation.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome and interstitial cystitis frequently overlap. We have shown that acute colitis sensitizes urinary bladder afferents to both mechanical and chemical stimuli and that chronic colitis similarly produces neurogenic cystitis. We hypothesize that chronic irritation of the colon releases neuropeptides from bladder afferents, leading to receptor sensitization and neurogenic inflammation. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received intrarectal trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) or vehicle 3 days following either systemic capsaicin (CP) pretreatment or vehicle. Ten days later, action potentials of single-unit pelvic C-fiber afferents with receptive fields in the bladder were recorded under urethane anesthesia during graded bladder distensions (UBD) or intravesical capsaicin (vCP) administration. In controls, UBD increased bladder afferent firing in proportion to intravesical pressure. At intravesical pressures of 30 mmHg and above, the percent increase in afferent firing was significantly accentuated following TNBS compared with controls (1,222 +/- 176 vs. 624 +/- 54%, P < 0.01). The response to vCP was also enhanced (4,126 +/- 775 vs. 1,979 +/- 438%, P < 0.01). Systemic depletion of neuropeptides from sensory nerves abolished these effects. Histological examination of the bladders revealed an increase in mast cell density in TNBS-treated animals compared with controls (18.02 +/- 1.25 vs. 3.11 +/- 0.27 mast cells/x100 field, P < 0.01). This effect was significantly ameliorated with CP (10.25 +/- 0.95, P < 0.5 vs. TNBS-treated animals). In summary, chronic colonic irritation in the rat sensitizes urinary bladder afferents to noxious stimuli and causes mast cell infiltration in the bladder. Depletion of neuropeptides from sensory afferents diminishes these effects, suggesting they play an important role.},

   abstract = {The gut contains a diverse bacterial flora that is acquired at birth and has a number of physiological functions. Administration of prebiotics or probiotics may favourably alter this gut microflora. Prebiotics are poorly digested oligosaccharides that promote the growth of desirable bacteria and may have other beneficial gastrointestinal and systemic effects. Probiotics are "helpful" human bacteria that provide a variety of health benefits when administered exogenously. Probiotics produce beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of traveller's diarrhoea, viral diarrhoea, and diarrhoea in day care centres. Moreover, probiotics have been shown to reduce relapses associated with Clostridium difficile, and Lactobacilli are effective in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Probiotics may also be efficacious in the treatment of gastroenteritis. Clinical studies of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease have proved disappointing, but beneficial effects in adults with irritable bowel syndrome have been reported with Bifidobacterium infantis 35624. Lactobacilli GG reduces the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms and gut permeability in patients with atopic dermatitis, and administration of probiotics reduces the frequency and severity of atopic eczema when administered to pregnant women and then to newborn infants. In conclusion, probiotics are effective in the treatment and/or prevention of a number of conditions, including diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome and atopic dermatitis, and the product used should be selected based on the particular indication.},

However, data from dietary elimination and re-challenge studies are inconclusive. Although investigations have shown that bran may be helpful in some patients, a complete review of the literature does not reveal conclusive evidence that a high fibre diet therapy is effective in IBS. From the limited reports on probiotics, there appears to be a trend to decreasing symptoms. Despite numerous reviews on this subject, it is very difficult to give general dietary advice to IBS patients, but dietary experts may have a positive role in managing such patients. It is clear that much more prospective research is needed to study both dietary factors and probiotics in these areas.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fecal lactoferrin (FLA) is a neutrophil-derived surrogate marker of intestinal inflammation that is elevated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. However, the correlation between FLA levels and serological markers of disease activity has not been previously reported, to our knowledge. In the present study we evaluated the ability of FLA levels to reflect disease activity in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We further assessed the relationship between FLA levels and customary laboratory and clinical measures of inflammation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fecal specimens were collected from 148 consecutive pediatric patients (79 with Crohn disease, 62 with ulcerative colitis, and 7 with irritable bowel syndrome) and 22 healthy control individuals. Lactoferrin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IBD-SCAN, TECHLAB, Inc). Disease activity was assessed at the time of sample provision by laboratory measures (including erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and albumin) and previously validated disease activity indices (Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index, Kozarek, Harvey Bradshaw Activity Index). RESULTS: Lactoferrin levels were significantly higher in patients with ulcerative colitis (1880 +/- 565 microg/mL) (mean +/- SE) or Crohn disease (1701 +/- 382 microg/mL) than in healthy control individuals under 21 years of age (1.17 +/- 0.47 microg/mL, P < 0.001). Lactoferrin levels correlated significantly with ESR, hematocrit, albumin, and platelet count (P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that FLA levels were comparable to ESR in detecting patients with clinically active disease (P < 0.001). Patients who experienced a clinical flare within 2 months of specimen collection displayed higher lactoferrin levels (845 +/- 452 microg/mL) than did those who remained in clinical remission (190 +/- 90 microg/mL, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Data presented here demonstrate that FLA is a sensitive and specific biochemical marker of inflammation for use in the diagnosis and interval assessment of pediatric patients with IBD, and its level correlates well with both clinical disease activity indices and ESR. Elevated levels of FLA may also identify patients at greater risk for the development of subsequent clinical flares.},

AIM: To investigate the effect of LAB4, a multistrain probiotic preparation on symptoms of IBS. This probiotic preparation has not previously been assessed in IBS. METHODS: Fifty-two participants with IBS, as defined by the Rome II criteria, participated in this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Participants were randomized to receive either a probiotic preparation comprising two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 (NCIMB 30157) and CUL21 (NCIMB 30156), Bifidobacterium lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) and Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) at a total of 2.5 x 10(10) cfu/capsule or a placebo for 8 weeks. Participants reported their IBS symptoms using a questionnaire fortnightly during the intervention and at 2 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: A significantly greater improvement in the Symptom Severity Score of IBS and in scores for quality of life, days with pain and satisfaction with bowel habit was observed over the 8-week intervention period in the volunteers receiving the probiotic preparation than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: LAB4 multistrain probiotic supplement may benefit subjects with IBS.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recognizing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is straightforward when alarm symptoms are present, such as bloody diarrhea and weight loss. When the presentation is subtle or atypical, physicians must determine which patients warrant evaluation for IBD. Appropriate use of noninvasive tests can help identify which patients should undergo further investigation. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently IBD serologies lack high enough sensitivity and specificity to make them useful as a screening test for distinguishing IBD from other disorders, but they may have a role in classifying subtypes of IBD. Fecal markers seem promising for helping to differentiate IBD from irritable bowl syndrome and for monitoring disease activity. Pharmacogenetically guided dosing is recommended for safe use of thiopurines but ongoing routine laboratory monitoring remains important. Thiopurine metabolite measurement can be useful but may not be needed in all cases. SUMMARY: Primary care physicians should continue to rely on routine laboratory tests and clinical suspicion to decide which patients with abdominal pain to refer to a gastroenterologist. Serology panels are not useful for IBD screening as the results may lead to unnecessary procedures. Although fecal markers do show promise as a screening test for IBD, patient resistance to providing stool samples may limit its usefulness in disease monitoring. Thiopurine metabolite levels are best used in conjunction with clinical status and routine laboratory tests to monitor clinical response and adverse events.},

   abstract = {Synthetic cDNA encoding pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) leptin (pfLEP) was prepared according to the published sequence. The pfLEP, transformed into Escherichia coli and expressed upon induction with nalidixic acid, was found almost entirely in the insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs). The proteins were solubilized, refolded and purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography and gel-filtration. The respective yield of dimers and monomers was 50-100mg from 5L of fermentation culture. Circular dichroism analyses revealed similarity of the purified pfLEP secondary structure to that of mammalian leptins. The purified monomers and dimers showed a single band of approximately 15 kDa following SDS-PAGE in the presence of reducing agent, whereas the dimer showed one band of approximately 30 kDa in the absence of reducing agent, indicating its formation by S-S bonds. The purified product also showed a single peak following gel-filtration under nondenaturating conditions and reverse-phase chromatography. Monomeric and dimeric pfLEPs were stable for at least 6 months in sterile solution frozen at -20 degrees C or as lyophilized powder. Both pfLEPs were biologically active in promoting proliferation of BAF/3 cells stably transfected with the long form of human leptin (hLEP) receptor, but their activity was four to five orders of magnitude lower than that of hLEP. The specificity of this activity was further evidenced by its complete inhibition by hLEP antagonist. In contrast to mammalian leptins, neither form of pfLEP bound to or formed 1:1 complex with chicken leptin-binding domain, likely due to low affinity. No specific binding of either ovine or pufferfish leptins to tilapia liver membranes was detected. This work is the first report on the purification of leptin from any fish species.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic abdominal pain is one of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms experienced by patients. Visceral hypersensitivity has been shown to be a biological marker in many patients with chronic visceral pain. We have previously shown that IBS patients with visceral hypersensitivity also have evidence of thermal hyperalgesia of the hand/foot. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current study was to develop an animal model of chronic visceral and somatic hypersensitivity in rats treated with intracolonic trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. DESIGN: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250g) were treated with either 20mg/rat trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS, Sigma Chemical Co.) in 50% ethanol (n=75), an equivalent volume of 50% ethanol (n=20) or an equivalent volume of saline (n=20). The agents were delivered with a 24-gauge catheter inserted into the lumen of the colon. Mechanical and thermal behavioral tests were performed using an automated von Frey and Hargreaves device to evaluate somatic hyperalgesia. Colonic distension was performed using an automated distension device to evaluate visceral pain thresholds. All animals were tested 16weeks after TNBS treatment following complete resolution of the colitis. RESULTS: At 16weeks, 24% of the treated rats (18/75 rats) still exhibited evidence of visceral as well as somatic hypersensitivity compared to saline- and ethanol-treated rats. CONCLUSION: Transient colonic inflammation leads to chronic visceral and somatic hypersensitivity in a subset of rats. These findings are similar to the subset of patients who develop chronic gastrointestinal symptoms following enteric infection.},

   abstract = {Chronic abdominal pain is a common gastrointestinal symptom experienced by patients. We have previously shown that IBS patients with visceral hypersensitivity also have evidence of thermal hypersensitivity of the hand and foot that is reversed by rectal lidocaine jelly. We have also recently developed an animal model of chronic visceral and somatic hypersensitivity in rats treated with intracolonic trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). The objective of the current study was to determine the effects of intracolonic lidocaine on visceral/somatic hypersensitivity in TNBS-treated rats. A total of 20 hypersensitive rats received either 20mg intracolonic lidocaine (n=10) or saline jelly (n=10). In comparison to saline jelly, intracolonic lidocaine jelly reduced responses to nociceptive visceral/somatic stimuli in hypersensitive rats. The effects were present within 5-30 min after administration of lidocaine and lasted for 6h. Lidocaine had no effects on recovered rats or control rats that had originally been treated with intracolonic saline instead of TNBS. Local anesthetic blockade of peripheral impulse input from the colon reduces both visceral and somatic hypersensitivity in TNBS-treated rats, similar to results in IBS patients. The results provide further evidence that visceral and secondary somatic hypersensitivity in a subset of TNBS-treated rats reflect central sensitization mechanisms maintained by tonic impulse input from the colon. This study evaluates the reversal of visceral/somatic hypersensitivity in a subset of TNBS-treated rats with intracolonic lidocaine. This animal model may be used in the future to study the mechanisms of local anesthetic agents applied to the gut to reduce visceral pain.},
