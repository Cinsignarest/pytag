   abstract = {Gastrointestinal disturbances (particularly diarrhea) are often induced in response to cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. Oral chemotherapeutic agents can induce diarrhea by damaging the intestinal lining. Two common oral drugs used in cancer treatment that are known to have gastrointestinal side effects are capecitabine and lapatinib. In this brief communication, the authors discuss a case study of a stage IV breast cancer patient whose chemotherapy-induced diarrhea was treated successfully with a multispecies combination of probiotics. This is a unique study in which grade 3 chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (characterized by 7-9 stools per day and associated with incontinence and abdominal cramping) was treated with only a multispecies combination of probiotics. Probiotics have been used to treat diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, and Crohn's disease. More recently, probiotics have been used to treat chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in colon cancer patients. This case study demonstrates that the probiotics can also be used to treat severe cases of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in breast cancer patients. The use of different probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases is an increasingly important area of study, and more research into this area is needed. This study demonstrates that probiotics should be considered for advanced breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.},

   abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). Risk factors for the development of CRC in the setting of IBD include disease duration, anatomic extent of disease, age at time of diagnosis, severity of inflammation, family history of colon cancer, and concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis. The current surveillance strategy of surveillance colonoscopy with multiple random biopsies most likely reduces morbidity and mortality associated with IBD-related CRC. Unfortunately, surveillance colonoscopy also has severe limitations including high cost, sampling error at time of biopsy, and interobserver disagreement in histologically grading dysplasia. Furthermore, once dysplasia is detected there is disagreement about its management. Advances in endoscopic imaging techniques are already underway, and may potentially aid in dysplasia detection and improve overall surveillance outcomes. Management of dysplasia depends predominantly on the degree and focality of dysplasia, with the mainstay of management involving either proctocolectomy or continued colonoscopic surveillance. Lastly, continued research into additional chemopreventive agents may increase our arsenal in attempting to reduce the incidence of IBD-associated CRC.},

The patient was treated with prednisolone administered orally in a tapering course plus azathioprine, in addition to nutritional supplementation. The general condition of the patient quickly improved and his skin lesions completely resolved within 2 weeks. Kwashiorkor is a serious potentially fatal disease that occurs less often in developed countries leading to low index of suspicion by physicians and pediatricians in those regions. Occasionally, dermatologists have the rare chance of alerting pediatricians to the diagnosis of kwashiorkor, thus making a difference in the care of this disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Individualised doses of azathioprine (AZA) may be prescribed by monitoring the levels of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). The measurements of thiopurine metabolites of AZA, 6-thioguanine (6-TGN) and 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP), have also been reported as new markers of AZA activity. OBJECTIVES: To describe TPMT phenotype in our population and to establish a relationship between thiopurine metabolites,and therapeutic activity and adverse effects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data on TPMT were retrospectively collected from 107 patients, and 6-TGN and 6-MMP levels in 18 patients currently on treatment with AZA (Crohn's disease 5, ulcerative colitis 5, autoimmune hepatitis 5). RESULTS: Mean value of TPMT was 20.19U/ml. None of the patients had a TPMT activity<5U/ml. Of the 18 patients on treatment, 13 showed sub-therapeutic levels of 6-TGN (<235pmol/8x10(8) red blood cells). Clinical remission was maintained in 45% of patients. Mean levels of 6-TGN in patients with clinical remission were 259pmol/8x10(8) red blood cells versus 209pmol/8x10(8) red blood cells in non-responders (p=0.37). There was an inverse relationship (r=-0.28) between TPMT and 6-TGN levels. Toxic effects occurred in 6 of 18 patients, with leukopenia in 5 and hyperamylasemia in 1. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of TPMT and monitoring of thiopurine metabolites allows AZA treatment to be optimised, although further studies are necessary to establish therapeutic effectiveness and toxicity ranges.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Crohn's disease (CD) is a lifelong relapsing-remitting disease often requiring health-care contact, hospitalization, or surgery. General comorbidity indices were developed to predict mortality, which is rare in this population. There are limited tools to stratify these hospitalizations by severity. METHODS: We used data obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2004 to identify all CD-related hospitalizations using discharge diagnosis codes (International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, Clinical Modification, ICD-9-CM, 555.x). Independent predictors on multivariate regression were identified and used to construct a quantitative risk score to predict severe hospitalizations (defined as requiring nonelective bowel surgery or hospitalization longer than 7 days). The performance of our risk score was compared with the Elixhauser and Charlson comorbidity indices, and validated in an independent sample of CD hospitalizations from 2007. RESULTS: Our final study cohort consisted of 25,938 discharges, among which 6,169 were determined to be severe hospitalizations (23.8%). Independent predictors of disease severity included disease phenotype, anemia, malnutrition, and requirement for blood transfusion or total parenteral nutrition, as well as Clostridium difficile infection, admission to a teaching hospital, or inter-hospital transfer. The cumulative risk score ranged from 0 to 13 points, with scores >or=5 being considered to be of greater severity. A total of 15,330 (59.1%), 9,060 (34.9%), and 1,548 (6.0%) discharges were classified as being of low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively. An intermediate (odds ratio (OR) 2.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.47-2.80) or high-risk score (OR 13.62, 95% CI: 12.12-15.33) was associated with a significantly higher adjusted risk of severe hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Using administrative data, we propose a simple quantitative risk score to measure the severity of CD hospitalizations.},

In order to improve our understanding of their incidence and impact, we assessed the complications associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) in a population-based study in Medicaid patients. METHODS: We utilized a retrospective cohort design and identified cases of UC and CD using Medi-Cal, the Medicaid program for the State of California. The disease cohort was age- and gender-matched to four controls each and the intestinal and extra-intestinal complications of CD and UC (analyzed separately) were studied over a period of 5 years following the initial diagnosis. RESULTS: For UC, the total number of intestinal complications, per 100 cases, was 92 observed compared to 21 expected; the total number of extra-intestinal complications was 42 observed compared to 30 expected. For CD, the number of intestinal complications was 81 observed compared to 20 expected and for extra-intestinal complications, 37 observed compared to 26 expected (all p < 0.001). For both UC and CD, bleeding was the most frequently seen intestinal complication, while the most common extra-intestinal complication was osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS: IBD is associated with several intestinal and extra-intestinal complications of variable incidence and risk. Success of therapeutic regimens should be measured by decreases in incidence, risks, and costs of these complications, in addition to the usual impact on disease activity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Capsule retention is a potential complication of capsule endoscopy (CE). The aims of our study were to determine the incidence of capsule retention in pediatric patients undergoing CE and to identify potential risk factors for capsule retention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review of pediatric patients undergoing CE studies at a single center. Data collected included patient age, sex, prior diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), CE indication, prior small bowel series results, study result, and complications. RESULTS: Two hundred seven CE procedures were performed in pediatric patients during the study period. Capsule retention occurred in 3 (1.4%) of the 207 studies. All 3 patients had known Crohn disease (CD). The risk of capsule retention in pediatric patients with known IBD was 5.2% (3/58). The risk of capsule retention for patients with suspected IBD and all other indications was 0%. If small bowel disease was identified on upper gastrointestinal series in patients with known CD, then the risk of capsule retention was 37.5% (3/8). Only 7 patients with known IBD had a body mass index (BMI) below the 5th percentile. Of these 7 patients, 3 (43%) had capsule retention. CONCLUSIONS: Red flags for potential CE retention identified in our study include known IBD (5.2% retention risk), previous small bowel follow-through demonstrating small bowel CD (37.5% retention risk), and BMI <5th percentile with known IBD (43% retention risk). Caution is advised in these pediatric patients before capsule ingestion.},

Although there is not widespread agreement on the etiology of CD, there is evidence that microorganisms lead to the often severe inflammatory response characteristic of the disease. Despite several microbial candidates, no specific microbe has been considered pathogenic. Instead, the concept of the 'pathogenic community' has emerged from the evidence, whereby the stability of the microbial ecosystem of the healthy human gut is disrupted in response to host genetics and destabilized immunity, perhaps through changing public health practices leading to altered microbial exposures over time. We discuss the complex microbial ecosystem of the mammalian gut, the underlying genetic factors that predispose to CD, and how these gene variants may alter host-microbe interactions and propagate inflammation. Over the next 5 years, the increased understanding of genes involved in CD and the way in which individuals with variants of these genes respond differently to nutrients and drugs will enable the rational development of personalized therapies, using pharmacogenomic and nutrigenomic approaches.},

Present available evidence supports enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease as a primary treatment if treatment with steroids is not possible (failure or contraindication) (grade of recommendation A) or either combined treatment with drugs in malnourished patients or those with inflammatory bowel stenosis. In those patients with sustained clinical remission, no benefit of either enteral nutrition or supplements in the absence of nutritional deficits has been shown. Elemental or modified formula (glutamine, omega 3 fatty acids) could not be recommended. In ulcerative colitis, nutritional influence over the activity of the disease has not been shown, although there are some promising results regarding enteric coated W3 fatty acids and a possible role for probiotics. In the treatment and prevention of pouchitis, there could be a role for probiotics (VSL#3). Nutritional treatment should be considered an integral component in the Management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex and probably multifactorial. Nutrition has been proposed to be an important aetiological factor for development of IBD. Several components of the diet (such as sugar, fat, fibre, fruit and vegetable, protein, fast food, preservatives etc.) were examined as possible causative agents for IBD. According to some researchers infant feeding (breast feeding) may also contribute to the development of IBD. Though the importance of environmental factors is evidenced by the increasing incidence in developed countries and in migrant population in recent decades, the aetiology of IBD remained unclear. There are many theories, but as yet no dietary approaches have been proved to reduce the risk of developing IBD. The role of nutrition in the management of IBD is better understood. The prevention and correction of malnutrition, the provision of macro- and micronutrients and vitamins and the promotion of optimal growth and development of children are key points of nutritional therapy. In active disease, the effective support of energy and nutrients is a very important part of the therapy. Natural and artificial nutrition or the combination of two can be chosen for supporting therapy of IBD. The author summarises the aetiological and therapeutic role of nutrition in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several antibodies, also called serological markers, are associated with specific forms, disease behavior and phenotype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). AIM: Summarize and analyze the evidence of the utility of serologic markers in IBD, making emphasis on their clinical utility and behavior between populations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Relevant articles were located by computer-assisted search of PubMed (since January 1979 until December 2008). RESULTS: Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and perinuclear Anti-neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (pANCA) are the best studied serological markers. Assessing both ASCA and pANCA allows a better differentiation of Crohn's disease (CD) from ulcerative colitis (UC) than by using the individual tests alone. The ASCA+/pANCA- phenotype is characteristic of CD, while the ASCA-/pANCA+ phenotype is found in UC. The interest on atypical ANCA is growing as it may be a useful tool to distinguish between different IBD forms. Newer markers derived from various microbial species of the gut and glycan markers are of interest as they offer new ways to stratify patients into serologic subgroups. These serological markers may act as prognostic indicators of the severity and behavior of IBD, but more studies are necessary to determine their utility. CONCLUSIONS: There is emerging evidence that combining serological markers may increase the accuracy of diagnosis of a specific form of IBD or its behavior, but the perfect assay or combination of antibodies has not been discovered. They have several limitations, therefore clinicians must be aware of the evidence on serological markers, interpret them with caution and always correlate with the clinical picture.},

   abstract = {Surgery for chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasingly often necessary in children. This study aimed at assessing the results of these operations in order to facilitate adequate preoperative counseling. We reviewed patients treated from 1992 to 2009. The operations, complications and functional outcome were recorded. For those with preserved rectal defecation, continence (Koivusalo score) and quality of life (standardized questionnaire) were assessed in the long term. Eighty five of 192 patients had Crohn disease (CD), 107 of 192 had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 3 of 192 had indeterminate colitis (IC). 12 of 85 CD patients (15%) aged 14 (12-19) years required 13 resections, 1 stricturoplasty, 1 transplantation and 6 other operations including 3 permanent enterostomies for anorectal involvement. Removal of the involved bowel led to significant improvement of nutritional status, growth and quality of life. The transplanted patient had a striking recovery but eventually died 1 year later of unrelated complications. 29 of 107 UC patients (26%) aged 11 (2-15) years required 87 operations. Nine had emergency colectomy for toxic megacolon (3, one death) or severe hemorrhage (6). 28 had restorative proctocolectomy and ileoanostomy (RPCIA) without (16) or with (12) J-pouch under protective ileostomy. Complications were frequent (40%). Permanent ileostomy was required in five children (17%). Twelve months postoperatively, RPCIA patients had 6.5 (2-13) stools/day; all were continent during daytime, and 25% have nocturnal leaks. Mean Koivusalo score (5-12) was 8.8 +/- 2. Quality of life was good in all. All attended normal school and 7 the university, 4 work and 60% of those older than 18 years have sexual partners. Three of 107 children treated as UC with RPCIA had ultimately IC (3%) and were permanently diverted. The nature of IBD involves frustrating surgery. However, it may change life for CD patients and provide a reasonably good quality of life for UC after the first year. Pediatric surgeons should be able to provide adequate preoperative counseling to patients and families.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fermentable, short chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) have been identified as triggers for functional gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition, excess FODMAP consumption has been implicated in the onset of Crohn's disease, and animal studies suggest that a low glycemic index diet can impair absorption of fructose, a major dietary FODMAP. Such hypotheses cannot be tested without the ability to quantify FODMAP ingestion with a validated dietary assessment tool. OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity and reproducibility of a 297-item comprehensive, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in estimating intake of macro- and micronutrients, FODMAPs, and glycemic index/load. SUBJECTS/SETTING: One hundred healthy participants were recruited to complete the FFQ on two occasions, plus four 1-week food diaries kept during a 12-month period. Participants exhibiting major dietary change during the study period or low energy reporting on the FFQ were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Validation and reproducibility of the semi-quantitative FFQ by comparison with the mean of four 1-week food diaries. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Validation was assessed using Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman's correlation, Bland-Altman, and weighted kappa statistics. Reproducibility was examined using Shrout-Fleiss intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Seventy-two participants fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria. Demographics of the participants were comparable with 2006 Australian Census data. Consistent with other reported FFQs, the FFQ overestimated nutrient intake by a mean 140% (range=95% to 249%). However, based on the other analyses performed, it demonstrated validity for intake of sugars, fiber, alcohol, glycemic index, glucose, FODMAPs, calcium, folate, phosphate, potassium, iron, and magnesium; moderate validation for energy, total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, sodium, thiamin, sucrose, and retinol; poor validation for protein, mono/polyunsaturated fat, starch, glycemic load, niacin, and zinc. Riboflavin intake was not validated. Intraclass correlation coefficients for reproducibility ranged from 0.352 to 0.928. CONCLUSIONS: The FFQ was validated for assessment of a wide range of nutrients, including the new class of carbohydrates, FODMAPs, and glycemic index. This provides a useful tool for dietary research, particularly in the area of gastroenterological disorders.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating and widespread immune-mediated illness of unknown etiology. Current treatments are modestly successful and with significant side-effects. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current understanding of mechanisms of action underlying the anti-inflammatory actions of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in IBD. RECENT FINDINGS: Nutrition-based interventions that target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) such as dietary CLA and n-3 PUFA have demonstrated anti-inflammatory efficacy in animal models of IBD. Clinical data on n-3 PUFA in IBD remains generally unimpressive, although results of a recent human study demonstrate that IBD remission can be maintained by maintaining the n-3: n-6 ratio more than 0.65 via n-3 PUFA intervention. In mice, CLA prevented inflammation-driven colorectal cancer by activating PPAR gamma and modulating regulatory T cells and macrophages. CLA is the subject of an ongoing clinical study in Crohn's disease patients. SUMMARY: Compelling evidence demonstrates that n-3 PUFA and CLA prevent or ameliorate IBD in animal models. However, this basic knowledge has not been translated into novel nutrition-based clinical interventions. For both compounds there is an urgent need for placebo-controlled, large-scale, multicenter clinical trials.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been shown to be effective for induction, but not maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. However, significant concerns exist regarding their risk for adverse events, particularly when used for long treatment courses. Budesonide is a glucocorticoid with limited systemic bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Budesonide has been shown to be effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral budesonide for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialised Trial Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Reference lists of articles, as well as conference proceedings were manually searched. Study authors, study sponsors and pharmaceutical companies were also contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing budesonide to a control treatment, or comparing two doses of budesonide, were included. The study population included patients of any age with Crohn's disease in remission. The primary outcome was maintenance of remission at various reported follow-up times during the study, up to 12 months following enrollment. Secondary outcomes included: time to relapse, mean change in CDAI, clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement, improvement in quality of life, adverse events and study withdrawal. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using Jadad's criteria. A random or fixed effects model was chosen based on an assessment of heterogeneity, and studies were weighted using the DerSimonian & Laird or the Mantel-Haenszel method accordingly. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 4.2.10 software. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the review: 8 studies compared budesonide with placebo, one compared budesonide to 5-aminosalicylates, one compared budesonide to traditional systemic corticosteroids, and one compared two doses of budesonide with no control group. Eight studies used a controlled ileal release form of budesonide, while three used a pH-modified release formulation. Budesonide 6 mg daily was no more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission at 3 months (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.58; P = 0.05), 6 months (RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.39; P = 0.14), or 12 months (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.35; P = 0.19). Budesonide was not more effective than weaning doses of prednisolone for maintenance of remission at 12 months (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.13; P = 0.20), but was better than mesalamine 3 grams per day (RR of remission 2.51; 95% CI 1.03 to 6.12; P = 0.04). Budesonide 3 mg daily was more effective than placebo at 3 months (RR 1.31; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.67; P = 0.03). This benefit was not sustained at 6 months (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.50; P = 0.53), or 12 months (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.30; P = 0.70). No differences in efficacy were detected based on the different formulations of budesonide, methods used to induce remission, or budesonide dose. The use of budesonide 6 mg resulted in slight improvements in CDAI scores when assessed at 6 months (WMD -24.3; 95% CI -46.31 to -2.29; P = 0.03) and 12 months (WMD -23.49; 95% CI -46.65 to -0.32; P = 0.05) and mean time to relapse of disease (WMD 59.93 days; 95% CI 19.02 to 100.84; P = 0.004). Adverse events were more frequent in patients treated with 6 mg of budesonide compared with placebo (RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.19; P = 0.05), but not in patients using lower doses of budesonide. These events were relatively minor and did not result in increased rates of study withdrawal. Abnormal adrenocorticoid stimulation tests were seen more frequently in patients receiving both 6 mg daily (RR 2.88; 95% CI 1.72 to 4.82; P < 0.0001) and 3 mg daily (RR 2.73; 95% CI 1.34 to 5.57; P = 0.006) compared with placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide is not more effective than placebo or weaning prednisolone for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Some modest benefits are noted in patients receiving budesonide compared with placebo in terms of lower CDAI scores and longer time to relapse of disease. However, these benefits are offset by higher treatment-related adverse event rates and more frequent adrenocorticoid suppression in patients receiving budesonide. Therefore, budesonide is not recommended for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the transition from pediatric to adult care, patients are expected to increase their level of self-care. Knowledge of disease characteristics, medications, and resources is crucial. This study evaluated the knowledge of adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and their parents in four major domains: disease characteristics, treatments, medical history, and health services resources. METHODS: Patients age 14-18 years and their parents completed MyHealth Passport for IBD as a cross-sectional assessment of knowledge. Responses were evaluated for accuracy using medical records. The proportion of correct responses between patients/parents were compared. RESULTS: In all, 78 patients (age 16.2 +/- 1.2 years, IBD duration 3.6 +/- 2.5 years), and 64 parents participated. Patients and parents were equally likely to answer questions correctly regarding disease characteristics and treatment, but not health services resources. Most patients accurately identified IBD classification and listed medications. Neither patients nor parents accurately identified disease location or previous investigation results. Parents more likely correctly named insurance provider (odds ratio [OR] 6.33, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 2.68-15.0), and pharmacy location (OR 18.5, 95% CI 4.6-76.8). Multivariate regression revealed that patients with IBD type unclassified were more likely to be aware of their diagnostic classification (OR 17.2, 95% CI 2.81-105.4 compared with Crohn's disease patients). Older patients were less likely to recall if they had a small bowel x-ray (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-0.996). CONCLUSIONS: Future educational interventions should target areas of weakness in adolescent knowledge, particularly health services resources.

   abstract = {Plants contain numerous polyphenols, which have been shown to reduce inflammation and hereby to increase resistance to disease. Examples of such polyphenols are isothiocyanates in cabbage and broccoli, epigallocatechin in green tee, capsaicin in chili peppers, chalones, rutin and naringenin in apples, resveratrol in red wine and fresh peanuts and curcumin/curcuminoids in turmeric. Most diseases are maintained by a sustained discreet but obvious increased systemic inflammation. Many studies suggest that the effect of treatment can be improved by a combination of restriction in intake of proinflammatory molecules such as advanced glycation end products (AGE), advanced lipoperoxidation end products (ALE), and rich supply of antiinflammatory molecules such as plant polyphenols. To the polyphenols with a bulk of experimental documentation belong the curcuminoid family and especially its main ingredient, curcumin. This review summarizes the present knowledge about these turmericderived ingredients, which have proven to be strong antioxidants and inhibitors of cyclooxigenase-2 (COX-2), lipoxygenase (LOX) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) but also AGE. A plethora of clinical effects are reported in various experimental diseases, but clinical studies in humans are few. It is suggested that supply of polyphenols and particularly curcuminoids might be value as complement to pharmaceutical treatment, but also prebiotic treatment, in conditions proven to be rather therapy-resistant such as Crohn's, long-stayed patients in intensive care units, but also in conditions such as cancer, liver cirrhosis, chronic renal disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal was to compare the predictive values of the Prometheus Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Serology 7 (IBD7) panel (Prometheus Laboratories, San Diego, CA) with the predictive values of routine blood tests in a population of children referred for initial evaluation of suspected IBD. METHODS: Medical records of pediatric patients referred for evaluation of IBD for whom IBD7 testing was performed at Prometheus Laboratories between January 2006 and November 2008 were reviewed. Patients underwent diagnosis by pediatric gastroenterologists on the basis of clinical, radiologic, endoscopic, and pathologic evaluations. RESULTS: A total of 394 records were identified. We excluded 90 records on the basis of age of >21 years, previous diagnosis of IBD, or unclear diagnosis. The prevalence of IBD in this cohort was 38%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and kappa value for the serological panel were 67%, 76%, 63%, 79%, and 42%, respectively, compared with values for a combination of 3 abnormal routine laboratory test results of 72%, 94%, 85%, 79%, and 47%. The antiflagellin antibody assay, the newest assay added to the panel, had sensitivity of 50% and specificity of 53%. Repeat serological testing failed to produce consistent results for 4 of 10 patients. CONCLUSION: Despite its recent inclusion of the antiflagellin assay, the IBD7 panel has lower predictive values than routine laboratory tests in pediatric screening for IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental factors are thought to play an important role in the development of Crohn's disease (CD). Immune responses against auto-antigens or food antigens may be a reason for the perpetuation of inflammation. METHODS: In a pilot study, 79 CD patients and 20 healthy controls were examined for food immunoglobulin G (IgG). Thereafter, the clinical relevance of these food IgG antibodies was assessed in a double-blind cross-over study with 40 patients. Based on the IgG antibodies, a nutritional intervention was planned. The interferon (IFN)gamma secretion of T cells was measured. Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin was quantified in stool. RESULTS: The pilot study resulted in a significant difference of IgG antibodies in serum between CD patients and healthy controls. In 84 and 83% of the patients, respectively, IgG antibodies against processed cheese and yeast were detected. The daily stool frequency significantly decreased by 11% during a specific diet compared with a sham diet. Abdominal pain reduced and general well-being improved. IFNgamma secretion of T cells increased. No difference for eosinophil-derived neurotoxin in stool was detected. CONCLUSION: A nutritional intervention based on circulating IgG antibodies against food antigens showed effects with respect to stool frequency. The mechanisms by which IgG antibodies might contribute to disease activity remain to be elucidated.},

   abstract = {The intestinal microbiota are a complex ecosystem influencing the immunoregulation of the human host, providing protection from colonising pathogens and producing SCFA as the main energy source of colonocytes. Our objective was to investigate the effect of dietary fibre exclusion and supplementation on the intestinal microbiota and SCFA concentrations. Faecal samples were obtained from healthy volunteers before and after two 14 d periods of consuming formulated diets devoid or supplemented with fibre (14 g/l). The faecal microbiota were analysed using fluorescent in situ hybridisation and SCFA were measured using GLC. There were large and statistically significant reductions in the numbers of the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P < or = 0.01) and Roseburia spp. (P < or = 0.01) groups during both the fibre-free and fibre-supplemented diets. Significant and strong positive correlations between the proportion of F. prausnitzii and the proportion of butyrate during both baseline normal diets were found (pre-fibre free r 0.881, P = 0.001; pre-fibre supplemented r 0.844, P = 0.002). A significant correlation was also found between the proportional reduction in F. prausnitzii and the proportional reduction in faecal butyrate during both the fibre-free (r 0.806; P = 0.005) and the fibre-supplemented diet (r 0.749; P = 0.013). These findings may contribute to the understanding of the association between fibre, microbiota and fermentation in health, during enteral nutrition and in disease states such as Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC), developing from dysplastic lesions, is the main long-term complication of pancolitis. The aims of the present study were to assess the risks for neoplasia and advanced neoplasia (AN), respectively, in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients with pancolitis, and to search for protective and risk factors for colorectal neoplasia. METHODS: A total of 855 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with longstanding pancolitis (276 UC, 56 IBD unclassified (IBDu), and 523 CD) had pathological examination of a proctocolectomy specimen (n=255) or multiple biopsy samples from a surveillance colonoscopy (n=600) after median disease duration of 115 months. Risk factors for low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and AN, respectively, were searched for in the whole group of patients and in a case-control comparison after matching for IBD phenotype. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients eventually developed colorectal neoplasia: 14 adenomas, 28 nonadenomatous LGD, and 33 ANs. The 25-year cumulative risks for neoplasia and AN, respectively, were 32.8+/-5.7% and 25.9+/-5.7% in UC and IBDu vs. 12.1+/-2.7% and 3.9+/-2.0% in CD (P<0.0001). In CD, patients with UC-like endoscopic appearance (n=126) had an increased risk for AN compared with those with discrete lesions (at 25 years, 10.6+/-7.2 vs. 1.5+/-0.9%). In the case-control comparison, factors associated with an increased risk of AN were primary sclerosing cholangitis (hazard ratio (HR) 4.72 (1.54-14.52)) and family history of CRC (HR 3.37 (1.02-11.14)), whereas previous segmental colectomy was protective (HR 0.25 (0.07-0.88)). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of AN in longstanding pancolitis is higher in UC or IBDu than in CD. In CD, this risk is significantly increased in patients with UC-like endoscopic lesions. The surveillance program should focus on these latter patients.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Increasing evidence indicates that adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ involved in metabolic syndrome and regulation of inflammation. Visceral fat accumulation is a hallmark of both obesity and Crohn's disease. Here, we present recent data describing the immune properties of intra-abdominal adipose tissue that could link the innate immune response to obesity-related disorders and gut inflammation. RECENT FINDINGS: Innate immune properties of adipocytes have become well characterized since recent studies described the Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression repertoire and specific TLR ligand responses of adipocytes. Adipokine secretion profiles have also been elucidated both in obese patients, when they may be involved in obesity-associated metabolic disease, and in Crohn's disease. Whereas mesenteric fat hypertrophy and fat wrapping of the bowel are characteristic of Crohn's disease, there exists a paucity of information concerning this important pathophysiological aspect. Our current classical animal models are of limited interest when investigating the role of mesenteric fat in gut inflammation. Recent new alternative disease paradigms could help to design more specific models for elucidating chronic transmural inflammation of the gut. SUMMARY: Obesity and Crohn's disease share common features with the development of mesenteric fat that may be involved in gut inflammation. Further studies are required to clearly assess the origin and influence of intestinal fat deposits upon gut inflammation, notably during Crohn's disease development.},

   abstract = {Abdominal pain is a common symptom of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis). Pain may arise from different mechanisms, which can include partial blockage and gut distention as well as severe intestinal inflammation. A majority of patients suffering from acute flares of IBD will experience pain, which will typically improve as disease activity decreases. However, a significant percentage of IBD patients continue experiencing symptoms of pain despite resolving inflammation and achieving what appears to be clinical remission. Current evidence suggests that sensory pathways sensitize during inflammation, leading to persistent changes in afferent neurons and central nervous system pain processing. Such persistent pain is not only a simple result of sensory input. Pain processing and even the activation of sensory pathways is modulated by arousal, emotion, and cognitive factors. Considering the high prevalence of iatrogenic as well as essential neuropsychiatric comorbidities including anxiety and depression in IBD patients, these central modulating factors may significantly contribute to the clinical manifestation of chronic pain. The improved understanding of peripheral and central pain mechanisms is leading to new treatment strategies that view pain as a biopsychosocial problem. Thus, improving the underlying inflammation, decreasing the excitability of sensitized afferent pathways, and altering emotional and/or cognitive functions may be required to more effectively address the difficult and disabling disease manifestations.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) may lead to protein and calorie malnutrition (PCM) secondary to impaired digestive and absorptive functions of the small intestine and sometimes to the influence of diet taboos. The earlier the PCM is diagnosed, the higher are the odds of reversal. The objective of this study was to compare different methods of nutritional assessment in patients with CD and correlate them with the disease characteristics. SAMPLE: The sample comprised 75 patients with CD from the Gastroenterology Service at the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre; 37 were male, with a mean age of 38.2 years old (SD = 13.3). All patients had been in clinical remission (CDAI <150) for over 3 months. They were not receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition. The nutritional assessment was considered: body mass index (BMI), triceps skin fold (TSF), arm circumference (MAC), arm muscle circumference (MAMC), subjective global assessment (SGA), non-dominating handgrip strength (HGS) and food intake inquiries. RESULTS: When comparing the different nutritional assessment methods, 26.7% of the patients were malnourished according to the MAC, 29.3% according to the MAMC, 18.7% according to the SGA, 6.7% according to the BMI, 37.3% according to the TSF and 73.3% according to the HGS. No statistically significant associations were found for disease location, its behavior, drugs utilized, ESR, CRP, age of patients and disease time with the nutritional state verified by HGS, TSF, MAMC and SGA. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is significant in patients with CD, even in clinical remission. The BMI should not be used as reference in this population. The HGS detected a high prevalence of nutritional risk in patients with CD in remission. Studies are required that correlate it with more sensitive methods, for the patients' effective nutritional state assessment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to design a theory-based educational program for adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using an interactive multimedia CD-ROM and to test its effectiveness in improving knowledge in IBD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Curriculum-based instruction using educational theory and principles was designed for adolescents on an interactive multimedia CD-ROM. Twenty subjects completed summative evaluation of the CD-ROM measuring gain in knowledge about IBD immediately and 9 months after instruction. RESULTS: Subjects found the CD-ROM to be informative, appealing, and easy to use. The mean baseline score of the adolescents on the Crohn's and Colitis Knowledge questionnaire was 12.2 (standard deviation 5.14, range 3-24). After an average of 30 minutes of self-directed learning, adolescent subjects increased their posttest score to a mean of 19.8, a gain of 7.6 points over baseline (95% confidence interval 5.2-10.1, P < 0.0001). Knowledge of medications, disease complications, and gastrointestinal structure and function was gained and retained upon retesting at 9 months with a mean Crohn's and Colitis Knowledge questionnaire score of 17.5 (standard deviation 3.9, range 12-26), which was still an improvement over the mean pretest knowledge score of 12.2 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with IBD have low baseline knowledge about their disease. A rigorously developed interactive educational tool is now available for instructing adolescent patients about their IBD.},

This procedure is also useful to place enteral feeding tubes in patients with an excluded stomach. Hemostatic efficacy is high in patients with elevated transfusional requirements. For polypectomy, this technique has not been demonstrated to have the same efficacy/risk as colonoscopy. Complications include pancreatitis (0.34%) and perforation (0.34-6.4%). The level of evidence for almost all indications is low, since few prospective and homogeneous studies have been performed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Thiopurines are a common, effective means of maintaining remission in pediatric Crohn disease (CD). Methotrexate (MTX) may be considered for those intolerant of or unresponsive to thiopurines. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of MTX as maintenance therapy in patients previously treated with thiopurines. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All of the patients at Nationwide Children's Hospital from 1998 to 2007 with an International Classification of Diseases code indicative of CD were identified. Patients with a diagnosis of CD, a history of prior thiopurine use, no current infliximab therapy, and at least 6 months of follow-up after MTX initiation were included. The primary outcome was defined as steroid-/infliximab-free remission determined by the physician global assessment at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included subsequent treatment with infliximab and/or corticosteroids, rate of discontinuation of MTX, and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (17 boys, 63%) with a mean age at diagnosis of 12.3 +/- 0.7 years and mean disease duration of 1.49 +/- 0.3 years were identified. Indications for MTX included nonresponse to thiopurines, AE, and poor adherence to thiopurines. At 6 and 12 months, 13 of 27 patients (48.1%) and 9 of 27 patients (33.3%), respectively, were in steroid-/infliximab-free remission. A total of 10 patients (37.0%) required infliximab therapy during the 12-month period and 5 patients discontinued MTX. Nausea was the most commonly reported AE. Transient transaminase elevation occurred in 4 patients and transient leukopenia in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: MTX can be effective as maintenance therapy for patients with pediatric CD previously intolerant of or unresponsive to thiopurines; however, greater than one third of this cohort required escalation to antitumor necrosis factor therapy within 12 months following MTX initiation. MTX was well tolerated.},

AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the risk of sub-clinical atherosclerosis in Crohn's disease, by measuring the intima-media thickness and peak systolic velocity of the common carotid artery. METHODS: Fifty Crohn's disease patients aged between 20 and 45 years were compared to 25 controls. Patients with a family history of cardiovascular diseases or a known risk for atherosclerosis were excluded. All participants underwent nutritional assessment. Carotid artery ultrasonography was performed and intima-media thickness and peak systolic velocity were measured, proximal to the common carotid bifurcation. Clinical data and laboratory parameters (hemoglobin, highly sensitive C-reactive protein, and plasma homocysteine) were determined. RESULTS: No significant differences between the groups were found for intima-media thickness or peak systolic velocity. Multiple regression analysis revealed a positive correlation of intima-media thickness with older age. Peak systolic velocity was negatively associated with age. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease patients do not have an increased risk for developing early atherosclerosis.},

Unfortunately, certain drugs can cause serious side effects, and surgeries must often be repeated. No diet has been established to alleviate the pain and suffering of CD patients. This is curious given the fact that a higher prevalence of food sensitivities exist in this population of patients, and enteral nutrition is not only the first-line of therapy in Japan, but a known research method used to place the majority of CD patients into remission. Although not all patients respond equally to diet, many simply remove symptom-provoking foods, such as dairy, wheat, corn and certain fruits and vegetables. We suggest assisting these patients in their self-assessment of irritating and symptom-provoking foods by educating them in the use of a food-symptom diary followed by a customized elimination diet trialed for 2-4 weeks to determine if there is any benefit to the individual patient.},

AIM: To describe our experience of treating CD with an 8-week course of primary EEN and to study factors affecting treatment outcome. METHODS: All CD patients treated with EEN in our centre between 2004 and 2007 were included in the study. Remission was determined by a combination of clinical parameters. Disease phenotype was assigned using published classifications. Inflammatory markers and anthropometry (Z-scores) were calculated before and after treatment. RESULTS: A total of 114 children were treated (four were excluded). Median age at diagnosis was 11.6 years. Fifty-seven (51.8%) were fed orally whilst 53 (48.2%) were fed by tube. Eighty-eight (80%) achieved remission with consequent reductions in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (P < 0.001). Patients in remission had comparative improvements in weight (-1.04 cf. -0.40) and BMI Z-scores (-0.98 cf. -0.03) by the end of treatment (P < 0.001). Individuals with isolated terminal ileal disease (n = 4) had lower remission rates than other locations (P = 0.02). No other significant differences in remission rates for any other disease locations were found. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive enteral nutrition induces clinical remission, normalization of inflammatory markers and improves weight/BMI Z-scores in most patients. This study demonstrates that disease phenotype should not influence clinicians when commencing patients on EEN.},

Veno-occlusive disease, peliosis hepatis, perisinusoidal fibrosis and nodular regenerative hyperplasia have all been described with thiopurines.

We describe a report of nodular regenerative hyperplasia in a Crohn's disease patient associated with 6-mercaptopurine therapy and have reviewed the management and the literature regarding this complication. Our report strengthens the importance of further safety studies to evaluate the etiology, prevalence, risk factors and screening modalities for hepatotoxicity, in particular of nodular regenerative hyperplasia, in patients treated with thiopurines for inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and 2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89 months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive, multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab, thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.},

Only two environmental factors have an established role in IBD. Smoking is a risk factor for CD and a protective factor for UC; appendectomy is a protective factor for UC. Many other environmental factors for IBD have been investigated. These are infectious agents, diet, drugs, stress and socio-economic factors. They are detailed in this paper. Among them, adherent invasive E. coli, infectious gastroenteritis, oral contraceptives and antibiotics could play a role in CD. To date, three theories integrate environmental factors to pathogenesis of IBD: hygiene, infection and cold chain. Much work remains to be done to identify risk factors for IBD. As exemplified by smoking, research of environmental risk factors of IBD is useful since it may lead to an improved disease course among patients and perhaps, to appropriate prevention among predisposed subjects. Further studies in this field are eagerly awaited.},

For instance, patients with Crohn's Disease (CD) or Ulcerative Colitis (UC) have a 12-20% increased risk for developing CRC. Preventive strategies utilizing nontoxic natural compounds that modulate immune responses could be successful in the suppression of inflammation-driven colorectal cancer in high-risk groups. The increase of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) expression and its transcriptional activity has been identified as a target for anti-inflammatory efforts, and the suppression of inflammation-driven colon cancer. PPARgamma down-modulates inflammation and elicits antiproliferative and proapoptotic actions in epithelial cells. All of which may decrease the risk for inflammation-induced CRC. This review will focus on the use of orally active, naturally occurring chemopreventive approaches against inflammation-induced CRC that target PPARgamma and therefore down-modulate inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The National UK IBD audit tool is an electronic database created to improve the quality and safety of care for IBD patients by auditing individual patient care, service resources and organisation against national standards. We used the National UK IBD audit tool to compare the organisation and process of IBD care between services in Oxford (UK) and Milan (Italy), as a pilot study to evaluate its application outside national boundaries. METHODS: Clinical and demographic data of patients with CD and UC, consecutively admitted during a 2month period, were collected and compared between the centres, to each other and to the UK IBD standards obtained by previous audit analyses performed in Oxford in 2006. RESULTS: 20 and 26 patients with UC were admitted in Oxford and Milan, as well as 21 and 20 patients with CD, respectively. Most admissions in Milan were planned admissions for moderately active treatment-refractory disease. No patient died. Oxford had a higher surgery rate. Endoscopy for UC consisted mainly of colonoscopy in Milan (92%) and flexible sigmoidoscopy in Oxford (64%). In CD, Oxford data revealed a higher use of immununomodulators and CT scan, compared with higher use of bowel ultrasound in Milan. CRP was the preferred biomarker of disease activity. The following areas did not reach the standards set for the 2006 UK IBD Audit: the lack in Milan of IBD specialist nurses and few dietitian visits, as well as little attention to heparin prophylaxis and abdominal radiography in UC. Both sites paid little attention to stool cultures and revealed a high rate of active smokers in CD and little attention to bone protection in steroids users. Since the 2006 audit in Oxford, improvements include IBD specialist nurse visits, dietitian visits, number of active smokers, stool samples, prophylactic heparin, bone protection and nutritional assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent procedural differences between Oxford and Milan identified by audits of both UC and CD could be resolved by organisational change, with an improvement in the service. The UK IBD audit tool is an easy instrument to assess the processes and outcomes of care delivery in IBD and can be applied also outside UK.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Enterohepatic Helicobacter species (EHS) have previously been found in adults with hepatobiliary diseases. Here, we report the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori and EHS in liver and gastric tissue in children and adolescents with chronic liver disease (CLD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-seven consecutive children and adolescents with CLD with or without ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease (UC/CD) were investigated. Tissue samples were analysed using a Helicobacter genus-specific 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and DNA-sequence analysis. Sera from 61 subjects were also analysed using enzyme immunoassay and immunoblotting. RESULTS: The Helicobacter PCR was positive in 3/23 (13%) livers from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and UC, and in 1/2 livers from patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and UC. Sequenced PCR products matched the 16S rDNA of H. hepaticus, H. muridarum, H. canis, and H. pylori, respectively. H. ganmani and H. bilis were detected in gastric tissues from two AIH patients. H. hepaticus and H. pullorum were found in livers from two patients with acute liver failure and intrahepatic cholestasis. Antibody reactivity to Helicobacter cell-surface proteins was negative. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori and EHS can be detected in the livers of some patients with UC and concomitant liver disease, as well as in other children with liver diseases. Multicentre studies from different locations are needed to find out whether these bacteria play a pathogenetic role or whether their presence is an epiphenomenon.},

   abstract = {AIM: This study aimed to test the efficacy of mesalazine in maintaining remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) following successful flare-up treatment. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 122 patients received either mesalazine 50mg/kg per day (n=60) or placebo (n=62) for one year. Treatment allocation was stratified according to flare-up treatment (nutrition or medication alone). Recruitment was carried out over two periods, as the first period's results showed a trend favoring mesalazine. Relapse was defined as a Harvey-Bradshaw score more than or equal to 5. Time to relapse was analyzed using the Cox model. RESULTS: The one-year relapse rate was 57% (n=29) and 63% (n=35) in the mesalazine and placebo groups, respectively. We demonstrated a twofold lower relapse risk (P<0.02) in patients taking mesalazine in the medication stratum (first recruitment period), and a twofold higher risk in patients taking mesalazine in the nutrition stratum (second recruitment period), compared with the other groups. None of the children's characteristics, which differed across the two recruitment periods, accounted for the between-period variation in mesalazine efficacy. One serious adverse event was reported in each treatment group. CONCLUSION: Overall, mesalazine does not appear to be an effective maintenance treatment in pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {The relation between Crohn disease (CD) and mycobacterial infection is complex and intriguing. The 2 conditions share common immunopathogenic features, and the hypothesis that Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis may cause CD is still under debate. Moreover, differential diagnosis between CD and intestinal tuberculosis (TB) may be challenging, especially in the growing proportion of children immigrating from countries with a high prevalence of TB. Thus, in Western countries, paediatricians who are involved in the diagnosis and management of children with CD are expected to face intestinal TB more frequently than in the past and should always consider the differential diagnosis between these 2 conditions. In addition, the use of biological agents in the treatment of CD, which may reactivate latent TB, requires the development of targeted diagnostic algorithms. Children with CD who are candidates for treatment with antitumour necrosis factor-alpha agents should be screened for latent or active TB and closely followed over time, also considering possible failure of antitubercular prophylaxis and the frequent uncharacteristic presentation of TB in children receiving antitumour necrosis factor-alpha agents. In the present review, the most recent literature findings on these topics are reported, focusing particularly on the paediatric age group.},

   abstract = {In order to increase dietary folic acid intake and to improve nutritional status regarding folate by controlling homocysteine concentrations, ten patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease in the colon and ulcerative colitis) received individualized nutritional guidance and were followed up as outpatients for 2 months. The following procedures were performed at the beginning of the study (T0), after 1 month (T1) and at the end of the study (T2): collection of anthropometric data (weight and height), dietary data (24 h diet recall), and blood under fasting condition for the determination of serum folic acid, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and vitamin B12. Plasma folic acid deficiency was not detected but hyperhomocysteinemia was present in six individuals and C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased (>0.5 mg/dl) in seven patients. After the patients were instructed there was a significant increase in vitamin B6 intake (about 35%) and in folate intake (49.6%). Mean plasma levels of folic acid, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 did not change, but there was a significant decrease of CRP at T1, 0.36 mg dl(-1) on average (P = 0.01), which was maintained at T2. We conclude that the increased folate intake reported by this group of patients was not reflected in improved serum concentrations of folic acid and homocysteine. However, the guidelines for the patients probably induced them to choose a more adequate diet, providing nutrients that help control the inflammatory process.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are corticosteroid-dependent or -refractory are at higher risk of developing disease- and treatment-related complications. AIMS: To identify retrospectively clinical factors present at diagnosis that predict the occurrence of corticosteroid dependency and refractoriness in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. METHODS: A total of 310 IBD patients (134 CD, 176 UC) were observed for 2140 person years and their use of systemic corticosteroids was determined. Outcomes of corticosteroid dependency and refractoriness were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the clinical factors associated with outcomes. RESULTS: Seventy-seven (57.5%) CD and 95 (54.0%) UC patients had received corticosteroids during study period. In CD, thrombocytosis [Hazard ratio (HR):3.0] predicted, whereas colonic CD (HR:0.3) negatively predicted corticosteroid dependency. Stricturing phenotype (HR:4.5) predicted corticosteroid-refractory CD. For UC, thrombocytosis (HR:3.9) and extensive colitis (HR:1.7) predicted corticosteroid dependency. Presence of anaemia (HR:10.8) at diagnosis and initial requirement of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (HR:18.8) predicted corticosteroid-refractory UC. The cumulative risks of surgery were 17.8% and 5.4% for CD and UC patients respectively at 1 year after starting corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytosis at diagnosis predicted corticosteroid-dependency in IBD. Stricturing phenotype of CD and the presence of anaemia in UC predicted subsequent course of corticosteroid refractoriness.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Proteasome-mediated protein degradation may contribute to the regulation of intestinal inflammation. At the same time, low-grade inflammation and increased intestinal permeability seem to be involved in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Thus, we aimed to evaluate proteasome composition and activities in colonic mucosa of IBS patients and its putative pathogenic role. METHODS: Proteasome activities and proteasome subunit expression were measured in colonic mucosa of IBS, Crohn's disease (CD), and control patients by fluorometric assays and western blot, respectively. Expression of inhibitor of kappa B factor (IkappaB alpha) and occludin, a tight junction protein, was also evaluated in colonic biopsies. The degradation of recombinant occludin incubated with protein extracts from colonic mucosa was evaluated in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitor, MG132. RESULTS: Proteasome trypsin-like activity was increased in IBS patients compared with CD and controls, whereas chymotrypsin-like activity was upregulated in CD patients only. Caspase-like activity was reduced both in IBS and CD patients. IkappaB alpha expression was similar between IBS and controls. In contrast, occludin expression was lower in IBS than in controls, but occludin mRNA level was similar. Protein extracts from IBS patients but not from controls degraded recombinant occludin (20% over 160 min), which was blocked by MG132. Although mast cell number was increased in IBS patients, no correlation was found between this number and proteasome alterations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that proteasome alterations are present in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients and may contribute to the pathophysiology of IBS by increasing occludin degradation.},

   abstract = {The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is multifactorial and involves interactions of gut luminal content with mucosal barrier and especially immune cells. Malnutrition is a frequent issue during IBD flares, especially in Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and nutritional support is frequently used to treat malnutrition but also in an attempt to modulate intestinal inflammation. The use of oral or enteral nutrition intervention in IBDs may be effective, alone or in combination with drugs, to achieve and maintain remission. However, standard diets are less effective than new-generation biotherapies and could be improved by supplementation with specific immunomodulatory amino acids. Experimental studies evaluating glutamine, the preferential substrate for enterocytes, are promising. Some clinical studies with oral glutamine in CD are until now disappointing, but new formulations and targeting could enhance glutamine efficacy at the site of mucosal lesions. The role of arginine, involved in nitric oxide and polyamines synthesis, still remains debated. However, the effects of these amino acids in IBD have been poorly documented in humans. Other candidates like glycine, cysteine, histidine, or taurine should also be evaluated in the future.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Variation in medical care can be a barrier to improving clinical outcomes. We aim to describe the variation in care of Crohn disease as provided by a broad sample of pediatric gastroenterologists. METHODS: Two hundred forty-six Crohn disease patients of 93 pediatric gastroenterologists from 48 practice sites starting treatment with either thiopurine or infliximab were studied. We assessed variation in diagnostic testing that had been performed to establish the diagnosis of Crohn disease and to assess the phenotype, extent, and severity of disease. We also assessed variation in initial thiopurine and infliximab dosage and in nutritional therapy. RESULTS: Diagnostic studies in which care was uniform included complete blood count, performed in 100% of patients, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and colonoscopy in 96%, and upper endoscopy in 89%. However, imaging of the small bowel had not been performed in 19%, and a stool test for pathogens had not been performed in 29%. Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) had been measured in 61% of patients before treatment with a thiopurine; in 85%, TPMT was normal. Nonetheless, even when TPMT was normal, 40% of patients received an initial dose of thiopurine that was lower than recommended. Testing for tuberculosis before initiating treatment with infliximab was not performed in 30%. In addition, 36% of severely underweight patients were not receiving a multivitamin supplement, supplemental formula, or tube feeding. CONCLUSIONS: There is variation in diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in the management of pediatric Crohn disease, and gaps exist between recommended and actual care.},

   abstract = {Dysregulation of intestinal epithelial cell performance is associated with an array of pathologies whose onset mechanisms are incompletely understood. While whole-genomics approaches have been valuable for studying the molecular basis of several intestinal diseases, a thorough analysis of gene expression along the healthy gastrointestinal tract is still lacking. The aim of this study was to map gene expression in gastrointestinal regions of healthy human adults and to implement a procedure for microarray data analysis that would allow its use as a reference when screening for pathological deviations. We analyzed the gene expression signature of antrum, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and transverse colon biopsies using a biostatistical method based on a multivariate and univariate approach to identify region-selective genes. One hundred sixty-six genes were found responsible for distinguishing the five regions considered. Nineteen had never been described in the GI tract, including a semaphorin probably implicated in pathogen invasion and six novel genes. Moreover, by crossing these genes with those retrieved from an existing data set of gene expression in the intestine of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients, we identified genes that might be biomarkers of Crohn's and/or ulcerative colitis in ileum and/or colon. These include CLCA4 and SLC26A2, both implicated in ion transport. This study furnishes the first map of gene expression along the healthy human gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, the approach implemented here, and validated by retrieving known gene profiles, allowed the identification of promising new leads in both healthy and disease states.},

Malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are common at the time of diagnosis and may persist throughout the course of the disease. There are a number of similarities with regards to the nutritional complications and the approach to nutritional management in IBD in both children and adults, but there are also important differences. Growth failure, pubertal delay and the need for corticosteroid-sparing regimens are of higher importance in pediatrics. In the pediatric population, exclusive enteral nutrition may be equivalent to corticosteroids in inducing remission in acute Crohn's disease, and may have benefits over corticosteroids in children. Adherence with exclusive enteral nutrition is better in children than in adults. Iron deficiency anemia is an important problem for adults and children with IBD. Intravenous iron administration may be superior to oral iron supplementation. Ensuring adequate bone health is another critical component of nutritional management in IBD, but guidelines for screening and therapeutic interventions for low bone mineral density are lacking in children.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are chronic disabling lifelong diseases which may be disturbed by severe flares and anatomical complications requiring surgery. Until the very last years there was no clear indication that treatment was able to modify the long-term natural history of the disease. In particular, there are no data demonstrating a clear improvement through the period 1950-2003 in disease activity, occurrence of complications and need for surgery, in spite of an increased use of immunosuppressants since the 1990s. However, in inflammatory bowel disease, both thiopurines and methotrexate are very efficient in about one half of the patients, and in responders, may heal the mucosa and decrease the need for surgery. The early use of immunosuppressants in selected patients may have an impact on occurrence of severe flares and complications, and need for surgery. Moreover, anti-TNF now used for 10 years in Crohn's disease and for 5 years in ulcerative colitis demonstrated in two thirds of the patients a remarkable anatomic effect, healing the mucosa, closing fistulae and preventing strictures. Infliximab does prevent endoscopic recurrence following ileal resection for Crohn's disease. Actually, because irreversible anatomical damage may develop during the first years of disease, there is a need to classify early in the course of the disease patients who will benefit from anti-TNF and classical immunosuppressants, respectively. There is the need in the next few years to better define these subgroups and to compare different strategies within each group through randomized interventional studies.},

   abstract = {Current smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease and worsens its course, increasing the need for steroids, immunosuppressants, and re-operations. On the contrary, smoking protects against ulcerative colitis and after disease onset improves its course, decreasing the need for colectomy. Smoking cessation improves Crohn's disease and worsens ulcerative colitis. Achieving smoking cessation in Crohn's disease is thus an important goal of therapy, whereas patients with ulcerative colitis should not be discouraged to quit, because the beneficial effect of smoking for their disease is counterbalanced by the deleterious respiratory and cardiovascular effects of tobacco. Physical activity improves quality of life without detrimental effect on disease activity, and may contribute to increase muscle mass and to prevent osteoporosis. Regarding nutrition, a Western diet may be associated with an increased risk of IBD, and a case-control study revealed an increased consumption of linoleic acid before diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Liquid diets may improve Crohn's disease flares and decrease the need for steroids; however, there are no defined diets able to improve the disease course, and in Crohn's disease, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids did not show a significant benefit. Obesity is becoming more prevalent in IBD and may be associated with higher disease activity. In total, adhering to four simple lifestyle factors - never smoking, physical activity, prudent diet and body mass index <25 - may have a strong impact both on the prevention of major chronic diseases and on the course of IBD.},

We assess in long-term the response of malnourished patients to treatment of nutritional supplement with TGF-beta2 (Substudy B). SUBJECTS: ninety-eight (51% females) patients with Crohn's disease without selection, ages: 39.2 +/- 15.19 years, range: 18-81 years were included in Substudy A. In Substudy B thirty-nine malnourished patients (52% females) were included with an average age of 36.41 +/- 5.2 years and range: 19-45 (Substudy B). METHODS: the design of the Substudy A was an observational and cross sectional study. Whereas, the Substudy B was a longitudinal, open intervention study with active (historical) control. The variables were anthropometric parameters, electrical bioimpedance, biochemical measures, index of disease activity, subjective global assessment and the kind of treatment that every patient has received. MAIN RESULTS: the malnutrition rate was 52%, being the most frequent the caloric malnutrition, followed by mixed malnutrition. Thirty four per cent of the patients had iron deficiency. Twelve months of nutritional therapy with supplement specifically enriched in TGF-beta2 improved the evolution of the disease determined by a decrease in CDAI. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of malnutrition was similar to that of previous studies realized in Spain. Our study confirms the high rate of iron deficiency that the patients suffer with Crohn's disease. The response to the treatment is favorable, especially regarding the natural history of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Post hoc analyses evaluated the effect of infliximab upon concurrent perianal Crohn disease (CD) in a subpopulation of 31 patients from REACH, a randomized trial of 112 children with moderately to severely active luminal CD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index perirectal subscore was used to assess perianal symptom activity and therapeutic response. Patients with no symptoms or asymptomatic tags received a score of 0; those with "1-2 indolent fistula, scant drainage, no tenderness" received a score of 5; and those with "active fistula, drainage, tenderness or abscess" received a score of 10. Initial perirectal subscores of 10 or 5 decreasing to 0 were considered complete response. Subscores of 10 decreasing to 5 were considered partial response. All patients were followed for efficacy and safety through week 54. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with baseline perianal disease were randomized at week 10 following a 3-dose infliximab induction regimen. At week 2, 40.9% (9/22) of patients with signs and symptoms of perianal disease at baseline attained response (4 partial and 5 complete). At week 54, 72.7% (16/22) of patients with signs and symptoms of perianal disease attained response (1 partial and 15 complete). Nine patients developed perianal signs and symptoms during treatment; 7 had complete response and 2 had no response at week 54. The incidence of adverse events for patients with perianal symptoms at baseline and for those in the overall REACH population was similar (95.7% vs 94.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab rapidly reduced concurrent perianal disease signs and symptoms in this REACH cohort.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are lifelong inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases starting in about one third of patients during childhood. Treatment strategies aim to control this chronic inflammatory process. Owing to recent advances in the understanding of IBD, immunosuppressive agents (mainly against TNFalpha directed) as well as biological drugs are more and more often used. This therapeutic approach clearly improved the clinical condition of the majority of patients with IBD. However, with this more aggressive treatment strategy, safety concerns clearly arise. Recently, the description of a series of a particularly severe form of T cell lymphoma in pediatric and young adult patients with IBD under immunomodulator and biological combination therapy raised the question of the risks of treatment-induced side effects or complications. As reviewed in the present article, there is a slightly increased risk of not only lymphoma development in IBD patients, potentially related to the inflammatory process, but also to the use of immunosuppressive therapies. On the basis of the literature data, were analyzed current treatment strategies for children with moderate-to-severe IBD, who are candidates to receive immunomodulator and/or biological agents potentially accelerating the risk of lymphoma development. Comparative clinical studies in IBD are still missing; however, it is prudent to think about adapting immunosuppressive therapies to the inflammatory process of the underlying disorder and if possible to reduce them to monotherapy. Alternative treatment strategies for heavy immunosuppression exist (eg, enteral nutrition in Crohn disease or colectomy in patients with ulcerative colitis) and should be considered whenever appropriate. There is a major need for comparative studies before evidence-based guidelines can be established for safest and best treatment strategies of pediatric patients with IBD.},

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) may present with granulomatous colitis, perianal abscesses, hepatic abscesses or granulomas, failure to thrive, and obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract (including esophageal strictures and dysmotility, delayed gastric emptying, and small bowel obstruction). Anemia, thrombocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and hypoalbuminemia are nonspecific and may occur in any of the granulomatous inflammatory bowel diseases. In histology, macrophages with cytoplasmic inclusions will be rather specific for CGD. Sarcoidosis may present with abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhea, weight loss, growth failure, delayed puberty, erythema nodosum, arthritis, uveitis, and hepatic granulomata. Only in 55% of the patients will angiotensin-converting enzyme be elevated. The noncaseating epithelioid granulomata will be unspecific. Bronchoalveolar lymphocytosis and abnormalities in pulmonary function are reported in sarcoidosis and in Crohn disease (CD) and CGD. Importantly, patients with CD may present with granulomatous lung disease, fibrosing alveolitis, and drug-induced pneumonitis. Sarcoidosis and concomitant gastrointestinal CD have been reported in patients, as well as coexistence of CD and sarcoidosis in siblings. Common susceptibility loci have been identified in CD and sarcoidosis. CD and CGD share defects in the defense mechanisms against different microbes. In the present review, common features and essential differences are discussed in clinical presentation and diagnostics--including histology--in CGD, sarcoidosis, and CD, together with 2 other granulomatous inflammatory bowel diseases, namely abdominal tuberculosis and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. Instructions for specific diagnosis and respective treatments are provided.},

The enteric microflora is implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD; however, its role in the development of GSD-associated IBD is unknown. Antibody reactivity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), Escherichia coli outer membrane porin C (anti-OmpC), and bacterial flagellin (anti-CBir1) have been associated with Crohn disease in the general population, but they have an undetermined association in children and adults with GSD-Ib. Our goal was to examine the association of ASCA, anti-OmpC, and anti-CBir1 with the clinical features of GSD-Ib enterocolitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: : A retrospective review identified 19 patients with GSD-Ib with or without a known diagnosis of enterocolitis. Radiographic, endoscopic, and serologic data were collected and assays for ASCA, anti-OmpC, and anti-CBir1 obtained. RESULTS: : Seven patients had combined radiographic, endoscopic, and histologic evidence of intestinal inflammation; the majority had ileocolonic involvement. Seventeen of 19 (89%) patients had elevated anti-CBir1 levels (6/7 in the IBD group and 11/12 in the no clinical evidence of IBD group). Thirteen of 19 (68%) had elevated anti-OmpC levels (5/7 in the IBD group and 8/12 in the no clinical evidence of IBD group). Eleven of 19 (58%) patients had elevated ASCA IgA levels (4/7 in the IBD group and 7/12 in the no clinical evidence of IBD group). CONCLUSIONS: : Nearly all of the patients with GSD-Ib had elevated anti-CBir1 levels. The antibody did not differentiate those with and without a diagnosis of GSD-Ib-associated IBD. Seroreactivity to flagellin may represent immune dysfunction rather than active enterocolitis in this patient population. Long-term follow-up of the group without known IBD is required to determine whether these antibodies can predict intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {AIM: Although available data support a role for exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in children with Crohn's disease (CD), use of this therapy varies. The aim of this study was to define the patterns of use of EEN across Australia and to better understand the reasons for this variation. METHODS: Using an existing email network, Australian paediatric gastroenterologists were asked to provide details of their attitudes towards, and use of, EEN in children. A questionnaire was designed to direct responses, with regard to use of EEN, to current EEN protocols and patterns of use. RESULTS: Twenty-one replies were received (58% response). Although 12 respondents felt that EEN was an appropriate therapy for CD, only 8 regularly used EEN for their patients. Usage varied between states and within units. Current use was related to practitioners' experiences of EEN during their gastroenterology training. The concerns of those who did not recommend EEN included compliance, cost and resource demands. The doctors who recommend EEN reported that family support, team approach and disease location were important factors for a positive outcome from EEN. Current protocols varied in terms of type of formula, length of therapy and use of concurrent medications. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in care were illustrated across these paediatric gastroenterologists. Practitioners have many reasons and concerns about the use of EEN: these impede the wider use of EEN for paediatric CD. More consistent protocols for the use of EEN and an improved understanding of the mechanisms of EEN could lead to enhanced use of this therapy.},

This is a chronic and relapsing condition of unknown aetiology that comprises chiefly ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Although there are treatments for IBD, they have frequent side effects and they are not always effective; therefore there is a need for new therapies that could alleviate this condition. Two bioactive peptides present in milk (transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and casein macropeptide, also named glycomacropeptide) have been shown to have intestinal anti-inflammatory activities. In fact, TGF-beta is currently added to formulas intended for patients with IBD, and several studies indicate that these formulas could induce clinical remission. In this paper, evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory effect of TGF-beta and bovine glycomacropeptide, as well as their mechanisms of action, is reviewed, focusing on the evidence obtained in animal models.},

   abstract = {AIM: Endorectal advancement flap is the most used treatment for acquired rectovaginal fistula but is liable to failure. We describe our experience with a modified technique. METHOD: Patients were included who had an acquired rectovaginal fistula. Exclusions included patients with Crohn's disease with proctitis, malignant or radiation-related fistula, stricture of the anorectum or those with an external sphincter defect. Surgery included closure of the internal opening with a figure-of-eight reabsorbable suture, plication of the anorectal muscular layer and mucosal flap advancement. Total parenteral nutrition was administered postoperatively for seven days. RESULTS: Between March 2003 and July 2008, 23 consecutive women (mean age 45.5 [28-78] years) were treated. The cause of fistulation included obstetric injury (n = 5), cryptoglandular disease (n = 11) and Crohn's disease (n = 7). Thirteen (57%) patients had a previous failed repair. At a mean follow-up of 14 (2-67) months, success was achieved in 65% (15/23) of patients. The mean Wexner incontinence scores pre- and postoperatively were 1.3 (0-15) and 0.6 (0-6), respectively. CONCLUSION: The success rate was promising with no deterioration of anal continence.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Growth hormone (GH) may reduce symptoms and improve growth in Crohn disease (CD). The effect on mucosal inflammation is not known. We hypothesized that GH would improve both clinical and mucosal disease activity and stimulate linear growth in pediatric CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients ages 7 to 18 receiving corticosteroids (CTX) for active CD were randomized to begin GH, 0.075 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) (group A), or continue CTX alone (group B). Clinical and endoscopic disease activities were assessed after 12 weeks. Group B began GH at 12 weeks, and clinical disease activity was assessed at 24 weeks. Subjects who experienced a clinical response after 12 weeks of GH therapy continued treatment for an additional 52 weeks, and linear growth was assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of patients receiving GH achieved clinical remission, compared with 20% treated with CTX alone (P = 0.03). Although endoscopic disease activity trended toward an improvement at week 12 in group A, this did not differ between the groups. Sixty-one percent of week 12 GH responders maintained their clinical response through week 64. Mean (95th confidence interval) height z score on GH increased from -1.1 (-1.6, -0.6) to -0.4 (-1, 0.2), P = 0.004 during this 52-week extension phase. GH was well tolerated with no unexpected safety signals. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of GH to CTX therapy did not induce a reduction in mucosal inflammation, relative to CTX alone. However, GH was safe and effective as an adjunct to CTX for treatment of clinical disease activity and growth failure in pediatric CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: TNFalpha seems to contribute to inflammation and malnutrition in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. In CD patients, the comparative effects on nutritional status of infliximab and traditional therapy have not yet been determined. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of infliximab as compared with those of standard therapy on nutritional status, disease activity, resting energy expenditure (REE), and food intake in CD children and adolescents. METHODS: From September 1999 to September 2005, all CD patients treated with infliximab (group A) were reviewed and matched with CD patients treated with traditional therapy (mesalazine and azathioprine) (group B). RESULTS: Fourteen CD patients from group A and 14 from group B were included; median interval before follow-up investigation was 10 months. Baseline and final values of weight, height, body mass index (BMI), pediatric CD activity index (pCDAI), REE, and food intake were studied. In treated patients, but not in control group, mean baseline weight (kg) and BMI values, 39.7 +/- 13.1 and 17.9 +/- 3.3, respectively, were significantly lower than their final values 42.6 +/- 13.2 and 18.9 +/- 3.1, and median pCDAI values 23.5 were significantly higher than their final values 10 (P < 0.05). Significant changes in height, REE, and food intake were not found in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric CD patients, infliximab seems to impact positively on the nutritional status as demonstrated by the improvement in weight and BMI, but not in linear growth; effects on nutritional status seem to be due to amelioration of disease activity, rather than to REE reduction or food intake increase.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although it is known that extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) commonly occur in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), little research has examined rates of EIMs and their relation to other disease-related factors in this population. The purpose of this study was to determine the rates of EIMs in pediatric IBD and examine correlations with age, sex, diagnosis, disease severity, and distribution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were prospectively collected as part of the Pediatric IBD Collaborative Research Group Registry, an observational database enrolling newly diagnosed IBD patients <16 years old since 2002. Rates of EIM (occurring anytime during the period of enrollment) and the aforementioned variables (at baseline) were examined. Patients with indeterminate colitis were excluded from the analysis given the relatively small number of patients. RESULTS: One thousand nine patients were enrolled (mean age 11.6 +/- 3.1 years, 57.5% boys, mean follow-up 26.2 +/- 18.2 months). Two hundred eighty-five (28.2%) patients experienced 1 or more EIMs. Eighty-seven percent of EIM occurred within the first year. Increased disease severity at baseline (mild vs moderate/severe) was associated with the occurrence of any EIM (P < 0.001), arthralgia (P = 0.024), aphthous stomatitis (P = 0.001), and erythema nodosum (P = 0.009) for both Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) during the period of follow-up. Statistically significant differences in the rates of EIMs between CD and UC were seen for aphthous stomatitis, erythema nodosum, and sclerosing cholangitis. CONCLUSIONS: EIMs as defined in this study occur in approximately one quarter of pediatric patients with IBD. Disease type and disease severity were commonly associated with the occurrence of EIMs.},

   abstract = {Carotenoids are colored molecules that are widespread in the plant kingdom, but animals cannot synthesize them. Carotenes are long, apolar molecules which require fully functioning digestive processes to be absorbed properly. Hence they could be interesting markers of intestinal absorption and digestion. Indeed, only few tests are available to assess these processes and only the D-xylose tolerance test is routinely used. However D-xylose is a sugar that tests only the absorption of water-soluble compounds and it only tests duodenal absorption. In this study, we have evaluated carotenoids as markers of digestion and absorption. We compared fasting plasma carotenoids concentrations in 21 control subjects, 20 patients with Crohn's disease, and 18 patients with pancreatic cancer. Crohn's disease alters intestinal absorption while pancreatic cancer decreases pancreatic enzyme secretion thus impairing digestion. Results show that all carotenoids are significantly lower in Crohn's and cancer patients as compared to control subjects and the multifactorial analysis shows that this decrease is mostly independent of dietary intake. Interestingly, maldigestion as seen in pancreatic cancer more strongly influences plasma lutein and lycopene concentrations while malabsorption in Crohn's disease acts on other carotenoids. Thus carotenoids could be interesting alternatives for testing and following patients that are suspected of having malabsorption or maldigestion syndromes.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: An association of variants in the genes encoding the interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R, p.Arg381Gln, rs11209026), and the autophagy-related gene 16-like 1 (ATG16L1, p.Ala197Thr, rs2241880) with Crohn disease (CD) was identified by whole genome association studies, and subsequently confirmed by other works. The aim of this study was to assess this association in the Czech population. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a case-control study 333 patients with CD (137 paediatric and 196 adult-onset) and 499 unrelated healthy controls were genotyped using TaqMan SNP assays. RESULTS: The IL23R p.381Gln allele was protective against CD in the Czech population (allelic frequency 3.2% in patients vs 5.5% in control subjects; OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33-0.93, P=0.02). ATG16L1 p.197Ala allele conferred increased risk of CD (allelic frequency 60% in patients vs 51% in controls; OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.52, P=0.03). There was no appreciable difference in the effect of the associated alleles across the strata of CARD15-conferred risk. The IL23R and ATG16L1 variants did not influence the age at diagnosis, and in the genotype-phenotype analysis, the only detected association was a weak one between IL23R p.381Gln and involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract (uncorrected P=0.031). CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the role of IL23R and ATG16L1 in the CD susceptibility in the Czech population, and found a weak protective effect of IL23R p.381Gln against upper gastrointestinal tract involvement.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serum Amyloid A (SAA) is a major acute phase protein of unknown function. SAA is mostly expressed in the liver, but also in other tissues including the intestinal epithelium. SAA reportedly has anti-bacterial effects, and because inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) result from a breakdown in homeostatic interactions between intestinal epithelia and bacteria, we hypothesized that SAA is protective during experimental colitis. METHODS: Intestinal SAA expression was measured in mouse and human samples. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis was induced in SAA 1/2 double knockout (DKO) mice and in wildtype controls. Anti-bacterial effects of SAA1/2 were tested in intestinal epithelial cell lines transduced with adenoviral vectors encoding the CE/J SAA isoform or control vectors prior to exposure to live Escherichia coli. RESULTS: Significant levels of SAA1/SAA2 RNA and SAA protein were detected by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in mouse colonic epithelium. SAA3 expression was weaker, but similarly distributed. SAA1/2 RNA was present in the ileum and colon of conventional mice and in the colon of germfree mice. Expression of SAA3 was strongly regulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides in cultured epithelial cell lines, whereas SAA1/2 expression was constitutive and not LPS inducible. Overexpression of SAA1/2 in cultured epithelial cell lines reduced the viability of co-cultured E. coli. This might partially explain the observed increase in susceptibility of DKO mice to DSS colitis. SAA1/2 expression was increased in colon samples obtained from Crohn's Disease patients compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal epithelial SAA displays bactericidal properties in vitro and could play a protective role in experimental mouse colitis. Altered expression of SAA in intestinal biopsies from Crohn's Disease patients suggests that SAA is involved in the disease process..},

   abstract = {The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) is highest during the peak reproductive years, hence the increased concern with the safety of IBD drugs during pregnancy. Over the past 11 years, anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy has emerged as a treatment approach for refractory IBD patients who have failed to achieve or maintain remission with corticosteroids and immunomodulator agents. The TNF-alpha inhibitors (anti-TNFs; infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol) have proven successful in inducing and maintaining remission of moderate-to-severe IBD, but recommendations for the use of these compounds during pregnancy have lacked consensus. Balanced against the potential risk of these drugs on the fetus is the well-established fact that high disease activity has been found to poorly affect pregnancy outcomes in IBD, and the potential use of anti-TNF agents may control disease flare and severity during pregnancy. Concerns regarding the effect of anti-TNFs on the pregnancy and fetus have been assuaged by registry data which has demonstrated an overall positive safety record. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization categorize anti-TNF agents as safe during pregnancy. New knowledge regarding the physiologic timing of placental transfer of therapeutic antibody subclasses and pegylated antibody fragments from the mother into the fetus has also helped to allay concerns. This review will examine the present state of knowledge regarding the use of anti-TNFs in pregnant women with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The composition of the fecal mircoflora and its changes on ageing have rarely been investigated in large samples of both patients and volunteers. METHODS: We analysed the fecal flora by conventional microbiological testing (Kyberstatus, Institute of Microecology, Herborn, Germany) of stool samples from 35 292 adults (age: 46.3 +/- 0.08 [18 to 96] years, 9564 males, 24 784 females; remaining = missing data) with different intestinal and non-intestinal diagnoses for total colony-forming units (CFU) (per g stool) as well as relative abundance of Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides spp., Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and Lactobacillus spp. with respect to age, gender, and clinical data available (e. g., stool consistency and pH). RESULTS: The total CFU was stable and showed no age- or gender-related changes. Individual bacterial species constantly and significantly increased with age (E. coli, Enterococci spp.), or decreased at higher age (Bacteroides spp.), or were stable throughout the life span (Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria). Gastrointestinal diagnoses (Crohn's disease, n = 198; ulcerative colitis, n = 515; irritable bowel syndrome, n = 7765; other GI diagnoses, n = 10 478) tended to exhibit some specificity of the bacterial profile, and when GI diagnoses were excluded, the age-related bacterial profile of the remaining group (n = 15 619, m:f = 4197:11 422) was not different. CONCLUSION: Conventional microbiological investigations of the fecal microbiota showed both bacteria-specific as well as a general pattern of ageing of the colonic microbiota, with the last decades (more than 60 years) demonstrating the most profound changes. It remains to be shown whether these changes reflect direct changes of the gut microbiota, the mucosal innate immunity, or indirect consequences of age-related altered nutrition.},

The patient was diagnosed as having Crohn's disease at the age of six months by intestinal endoscopy. Based on the diagnosis, he was treated with nutrition therapy, salazosulfapyridine, and prednisolone. Fever of unknown origin occurred two months after he had taken azathioprine at the age of two years and two months. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected from a gastric aspirate, and he was diagnosed as having disseminated BCG infection by means of the multiplex PCR method. Chest CT showed miliary pulmonary nodules in both lungs on admission. Physical examination revealed enlarged lymphnodes, which were palpable around the neck and groin, and hepatomegaly. Laboratory data were within normal ranges except a slightly increased peripheral white blood cell and serum CRP level. He was treated with rifampicin (15 mg/kg/day), isoniazid (15 mg/kg/day) for 12 months, and streptomycin (25 mg/kg/day) for two months. He became afebrile a week after starting the treatment, and the miliary pulmonary nodules in both lungs had disappeared by 5 months after starting the treatment. An abnormality of the NEMO gene, which is the gene responsible for ectodermal dysplasia and immunodeficiency, was identified at the age of three years. It is assumed that an abnormality of the NEMO gene caused a latent BCG infection over a period of one year and ten months, and immunosuppressive medicine (azathioprine) induced a disseminated BCG infection. This case report supports that anti-tuberculosis medicine should be given to prevent disseminated BCG infection if an infant who receive immunosuppressive therapy is found to have an immune deficiency characterized by a mycobacterium infection after BCG vaccination.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a major source of morbidity in children and adults. Its incidence is rising, particularly in young people. IBD carries a lifelong risk of cancer, which is proportional to disease duration. Drug and surgical treatments rarely offer cure and often carry a high side effect burden. Dietary therapy is highly effective in Crohn's disease. For these reasons, there is much interest in developing novel dietary treatments in IBD. Curcumin, a component of the spice turmeric, and an anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agent, shows preclinical and clinical potential in IBD. Its mechanisms of action are unknown. Our aim was to assess the effect of curcumin on key disease mediators p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), IL-1beta, IL-10 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in the gut of children and adults with IBD. Colonic mucosal biopsies and colonic myofibroblasts (CMF) from children and adults with active IBD were cultured ex vivo with curcumin. p38 MAPK, NF-kappaB and MMP-3 were measured by immunoblotting. IL-1beta and IL-10 were measured by ELISA. We show reduced p38 MAPK activation in curcumin-treated mucosal biopsies, enhanced IL-10 and reduced IL-1beta. We demonstrate dose-dependent suppression of MMP-3 in CMF with curcumin. We conclude that curcumin, a naturally occurring food substance with no known human toxicity, holds promise as a novel therapy in IBD.},

This study aims to determine the frequency of this occurrence, and to identify predictive factors leading to a CD diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed in patients who have undergone colectomy. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2006, colectomy was performed in 212 patients, 37 of whom were diagnosed preoperatively with UC. The mean ages at diagnosis and at colectomy were 10.6+/-4.3 years and 13.7+/-3.7 years, respectively. Inflammatory bowel disease serology at diagnosis in 29 patients showed that 26 (90%) were pANCA+. Serology was negative in 3. Ten (27%) had nonspecific inflammation of the upper digestive tract. Radiographs in 25 patients indicated no abnormalities in the small intestine. Before colectomy, patients (n=35) were treated with corticosteroid (97%), 5-ASA (69%), immunomodulator (66%), infliximab (29%), and cyclosporin (11%). The mean postoperative follow-up was 2.6+/-2 years. Six patients (16%) were found to have CD. All 6 patients were pANCA+ with elevated anti-OmpC (n=4), ASCA immunoglobulin A (n=2), and ASCA immunoglobulin G (n=1). The CD group had higher mean anti-OmpC compared with the UC group, 16.9+/-5.2 and 6.2+/-3.4, respectively (P<0.005). Weight z score at time of surgery was lower in the CD group (-1.38+/-0.79) than in the UC group (0.29+/-0.24), P<0.05. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of CD remains in a small fraction of patients who undergo colectomy for medically refractory UC. A lower weight and a higher anti-OmpC titer may be predictive of CD.},

   abstract = {Inflammation is a necessary part of the immune response. However, when inflammation persists, the resultant state of chronic inflammation may have a number of secondary consequences associated with increased risk of chronic disease. Among these is an increased rate of mutation. There is evidence to suggest that the accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species may be a causal factor in chronic inflammation. These reactive species are also produced through the oxidative burst associated with the inflammatory process, and may interact with various cellular components including proteins, lipids and, most important for mutagenesis, nucleic acids. DNA strand breaks are commonly produced, leading to chromosomal mutation. Oxidized bases, abasic sites, DNA-DNA intrastrand adducts, and DNA-protein cross-links also occur. Not only do the nucleic acid products act directly as pro-mutagenic lesions, lipid peroxidation products may also lead to secondary DNA damage, including pro-mutagenic exocyclic DNA adducts. While frameshift and chromosomal mutations have been associated with chronic inflammation, much of the evidence reveals base pair substitution mutations associated with polymerase stalling near the lesions, and base pair mis-incorporation. There are also indirect effects of ROS/RNS through inhibition of DNA repair enzymes and/or effects on metabolic activation of known carcinogens. Certain disease states, including the Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are associated with enhanced levels of chronic inflammation, and show evidence of enhanced levels of genetic damage in the colonic mucosa. Mutations may provide at least part of the cause of enhanced susceptibility to chronic diseases associated with chronic inflammation.},

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory bowel diseases for which twin studies reveal genetic susceptibility that is impacted by diet and environment. Apparently contradictory data on the role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease would be entirely explainable if genetic variability determined dietary requirements and intolerances. Considering Crohn's disease, we recognize three major classes of genes. The first of these involves bacterial recognition through pattern recognition receptors and autophagy genes, while the second act through secondary immune response, and the third concern epithelial barrier integrity. Despite genetic overlap with CD, the first two groups of genes appear to be less important in ulcerative colitis, while other genes, particularly those involved in barrier function, gain prominence. Case-control studies suggest that these different genetic groups reflect distinct dietary requirements. Such studies suggest nutrigenomic approaches to maintaining disease remission at present, and preventing disease development in the future.},

   abstract = {DNA samples from 339 Crohn's disease (CD) and 407 randomly selected controls from the Auckland (New Zealand) IBD project, were genotyped for five common single nucleotide polymorphisms in IL-23R (rs11805303, rs7517847, rs1343151, rs11209026, and rs10889677) and two in IL-12B (rs1363670 and rs6887695). While the IL-12B variants did not show an overall association and other IL23R variants led to minor changes in the risk of CD, rs1343151 and/or rs7517847 variants in the IL-23R gene strongly reduced the risk of developing CD at both allelic and genotype levels. A significantly decreased risk of first diagnosis of childhood CD was observed in individuals carrying the A allele of rs1343151, or between 17-40 y in individuals carrying the G allele in rs7517847 of IL-23R. A significantly decreased risk of ileocolonic or structuring disease was observed in individuals carrying the A allele in either rs11209026 or rs1343151, or the G allele in rs7517847 of IL-23R, and when such individuals did develop the disease, they were unlikely to require a bowel resection. Certain haplotypes very strongly modified risk. There was evidence for interactions of IL-23R variants with the NOD2 wild-type (d/d) genotype. Down-regulating the function of the IL-23R gene may decrease CD risk in the normal population.},

   abstract = {The Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT)-Janus kinase (JAK) pathway controls signal transduction between cell surface receptors and the nucleus. Two members of that pathway, STAT3 and JAK2, enhanced the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) in recent genome-wide association studies. We replicated these findings in a New Zealand Caucasian case-control cohort, by genotyping two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in STAT3 (rs744166(G>A) and rs3816769(C>T)) and rs10758669(A>C) in JAK2, in 302 CD patients and 382 controls. For STAT3, there was a significant decrease in the frequency of the G allele of rs744166 and the C allele of rs3816769 in CD patients as compared with controls (OR=0.76, 95% CI=0.61-0.95, p=0.013; OR=0.71, 95% CI=0.56-0.89, p=0.003). For the JAK2 rs10758669 polymorphism, the homozygous C/C or heterozygous A/C genotypes increased the risk of having CD as compared with the homozygous A/A (OR=1.76, 95% CI=1.26-2.45 and OR=2.36, 95% CI=1.44-3.86, respectively, p=0.0003). Variant alleles in either gene significantly modified the likelihood of inflammatory disease in a colonic location, and of developing extra-intestinal manifestations. The JAK2 variant also strongly enhanced the risk of ileocolonic disease, with stricturing or ileal/stricturing behaviour, requiring a bowel resection. We further studied a subset of our control population, stratified for JAK2 rs10758669 and/or STAT3 rs3816769 genotype. Carrying either the JAK2 or STAT3 IBD risk allele was associated with significantly enhanced susceptibility to DNA damage, as estimated by comet assays in peripheral blood leukocytes, with or without a subsequent oxidative challenge. That is, both risk alleles enhance genomic instability. The JAK2 SNP is part of a haplotype previously associated with enhanced susceptibility to myeloproliferative neoplasms, but functional consequences of the STAT3 variant had not been previously demonstrated. It will be of interest to follow up CD patients carrying either JAK2 or STAT3 risk alleles for development of further secondary effects, including cancer.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) comprising Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions with polygenic susceptibility. Interactions between TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha receptor play a fundamental role in inflammatory response. This study investigates the role that selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the TNF-alpha receptor (TNSFRSF1B) gene play in the risk of IBD in a New Zealand Caucasian population. DNA samples from 388 CD, 405 UC, 27 indeterminate colitis patients, and 293 randomly selected controls, from Canterbury, New Zealand were screened for 3 common SNPs in TNSFRSF1B: rs1061622 (c.676T > C), rs1061624 (c.*1663A > G), and rs3397 (c.*1690T > C), using TaqMan technologies. Carrying the rs1061624 variant decreased the risk of UC in the left colon (OR 0.73, 95% CI = 0.54-1.00) and of being a smoker at diagnosis (OR 0.62; 95% CI = 0.40-0.96). Carrying the rs3397 variant decreased the risk of penetrating CD (OR 0.62, 95% CI = 0.40-0.95). Three marker haplotype analyses revealed highly significant differences between CD patients and control subjects (chi(2) = 29.9, df = 7, P = .0001) and UC cases and controls (chi(2) = 46.3, df = 7, P < .0001). We conclude that carrying a 3-marker haplotype in the TNSFRSF1B gene may increase (e.g., haplotype of GGC was 2.9-fold more in the CD or UCpatients) or decrease (e.g., TGT was 0.47-fold less in UC patients) the risk of IBD in a New Zealand Caucasian population.},

   abstract = {The Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are debilitating conditions, characterised by lifelong sensitivity to certain foods, and often a need for surgery and life-long medication. The anti-inflammatory effects of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated acids justify their inclusion in enteral nutrition formulas that have been associated with disease remission. However, there have been variable data in clinical trials to test supplementary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in inducing or maintaining remission in these diseases. Although variability in trial design has been suggested as a major factor, we suggest that variability in processing and presentation of the products may be equally or more important. The nature of the source, and rapidity of getting the fish or other food source to processing or to market, will affect the percentage of the various fatty acids, possible presence of heavy metal contaminants and oxidation status of the various fatty acids. For dietary supplements or fortified foods, whether the product is encapsulated or not, whether storage is under nitrogen or not, and length of time between harvest, processing and marketing will again profoundly affect the properties of the final product. Clinical trials to test efficacy of these products in IBD to date have utilised the relevant skills of pharmacology and gastroenterology. We suggest that knowledge from food science, nutrition and engineering will be essential to establish the true role of this important group of compounds in these diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is a multifactorial disease where resistance to apoptosis is one major defect. Also, dietary fat intake has been shown to modulate disease activity. We aimed to explore the interaction between four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in apoptotic genes and dietary fat intake in modulating disease activity in CD patients. METHODS: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) techniques were used to analyze Caspase9+93C/T, FasLigand-843C/T, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma+161C/T and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma Pro12Ala SNPs in 99 patients with CD and 116 healthy controls. Interactions between SNPs and fat intake in modulating disease activity were analyzed using regression analysis. RESULTS: None of the polymorphisms analyzed influenced disease susceptibility and/or activity, but a high intake of total, saturated and monounsaturated fats and a higher ratio of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFA), was associated with a more active phenotype (p < 0.05). We observed that the detrimental effect of a high intake of total and trans fat was more marked in wild type carriers of the Caspase9+93C/T polymorphism [O.R(95%CI) 4.64(1.27-16.89) and O.R(95%CI) 4.84(1.34-17.50)]. In the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma Pro12Ala SNP, we also observed that a high intake of saturated and monounsaturated fat was associated to a more active disease in wild type carriers [OR(95%CI) 4.21(1.33-13.26) and 4.37(1.52-12.51)]. Finally, a high intake of n-6 PUFA was associated with a more active disease in wild type carriers for the FasLigand-843C/T polymorphism [O.R(95%CI) 5.15(1.07-24.74)]. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to disclose a synergism between fat intake and SNPs in apoptotic genes in modulating disease activity in CD patients.},

Microspheres are currently being assessed as scaffolds for tissue engineering and drug delivery devices. The aim of this study was to produce anti-TNF-alpha antibody-encapsulated microspheres using thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) and to characterize their behavior. METHODS: Anti-TNF-alpha antibody was encapsulated into the microspheres (100 mg infliximab/g poly[lactide-co-glycolide] w/w) using a novel technique combining a vibration encapsulator unit with a TIPS process, using either lyophilized particulate antibody or an aqueous solution of antibody. Microspheres were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline for collection of supernatant and assessment of degradation. The amount and biological activity of the encapsulated antibody released from the microspheres was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and its ability to neutralize recombinant human (rh)TNF-alpha in vitro with a cytotoxicity assay. An in vitro wound scratch assay was used to assess the effect of released antibody on fibroblast migration. Ultrastructural characteristics of the different microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Highly porous microspheres released anti-TNF-alpha antibody under zero-order kinetics and inhibited the cytotoxic activity of rhTNF-alpha, producing a significant increase in cell viability compared with cells treated with rhTNF-alpha alone. This effect was most pronounced with microspheres fabricated by blending lyophilized particulate anti-TNF-alpha antibody into the polymer solution, which also significantly reduced the release of lactate dehydrogenase. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF-alpha antibody encapsulated into highly porous microspheres was released in a controlled manner and exhibited biological activity against TNF-alpha. The technique used to produce TIPS microspheres is rapid and provides high encapsulation efficiency. This technique could also be applied to other therapeutic peptides where rapid fabrication and high yields are required.},

This small intestinal mucosal disorder is gluten-dependent and causes nutrient malabsorption, often with diarrhea and weight loss. Diagnosis depends on detection of typical biopsy changes in the proximal small bowel along with an unequivocal response to a gluten-free diet. Recurrent changes usually result from poor adherence to the gluten-free diet, sometimes intentional, or from consumption of unsuspected gluten sources. In others, the original diagnosis may not be correct (e.g., duodenal involvement with Crohn's disease) or another cause for symptoms may have supervened (e.g., collagenous colitis, functional bowel disease). Rarely, a complication may occur (e.g., collagenous sprue, lymphoma). In some, the gluten-dependent nature of the small bowel disorder was not initially documented and biopsy changes continued despite a gluten-free diet. These have a sprue-like intestinal disorder, also labeled unclassified sprue. This represents a small, but likely, heterogeneous group, and in these, intractable symptoms may be present and, in some, lymphoma is eventually diagnosed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase regulates cell growth, survival, and differentiation in several tissues, but its role in the gastrointestinal tract has not been reported. We tested the hypothesis that ErbB4 promotes intestinal cell survival and restitution following injury or inflammation. METHODS: ErbB4 expression in human inflammatory bowel disease was determined by immunohistochemistry. Mice were subjected to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 3%) colitis or injected with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and ErbB4 expression was quantified by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Cultured young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells were exposed to TNF, and ErbB4 messenger RNA, protein, and phosphorylation levels were measured. Cells transfected with ErbB4 small interfering RNA (siRNA), or over expressing ErbB4, were subjected to wound healing and apoptosis assays. RESULTS: ErbB4 levels increased in Crohn's colitis and the colon epithelium of mice with DSS colitis or injected with TNF. In YAMC cells, TNF induced ErbB4 messenger RNA, protein, and phosphorylation; nuclear factor kappaB activation also stimulated ErbB4 accumulation. ErbB4 siRNA sensitized cells to TNF-stimulated apoptosis, while over expression blocked apoptosis induced by TNF plus cycloheximide. Additionally, ErbB4 siRNA decreased YAMC cell wound healing. ErbB4 knockdown attenuated, while over expression elevated, phosphorylation of Akt in response to TNF. Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascade reversed the ability of ErbB4 over expression to protect from cytokine-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: ErbB4 expression and signaling are key elements for TNF responses in vivo and in cell culture, protecting intestinal epithelial cells from apoptosis in the inflammatory environment, possibly through Akt activation.},

METHODS: Sixty-one adolescents (mean age 15 years, SD+/-4.13) were included in the study. Intestinal biopsies from inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa of IBD patients and from controls with functional abdominal pain were cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The number of microbes belonging to the same group was calculated per weight of collected tissue. The mucus thickness in frozen samples was measured under a fluorescent microscope. RESULTS: The ratios of different bacterial groups in inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa of IBD patients and controls were specific for particular diseases. Streptococcus spp. were predominant in the inflamed mucosa of Crohn's disease (CD) patients (80% of all bacteria), and Lactobacillus spp. were predominant in ulcerative colitis patients (90%). The differences were statistically significant (P=0.01-0.001). Lower number of bifidobacteria was observed in the whole IBD group. A relation was also found between clinical and endoscopic severity and decreased numbers of Lactobacillus and, to a lesser extent, of Streptococcus in biopsies from CD patients. The mucus layer in the inflamed sites was significantly thinner as compared to controls (P=0.0033) and to non-inflamed areas in IBD patients (P=0.031). CONCLUSION: The significantly thinner mucosa of IBD patients showed a predominance of some aerobes specific for particular diseases, their numbers decreased in relation to higher clinical and endoscopic activity of the disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomized, placebo controlled trials are used to assess the efficacy of therapies for Crohn's disease. The placebo response and remission rates vary among studies. AIM: To analyse how the placebo response and remission rates in Crohn's trials have changed over time in the era of parenteral biologic therapies. METHODS: A search for randomized, placebo-controlled trials of parenteral biologic therapies for active Crohn's disease was conducted using online databases. The placebo response and remission rates and study week of evaluation were recorded for each trial. The placebo response and remission rates were analysed as functions of publication date and study week of evaluation. RESULTS: The odds of a placebo-induced remission and response significantly increased as the week of evaluation increased. The placebo remission rate increased significantly with year of publication. Adjusted for week of evaluation, this increase in placebo remission rate over time was no longer significant. The increase in the placebo response over this time period was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The observed increase in placebo remission rates over time in trials of parenteral biologic therapies in Crohn's disease is explained by longer times to the primary endpoint in more recent trials.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nutritional deficiency is prevalent in developing countries but should also be considered in developed countries in the setting of genetic or acquired disease states. The skin is commonly involved and is often one of the first organs affected in nutritional deficiency, providing a key to the diagnosis. This article will review the most common nutritional deficiencies causing a periorificial and/or acrodermatitis: zinc deficiency, biotin deficiency, kwashiorkor, and essential fatty acid deficiency. RECENT FINDINGS: Whereas older literature has focused on the relationship among nutritional deficiency, malnutrition and poverty, recent research has identified additional patient populations that are at risk for developing nutritional deficiencies. These populations include premature infants, patients with long-term total parenteral nutrition, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, intestinal bypass procedures, chronic alcoholics, anorexia nervosa, and restrictive diets. Recent studies have also focused on further understanding the genetic basis of inherited nutritional deficiencies such as acrodermatitis enteropathica. SUMMARY: Skin manifestations can lead a provider to the diagnosis of a nutritional deficiency. In a child with a periorificial or acral dermatitis, the diagnosis of zinc, biotin, protein, or essential fatty acid deficiency should be considered, especially if accompanied by systemic signs of failure to thrive.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) affect bone metabolism and are frequently associated with the presence of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. Although several mechanisms may contribute to skeletal abnormalities in IBD patients, inflammation and inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 may be the most critical. It is not clear whether the changes in bone metabolism leading to decreased mineral density are the result of decreased bone formation, increased bone resorption, or both, with varying results reported in experimental models of IBD and in pediatric and adult IBD patients. New data, including our own, challenge the conventional views, and contributes to the unraveling of an increasingly complex network of interactions leading to the inflammation-associated bone loss. Since nutritional interventions (dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation) are of limited efficacy in IBD patients, understanding the pathophysiology of osteopenia and osteoporosis in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is critical for the correct choice of available treatments or the development of new targeted therapies. In this review, we discuss current concepts explaining the effects of inflammation, inflammatory mediators and their signaling effectors on calcium and phosphate homeostasis, osteoblast and osteoclast function, and the potential limitations of vitamin D used as an immunomodulator and anabolic hormone in IBD.},

In that sense, rosemary extracts have long been recognized as having antioxidant properties, and folic acid may be able to improve endothelial progenitor cell function. A mixture containing both has been tested as a possible nutraceutical to improve health complications in diabetes. We have developed the methodology to evaluate metabolic changes in the urine of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats after supplementing their diet with rosemary extract obtained with supercritical fluids (SFE) containing 10% folic acid in an acute but short-term study. It has been done with a metabolomics approach using LC-QTOF as an analytical tool. About 20 endogenous metabolites have been identified by databases and MS/MS showing statistically significant changes. Among them, several amino acids and their metabolites point to changes due to the effect of the gut microbiota. In addition, the comparison between control and streptozotocin-diabetic rats has permitted the showing of some metabolic coincidences between type 1 diabetes and other (possible) autoimmune diseases such as autism and/or Crohn's disease, and the nutraceutical intervention has succeeded in inducing changes in such biomarkers.},

METHODS: Clinical data of 62 adult patients with active CD treated with EN and TWP in combination (n = 42) or TWP alone (n = 20) from March 2001 to September 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. All the patients had a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) > 150 and < 450. In TWP group, subjects received TWP tablets (1.0 - 1.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) with uncontrolled diets; while in the group of combination therapy, the patients were given total enteral nutrition (TEN) through tube feeding in addition to TWP tablets. Clinical response was defined by a decrease of at least 70 points in the CDAI from baseline after treatment, and clinical remission was defined as the absolute value of CDAI (less than 150). Patients' nutritional and disease activity index, such as CDAI score, C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), were determined at 0, 4, and 12 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: The ratio of clinical response (78.6% vs. 40.0%, P = 0.003) and clinical remission (69.1% vs. 30.0%, P = 0.004) were both significantly higher in the combined treatment group than in those the TWP group at week 4. At week 12, the clinical response ratio was significantly higher in the combined treatment group (90.5% vs. 65.0%, P = 0.014); the remission ratio was also higher in the combined treatment group (76.2% vs. 55.0%, P = 0.091). The nutritional parameters improved from baseline at week 4 and 12 in the combined treatment group but not in TWP group. At week 4, blood albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin levels was higher in the combined treatment group than those in TWP group (P < 0.05); at week 12, patients in combined treatment group also had significantly higher body mass index (BMI), blood albumin, prealbumin, transferrin and hemoglobin levels (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with enteral nutrition and TWP in combination are superior to TWP alone for induction of clinical response and remission in adult Crohn's Disease. This strategy also improves patient's nutritional status and avoids the adverse effects of traditional therapy.},

   abstract = {Growth impairment and associated pubertal delay are common complications of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn's disease (CD). Chronic undernutrition (related primarily to inadequate intake) and pro-inflammatory cytokines are the two major and interrelated contributory factors. Pathogenic mechanisms include interference with growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis, with gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion patterns, and direct cytokine effects on growing bone. Chronic corticosteroid therapy compounds disease-related causes of growth impairment. The influence on growth of polymorphisms in IBD susceptibility or modifier genes is under study. Accurate recognition of impaired growth requires appreciation of normal growth. Pre-illness standard deviation scores (SDS) for height should be obtained and compared with height SDS at diagnosis, so that the impact of disease on growth can be fully appreciated. The greater the deficit prior to recognition of IBD, the greater is the demand for catch-up growth. Height velocity should be regularly monitored and its adequacy for age and pubertal stage assessed. Restoration and maintenance of pre-illness growth pattern indicate success of therapy. Current treatment regimens limit use of corticosteroids, via optimization of immunomodulatory drugs, use of enteral nutrition in CD, and, if necessary, surgery for ulcerative colitis and for intestinal complications of localized CD. Biologic agents with the potential for mucosal healing hold promise of growth enhancement even among children, whose growth with previously available therapies remained compromised. For all therapies, there is a window of opportunity to achieve normal growth before puberty is too advanced.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It has yet to be established whether the manifestations of IBD are similar in paediatric and adult ages. The objective of this study was to compare the phenotypic expression of the disease between patients with childhood-onset IBD and adulthood-onset cases, all afferent to the same clinical centre. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Descriptive and multivariate analyses were completed on retrospective and prospective data of paediatric-onset and adult-onset consecutive cases who were diagnosed and followed at the same tertiary referral hospital of the University of Padua, Italy, during a period of 14 years (1994-2008). Paediatric-onset patients were further divided into age brackets (0-5, 6-12, and 13-17 year-olds). Analyses were conducted using the SAS package, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). RESULTS: Three hundred twelve patients were analysed. At disease onset, the manifestations which were more frequent among the 133 paediatric patients (50.4% with diagnosis of Crohn disease [CD], 43.6% with ulcerative colitis, and 6% with unclassified IBD) with respect to the adult-onset patients were perianal disease (12.8%) (P < 0.0001) and extraintestinal manifestations (14.3%) (P = 0.043). Among the 179 adult patients (55.3% with diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, 36.3% with CD, and 8.3% with unclassified IBD) instead, severe abdominal pain (P = 0.008), diarrhoea (P = 0.005), and anorexia (P < 0.0001) were more frequently observed. During the follow-up, the presence of extraintestinal manifestations (50.4%) (P = 0.005) and perianal disease (44.8% of the patients with childhood-onset CD) (P = 0.006) was observed more often in the paediatric-onset group. CONCLUSIONS: In our cases, the phenotypic expression of IBD developing in paediatric age differs from that seen in adults.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to study the interaction between genetic polymorphisms (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and fat intake on the risk of developing Crohn's disease (CD) or modifying disease activity. METHODS: Seven SNPs in interleukin 1 (IL1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), lymphotoxin alpha (LTalpha), and IL6 genes were analyzed in 116 controls and 99 patients with CD. The type of fat intake was evaluated, and the interaction between SNPs and dietary fat in modulating disease activity was analyzed. RESULTS: Individuals who were homozygous for the IL6-174G/C polymorphism had a six-fold higher risk for CD (odds ratio (OR)=6.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.9-19.4), whereas the TT genotype on the TNFalpha-857C/T polymorphism was associated with more active disease (OR=10.4; 95% CI=1.1-94.1). A high intake of total, saturated, and monounsaturated fats, as well as a higher ratio of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), was associated with a more active phenotype (P<0.05). Furthermore, there was an interaction between dietary fat intake and SNPs, with a high intake of saturated and monounsaturated fats being associated with active disease, mainly in patients carrying the variant alleles of the 857 TNFalpha polymorphism (OR=6.0, 95% CI=1.4-26.2; OR=5.17; 95% CI=1.4-19.2, respectively) and the 174 IL6 polymorphism (OR=2.95; 95% CI=1.0-9.1; OR=3.21; 95% CI=1.0-10.4, respectively). Finally, low intake of n-3 PUFA and high n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in patients with the TNFalpha 857 polymorphism were associated with higher disease activity (OR=3.6; 95% CI=1.0-13.0; OR=5.92; 95% CI=1.3-26.5, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that different types of fat may interact with cytokine genotype, modulating disease activity.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis is an important pathogen that causes Johne's disease in animals and has been implicated in Crohn's disease in man yet few data exist on its physiological adaptation in either the host or the environment. In this study, the proteomic responses of the two distinct strains of M. a. paratuberculosis, cattle (C) and sheep (S), to hypoxia and starvation were studied in vitro. Nutrient starvation inhibited growth of both strains and was lethal for S strain after 12 weeks. Hypoxia induced a state of very low metabolic activity but rapid resuscitation occurred upon restoration of an aerobic atmosphere, consistent with the dormancy response of other mycobacteria. A total of 55 protein spots differentially expressed in response to starvation and/or hypoxic stress in one or both strains were identified from 2D gels and classified based on biological function. Antioxidant enzymes, oxidoreducatse enzymes and proteins involved in amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, ATP and purine biosynthesis, proteolysis, cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, signal recognition and hypothetical proteins with putative functions including dormancy response regulators and universal stress proteins were identified. These proteins are potential screening targets for future diagnosis, prevention and control of M. a. paratuberculosis infection and their identification will assist understanding the pathogenesis of diseases caused by this organism.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enterocutaneous fistulae (ECFs) present a difficult management problem and can cause significant morbidity. The aim of the study was to assess the outcome of these patients. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all patients with ECF managed at a tertiary centre between 1996 and 2006 was performed. Demographic, management and outcome data including ECF closure, morbidity and mortality were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients (17 male) were identified with ECF (median age: 63 years, range: 27-84). The primary aetiology was Crohn's (30%), anastomotic leak (24%), iatrogenic (18%), mesh (6%), neoplasia (6%) and other (16%). Definitive surgery was undertaken in 21 (64%) at a median of 6.4 months (0.4-72 range) following presentation. Twenty percent of patients required emergency surgical intervention and 5 patients required preoperative total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Surgical management was formal resection and reanastomosis in all patients, with a mean operative time of 4.75 h (standard deviation = 1.8). The median hospital stay for the operative group was 19 days (7-85). Four patients required post-operative TPN with one patient requiring home TPN. Fistula closure rate was 97% (operative group: 21 out of 21; non-operative group: 11 out of 12). Mean follow-up was 37.3 months (0.5-217). Six (19%) operative patients developed fistula recurrence. There were two deaths at 2 and 5 months (fistula aetiology malignant colonic fistula and radiation enteritis, respectively). CONCLUSION: Patients with ECF can be treated with low morbidity and low recurrence rate in a multidisciplinary setting. We believe that patients with ECF should be referred to specialist units for management.},

Profiling technologies such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabonomics at the interface of the host's genetic make-up and its metabolic phenotype are implemented to identify cellular and molecular targets to develop novel hypothesise with respect to the functional role of diet and gut bacteria in modulating chronic degenerative diseases including inflammatory bowel disease.},

Selected probiotics strains have been proven to be clinically effective in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. None of the probiotics thus far tested has been shown to be effective in induction of remission or in maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease. The multispecies probiotics mixture of 8 strains seems effective in the maintenance of remission in pouchitis. Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional bowel disorder manifested by chronic, recurring abdominal pain or discomfort associated with disturbed bowel habit in the absence of structural abnormalities likely to account for these symptoms. Recently conducted appropriately powered studies with different (combinations of) probiotics show positive results on reduction of symptoms, although a considerable placebo effect is also found. Mechanistic studies aimed at pathophysiological mechanisms of inflammatory bowel diseases can identify new targets for probiotic bacteria.},

A total of 315 CD patients and 536 controls were recruited through various sources to the Auckland CD Risk Factor Study. As well as demographic characteristics, the self-reported questionnaire included (1) smoking and drinking alcohol, (2) breastfeeding in infancy, (3) early life exposures to allergens and microbes, (4) health conditions lasting 6 months or longer and (5) taking antibiotics and any medications. There was strong evidence for familial associations of the disease, and minor effects of birth order and number of siblings. Being a smoker, especially over a long time period, and exposure to smoking during childhood and adolescence periods increased risk, whereas drinking alcohol at least once per week showed a slight protective effect. Long term use of the oral contraceptive pill increased the risk of developing CD, but breastfeeding and immunisation during infancy showed no significant association. Long term and debilitating illness (lasting 6 months or more), taking antibiotics prior to developing CD, or taking four or more antibiotics or any regular medication in a year during adolescence substantially increased the CD risk. Having a pet during childhood was a protective factor, but regularly feeding an animal was not sufficient to protect. Many of these significant factors are likely to impact on the colonic microflora and/or immune system. We conclude that, in addition to strong evidence for genetic associations, factors likely to impact on immune response or reduce early exposure to microbes provide a main risk factor for CD in this New Zealand population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genetic variations that affect innate immunity increase risk of ileal Crohn's disease (CD). However, the penetrance of susceptibility genes, including NOD2, is low, suggesting additional risk factors. Neutralizing autoantibodies (Ab) against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF Ab) reduce neutrophil antimicrobial function in patients with primary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). We investigated whether GM-CSF Ab regulates neutrophil function in CD. METHODS: Serum samples from 354 adult and pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were analyzed for GM-CSF Ab and IBD markers. Levels of GM-CSF Ab were compared with patients' CD features and neutrophil function. Intestinal barrier function and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced injury were assessed in GM-CSF-null and NOD2-null mice. RESULTS: Median GM-CSF Ab levels increased from 0.4 microg/mL in control serum to 2.4 microg/mL in pediatric CD and 11.7 microg/mL in adult CD serum and were associated with ileal involvement (P<.001). Ileal location, duration of disease, and increased GM-CSF Ab levels were associated with stricturing/penetrating behavior (odds ratio, 2.2; P=.018). The positive and negative predictive values of GM-CSF Ab for stricturing/penetrating behavior were comparable with that of other IBD serum markers. CD patients with increased GM-CSF Ab had reduced neutrophil phagocytic capacity and increased accumulation of pSTAT3+ neutrophils in the affected ileum. GM-CSF-null mice and NOD2-null mice in which GM-CSF was neutralized had defects in mucosal barrier function and developed a transmural ileitis following NSAID exposure. CONCLUSIONS: GM-CSF regulates ileal homeostasis in CD and in mouse models. CD patients with increases in serum GM-CSF Ab might benefit from GM-CSF administration.},

   abstract = {There has been a continual evolution of therapy for Crohn's disease (CD) over the past decade since the introduction of biological therapies targeting tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Conventional agents continue to be safe and effective for patients with mild to moderately active CD and, in population series, less than half of the patients with CD require corticosteroid therapy. In contrast, patients presenting at young ages, those with extensive disease, deep ulcerations, transmural complications or extraintestinal complications that require corticosteroid therapy have a poor prognosis. Introduction of immunosuppressives late in the course or for patients with steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory disease have not changed the 'natural history' of CD or the need for eventual surgical resections. There is increasing evidence that early intervention with immunosuppressives or biologic agents at the same time as corticosteroids, or biologic agents targeting tumor necrosis factor or adhesion molecules, can have rapid and prolonged benefits, including steroid sparing, reductions in hospitalizations and, perhaps, reductions in the need for surgery. Treatment should be optimized according to the patient status and response with whichever level of therapy is introduced and maintained.},

   abstract = {One decade after the emergence of biologic therapy for Crohn's disease (CD), our treatment algorithms are beginning to change. Once reserved for patients with refractory disease, disease unresponsive to conventional therapies, or those requiring multiple courses of corticosteroids, there is increasing evidence that early, aggressive interventions with immunosuppressants or biologic therapies targeting tumor necrosis factor-alpha or alpha-4 integrins can alter the natural history of CD by reducing the transmural complications of structuring and fistulization and the nearly inevitable requisite for surgical resections. More recent trials are beginning to suggest that intervention with combination therapy for selected patients with a poor prognosis may modify the long-term course of CD. Selection of patients with features predicting a complex or progressive course and early, combined intervention is now possible. Future studies are still needed to best identify predictors of response to individual agents with differing mechanisms of action, as well as to optimize the risk-benefit of long-term maintenance therapy.},

Early observational series suggested a benefit in the setting of severe, hospitalized patients. However, the recent completion of two large multi-center, double-blind placebo-controlled trials confirmed a role for infliximab for outpatients with refractory, moderate-severe disease with evidence for clinical remissions, mucosal healing, and a reduction in colectomies. Despite this evidence, there are numerous questions remaining regarding the optimal positioning in the setting of moderate-severe disease, potential benefits of concomitant immune suppression and the need for maintenance treatment after induction therapy. Additional clinical trials have demonstrated a less profound benefit for adalimumab at similar doses that are used in Crohn's disease. Other biological agents that have targeted T cells such as visiluzimab and abatacept were not demonstrated to be effective in controlled trials.},

   abstract = {Underweight and specific nutrient deficiencies are frequent in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In addition, a significant number of children with IBD, especially Crohn's disease (CD) have impaired linear growth. Nutrition has an important role in the management of IBD. In adults with CD, enteral nutrition (EN) is effective in inducing clinical remission of IBD, although it is less efficient than corticosteroids. Exclusive EN is an established primary therapy for pediatric CD. Limited data suggests that EN is as efficient as corticosteroids for induction of remission. Additional advantages of nutritional therapy are control of inflammation, mucosal healing, positive benefits to growth and overall nutritional status with minimal adverse effects. The available evidence suggests that supplementary EN may be effective also for maintenance of remission in CD. More studies are needed to confirm these findings. However, EN supplementation could be considered as an alternative or as an adjunct to maintenance drug therapy in CD. EN does not have a primary therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis. Specific compositions of enteral diets-elemental diets or diets containing specific components-were not shown to have any advantage over standard polymeric diets and their place in the treatment of CD or UC need further evaluation. Recent theories suggest that diet may be implicated in the etiology of IBD, however there are no proven dietary approaches to reduce the risk of developing IBD.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Osteonecrosis (ON) of the femoral head can lead to femoral head collapse, necessitating total hip replacement. Reports of patients suffering from both ON and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) have prompted us to evaluate the relationship between ON and IBD, especially Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. METHODS: A review of the data from three new cases, along with data from all the published cases of patients presenting ON and IBD found through a systematic search of the Pub Med database. RESULTS: We encountered some diagnostic problems: The ON diagnosis could not be confirmed in some patients who did not meet the ON diagnostic criteria. Reviewed data was too weak to assess the exact incidence of ON in IBD. Corticosteroid therapy, especially in high dose regimens, is likely the most important etiological factor. No evidence supporting other physiopathological hypothesis, such as total parenteral nutrition, osteoporosis, or coagulation disorders, was found. Finally, the multifocal form of ON appears particularly common in IBD, with some patients presenting multiple lesions of the hip, shoulder, knee and talus. CONCLUSIONS: ON in IBD, which is frequently multifocal, appears to be a complication of corticosteroid therapy, especially when high doses are used. We recommend regular ON checkups for corticosteroid-treated IBD patients.},

   abstract = {75% of hospital patients with Crohn's disease (CD) suffer from malnutrition and one third of CD patients have a body mass index below 20. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients have many vitamin and nutrient deficiencies which can lead to important consequences such as hyperhomocysteinemia which is associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic disease. Nutritional deficiencies in IBD patients are the result of insufficient intake, malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy as well as the metabolic distubances directly induced by the chronic disease and its treatments, in particular corticosteroids. Screening for nutritional deficiencies in chronic disease patients is warranted. Managing the deficiencies involves simple nutritional guidelines, vitamin supplements, and nutritional support in the worst cases, in particular in children in order to limit the impact of IBD on growth. In active CD, enteral nutrition is the first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been extensively studied. However, the use of probiotics and prebiotics is poorly documented, despite evidence of efficacy of particular probiotic strains in specific forms of IBD. METHODS: A case-control study comprising interviewer-administered questionnaires was conducted in IBD patients and healthy controls. Data regarding use and knowledge of probiotics and prebiotics, demographic, and clinical information were collected. RESULTS: In total, 334 participants (234 IBD, 100 controls) were interviewed. Significantly more IBD patients than controls had ever used probiotics to manage their health (Crohn's disease [CD] 43%, ulcerative colitis [UC] 51%, controls 21%, P < 0.001). Prebiotic use was negligible. On logistic regression analysis, having UC (odds ratio [OR] 4.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.27-8.12) or CD (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.66-5.60) were the strongest predictors of probiotic use. Within IBD patients the strongest predictor of probiotic use was current steroid use (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.11-5.18). IBD patients had greater probiotic knowledge scores than controls (P = 0.003), although 20% of IBD probiotic users could not provide a definition of a probiotic. Less than half of IBD probiotic users discussed probiotic use with healthcare professionals, with commercial advertising being the primary source of information. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD use probiotics to manage their health but frequently choose strains without evidence of efficacy in IBD. Patients rely on nonclinical sources of information and often do not disclose probiotic use to healthcare professionals. Conventional healthcare providers should inquire about probiotic use among their patients and offer evidence-based advice.},

   abstract = {Johne's disease is chronic inflammation of the intestine caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. Infection and disease are mainly in domestic livestock but can affect many species including primates. Johne's is a new disease which emerged at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and principally involved Europe and North America. It has since spread to former low incidence regions to become a global problem. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammation of the intestine in humans which emerged in Europe and North America mid 20th century and increased to become a major healthcare problem. It has now spread to former low incidence regions. Infected animals shed Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis in milk and into the environment. Human populations are widely exposed. Outcomes maybe influenced by microbial phenotype. Exposure to extracellular forms of these pathogens may confer some natural protection; exposure to intracellular forms which have passaged through milk macrophages or environmental protists may pose a greater threat to humans particularly individuals with an inherited or acquired susceptibility. Hot spots of human disease such as in Winnipeg which sits on rock at the junction of two rivers may result from local exposure to high levels of waterborne pathogens brought down from farmland. When appropriate methods are used most people with Crohn's disease are found to be infected. There are no data which demonstrate that these pathogens are harmless to humans. An overwhelming balance of probability and Public health risk favours the conclusion that Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis is also pathogenic for people. A two tier co-operative pathogenic mechanism is proposed in Crohn's disease. Intracellular infection with the primary pathogen widely distributed throughout the gut causes an immune dysregulation and a specific chronic enteric neuropathy with loss of mucosal integrity. Segments of gross inflammatory disease result from the perturbed neuroimmune response to penetration into the gut wall of secondary pathogens from the lumen. These include both normal gut organisms and educated members of the enteric microbiome such as more aggressive E. coli. More new diseases may arise from failure to apply a range of remedial measures to this longstanding zoonotic problem.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition has been used over many years as a therapy to try and achieve a remission in adults and children presenting with acute Crohn's disease. Despite its reported efficacy at achieving clinical responses in excess of 80% in some case series, it has not been taken up widely as a first-line therapy. This is, at least in part, due to the lack of a large prospective randomised study. METHODS: The literature is replete with small case series and anecdotal reports from units who use this therapy. Recent literature is reviewed on efficacy, application, composition and potential mechanisms of action of this therapy. RESULTS: Although the evidence base remains quite limited, further data are available that suggest a clear benefit of exclusive enteral nutrition as an efficacious alternative to steroid therapy at inducing a clinical remission in Crohn's disease. Certain sub-groups are likely to benefit more, with potential benefits on growth making it particularly useful in adolescents and growing young adults. Given the lack of side effects compared to the alternative of steroid therapy, along with the clear nutritional benefits of this therapy, it remains an obvious choice for patients presenting with Crohn's disease and a degree of malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: This therapy should remain a first-line therapy for children and adults presenting with mild to moderate Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls. DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4 patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20 IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P = 0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7 ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400 microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis should be explored further.},

This article aims to detail QOL in a cohort of Australian children with CD in relation to disease duration, disease activity, and treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : QOL, assessed using the IMPACT-III questionnaire, and disease activity measures, assessed using the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), were available in 41 children with CD. For this cohort, a total of 186 measurements of both parameters were available. RESULTS: : QOL was found to be significantly lower, and disease activity significantly higher (F = 31.1, P = 0.00), in patients within 6 months of their diagnosis compared with those up to 2.5 years, up to 5 years, and beyond 5 years since diagnosis. Higher disease activity was associated with poorer QOL (r = -0.51, P = 0.00). Total QOL was highest in children on nil medications and lowest in children on enteral nutrition. The PCDAI (t = -6.0, P = 0.00) was a significant predictor of QOL, with the clinical history (t = -6.9, P = 0.00) and examination (t = -2.9, P = 0.01) sections of the PCDAI significantly predicting QOL. Disease duration, age, or sex was neither related to nor significant predictors of QOL, but height z score and type of treatment approached significance. CONCLUSIONS: : Children with CD within 6 months of their diagnosis have impaired QOL compared with those diagnosed beyond 6 months. These patients, along with those with growth impairment, ongoing elevated disease activity with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and/or perirectal and extraintestinal complications, may benefit from regular assessments of QOL as part of their clinical treatment.},

   abstract = {There is evidence to suggest that the inflammation associated with Crohn's disease (CD) impacts the bone health of patients, predisposing them to early onset osteoporosis and increasing their risk of fracture. Fractures have been documented in patients with CD, with a high proportion of these being found during young adulthood, which suggests that these patients are not simply fracturing as a result of the normal aging process but rather due to the presence of CD. In population terms, patients with CD have increased risk of fracture compared with the general population. Studies in children suggest that, irrespective of time on corticosteroid therapy, the underlying systemic inflammation associated with CD is an independent detrimental influence on the bone health of children with CD. This poses the question as to whether the onset of disease in childhood predisposes the individual to increased risk of future fractures later in life, as a result of decreased peak bone mass during the growing years. It is generally believed that dual energy x-ray absorptiometry-assessed areal bone mineral density is a good indicator of fracture risk; however, several studies have shown this may not be the case. New research, utilizing peripheral quantitative computed tomography, which provides a true volumetric assessment of bone, suggests altered bone geometry in patients with CD, which poses a structural threat by being more brittle and susceptible to damage accumulation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clinical results of bone mineral density for children with inflammatory bowel disease are commonly reported using reference data for chronological age. It is known that these children, particularly those with Crohn disease, experience delayed growth and maturation. Therefore, it is more appropriate to compare clinical results with bone age rather than chronological age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and bone age was assessed using the Tanner-Whitehouse 3 method from a standard hand/wrist radiograph. Results were available for 44 children ages 7.99 to 16.89 years. Areal bone mineral density measurements were converted to z scores using both chronological and bone ages for each subject. RESULTS: Areal bone mineral density z scores calculated using bone age, as opposed to chronological age, were significantly improved for both the total body and lumbar spine regions of interest. When subjects were grouped according to diagnosis, bone age generated z scores remained significantly improved for those with Crohn disease but not for those diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Grouping of children with Crohn disease into younger and older ages produced significantly higher z scores using bone age compared with chronological for the older age group, but not the younger age group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, in accordance with those presented in the literature, suggest that aBMD results in children with Crohn disease should include the consideration of bone age, rather than merely chronological age. Bone size, although not as easily available, would also be an important consideration for interpreting results in paediatric populations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4) years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236), 1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE, it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions are a significant reason for therapeutic failure during thiopurine treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Some smaller series in this patient population have shown that a switch to mercaptopurine may be successful in many cases of azathioprine intolerance. AIM: To assess the long-term outcome of mercaptopurine treatment in a large patient population with azathioprine intolerance. METHODS: We identified 135 patients (74 women; median age 40 years) with Crohn's disease (n = 88) or ulcerative colitis (n = 47) and reviewed their medical records. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients (52%) tolerated mercaptopurine and were followed up for 736 (362-1080) days; 65 patients discontinued mercaptopurine due to adverse events after 25 (8-92) days. Mercaptopurine was tolerated in 71% (12/17) with hepatotoxicity and in 68% (13/19) with arthralgia/myalgia during azathioprine treatment. Previous abdominal surgery was more common in mercaptopurine intolerant patients [39/65 (60%) vs. 27/70 (39%); P = 0.02] and thiopurine methyltransferase activity was higher in mercaptopurine tolerant patients than in mercaptopurine intolerant patients [13.2 (11.4-15.3) vs. 11.8 (9.6-14.2) U/mL red blood cells; P = 0.04; n = 81]. CONCLUSIONS: A trial of mercaptopurine should be considered in azathioprine intolerance, as half of the patients tolerate a switch to mercaptopurine. Patients with hepatotoxicity or arthralgia/myalgia during azathioprine treatment might benefit more often than those with other types of adverse events.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the accuracy of magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) in diagnosing and differentiating pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The secondary aims were to determine the accuracy of MRE in grading disease activity and determine the interobserver agreement for individual MRE parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pediatric patients scheduled to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy, ileocolonoscopy with biopsies, and barium enteroclysis for suspected IBD were included and underwent MRE. MRE images were evaluated by 3 observers. The accuracy of MRE was calculated using the clinical diagnosis based on endoscopic, histopathological, and barium enteroclysis examinations as reference standard. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were available for analysis. IBD was correctly diagnosed in, respectively, 61%, 61%, and 91% of the patients by the 3 observers, with a specificity of 80%, 90%, and 60%. Differentiation between Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was accurately done in, respectively, 67%, 53%, and 80% of patients with CD and 0%, 14%, and 43% of patients with UC. Disease activity was understaged on MRE in the majority of patients. Intraclass correlation coefficients for measurements of bowel thickness were 0.52 (observer 1-2; observer 1-3) and 0.34 (observer 2-3). Interobserver agreement on bowel wall enhancement and stenosis was moderate to good (kappa 0.59, 0.56, and 0.56 and kappa 0.62, 0.32, 0.30, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity and specificity values of MRE for diagnosing pediatric IBD were moderate to good. CD, but not UC, was accurately diagnosed by MRE in a large proportion of patients. Activity was understaged in a large proportion of patients. Interobserver agreement for individual MRE parameters was fair to good.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the multidrug transporter MDR1 have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in different studies. However, the data are highly controversial. Recently, 6 haplotype tagging SNPs (tSNPs), representing the haplotype variations of the MDR1 gene, were identified. The aims of this study were to genotype these variants and correlate them to disease phenotype in New Zealand IBD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 784 IBD patients and 200 healthy subjects were genotyped for 5 tSNPs and the triallelic MDR1 variant G2677T/A using the Sequenom MassArray platform. Furthermore, the effects of these variants were examined in correlation with phenotypic clinical features. RESULTS: Heterozygous carriers for the variants C1236T, rs2235046 (an SNP in intron 16), and G2677T/A showed a lower risk of developing ulcerative colitis (C1236T: odds ratio [OR] = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.42-0.93, P = 0.03; G2677T/A: OR = 0.59, CI = 0.39-0.89, P = 0.02; and rs2235046: OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.38-0.91, P = 0.009) as compared with homozygotes. None of the analyzed markers were associated with Crohn's disease on a genotypic level. Subgroup analysis revealed an association for 2 variants with IBD when stratified for age of onset (C1236T SNP and rs3789243). The MDR1 variant C3435T was associated with disease behavior in CD (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.01-2.08, P = 0.04), whereas the SNP rs3789243 was found to be associated with pancolitis in UC patients (OR = 1.35, CI = 1.00-1.82, P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study support the role of MDR1 as a candidate gene for ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, our results suggest the possibility of a heterozygous advantage for certain MDR1 variants for this disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 1 (NOD1) gene encodes a pattern recognition receptor that senses pathogens, leading to downstream responses characteristic of innate immunity. We investigated the role of NOD1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on IBD risk in a New Zealand Caucasian population, and studied Nod1 expression in response to bacterial invasion in the Caco2 cell line. FINDINGS: DNA samples from 388 Crohn's disease (CD), 405 ulcerative colitis (UC), 27 indeterminate colitis patients and 201 randomly selected controls, from Canterbury, New Zealand were screened for 3 common SNPs in NOD1, using the MassARRAY iPLEX Gold assay. Transcriptional activation of the protein produced by NOD1 (Nod1) was studied after infection of Caco2 cells with Escherichia coli LF82. Carrying the rs2075818 G allele decreased the risk of CD (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.50-0.88, p < 0.002) but not UC. There was an increased frequency of the three SNP (rs2075818, rs2075822, rs2907748) haplotype, CTG (p = 0.004) and a decreased frequency of the GTG haplotype (p = 0.02).in CD. The rs2075822 CT or TT genotypes were at an increased frequency (genotype p value = 0.02), while the rs2907748 AA or AG genotypes showed decreased frequencies in UC (p = 0.04), but not in CD. Functional assays showed that Nod1 is produced 6 hours after bacterial invasion of the Caco2 cell line. CONCLUSION: The NOD1 gene is important in signalling invasion of colonic cells by pathogenic bacteria, indicative of its' key role in innate immunity. Carrying specific SNPs in this gene significantly modifies the risk of CD and/or UC in a New Zealand Caucasian population.},

Emerging evidence, however, now suggests that autophagy can form part of our innate and adaptive immune defense programs. Recent studies have identified pattern recognition molecules as mediators of this process and shown that intracellular pathogens can interact with and even manipulate autophagy. Recent translational evidence has also implicated autophagy in the pathogenesis of several immune-mediated diseases, including Crohn disease. In this review, we present autophagy in the context of its role as an immune system component and effector and speculate on imminent and future research directions in this field.},

   abstract = {Clinicians caring for children with Crohn's disease must consider the long-term implications of therapeutic interventions and cumulative diagnostic studies in their patients whose disease duration will be measured in decades. There is evidence of the increased severity of pediatric Crohn's disease compared to its adult counterpart, its frequent co-morbid growth disturbances, and the frequent need for aggressive medical therapies including immunomodulators and biological agents. The initial management of most children diagnosed with Crohn's disease involves enteral nutritional support, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators. Corticosteroids, while initially helpful in decreasing signs and symptoms of disease, are occasionally ineffective, generally do not heal mucosa, impair growth, and are frequently associated with a state of corticosteroid dependency. Immunomodulators are effective maintenance therapies with corticosteroid sparing effects, but have no value in the acutely ill child. The emergence of biological therapy with its impressive record of rapid efficacy and use as maintenance therapy has prompted discussion of its incorporation into initial management, but has also raised concerns about who are the most suitable candidates, which if any medications can be used concomitantly, and long-term safety. The combined use of thiopurines and anti-TNF agents may predispose to a rare and uniformly fatal lymphoma. Identification of children at high risk for complicated disease may allow us to better evaluate risk/benefit in newly diagnosed children, and biologic agents are likely to assume an increasing role in primary therapy in those deemed at highest risk. Long-term observations will determine whether biologics will change natural history and demonstrate adequate safety.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infliximab therapy has short-term benefits in children with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (CD). We assessed the long-term outcome of infliximab maintenance therapy in children with CD. METHODS: We performed a multicenter cohort study of 729 pediatric patients with CD enrolled in the Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Collaborative Research Group Registry. Children younger than 16 years and newly diagnosed with CD were eligible for this study. Disease and medication information were collected prospectively from the treating physician at diagnosis, 30 days, and quarterly thereafter. No interventions were specified, per protocol. RESULTS: In all, 202 of 729 patients received infliximab: 62%, 23%, and 15% within 1, 1-2, and >2 years of diagnosis, respectively. The mean age at infliximab initiation was 12.7 years. A total of 158 infliximab-treated patients received maintenance therapy, 29 episodic (8 converted to maintenance), and 15 had incomplete follow-up. Among 128 patients administered maintenance infliximab and followed for >or=1 year, concomitant medications at infliximab initiation included corticosteroids (52%) and immunomodulators (90%). By 1, 2, and 3 years, <10% of patients continuing on maintenance infliximab were receiving corticosteroids (P < 0.001). Following maintenance therapy initiation, 26%, 44%, and 33% of patients continuing on maintenance infliximab over 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3 years, respectively, had clinically inactive disease not requiring corticosteroids or surgery. The likelihood of continuing maintenance infliximab at 1, 2, and 3 years was 93%, 78%, and 67%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab maintenance therapy was a durable and effective treatment that was associated with prolonged corticosteroid withdrawal over a 3-year period in children with CD.},

The long-acting analog h(Gly(2))GLP-2[1-33] is currently being tested for treatment of short bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease. However, the role of GLP-2 in colon carcinogenesis is controversial. To assess the intestinotropic effects of exogenous and endogenous GLP-2, C57BL6/J mice were injected with 1 microg h(Gly(2))GLP-2[1-33]; 30 or 60 ng hGLP-2[3-33], a GLP-2 receptor antagonist; or PBS (4 wk, twice a day, sc). Chronic h(Gly(2))GLP-2[1-33] increased small intestinal weight/body weight (P < 0.001), villus height (P < 0.001), crypt depth (P < 0.001), and crypt cell proliferation, as measured by expression of the proliferative marker Ki67 (P < 0.05-0.01). In contrast, chronic hGLP-2[3-33] decreased small intestinal weight/body weight (P < 0.05) and colon weight/body weight (P < 0.05). To assess the carcinogenic effects of endogenous and exogenous GLP-2, separate mice were injected with azoxymethane (10 mg/kg, 4 wk, every 7 d, ip), followed by 1.5 microg h(Gly(2))GLP-2[1-33], 30 ng hGLP-2[3-33], or PBS (4 wk, twice a day, sc) 2 or 12 wk thereafter. At 10 or 46 wk after azoxymethane treatment, the numbers of aberrant crypt foci increased with h(Gly(2))GLP-2[1-33] (P < 0.001) and decreased with hGLP-2[3-33] (P < 0.01-0.05) treatment. Furthermore, mucin-depleted aberrant foci, consistent with progressive dysplasia, were almost exclusively present in h(Gly(2))GLP-2[1-33]-treated mice (P < 0.01-0.001). Additionally, adenocarcinomas developed in h(Gly(2))GLP-2[1-33]-treated mice but not in those receiving hGLP-2[3-33] or PBS. Taken together, these studies indicate that chronic treatment with GLP-2 enhances colon carcinogenesis, whereas antagonism of the GLP-2 receptor decreases dysplasia, with possible implications for human therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The spreading of gastrointestinal diseases is growing all over the world. Although for some of them an effective therapeutic approach has been found, palliation rather than cure is very frequent due to a partial knowledge of their aetiology and pathogenesis. This review, analyzing the main clinical studies, aims at being a state of the art update of the use of probiotic formulations in daily practice. METHODS: In this review we include all the most significant clinical trials involving the use of probiotic formulations for the treatment of several pathologies. RESULTS: Dysbiosis has been observed in irritable bowel syndrome patients. Probiotics may exert a beneficial effect on Crohn's disease affected patients who have shown gut microbiota antigens and altered wall permeability. Moreover some probiotic formulations seem to enhance the therapy for Helicobacter Pylori reducing its pathogenic potential. Intestinal ecology imbalance has been also linked to cancer induction, allergy, skin and urogenital diseases. In addition probiotics administration seems to be particularly useful to ease post-operative complications. CONCLUSION: Further future clinical trials, involving large numbers of patients, will be mandatory to achieve definite evidence of the preventive and curative role of probiotics in medical practice.},

   abstract = {Peyer's patches (PPs), a major component of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, serve as important antigen entry sites in mucosal immunity. PPs may play a role in the extension of ulcerative colitis (UC) into the terminal ileum. We sought to clarify the magnified endoscopic findings of the PPs in the terminal ileum of UC patients. Eighteen UC patients underwent magnifying chromoendoscopy before initial treatment to evaluate the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) on the PPs domes and the surrounding villi. In 8 UC patients, as in healthy controls, the PPs' domes were slightly elevated, covered with the regular FAE lining, and surrounded by dense and bulky villi; however, in 10 UC patients, the PPs' domes were irregular, and the surrounding villi were sparse and atrophic. These abnormal findings within the PPs were associated with minimal mucosal lesions but not with backwash ileitis; both electron microscopy and magnifying endoscopy confirmed that these lesions were reversible following remission with prednisolone-mesalazine therapy. Similar to Crohn's disease patients, UC patients commonly had abnormalities in the FAE on PPs' domes and the surrounding villi on magnifying endoscopy.},

CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present a case of severe metabolic alkalosis in a young patient suffering from M. Crohn. The patient had undergone multiple resections of the intestine and suffered from chronic kidney disease. He was now referred to our clinic for recurrent acute kidney injury, the nature of which was pre-renal due to profound volume depletion. Renal failure was associated with marked hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis which only responded to high volume repletion and high dose blockade of gastric hypersecretion. Intestinal failure with stomal fluid losses of up to 5.7 litres per day required port implantation to commence parenteral nutrition. Fluid and electrolyte replacement rapidly improved renal function and acid base homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the important role of gastrointestinal function to maintain acid base status in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are poorly characterized. We examined the prevalence of EIMs at diagnosis, subsequent incidence, and risk factors for EIMs. METHODS: Data for 1649 patients from the PediIBD Consortium Registry, diagnosed with IBD before 18 years of age (1007 [61%] with Crohn's disease, 471 [29%] with ulcerative colitis, and 171 [10%] with indeterminate colitis), were analyzed using logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier, log rank tests, and Cox models. RESULTS: EIMs were reported prior to IBD diagnosis in 97 of 1649 patients (6%). Older children at diagnosis had higher rates compared with younger children, and arthritis (26%) and aphthous stomatitis (21%) were most common. Among the 1552 patients without EIM at diagnosis, 290 developed at least 1 EIM. Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative incidence were 9% at 1 year, 19% at 5 years, and 29% at 15 years after diagnosis. Incidence did not differ by IBD type (P = 0.20), age at diagnosis (P = 0.22), or race/ethnicity (P = 0.24). Arthritis (17%) and osteopenia/osteoporosis (15%) were the most common EIMs after IBD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In our large cohort of pediatric IBD patients, 6% had at least 1 EIM before diagnosis of IBD. At least 1 EIM will develop in 29% within 15 years of diagnosis. The incidence of EIMs both before and after diagnosis of IBD differs by type of EIM and may be slightly higher in girls, but is independent of the type of IBD, age at diagnosis, and race/ethnicity.},

If the functional candidate gene approach was rarely fruitful in the past, genome-wide scans allowed finding several susceptibility genes for Crohn disease including NOD2, IL23R, ATG16L1, IRGM, TNFSF15, a region close to PTGER4, PTPN2, PTPN22, NKX2-3 and many others. Only one gene, ECM1, has been reported for ulcerative colitis alone. We now need to further explore these new genes before to understand their biological role. However they clearly demonstrate the importance of innate immunity and autophagy for Crohn's disease and of the TH-17 differentiation for ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and other inflammatory disorders.},

Despite frank inflammation, Crohn disease patients with colitis had significantly lower, albeit enhanced, HBD2 levels than did ulcerative colitis patients.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Western countries is on the rise. No prospective studies have been conducted on the epidemiology of pediatric IBD in Poland. The aim of the study was to define the characteristics of new pediatric IBD and assess the incidence of new IBD among children in Poland between 2002 and 2004. METHODS: Patient records from 24 pediatric gastroenterology centers servicing the whole population of Poland were collected. IBD diagnosis was based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological features. RESULTS: There were 491 new IBD patients, representing an overall incidence of IBD of 2.7 cases/100,000 children/year. The incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) was 0.6, ulcerative colitis (UC) 1.3, and indeterminate colitis (IC) 0.8. The age-related incidence of IBD was 1.8 in the 0- to 10-year-old age group, rising to 3.7 for the 11- to 18-year age group. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of IBD (as well as CD, UC and IC) in Poland is lower than that in Western countries. The relative contribution of UC and IC to the overall IBD incidence is higher in Poland than in most Western countries. These findings may suggest a tendency towards under- or misdiagnosis.},

Such blends were recently shown to be highly promising for the site-specific delivery of drugs to the colon in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, in particular Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Importantly, and in contrast to various other colon targeting approaches, the system is adapted to the pathophysiological conditions in the disease state. However, it is yet unknown how desired membrane properties, especially water uptake and dry mass loss kinetics as well as mechanical stability can be adjusted to the specific needs of particular drug treatments. Different highly efficient and easy to apply tools were identified altering the membrane's properties, in particular their mechanical resistance required to withstand the shear forces resulting from the motility of the upper GIT and the hydrostatic pressure built up within the devices upon contact with aqueous media. This includes the variation of the Nutriose:ethylcellulose blend ratio and initial plasticizer content. Importantly, Nutriose also exhibits significant pre-biotic activity, normalizing the microflora in the patients' colon, which is of major clinical benefit in the case of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

Ethylcellulose was blended with different types of bacteria-sensitive starch derivatives. The water uptake and dry mass loss kinetics of the systems were monitored upon exposure to media simulating the contents of the stomach, small intestine and colon (including fresh fecal samples from Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis patients). Importantly, ethylcellulose:Nutriose FB 06 and ethylcellulose:Peas starch N-735 films showed highly promising water uptake and dry mass loss kinetics in all the investigated media, indicating their potential to minimize premature drug release in the upper gastro-intestinal tract, and allowing for controlled release once the colon is reached. This can be attributed to the fact that the starch derivatives serve as substrates for the enzymes, which are secreted by the bacteria present in the colon of inflammatory bowel disease patients. Thus, the identified new polymeric films are adapted to the pathophysiological conditions in the gastro-intestinal tract in the disease state. Furthermore, Nutriose is known to provide pre-biotic effects, which can be of great benefit for these patients.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to prepare and characterize novel types of polymer coated pellets allowing for the site-specific delivery of drugs to the colon. 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)-loaded beads were prepared by extrusion-spheronization and coated with different Nutriose:ethylcellulose blends. In vitro drug release from these systems was measured under various conditions, including the exposure to fresh fecal samples from inflammatory bowel disease patients under anaerobic conditions. Nutriose is a starch derivative, which is preferentially degraded by enzymes secreted by the microflora in the colon of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Interestingly, the release of 5-ASA (which is commonly used for the local treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases) could effectively be suppressed upon exposure to release media simulating the conditions in the upper GIT, irrespective of the degree of agitation and presence or absence of enzymes. But as soon as the pellets came into contact with fecal samples of inflammatory bowel disease patients, the release rate significantly increased and the drug was released in a time-controlled manner. Thus, this novel type of colon targeting system is adapted to the pathophysiology of the patient. Furthermore, culture media containing specific colonic bacteria are presented providing an interesting potential as substitutes for fresh fecal samples.},

   abstract = {Fournier gangrene is a very rare and a rapidly progressing, polymicrobial necrotizing faciitis or myonecrosis of the perineal, perianal and genital regions, with a high mortality rate. Infection is associated with superficial traum, urological and colorectal diseases and operations. The most commonly found bacteria are Escherichia coli followed by Bacteroides and streptococcal species. Diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and immunosuppression are perpetuating co-factors. Fournier's gangrene complicating inflammatory bowel disease has been reported in three patients so far, two with Crohn's disease. A 78-year-old man diagnosed with ulcerative pancolitis was referred for fever, and painful perianal and scrotal swelling after perianal surgery for a horseshoe-type perianal abscess. Since bowel disease diagnosis, patient was on mesalazine and achieved long-term remission. Perianal abscess occurred suddenly one week before perianal surgery without any evidence of pre-existing fistula or other abnormalities. Physical examination showed extensive edema and crepitus of perineum and genitalia and patient had symptoms of significant toxicity. The diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene was made and patient underwent emergency surgery with extensive surgical debridement of the scrotal and perianal area and Hartman procedure with a diverting colostomy. In addition, patient started on therapy with mesalazine 3gr, methylprednisolone 16 mg, parenteral nutrition and broad spectrum of antibiotics. Two days after the first operation the patient needed a second operation for perianal debridement. On the fourth day, blood cultures showed E. coli. Patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged after 34 days of hospitalization. On follow up, disease review is scheduled and colostomy closure is planned.},

Although the bulk of the published experience regarding osteoporosis is derived from the postmenopausal population, this review will focus on gastrointestinal disorders implicated in osteoporosis, with an emphasis on inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. The unique aspects of gastrointestinal diseases associated with osteoporosis include early onset of disease (and, therefore, prolonged exposure to risk factors for developing osteoporosis, particularly with inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease), malabsorption, and maldigestion of nutrients necessary for bone health and maintenance (eg, calcium, vitamin D), as well as the impact of glucocorticoids. These factors, when added to smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, hypogonadism, and a family history of osteoporosis, accumulate into an imposing package of predictors for osteoporotic fracture. This paper will review the identification and treatment strategies for patients with gastrointestinal disorders and osteoporosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We sought to characterize perianal disease and its treatment in pediatric patients newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Collaborative Group Registry, a prospective, multicenter observational registry recording clinical and laboratory outcomes in children under 16 years of age newly diagnosed with IBD. Patients with Crohn's disease were selected who had data on perianal disease and at least 24 months of follow-up. The records of patients with a Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index perianal subscore greater than 0 were reviewed, and patients with abscesses or fistulas were selected. The therapies used and the course of their perianal disease were then assessed. RESULTS: Of the 276 patients identified, 41 had perianal lesions within 30 days of diagnosis. Thirteen of these had skin tags and fissures only, whereas 28 had fistulas and/or abscesses. The latter lesions resolved by 1 year in 20 patients, and 8 had chronic/recurrent perianal disease persisting for more than 1 year following diagnosis. Patients with fistulizing disease were much more likely to be treated and were treated earlier with antibiotics, infliximab, and immunomodulators than were nonfistulizing patients. Patients who developed chronic perianal disease were more likely to have low body mass indices and required more perianal surgery than did patients whose perianal disease resolved. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 10% of newly diagnosed pediatric patients with Crohn's disease will have perianal fistulas and/or abscesses at the time of diagnosis. Most of these will resolve within a year with medical therapy alone.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In this study we aimed to determine, in pediatric patients, whether norovirus infection could be associated with exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and ascertain whether the clinical expression of norovirus gastroenteritis was similar in patients with IBD compared with non-IBD controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a case-control retrospective chart review, over a 10-month interval, of patients with IBD with an exacerbation of their disease. The presence of norovirus in stool and/or rectal swab samples, as determined by an enzyme-linked immunoassay, was assessed. In addition, sex, age, type of IBD, presence or absence of diarrhea, hematochezia, and the need for hospitalization were determined. A similar number of control patients who did not have IBD were used as controls. RESULTS: Nine patients with IBD (8 ulcerative colitis/1 Crohn disease) had exacerbations with diarrhea. Eight had norovirus antigen in at least 1 sample. All 9 patients with IBD presented with bloody diarrhea and 6 of the 8 norovirus-positive patients with IBD required hospitalization. All of the control patients experienced diarrhea; however, no hematochezia was noted and no hospitalization was required. Several patients with IBD and controls remained positive for norovirus months after the initial positive stool and/or rectal swab sample. The virus appeared to be more common during winter months. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that norovirus may be associated with exacerbations of IBD. When norovirus accompanies IBD it is more likely to be associated with hematochezia than when the infection occurs in the absence of IBD.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the tolerance of a peptide-based formula with insoluble and prebiotic fiber in children with compromised gut function. During January 2005 to June 2006, a 6-week randomized, double-blind, cross-over clinical study was conducted to compare stool frequency, stool consistency, and tolerance (abdominal pain, abdominal distension, vomiting, weight gain, and intake) between a formula with or without 3.5 g fructo-oligosaccharides and 3.8 g insoluble fiber/L. Fourteen children with gastrointestinal dysmotility (n=9), Crohn's disease (n=3), or mild short bowel syndrome (n=2) were randomized to receive one of two formulas for 2 weeks followed by a 5-day washout period and then the second diet for another 2 weeks. Means and standard deviations of daily stool frequency and consistency were calculated and compared using intent-to-treat analysis. Linear mixed models were applied to each outcome variable. Stool frequency did not differ by formula. Stool consistency did differ with more soft "mushy" stools (less hard stools) occurring with use of fiber (P<0.001) and more watery stools occurring with control formula (P<0.01). The extremes of stool consistency were normalized with the fiber formula. No significant differences were observed in vomiting, abdominal pain, feeding intakes, or weight gain between the two formulas. This study showed that a peptide-based formula containing fiber was as well-tolerated as a fiber-free formula in a small population of children with gastrointestinal impairments. Longer-term effects of the fiber formula need to be studied.},

   abstract = {Interleukin-10 gene-deficient (Il10(-/-)) mice show a hyper-reaction to normal intestinal bacteria and develop spontaneous colitis similar to that of human Crohn's disease when raised under conventional (but not germ-free) conditions. The lack of IL10 protein in these mice leads to changes in intestinal metabolic and signalling processes. The first aim of this study was to identify changes in the bacterial community of the caeca at 7 weeks of age (preclinical colitis) and at 12 weeks of age (when clinical signs of colitis are present), and establish if there were any changes that could be associated with the mouse genotype. We have previously shown that dietary n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have anti-inflammatory effects and affect colonic gene expression profiles in Il10(-/-) mice; therefore, we also aimed to test the effect of the n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) on the bacterial community of caeca in both Il10(-/-) and C57 mice fed these diets. The lower number of caecal bacteria observed before colitis (7 weeks of age) in Il10(-/-) compared to C57 mice suggests differences in the intestinal bacteria that might be associated with the genotype, and this could contribute to the development of colitis in this mouse model. The number and diversity of caecal bacteria increased after the onset of colitis (12 weeks of age). The increase in caecal Escherichia coli numbers in both inflamed Il10(-/-) and healthy C57 mice might be attributed to the dietary PUFA (especially dietary AA), and thus not be a cause of colitis development. A possible protective effect of E. coli mediated by PUFA supplementation and associated changes in the bacterial environment could be a subject for further investigation to define the mode of action of PUFA in colitis.},

Exclusive enteral nutrition is a therapeutic concept to induce remission in children and adolescents with active Crohn's disease. A new area of nutritional research in pediatrics is potential immunonutrition in critically ill children. Formulae are enriched with single components or a combination of key substrates that might play a crucial role during intermediary metabolism in sepsis, inflammation, tissue healing, and growth. For pharmaconutrition, single components are investigated in a scientific stepwise procedure in order to identify effective disease-dedicated nutrition therapy. Any new formula needs to be evaluated, if possible in comparison to a normal diet or the reference formulation to demonstrate its safety and efficacy (equal or superior to standard formula).},

This role includes the prevention and correction of malnutrition, the prevention of osteoporosis and the promotion of optimal growth and development in children. In active Crohn's disease, nutritional therapy (in the form of enteral feeding) is an effective primary therapy for pediatric patients. Studies have shown that there is no difference in the efficacy of elemental, oligomeric and polymeric enteral formulas. Therefore, the use of polymeric formula is recommended because of higher palatability, better acceptance by patients, lower rate of complications and lower cost when compared with other enteral formulas. Today we have knowledge that some nutrients which are added to modified special enteral formulas have almost pharmacological terapeutic potential in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease, such as transforming growth factor-beta-enriched (TGF-beta2) enteral feeding, showed beneficial effects in several clinical studies. Croatian guidelines for enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease have been developed by interdisciplinary expert group of Croatian clinicians involved with inflammatory bowel disease. The guidelines are based on evidence from relevant medical literature and clinical experience of working group.},

RESULTS: Catalase and GPx1 activities were decreased in active IBD, whereas SOD1 became upregulated by IBD-related oxidative stress. In Crohn's disease (CD) corticosteroids decreased SOD1 activity. SOD1 correlated indirectly with CD activity and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and directly with transferrin. In ulcerative colitis (UC) anemia downregulated SOD1. Decreases in GPx activity corresponded with IBD activity, anemia, inflammation, and malnutrition. Oxidative stress in UC and corticosteroids in CD also downregulated GPx. Catalase activity was decreased by CD-related anemia, correlating directly with hemoglobin, and indirectly with CD activity, inflammatory and protein oxidative stress markers. When co-analyzed, anemia but not CD activity significantly contributed to catalase downregulation. In UC, catalase activity corresponded indirectly with UC endoscopic activity and inflammation and directly with hemoglobin. UC activity, anemia, and treatment with azathioprine negatively affected catalase. As indicators of active IBD, GPx1 showed a diagnostic accuracy of 73%, whereas catalase showed 63% as compared to 74% of C-reactive protein and ESR. CONCLUSIONS: Erythrocyte antioxidant defense is impaired in active IBD. SOD1, GPx1, and CAT activities are differently affected by the disease type, activity, anemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, and treatment. As an active IBD indicator, GPx1 was comparable to C-reactive protein and ESR.},

   abstract = {Vitamin D is the critical hormone for intestinal absorption of calcium. Optimal calcium absorption is important for proper mineralization of bone in the prevention of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures, among other important functions. Diseases associated with gut inflammation, such as Crohn's disease (CD), may impair calcium absorption. This pilot study evaluated vitamin D- dependent calcium absorption in subjects with CD. Male subjects with CD (n=4) and healthy age-matched controls (n=5) were studied. All subjects had fractional calcium absorption (FCA; by the dual calcium isotope method), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, serum calcium and 24 h urinary calcium excretion measurements at baseline. The FCA in response to vitamin D therapy was re-assessed following administration of oral calcitriol 0.25 mcg twice daily for 1 wk, followed by oral calcitriol 0.50 mcg twice daily for 1 wk. Serum calcium and 24 h urinary calcium determinations were re-assessed after each increasing dose of calcitriol as safety measures. There was no significant difference in calcium FCA at baseline or after increasing doses of calcitriol between the CD and controls. FCA in the control and CD group was approximately 35% at baseline, which increased to 60% after calcitriol therapy. No subject developed hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria. Our results suggest that CD patients have a normal response to vitamin D in enhancing the efficacy of calcium absorption. This suggests that stable CD patients can follow calcium and vitamin D guidelines of non-CD adults. Other factors independent of vitamin D status may impair intestinal calcium absorption in CD, including the degree and location of inflammation, presence of surgical resection and/or use of glucocorticoids.},

METHODOLOGY: We cross-sectionally evaluated the effect of multiple clinical factors including enteral nutrition on the health-related quality of life of Crohn's disease patients focusing on patient disease duration using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire. RESULTS: Of all 126 patients examined, 95 patients were receiving enteral nutrition. Multiple linear regression analysis using 18 clinical parameters revealed that disease activity was a dominant factor that affected the health-related quality of life of Crohn's disease patients, and that enteral nutrition was also an independent factor that improved the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire total score, bowel symptoms, and systemic symptoms for patients with a disease duration of 10 years or more (P = 0.0090, 0.0033, and 0.016, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutrition improved the health-related quality of life of Crohn's disease patients with long-term disease duration. Thus, enteral nutrition should be recommended as one of the options for maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK), menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of these vitamins.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two main disorders, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, that cause chronic, recurrent inflammation of the intestine. An inappropriate immune response to the enteric ecosystem has been postulated to cause IBD. Genomewide association studies provide the information of diverse genetic variations and susceptibilities to patients with IBD. Through the application of these studies, the pathogenesis of IBD may result in part from genetic abnormalities that regulate epithelial barrier function and innate and adaptive immune responses. Crohn's disease shows strong association with CARD15, ATG15L1, and IRGM, which are involved in the innate immunity. In the adaptive immune response, IL23R, MST1, IL12B, and STAT3 polymorphisms are associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Current pharmacologic treatment of IBD, including 5-aminosalycylate, steroids, and immunomodulator therapy, are mainly aimed at suppressing inflammation non-specifically, except biologic therapies such as anti-tumor necrosis factor molecule, which block specific proinflammatory molecules. For nutritional issues in IBD, the mainstay of therapy has been supportive, with particular attention paid to the prevention, recognition, and therapy of nutritional deficiencies, and individual outcomes to specific dietary factors have been controversial. Parenteral nutritional support and exclusionary diets have been investigated and are not the subject of this review. The emerging concepts of nutrition-gene interaction gave birth to unique scientific fields, nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics. These studies provide information about 1) the genetic variability that induces an individual's response to nutrition according to particular states of health and disease and 2) changes in gene expression that develop as a result of nutrition-gene interaction. For IBD, the role of diet in the regulation of the immune response against gut flora is the subject of current intensive evaluation. These approaches may lead clinicians to derive a personalized nutritional prescription based on individual genetic variations and may result in a significant impact on IBD treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study was designed to elucidate the contribution of parental height to the stature of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), who often exhibit growth impairment. Accordingly, we compared patients' final adult heights and target heights based on measured parental heights and examined predictors of final adult height in pediatric IBD patients. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed the growth of 295 patients diagnosed between ages 1 and 18 (211 Crohn's disease [CD], 84 ulcerative colitis [UC]) and their family members (283 mothers, 231 fathers, 55 siblings). RESULTS: Twenty-two percent had growth impairment (height for age Z-score <-1.64, equivalent to <5th percentile on growth curve) in more than 1 measurement since diagnosis; most growth-impaired patients had CD (88% CD versus 12% UC). Parents of the growth-impaired group had lower mean height Z-scores compared to parents of nongrowth-impaired patients (-0.67 versus 0.02 for mothers [P < 0.001]; -0.31 versus 0.22 for fathers [P = 0.002]). For 108 patients who reached adult heights and had available parental heights, the growth-impaired group continued to demonstrate lower adult height Z-scores (-1.38 versus 0.07; P < 0.001). Adult heights were within 1 SD of target heights even for the growth-impaired group. Only 11.3% remained persistently growth-impaired in adulthood. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated lower parental height and minimum patient height Z-score as significant predictors of lower final adult height in IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Parental height is a powerful determinant of linear growth even in the presence of chronic inflammation, and should be an integral part of the evaluation of growth in IBD children.},

Low body weight is associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in CD, although the relative importance of its components, lean and fat mass, is unclear. Muscle strength is also a predictor of BMD in nondiseased populations; however, its association with bone in CD is unknown. We examined the independent effects of body composition and muscle strength on regional and whole-body BMD in a cohort of CD patients. Sixty men and women, aged 22-72 years, with disease duration of 13 +/- 7 years, underwent scanning of the spine, hip, forearm, and whole-body BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Lean tissue, appendicular muscle mass (AMM), and fat mass were derived by DXA and grip strength by dynamometry. Medical history, medication usage, clinical variables, and nutritional intake were obtained by questionnaire. Prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was 32 and 17%, respectively, with osteopenia more common at the hip and osteoporosis more common at the spine. In multiple regression analyses, AMM was an independent predictor of whole-body and regional BMD whereas lean mass was an independent predictor at the hip. Neither grip strength nor fat mass was independently associated with BMD. Of the components of body composition, muscle mass was strongly associated with regional and whole-body BMD. Preserving or augmenting muscle mass in this population may be a useful strategy to preserve BMD and thereby reduce fracture risk.},

METHODS: A nested subgroup of 101 adult subjects of the population-based Manitoba IBD Cohort Study were enrolled. Baseline BMD and body composition were measured and repeated 2.3 +/- 0.3 years later. RESULTS: Greater weight, height, and body mass measurements were positively correlated with bone density at all sites (P < 0.01). Although both fat tissue and lean tissue showed positive relationships with BMD, lean tissue showed a much stronger correlation than fat tissue, especially for the total hip (r = 0.66, P < 0.001 versus r = 0.23, P < 0.05) and total body measurements (r = 0.59, P < 0.001 versus r = 0.04, P NS). Increase (or decrease) in hip bone density was strongly associated with an increase (or decrease) in all body mass variables (r = 0.49-0.54, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Measures of body mass are important determinants of baseline BMD in recently diagnosed IBD patients. Furthermore, change in body mass is correlated with change in BMD, especially at the total hip. Early optimization and maintenance of nutrition and body weight, particularly toward lean tissue mass, may play an important role in preventing IBD-related bone disease.},

   abstract = {Although the use of concomitant immunosuppressants (IS) with biologics has been demonstrated to reduce the immunogenicity of chimeric (infliximab), humanized (natalizumab), human (adalimumab) antibodies and antibody fragments (certolizumab pegol), to date concomitant IS with biologics has not impacted on the short or intermediate responses in the treatment of Crohn's disease in most induction and maintenance trials. The optimal strategy to reduce antibodies to infliximab is to use an induction and maintenance strategy rather than episodic therapy. Any potential benefit of concomitant IS use with biologic agents needs to be balanced against the risk of combination therapy including serious infections and the risk of neoplasia. The discovery of genetic polymorphism for production of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), a key enzyme in the metabolism of thiopurine antimetabolites, has made it possible to rationalize therapy in terms of patient and dosage selection. TPMT screening prior to initiation of thiopurine antimetabolites is currently recommended to avoid treating patients with low or absent TPMT activity with potentially toxic doses of thiopurines. Routine monitoring of blood counts and liver enzymes is recommended even in individuals with normal TPMT activity. The ability to monitor thiopurine metabolites may make it possible to optimize therapeutic response by guiding clinicians on dose escalation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We previously reported that IBD patients who are non-responders to thiopurines with preferential shunting of metabolites to hepatotoxic 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleotides compared to 6-thioguanine nucleotides can reverse the ratio of 6-MMP/6-TGN and respond to thiopurines with the addition of allopurinol. The objective of this study is to report long term efficacy and safety, along with results for an additional 11 patients. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients at the University of Chicago IBD Center treated with allopurinol in addition to thiopurines. RESULTS: Twenty five patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis were enrolled. Within the first month of therapy 6-TGN metabolite levels increased from a mean of 186.5+/-17.4 (SE) to 352.8+/-37.8 pmol/8x10(8) (p=0.0001). Over the same period 6-MMP levels decreased from a mean of 11,966+/-1697 to 2004+/-536 pmol/8x10(8) (p<0.0001). The mean daily dosage of prednisone decreased from 19.8+/-3.8 mg to 5.3+/-2.7 mg (p=0.03). Thirteen patients have a minimum of one year follow-up. Nine of these thirteen patients have continued on therapy for at least 2 years. All thirteen of these patients continue to be in clinical remission at the last follow-up visit. No patients have had evidence of sustained thrombocytopenia or abnormal liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: In AZA/6-MP non-responders with increased 6-MMP/6-TGN ratios, addition of allopurinol continues to demonstrate safety and efficacy for long-term maintenance and steroid-sparing in IBD.},

   abstract = {The clinical manifestations of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are highly variable, with significant diversity in phenotypes of the diseases. This diversity may manifest as a difference in age of onset. Pediatric-onset disease may present differently and have a different natural history, with ramifications for disease management. Clear evidence exists at present that pediatric-onset UC may be different than adult-onset UC. The primary difference in disease phenotype is extent of disease. Approximately 60-70% of patients with pediatric-onset UC present with pancolitis, as opposed to approximately 20-30% in adults. Patients are more likely to have severe disease and become steroid-dependent. CD may be affected by an age gradient. There is an inverse linear relationship between age and colonic CD, the younger the patient, the more likely is the patient to have colonic CD. This inverse relationship is true through age 10. In addition, pediatric patients are more likely to have upper gastrointestinal involvement than their adult peers. Comparing adult and pediatric phenotypes is fraught with methodological obstacles. Disease behavior, with the exception of growth failure, seems to parallel disease behavior in adults. Patients with growth retardation are a high risk group for complications and should be managed as such.},

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in IBD patients. Anthropometric measures, biochemical markers of nutrition and bone mineral density measurement were completed for these patients as well as healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Seventy-seven Crohn's disease (CD) and 43 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were enrolled, and 37 healthy volunteers were recruited as healthy controls (HC). The T value of CD patients, UC patients and HC was -1.72 +/- 1.20, -1.26 +/- 1.12 and -0.62 +/- 0.87 respectively and the T value of CD patients was significantly lower than that of HC (P = 0.000). The prevalence of osteoporosis in CD, UC and HC was 23.3%, 14.0% and 0 respectively. The prevalence of osteoporosis in CD was higher than that in HC (P = 0.003). Logistic regression analysis indicated that low BMI (BMI < or = 18.4 kg/m(2)) was an independent risk factor for osteoporosis both in CD (OR = 11.25, 95%CI 3.198 - 39.580, P = 0.000) and in UC (OR = 14.50, 95%CI 1.058 - 88.200, P = 0.045) patients. Age, disease duration, clinical activity active index (CDAI), oral steroid therapy, immunosuppressant treatment and serum vitamin D concentration were not found to be correlated with osteoporosis in IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low bone mineral density is common in both CD and UC patients and low BMI is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis in IBD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare inherited immunodeficiency disorder characterized by inability of phagocytes to kill certain bacteria and fungi. Histology from colon biopsies of CGD patients have shown the presence of inflammation and granulomas, almost indistinguishable from the findings seen in Crohn's disease. We sought to determine if there were any differences in the cell types that comprise the inflammatory infiltrates in inflamed colon specimens between the 2 diseases. The objective was to determine whether the pattern of inflammatory cell composition could be used to distinguish CGD-associated colitis from Crohn's colitis. METHODS: Biopsies from 6 patients with Crohn's disease, 6 patients with CGD, and 6 control patients were stained with antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, CD79, CD163, and Foxp3. Positively staining cells per mm(2) of lamina propria were calculated for each antibody, with the exception of CD163, in which a percent area of lamina propria stained was calculated. RESULTS: There was a marked difference in the average CD68+ cells per mm(2) of lamina propria between the 2 groups (Crohn's: 1104.2 cells/mm(2); CGD: 242.3 cells/mm(2), P < 0.0004) and a significant difference between the CGD group and control group (Control: 565.4 cells/mm(2), CGD: 242.3 cells/mm(2), P = 0.0072). There were no significant differences between Crohn's and CGD biopsies in the other cell types. CONCLUSIONS: This phenomenon provides physicians with a simple and valuable tool to identify CGD in patients with colonic inflammation.},

   abstract = {A number of studies have been performed examining the influence of various probiotic organisms, either alone or in combination, on immune parameters, infectious outcomes, and inflammatory conditions in humans. Some components of the immune response, including phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity and mucosal immunoglobulin A production (especially in children), can be improved by some probiotic bacteria. Other components, including lymphocyte proliferation, the production of cytokines and of antibodies other than immunoglobulin A appear less sensitive to probiotics. Probiotics, including lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, administered to children can reduce incidence and duration of diarrhoea, but the precise effects depend upon the nature of the condition. Probiotic supplementation can reduce the risk of travellers' diarrhoea in adults, but does not affect duration. The effect of probiotics on other infectious outcomes is less clear. Probiotics may benefit children and adults with irritable bowel syndrome and adults with ulcerative colitis; studies in Crohn's Disease are less clear. Probiotics have little effect in rheumatoid arthritis. Probiotic supplementation, especially with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, can reduce risk and severity of allergic disease, particular atopic dermatitis; early supplementation appears to be effective. Overall, the picture that emerges from studies of probiotics on immune, infectious and inflammatory outcomes in humans is mixed and there appear to be large species and strain differences in effects seen. Other reasons for differences in effects seen will include dose of probiotic organism used, duration of supplementation, characteristics of the subjects studied, sample size, and technical differences in how the measurements were made.},

   abstract = {Butyrate-producing bacteria play a key role in colonic health in humans. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of the diversity, metabolism and microbial ecology of this functionally important group of bacteria. Human colonic butyrate producers are Gram-positive firmicutes, but are phylogenetically diverse, with the two most abundant groups related to Eubacterium rectale/Roseburia spp. and to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Five different arrangements have been identified for the genes of the central pathway involved in butyrate synthesis, while in most cases butyryl-CoA : acetate CoA-transferase, rather than butyrate kinase, appears to perform the final step in butyrate synthesis. Mechanisms have been proposed recently in non-gut Clostridium spp. whereby butyrate synthesis can result in energy generation via both substrate-level phosphorylation and proton gradients. Here we suggest that these mechanisms also apply to the majority of butyrate producers from the human colon. The roles of these bacteria in the gut community and their influence on health are now being uncovered, taking advantage of the availability of cultured isolates and molecular methodologies. Populations of F. prausnitzii are reported to be decreased in Crohn's disease, for example, while populations of Roseburia relatives appear to be particularly sensitive to the diet composition in human volunteer studies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) frequently receive immunosuppressive therapy. The immune response in these patients to vaccines has not been well studied. We conducted a prospective, open label study to evaluate the serologic response to influenza vaccine in children with IBD. METHODS: Serum was obtained from 146 children and young adults with IBD (96 Crohn's disease, 47 ulcerative colitis, and 3 indeterminate colitis) for baseline influenza titer, immediately followed by immunization with trivalent (A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (B)) inactivated influenza vaccine. Patients returned for repeat titers 3-9 weeks later. Seroprotection against each influenza strain was defined as hemagglutination inhibition titer > or = 40. Patients were categorized as nonimmunosuppressed (NIS; aminosalicylates only, antibiotics only, or no therapy) or immunosuppressed (IS; any immunosuppressive agent). IS patients were further subcategorized as: (i) tacrolimus, (ii) tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor, (3) immunomodulator, and (4) corticosteroids only. RESULTS: More patients were seroprotected against strains A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 than B strain (P<0.02), regardless of immunosuppression status. The proportion of seroprotected patients and geometric mean titers at post-vaccination were similar between NIS and IS groups for all three strains. Subanalysis of patients not seroprotected at baseline showed that those receiving anti-TNF therapy were less likely to be seroprotected against strain B (14%) compared to patients in the NIS group (39%, P=0.025). There were no serious vaccine-associated adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination produces a high prevalence of seroprotection in IBD patients, particularly against A strains. The vaccine is well tolerated. Routine influenza vaccination in IBD patients is recommended, irrespective of whether patients receive immunosuppressive medications.},

Various feeding practices have been implicated in the origin of IBD based on epidemiological observations in developed countries, but we do not have solid evidence for the etiological role played by specific food types. IBD is associated with frequent nutritional deficiencies, the pattern and severity of which depends on the extent, duration and activity of the inflammation. Nutritional support allows these deficiencies in calories, macro- and micro-nutrients to be rectified. Enteral nutrition is also a primary therapy for IBD, especially for Crohn's disease, as it allows the inflammatory activity to be controlled, kept in remission, and prevents or delays the need for surgery. Nutritional support is especially important in childhood IBD as an alternative to pharmacological treatment. This report discusses the complex relationship between diet and IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The clinical, endoscopic, and histological features of Crohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis mimic each other so much that it becomes difficult to differentiate between them. The aim was to find out clinical, endoscopic, and histological predictor features for differentiation between CD and intestinal tuberculosis. METHODS: We recruited 106 patients, 53 each with CD and intestinal tuberculosis, in this study. The clinical, histological, and endoscopic features were subjected to univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. On the basis of regression coefficients of the final multivariate logistic model, a score to discriminate between CD and intestinal tuberculosis was devised. For the validation of the score, the same model was tested on 20 new patients, each with CD and intestinal tuberculosis. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, although longer duration of disease, chronic diarrhea, blood in stool, perianal disease, extra-intestinal manifestations, involvement of left colon, skip lesions, aphthous ulcers, cobblestoning, longitudinal ulcers, focally enhanced colitis, and microgranulomas were significantly more common in CD, partial intestinal obstruction, constipation, presence of nodular lesions, higher number, and larger granulomas were significantly more common in intestinal tuberculosis. On multivariate analysis, blood in stool (odds ratio (OR) 0.1 (confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.5)), weight loss (OR 9.8 (CI 2.2-43.9)), histologically focally enhanced colitis (OR 0.1 (CI 0.03-0.5)), and involvement of sigmoid colon (OR 0.07(0.01-0.3)) were independent predictors of intestinal tuberculosis. On the basis of regression coefficients of the final multivariate logistic model, a score that varied from 0.3 to 9.3 was devised. Higher score predicted more likelihood of intestinal tuberculosis. Once the cutoff was set at 5.1, then the sensitivity, specificity, and ability to correctly classify the two diseases were 83.0, 79.2, and 81.1%, respectively. Area under the curve for receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) to assess the ability of these features to discriminate between CD and intestinal tuberculosis was 0.9089. The area under ROC in the validation data set was 89.2% (95% CI 0.79-0.99). With a similar cutoff score of 5.1, sensitivity and specificity in the validation model were 90% (95% CI 66.9-98.2) and 60% (95% CI 36.4-80.0), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood in stool, weight loss, focally enhanced colitis, and involvement of the sigmoid colon were the most important features in differentiating CD from intestinal tuberculosis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Data suggest an increase in the incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We examined the trend of the incidence of IBD in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective investigation was conducted on a cohort of children diagnosed with IBD between 1991 and 2002 who were registered in the IBD center at Texas Children's Hospital. The diagnosis of IBD was based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and histological examinations. RESULTS: There were 272 children eligible for the analysis; 56% diagnosed with Crohn disease (CD), 22% with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 22% with indeterminate colitis. The male-to-female ratio was 1.2:1 in CD, 0.6:1 in UC, and 0.8:1 in indeterminate colitis. From 1991 to 2002, the incidence rate has doubled from 1.1/100,000/year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.36) to 2.4/1001,000/year (95% CI 2.10-2.77). This trend was valid for CD but not for UC. Whites had higher incidence rate of IBD than African Americans or Hispanics: 4.15/100,000/year (95% CI 3.48-4.82) versus 1.83/100,000/year (95% CI 1.14-2.51), and 0.61/100,000/year (95% CI 0.33-0.89), respectively. African Americans were predominantly diagnosed with CD. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the rising incidence of IBD among children with evidence of more CD than UC. Recognition of these results will have important implications for diagnosis and management of IBD in children.},

   abstract = {Enteral nutrition has a primary therapeutic effect in active Crohn's disease. It is unknown which nutrient(s) account for this action, but a role for both the amount and type of dietary fat has been postulated. Some clinical and experimental data suggest that medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) may reduce intestinal inflammation. We aimed to assess the effect of replacing part of the dietary fat with MCT on the incidence and severity of colitis in interleukin (IL)-10(-/-) mice under specific pathogen-free conditions. Twenty-four IL-10(-/-) 4-wk-old mice were randomized to receive a control diet based on sunflower oil [(n-6) fatty acids (FA)] and an experimental isocaloric, isonitrogenous diet with 50% sunflower and 50% coconut oil (MCT diet). When the mice were 12 wk old, they were killed and the colon was examined for the presence of colitis, lymphocyte subpopulations and apoptosis, ex vivo cytokine production in supernatant of colon explants, toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-9 mRNA, and FA profile in colonic tissue homogenates. Colitis incidence was lower in the IL-10(-/-) mice fed the MCT diet (1/12) than in the mice fed the control diet (8/12; P = 0.03). The histological damage score was also lower in the former (P < 0.0005). Feeding the MCT diet resulted in fewer total and apoptotic intraepithelial CD3+ and lamina propria CD3+CD4+ lymphocytes, as well as downregulated production of IL-6 and interferon-gamma, and reduced TLR-9 mRNA. We conclude that partial replacement of dietary (n-6) FA with MCT decreases the incidence of colitis in a model of spontaneous intestinal inflammation and provide experimental arguments for a possible primary therapeutic effect of MCT in human Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The literature suggests that medications prescribed for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease may be more efficacious in children than adults. Care must be exercised in comparing these data, however, as significant differences in disease duration and concomitant therapy are present among studies. METHODS: Review of key clinical trials, meta-analyses and observational registries for which there are treatment response data from both pediatric and adult Crohn's disease (CD) populations. RESULTS: Acute response to corticosteroids is similar in children (84-89%) and adults (80-84%), but prolonged response may be better in children (50-61 vs. 32-44%). Differences in duration of CD among the various studies' subjects and the proportion of subjects receiving concomitant immunomodulators probably explain much of these differences. CD remission rates with thiopurines appear higher in children at both 6 months (85 vs. 31%) and 15-18 months (81 vs. 42%), but the reported outcomes are likely influenced by very short duration of CD in the pediatric populations studied. Similarly, remission of CD 1 year following initiation of infliximab also appears higher in children (56%) than adults (28%), but again differences in study populations' durations of CD and use of concomitant immunomodulators likely are responsible for the observed differences. CONCLUSION: Differences between pediatric and adult responses to a variety of IBD treatments appear to be due more to study design than the age of the subjects evaluated. As published pediatric trials have generally evaluated subjects with potent treatments at or shortly after diagnosis, the consistently higher rates of responses seen in children lend weight to the argument that some form of 'top-down' therapy offers the best option to maximize remission rates in all patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of immunomodulatory agents has changed the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Immunosuppressive drugs (mainly thiopurines) and biological treatments (mainly monoclonal antibodies against TNFalpha) are currently most frequently and earlier used. The recent report of new cases of the rare and almost always fatal hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in young patients on combined therapy with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine and infliximab suggests that the optimal strategies for reducing increased risk of side-effects need to be urgently assessed. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We report the effects of stopping immunosupressants in four Crohn's disease patients previously treated with azathioprine and infliximab for 6-12 months as combined therapy. The appearance of infusion reactions due to immunogenicity and the loss of efficacy of infliximab are evaluated. RESULTS: No adverse events attributable to immunosuppression cessation or changes in infliximab efficacy have been noted during a 6-month evaluation period. CONCLUSIONS: Stopping immunosuppressant therapy in Crohn's patients with a previous good response to combination therapy (azathioprine and infliximab) does not result in an increased risk of adverse events or loss of infliximab efficacy. Our results must be confirmed in larger and longer studies. Until the pathogenic role of this combined therapy in the incidence of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma is clearly defined, we consider that monotherapy with infliximab after a period on combined treatment is a safe and effective strategy.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Adalimumab is a fully-humanized anti-TNF a antibody that has showed its efficacy in Crohn's disease (CD) adult patients. Its less immunogenic composition seems to be an advantage compared to previous anti-TNF alpha, mainly infliximab. Good response to adalimumab has been reported in patients naive to infliximab, in those in whom infliximab has shown no efficacy and in those intolerant or who have lost previous response to it. Adalimumab has shown also its efficacy as a second-line anti-TNF alpha in small series of paediatric CD but data regarding its use in children naive to infliximab are scarce. AIM: To report our experience with adalimumab as first line anti-TNF alpha treatment in paediatric CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four CD paediatric patients (2 boys) previously naive to infliximab have received adalimumab. Mean age at diagnosis: 13 years, 4 months. Adalimumab was initiated in our patients soon after diagnosis (mean time from diagnosis: 8.5 months, range: 1 month 15 days-14 months) at decreasing loading doses (160 mg and 80 mg two weeks after) and then 40 mg subsequently every two weeks. RESULTS: The four patients entered in remission after the first dose of adalimumab (mean previous PCDAI: 35, mean PCDAI after first dose: 3.6). No adverse effects were registered. Azathioprine was stopped after 4 months of combination therapy, without loss of efficacy or adverse reactions attributable to immunogenicity. All the 4 patients have remained in remission on adalimumab monotherapy for a mean follow-up of 17 months (range 9-20 months). CONCLUSION: Adalimumab has shown its efficacy in our paediatric CD patients naive to other anti-TNF alpha drugs. Early introduction of anti-TNF alpha antibodies in these patients could help to a better control of the disease. Its less immunogenicity and the possibility of a home-based administration are advantages when compared to other parenteral anti-TNF treatments. Change to monotherapy after prior successful combination therapy with azathioprine and adalimumab is a safe strategy that can help to minimize possible risks of intensive immunomodulation.},

For meta-analysis, only randomized, blinded controlled trials unrestricted by language were included. Pre-clinical studies, volunteer studies and uncontrolled studies were excluded from the review of efficacy and meta-analysis, but included in the systematic review. Of 31 randomized, placebo-controlled treatment arms in 27 trials (encompassing 5029 study patients), S. boulardii was found to be significantly efficacious and safe in 84% of those treatment arms. A meta-analysis found a significant therapeutic efficacy for S. boulardii in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) (RR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.35-0.63, P < 0.001). In adults, S. boulardii can be strongly recommended for the prevention of AAD and the traveler's diarrhea. Randomized trials also support the use of this yeast probiotic for prevention of enteral nutrition-related diarrhea and reduction of Helicobacter pylori treatment-related symptoms. S. boulardii shows promise for the prevention of C. difficile disease recurrences; treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, acute adult diarrhea, Crohn's disease, giardiasis, human immunodeficiency virus-related diarrhea; but more supporting evidence is recommended for these indications. The use of S. boulardii as a therapeutic probiotic is evidence-based for both efficacy and safety for several types of diarrhea.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Although Crohn Disease (CD) can affect any part of the digestive tract its presentation in the upper digestive tract (UDT) is very uncommon. Recently we have seen some patients with CD in UDT. Because our Institute is a third level reference hospital in Mexico, we decided to review all patients with CD looking for those with UDT in order to know their clinical. MATERIAL AND METHODS: [corrected] Clinical records of all patients with histological diagnosis of CD were reviewed. Clinical and biochemical analysis was done in each case. Location of CD was established by endoscopy or radiology methods. Statistical differences were evaluated by Student t test,Fisher exact test and X2 test. RESULTS: The diagnosis of CD was established in 72 patients during the period of study (13 years). Sixty of them had distal CD while lesions in the upper digestive tract were detected in 12 (17%). Clinical parameters that showed statistical differences between patients with UDT and LDT-CD were: Age: 29.8+/-13.8 vs. 49.8+/-17 years (p=0.035), BMI: 19.6+/-3.6 vs. 22.6+/-4.9 kg/m2 (p=0.001) and platelets count: 561.4+/-242 vs. 408+/-165/mm3 (p=0.021), respectively. Patients with UDT-CD had more frequency of dysphagia, odinophagia and oral ulcers when compared with LDT affected patients. Six patients had esophageal involvement, three showed oral lesions,two pharyngeal ulcers and one duodenal ulcer. In all but one patient lesions in the distal part were concomitantly detected. Thus only in one case isolated UDT involvement was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Mexicans patients with UDT-CD were younger, had a lower BMI and a higher platelets count when compared with LDT-CD patients. Solitary lesions in esophagus, stomach and duodenum are rare, occurring only in 1 of the 72 cases (3%). Dysphagia, odinophagia and oral ulcers must be a warning about the possibility of CD in the UDT portions.},

   abstract = {This review provides an overview of the current status of the chemistry and biology of di-D-fructose dianhydrides (DFAs) with a focus on their potential as functional foods. The history of this family of cyclic ketodisaccharides has expanded for almost 100 years and offers a paradigmatic example of artificial synthetic molecules that were identified as natural products later on and finally encountered in our own table. Issued from fundamental investigations on the reactivity of carbohydrates in strongly acidic media, DFAs remained laboratory curiosities for decades. Early reports on their isolation from plants raised doubts, until the formation of some DFA representatives by the action of microorganisms on fructans was reported in the middle 1980s. Since then, research on DFAs has run in parallel in the areas of microbiology and carbohydrate chemistry. Evidence of the potential of these compounds as functional food was accumulated from both sides, with the development of biotechnological processes for mass production of selected candidates and of chemical methodologies to prepare DFA-enriched products from sucrose or inulin. In 1994 a decisive discovery in the field took place in the laboratory of Jacques Defaye in Grenoble, France: the presence of DFAs in a commercial sucrose caramel was evidenced in a quite significant 18% mass proportion! The development of an efficient analytical protocol for DFAs and the stereoselective synthesis of individual standards allowed one to demonstrate that DFAs and their glycosylated derivatives (glycosyl-DFAs) are universally formed during caramelization reactions. They are not potential food products; they have actually always been in our daily food. Most important, they seem to exert beneficial effects: they are acariogenic, low-caloric, and promote the growth of beneficial microflora in the gut. Most recent evidence indicates that DFAs can even protect the intestinal tract against agressive agents favor the assimilation of antioxidants, and act as a drug-like food for the treatment of colon ailments such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease). The development of efficient methodologies for the preparation of DFA-enriched caramels, compatible with the food and agricultural industry regulations, may lead to new natural functional foods and nutraceuticals based on DFAs in the near future.},

The aim was to analyze pediatric CD activity at diagnosis, its influence on pediatrician's prescribing behavior, and clinical outcome 5 years later. METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter study we divided pediatric CD patients at diagnosis into mild or moderate-severe disease. We compared initial therapies, duration of first remission, number of exacerbations, height-for-age and weight-for-height evolvement, and cumulative duration of systemic steroid use in a 5-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Forty-three children were included (25 with mild and 18 with moderate-severe disease). Aminosalicylate monotherapy was more frequently prescribed in the mild group (40% versus 17%; P < 0.01). The median duration of systemic steroid use was 18.3 months in the mild group and 10.4 months in the moderate-severe group (P = 0.09). Duration of first remission was 15.0 months in the mild group and 23.4 months in the moderate-severe group (P = 0.16). The mean number of exacerbations was 2.2 in the mild group and 1.8 in the moderate-severe group (P = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: CD patients with mild disease were treated with aminosalicylate monotherapy more frequently. These patients, however, tend to have more exacerbations, shorter duration of first remission, and longer total duration of systemic steroid use. Our data support the concept that severity of disease at diagnosis does not reliably predict subsequent clinical course. This study suggests that there is no indication that children with mild CD should be treated differently compared to children with moderate-severe disease.},

There are numerous methods for the assessment of nutritional status, but the gold standard has not yet been established. The aims of the study were to estimate the prevalence of undernutrition and to evaluate methods for routine nutritional assessment of active IBD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with active Crohn disease, 53 patients with active ulcerative colitis and 30 controls were included in the study. The nutritional status was assessed by extensive anthropometric measurements, percentage of weight loss in the past 1-6 months and biochemical markers of nutrition. RESULTS: All investigated nutritional parameters were significantly different in IBD patients compared to control subjects, except MCV, tryglicerides and serum total protein level. Serum albumin level and body mass index (BMI) were the most predictive parameters of malnutrition. According to different assessment methods the prevalence of undernutrition and severe undernutrition in patients with active IBD were 25.0%-69.7% and 1.3%-31.6%, respectively, while in the control subjects no abnormalities have been detected. There was no statistically significant difference of nutritional parameters between UC and CD patients except lower mid-arm muscle circumference in UC group. CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition is common in IBD patients. BMI and serum albumin are simple and convenient methods for the assessment of the nutritional status in IBD patients. Further studies with larger group of patients are necessary to elucidate the prevalence of malnutrition and the most accurate assessment methods in IBD patients.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a chronic condition of the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous inflammation that occurs in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form fistulae. The cause is unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of medical treatments to induce remission in adults with Crohn's disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce and maintain remission in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce remission in adults with colonic Crohn's disease? What are the effects of medical interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease; and to maintain remission following surgery? What are the effects of lifestyle interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 93 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aminosalicylates, antibiotics, azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral), enteral nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection, segmental colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor weight gain and growth can be caused by many medical, nutritional, behavioral, and psychological factors. Crohn disease is one of the more common gastrointestinal etiologies associated with growth failure. The aim of this study is to determine the role of capsule endoscopy (CE) in the evaluation of older children and adolescents who were referred to a pediatric gastroenterology service for a chief complaint of unexplained growth failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of children with growth failure undergoing CE between August 2002 and November 2005. Height and weight (expressed as z scores) were recorded at least 6 months before study, at the time of the study, and at least 6 months post study. All of the patients had celiac disease and Crohn disease excluded using standard biochemical, radiologic, endoscopic, and histologic assessment. RESULTS: Seven children (4 males and 3 females) were included in the study-mean age 11.7+/-3.6 years. Indications for CE were growth failure associated with abdominal pain (3 patients), diarrhea and apthous ulcers (2 patients), delayed puberty (1 patient), or a family history of Crohn disease (1 patient). The mean z score for weight at the time of the study was 2.10+/-1.0 and for height was 1.50+/-0.7 All 7 children had normal small bowel series performed before the CE. All had both endoscopically and histologically normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. In 4 of 7 patients, multiple small bowel apthous ulcerations consistent with Crohn disease were identified by CE. All 4 patients who had abnormal CE were treated and started gaining weight. The mean z score for weight after 6 months of treatment was 1.35+/-1.2 and for height was 0.50+/-1.7. The mean z score for weight after treatment was significantly improved compared with the mean z score at diagnosis (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, 4 of the 7 older children and adolescents with unexplained growth failure and normal small bowel series were found to have Crohn disease involving the small intestine. In addition, we were able to show the improvement on the mean z score for weight after treatment of small bowel Crohn disease was instituted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease have defects in intestinal epithelial permeability that are inadequately explained by known inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility genes. E-cadherin (CDH1) plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier and its cellular localisation is disrupted in patients with Crohn's disease. AIM: To determine if polymorphisms in the CDH1 gene are associated with Crohn's disease and to determine the function associated with these polymorphisms. METHODS: The hypothesis was tested using a candidate gene approach using 20 Tag SNPs derived from the HapMap and Crohn's disease trios. Functional studies were carried out using HapMap cell lines and polarised epithelial cell lines (MDCK-1 and Caco2). RESULTS: Here we show that CDH1 is associated with Crohn's disease in 327 trios (rs10431923 excess transmission of "TT" genotype; p = 0.0020) and is replicated in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium CD data set (TT risk allele; OR 1.2, p = 0.005). Patients with the Crohn's disease risk haplotype (rs12597188, rs10431923 and rs9935563; GTC allelic frequency 21%; p = 0.000016) exhibited increased E-cadherin cytoplasmic accumulation in their intestinal epithelium which may be explained by the presence of a novel truncated form of E-cadherin. Accordingly, expression of this truncated E-cadherin in cultured polarised epithelial cells resulted in abnormal intracellular accumulation and impaired plasma membrane localisation of both E-cadherin and beta-catenin. CONCLUSION: The mis-localisation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin may explain the increased permeability seen in some patients with Crohn's disease. Thus, the polymorphisms identified in CDH1 are important for understanding the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and point to a defect in barrier defence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rifaximin, Food and Drug Administration approved for traveler's diarrhea, has been used in adult patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This retrospective review was undertaken to determine its role in the treatment of pediatric IBD. METHODS: A review of children with IBD, who were treated with rifaximin from 2005 to 2007 at our institution, was performed. Collected data included diagnosis, age, medication history, recent therapy, symptom, and interval to improvement. Response was rated as none, moderate, or optimum relief for each symptom. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were identified, 12 with Crohn disease and 11 with ulcerative colitis (UC) with a median age of 13 years. The most common complaints were diarrhea in 20 patients (87%), abdominal pain in 17 (74%), and bloody stools in 15 (65%). Rifaximin was given at doses ranging between 10 and 30 mg/kg (Table 1). Of the 20 patients who presented with diarrhea 5 (25%) had relief of diarrhea within 1 week of starting rifaximin and total of 12 patients (60%) experienced relief within 4 weeks. Abdominal pain resolved in 3 of 17 patients (17.6%) within 1 week and in 12 of 17 (70.6%) within 4 weeks. Visible bleeding resolved in 10 of 15 patients (66.7%) within 4 weeks of therapy (Table 2). Analysis of concurrent medications showed 61% experienced relief of symptoms when addition of rifaximin was the only meaningful treatment change. CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin was well-tolerated and showed favorable results. Larger doses of rifaximin were statistically better for abdominal pain. Further studies are needed to evaluate efficacy and optimal dosing of rifaximin in this population.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral tacrolimus treatment of acute and severe UC or CD to induce their remission, and also to assess its efficacy in delaying or avoiding surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a retrospective study that included all patients under 18 years of age with acute and severe bouts of CD (colonic or ileocolonic location) or UC who were treated with oral tacrolimus at our institution from January 1998 to December 2007. RESULTS: We included a total of 8 patients (4 males and 4 females), 6 presented with UC and 2 had CD. The mean age of our patients at the start of the treatment was 11.8 years (range 2.75-16.58 y) and the mean time from diagnosis to the start of tacrolimus therapy was 4 months (range 1-96 m). An initial response was obtained in 50% of patients. Plasma trough levels of tacrolimus remained between 5-11 ng/ml. Six of the eight patients (75%) required surgery. In one patient with UC and in another with CD, surgery was avoided. In 2 of the 6 patients with UC, surgery was postponed beyond 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus is useful in inducing clinical remission in patients with acute and severe bouts of UC or CD, and so can avoid or delay the surgery; it may also be used as a bridging agent until the new maintenance therapy with other immunosuppressants is effective.},

Although biological agents are alternative treatments, they may not be suitable or available to some patients. AIM: To review the evidence for use of nonbiological drugs in the treatment of patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines. METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed for English language publications with predetermined search criteria to identify relevant studies. RESULTS: Published evidence from uncontrolled series and controlled clinical trials has been used to produce a practical approach relevant to clinical practice which incorporates the indication, optimal dose, and side effects of various therapies including tacrolimus, methotrexate, thalidomide, tioguanine, mycophenolate mofotil, leucocyte apheresis, nutritional therapy, antibiotics, probiotics, allopurinol, rectal acetarsol and ciclosporin in the treatment of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Approaches to optimise thiopurine efficacy are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines may respond to alternative anti-inflammatory chemical molecules, but the evidence base for many of these alternatives is limited and further trials are needed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of perioperative combined nutritional support in patients with Crohn disease. METHODS: From January 2000 to June 2008, 165 patients with Crohn disease receiving perioperative nutritional support were included in this retrospective analysis. The patients were divided into three groups according to the ways of nutritional support: total enteral nutrition group, total parenteral nutrition group and combined nutrition group; there were 55 patients in each group. Each group had the same treatment except for nutritional support. The efficacy of different approaches of nutritional support was analyzed and compared among the groups. RESULTS: Compared with total enteral and total parenteral nutrition, combined nutrition supplied more sufficient energy, the nutritional status improved more significant in short time; pre-albumin, transferrin, lymphocytes and platelet count increased significantly. The disease remission rate in combined nutrition group was 80.0%, better than 76.4% in total enteral nutrition group and 74.5% in total parenteral nutrition group. The morbidity rate was 10.9% in combined nutrition group, and it was lower than that in total enteral nutrition group and total parenteral nutrition group (25.4% and 18.2%, respectively). The length of hospital stay was shorter and the treatment was more cost-effective in combined nutrition group. CONCLUSION: For patients with Crohn disease, perioperative combined nutritional support is more efficient than total enteral or parental nutrition support.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory disorders of the intestinal tract with excessive production of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and reactive oxygen species. Although nitric oxide (NO) is reported to be involved in the onset and progression of IBDs, it remains controversial as to whether NO is toxic or protective in experimental colitis. We investigated the effects of oral nitrite as a NO donor on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis in mice. Mice were fed DSS in their drinking water with or without nitrite for up to 7days. The severity of colitis was assessed by disease activity index (DAI) observed over the experimental period, as well as by the other parameters, including colon lengths, hematocrit levels, and histological scores at day 7. DSS treatment induced severe colitis by day 7 with exacerbation in DAI and histological scores. We first observed a significant decrease in colonic nitrite levels and increase in colonic TNF-alpha expression at day 3 after DSS treatment, followed by increased colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and increased colonic expressions of both inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) at day 7. Oral nitrite supplementation to colitis mice reversed colonic nitrite levels and TNF-alpha expression to that of normal control mice at day 3, resulting in the reduction of MPO activity as well as iNOS and HO-1 expressions in colonic tissues with clinical and histological improvements at day 7. These results suggest that oral nitrite inhibits inflammatory process of DSS-induced experimental colitis by supplying nitrite-derived NO instead of impaired colonic NOS activity.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients with newly diagnosed IBD during the period of 1994-2005 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: In the 12-year study period, 137 children received new diagnoses of IBD, 60% had Crohn disease (CD), 28% had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 12% had indeterminate colitis (IC). The mean annual incidence of IBD for the whole 12-year period was 4.03/100,000 children; for CD 2.42, for UC 1.14, and for IC 0.47. The annual incidence of IBD rose from 3.04 in the period 1994-1999 to 5.14 in the period 2000-2005. The incidences of CD, UC, and IC rose from 1.99, 0.77, and 0.28, respectively, in the first 6 years to 2.88, 1.57, and 0.69, respectively, in the second 6-year period. The most common type of CD at presentation was inflammatory. Pancolitis was the most frequent form of UC. Almost half of the patients had a severe form of CD at its onset. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of total pediatric IBD in central and western Slovenia is high and seems to be still rising. CD is the most prevalent form of IBD; its incidence is comparable with that reported in other central and western European countries. The incidences of UC and IC are rising more rapidly than the incidence of CD.},

   abstract = {The exact aetiology of Crohn's disease remains unknown. The consensus is that the disease results from a complex interaction between genes, immunity and environmental factors. Diet is attractive, in theory, as an environmental risk factor in the aetiology of the disease. The epidemiological data, often impeded by methodological issues, have failed to confirm a direct link between pre-diet illness and the development of Crohn's disease. Once diagnosed, however, nutrition has an important role in disease management. Among the nutritional issues are malnutrition, weight loss and suboptimal nutritional status; these outcomes may be present at any stage of the disease but are likely to be overt during acute illness and hospitalisation. Malnutrition has been identified in approximately 40% of hospital admissions with Crohn's disease and is associated with higher mortality, longer hospital stays and higher healthcare costs. Patients in remission may indeed be overweight and appear to be influenced by the general population trends toward overweight and obesity. Irrespective of BMI, patients are at risk of micronutrient deficiencies. Vitamin D deficiency, for example, is common in Crohn's disease and has important implications for bone health. Moreover, newer evidence suggests that vitamin D has potential anti-inflammatory effects. Dietary approaches, in the form of enteral nutrition, have previously been shown to reduce inflammation and treat the active disease. Current guidelines now recommend that corticosteroids are more effective than enteral nutrition for treating adults. Enteral nutrition has important growth and developmental benefits and continues to be a recommended therapy for children with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Fistula formation in patients with Crohn's disease is a common complication during the course of the disease. Perianal and enteroenteric are the most common forms of fistulas, whereas the involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract with gastrocolic and duodenocolic fistulas represents an extremely unusual condition. Moreover, hyperthyroidism in association with Crohn's disease has been rarely described. CASE PRESENTATION: We present here a rare case of a 25-year-old male with simultaneous onset of hyperthyroidism and fistulizing Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease was complicated with intra-abdominal fistulas involving the upper gastrointestinal tract (duodenocolic, gastrocolic) and an intra-peritoneal abscess formation in the lesser sac. We describe the clinical presentation and therapeutic management of the patient including both medical treatment and surgical intervention. Despite intense medical treatment with total parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, aminosalicylates and corticosteroids the clinical course of the disease was suboptimal. Finally, the patient underwent laparotomy and right hemi-colectomy with ileo-transverse anastomosis performed, with simultaneous drainage of the abdominal abscess and primary closure of the upper gastrointestinal tract openings (gastric, duodenal and jejunal) at one stage operation. Although the surgical approach definitively cured the perforating complications of the disease (fistulas and abscess), the luminal disease in the colon remnant was still active and steroid-refractory. The subsequent successful treatment with infliximab, azathioprine and mesalazine resulted in the induction and maintenance of the disease remission. Thyrotoxicosis was successfully treated with methimazole and the hyperthyroidism has definitely subsided. CONCLUSION: The management of intra-abdominal fistulas in Crohn's disease is a complex issue, requiring a multi-disciplinary approach and 'tailoring' of the treatment to the individual patient's needs. Probably, a sensible approach involves early surgical intervention with prior optimization of the patient's general condition when feasible. Common autoimmune mechanisms are probably involved in thyroid dysfunction associated with Crohn's disease. Moreover, diagnosis and treatment of coexisting thyroid disorder in patients with Crohn's disease has a favorable impact in disease prognosis.},

She appeared malnourished and her symptoms were refractory to previous treatment with acid-suppressive drugs, prokinetics and antiemetics. Her medical history was significant for a diagnosis of juvenile polyposis syndrome at the age of 14 resulting in a transverse colectomy, and a diagnosis of Crohn's disease in her residual colon at the age of 35 resulting in a total colectomy. INVESTIGATIONS: Physical examination, blood analysis, esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy, abdominal endoscopic ultrasound, abdominal CT scan, MRI, 24 h urine analysis, MIBG scintigraphy, ocreotide scintigraphy, fluorodeoxyglucose-PET scan and genetic testing for defined polyposis syndromes (SMAD4, BMPR1A). DIAGNOSIS: Juvenile polyposis syndrome with outlet obstruction of the stomach and excessive hypergastrinemia. MANAGEMENT: Continuous acid-suppressive therapy, prokinetic therapy and total parenteral nutrition. Repetitive endoscopic polypectomy (also known as debulking) was performed twice and was followed by gastrectomy with duodenoesophageal anastomosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor is an adipocytokine possessing a well-established lipolytic effect. In Crohn's disease (CD) patients, infliximab therapy may thus result in visceral fat accumulation, which is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. METHODS: A total of 132 CD patients were investigated. In a first prospective study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quantification of subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat was performed before and 8 weeks after initiation of infliximab induction therapy (5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6) in 21 responding patients treated for perianal disease. In a second prospective study, fasting glycemia, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were assessed in 111 responding patients receiving infliximab infusions every 8 weeks, with a mean follow-up of 41 weeks. RESULTS: A significant homogeneous 18% increase in total abdominal fat was observed in the 21 CD patients after infliximab induction therapy (P = 0.027), independently of body mass index evolution. Infliximab maintenance therapy was associated with a decrease in glycemia (P < 0.0001) and HbA1c (P = 0.0005) concentrations, together with an increase in both total cholesterol (P = 0.02) and HDL cholesterol (P = 0.008) concentrations. All glycemic and lipid parameters remained within the normal range throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab induction therapy is associated with a significant increase in abdominal fat tissue in CD patients. Infliximab maintenance therapy has no deleterious effects on lipid profile and is accompanied by a decrease in glycemia and HbA1c concentrations, probably by reversing the impairment of tumor necrosis factor-induced insulin-mediated glucose uptake.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have reported on the surgical outcomes of colectomy in pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients diagnosed with UC who underwent colectomy at UCSF between 1980 and 2005 to identify early (within 30 days) and later complications of surgery. RESULTS: Complete medical records were available for 31 patients [12.4 +/- 3.3 (range 6-19) years] with UC who underwent colectomy at UCSF Children's Hospital. Total colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) was performed in 21 of the 31 patients (12 without diverting ileostomy). Five of the 31 patients had an initial colectomy with IPAA and J-pouch performed later; 4 had an initial subtotal colectomy for urgent indications. Only one of 31 had IPAA with S-pouch. The median number of early postoperative complications was 1.0; 4 required additional surgery to treat complications. The most common early complications were small intestinal obstruction in 6 (19%) and wound infection in 4 (13%). Preoperative medications included corticosteroids in 25 (81%), 6-mercaptopurine/azathioprine in 10 (32%), and 5-aminosalicylates in 19 (61%). Medication exposure was not related to postoperative complications. Late complications included pouchitis in 12 (39%), anastomotic, anal, or rectal strictures in 5 (16%), and fistulas in 5 (16%); 1 (3%) was subsequently diagnosed as having Crohn disease. CONCLUSIONS: Postcolectomy morbidity is common among pediatric patients with UC. Preoperative medications were not associated with postoperative complications. Investigations to determine preoperative factors affecting surgical outcomes and long-term satisfaction following this surgery in a large pediatric cohort are needed.},

   abstract = {Bacterial sensing is crucial for appropriate response by the innate and adaptive immune system against invading microorganisms. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in bacterial recognition, CARD15 and TLR4, increased the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a New Zealand Caucasian case-control cohort. We now consider the effects of SNPs in CD14, TLR9, and BPI, analyzed individually, in association with one another, and with SNPs in CARD15 or TLR4 in this same population group. SNPs in CD14 (c.-159 C>T), TLR9 (c.-1237T>C) and BPI (c.645A>G) showed no significant allele or genotype frequency differences between IBD cases and controls. Genotype-phenotype mapping reveals an association with BPI and ileocolonic Crohn's disease (CD) as well as an association with CD14 and early-onset ulcerative colitis (UC). Genotype interaction analyses using three different statistical approaches provided significant evidence of interaction for the following combinations: CARD15/TLR4 (CD and UC), CARD15/CD14 (CD and UC), CD14/TLR4 (UC only), and CD14/BPI (UC only). A trend for an association between BPI and TLR4 was observed in UC patients, but failed to reach statistical significance. Our findings support the idea of gene-gene interactions for genes involved in closely related pathways (i.e. bacterial detection). There is evidence that carrying two SNPs in genes may lead to statistical significance for genes and SNPs that do not otherwise confirm as risk alleles for disease aetiology when analysed alone.},

   abstract = {Carrying a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (L503F, c. 1672 C>T) in the gene for the Na-dependent organic cation transporter (OCTN1), increases the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) in some, but not all, populations. Case-control data on New Zealand Caucasians show no differences for CD risk between individuals carrying the L503F OCTN1 C-allele when compared with those carrying the variant T-allele. However, more of the New Zealand CD cases report intolerance to maize and mushrooms than those who report beneficial effects or no differences. The OCTN1 gene encodes a transporter for ergothionine, a fungal metabolite at high levels in mushrooms but not widely common in other dietary items. An inability to tolerate mushrooms showed statistically significant associations with the variant OCTN1 genotype. That is, among those individuals reporting adverse effects from mushrooms, there was a higher frequency of the variant T-allele when compared with the general population, or with CD patients overall. We believe that this is a novel gene-diet association, suggesting that individuals carrying the OCTN1 variant single nucleotide polymorphism may have an enhanced risk of adverse symptoms associated with consuming mushrooms. Nutrigenomic approaches to dietary recommendations may be appropriate in this group.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We analyzed growth outcomes in children newly diagnosed with Crohn disease and determined whether growth abnormalities persist despite current therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and growth data were prospectively obtained on an inception cohort younger than 16 years old at diagnosis and Tanner I to III during the study. RESULTS: In all, 176 children (mean age 10.1 years; 65% male) with mild (33%) or moderate/severe (67%) disease at diagnosis were studied. Disease activity at 1 year was inactive/mild (89%) or moderate/severe (11%). First-year treatments included immunomodulators (60%), corticosteroids (77%), 5-aminosalicylates (61%), infliximab (15%), and enteral nutrition (10%). By 2 years, 86% had received immunomodulators and 36% infliximab. Mean height z scores at diagnosis, 1 year, and 2 years were -0.49 +/- 1.2 standard deviations (SDs), -0.50 +/- 1.2, and -0.46 +/- 1.1, respectively. Of the subjects, 10%, 8%, and 6.5% had height z scores less than -2 SD at diagnosis, 1 year, and 2 years. A height velocity z score less than -1SD was seen in 45% of subjects at 1 year and 38% at 2 years. The mean height velocity z score, however, increased between 1 and 2 years from -0.71 to 0.26 (P < 0.03). Corticosteroid use greater than 6 months in the first year was associated with abnormal height velocity at 1 year (adjusted odds ratio = 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.2-9.6). No statistically significant effect on height velocity z scores was noted when comparing those receiving or not receiving infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: Growth delay persists in many children with CD following diagnosis, despite improved disease activity and the frequent use of immunomodulators and biologics. Additional strategies to improve growth outcomes require development.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fecal lactoferrin (FL) is a noninvasive biomarker that is elevated in Crohn disease (CD) compared to irritable bowel syndrome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate FL in identifying children with active versus inactive CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fresh stool samples were collected from children with CD scheduled for endoscopy or a clinic visit, and from new outpatients who were scheduled for colonoscopy. FL was determined using a polyclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Physical global assessment, endoscopic findings, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the Pediatric CD Activity Index (PCDAI) were recorded for patients with CD. The PCDAI scores symptoms, laboratory parameters, physical examination, and extraintestinal manifestations. A score of </=10 is inactive disease, 11 to 30 is mild active, and </=31 is moderate to severe active. RESULTS: Of 101 study patients (4- to 20-year-old, 66 boys), 31 had active CD, 23 had inactive CD, and 37 had noninflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) conditions. Four patients with ulcerative colitis and 6 patients with polyposis were excluded from analysis. FL was significantly elevated in CD versus non-IBD (P < 0.001) and in active versus inactive CD (P < 0.001). The PCDAI and ESR were higher in active CD than in inactive CD (both P < 0.001). Using an FL cutoff of 7.25 mug/g, FL has 100% sensitivity and 100% negative predictive value in detecting active CD. Using an FL cutoff level of 60 mug/g, FL had 84% sensitivity, 74% specificity, 81% positive predictive value, and 77% negative predictive value for detecting active CD. CONCLUSIONS: FL is a promising biomarker of active CD and may be more practical to use when it is not feasible to obtain all of the necessary clinical information for the PCDAI.},

   abstract = {Probiotics have been suggested as an alternative therapeutical approach in the intervention of inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Application of single strains or probiotic mixtures has shown promising results in animal models and patients of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We recently demonstrated potent inhibitory capacity of a Bifidobacterium bifidum S17 on LPS-induced inflammatory events in cell culture models using intestinal epithelial cells and verified these anti-inflammatory effects in two mouse models of colitis. In the present study we analyze the anti-inflammatory effect of this potential probiotic strain in a chemically-induced model of colitis in C57BL/6 mice. This model is characterized by a strong type 1T helper (Th1) response resembling Crohn's disease, one of the two most prevalent forms of IBD. We performed macroscopic analysis and determined the effect of B. bifidum S17 on the cytokine balance in biopsies of the colonic mucosa. While treatment with B. bifidum S17 only had a marginal effect on weight loss, no difference was observed in the macroscopic parameters. However, a significant reduction in histology scores and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and the inflammatory markers cyclooxigenase 2 (Cox-2) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) was observed. These results indicate that treatment with B. bifidum S17 is able to partially inhibit the strong Th1-driven intestinal inflammation induced in our model of colitis.},

The costs of managing complex chronic care at home cannot be completely understood until all out-of-pocket costs have been defined, described, and tabulated.

National health care reform must take into account the long-term financial burdens of families caring for those with complex home care. Any changes that may increase the out-of-pocket costs or health insurance costs to these families can also have a negative long-term impact on society when greater numbers of patients declare bankruptcy or qualify for medical disability.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Childhood-onset Crohn's disease (CD) might reflect a more severe form of disease. To test this hypothesis we analyzed the long-term natural history of CD in an adult cohort of patients with childhood-onset compared to adult-onset CD. METHODS: We selected 206 childhood-onset CD patients among 2992 adult patients with a diagnosis of CD established before December 31, 2000. Disease characteristics were prospectively assessed during follow-up until December 2007 and compared to adult-onset CD patients matched 2 to 1 on gender, year of CD diagnosis, and disease location. RESULTS: Compared to adult-onset CD, patients with childhood-onset CD were more likely to have a severe disease, with an increased year-by-year disease activity index (37% of patient-years in childhood-onset group versus 31% in the adult-onset group, P < 0.001). Immunosuppressant requirement was also increased with a 10-year cumulative risk of 54 +/- 3% in childhood-onset CD group versus 45 +/- 2%, in the adult-onset CD group (P < 0.001). Cumulative risks of stricturing and penetrating complications and surgical resections were not statistically different between groups. Accordingly, these events occurred at a younger age in the childhood-onset CD group. At the age of 30 years the actuarial risk of having undergone an extensive intestinal resection was 48 +/- 5% in the childhood-onset group versus 14 +/- 2% in the adult-onset group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with childhood-onset CD exhibit a more active disease and require more immunosuppressive therapy. This feature is observed irrespective of the disease location, suggesting an intrinsic more severe phenotype.},

   abstract = {Mucosal healing (MH) has emerged as an important treatment goal for patients with IBD. Historically, the therapeutic goals of induction and maintenance of clinical remission seemed insufficient to change the natural history of IBD. Evidence has now accumulated to show that MH can alter the course of IBD, as it is associated with sustained clinical remission, and reduced rates of hospitalization and surgical resection. In patients with ulcerative colitis, MH may represent the ultimate therapeutic goal because inflammation is limited to the mucosa. In patients with Crohn's disease, which is a transmural disease, MH could be considered as a minimum therapeutic goal. This Review focuses on the definition of MH and discusses the ability of each available IBD medication to induce and maintain MH. The importance of achieving MH is also discussed and literature that demonstrates improvement of disease course with MH is reviewed. Finally, we discuss how best to integrate the treatment end point of MH into clinical practice for the management of patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {THE AIM: The aim of this thesis was to elucidate more differences between a familial and sporadic inflammatory bowel disease by comparing certain clinical data. METHODS: We assessed 248 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) observed in 1994-2004 in the Academic Department of Gastroenterology at the Medical Faculty in Hradec Kralove. To get information about the defined characters we obtained from the questionary and the hospital data. RESULTS: We did not identify any relationship between the onset of the disease and a certain age group, yet males seem to be more prone to familial Crohn's disease. The more frequent familial form of Crohn's disease was the fibro-stenotic one. There were no differences in the onset of the disease. We did not prove the differences in extraintestinal signs, alergy and comorbidities. We did not find any differences in therapy response in relation to the type of nutrition (enteral, parenteral) and the administration of immunosupresive drugs. The biological therapy in sporadic and familial Crohn's disease did not differ either. Surgical intervention was more frequent in Crohn's patients compared to the patients with ulcerative colitis; yet no difference was identified between familial and sporadic cases. Appendectomy carried out before the onset of the disease was later diagnosed as Crohn's disease in more instances than ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSION: We did not prove significant differences comparing certain clinical data in familial and sporadic form of inflammatory bowel disease, yet males seem to be more prone to familial Crohn's disease. Small bowel was involved more often in familial form of Crohn's disease than in sporadic form.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, together popularly known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are characterized by a number of extraintestinal manifestations. Although infrequent, acute pancreatitis, and less often chronic pancreatitis, may occur as a result of the disease itself or secondary to the medications used in the treatment. The increased incidence of acute pancreatitis in Crohn's disease can be explained based on the high predisposition to cholesterol as well as pigment stones as a result of ileal disease, anatomic abnormalities of the duodenum, immunologic disturbances associated with IBD, and, above all, to the side effects of many medications used in the treatment. Sulfasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid, azathioprine, and 6-mercaptopurine are well known to cause acute pancreatitis as a result of a possible idiosyncratic mechanism. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis share many clinical manifestations and treatment modalities. Nonspecific elevations of serum pancreatic enzymes in IBD make it difficult to avoid over diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, particularly in patients with Crohn's disease who suffer from abdominal pain often. The IBD-pancreas association is further reflected in many reports of exocrine as well as endocrine pancreatic insufficiency.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Leptin and adiponectin (APN) are adipokines produced by adipocytes that participate in the modulation of immune and inflammatory responses. In Crohn's disease (CD), fat wrapping surrounding the inflamed intestine produces high levels of leptin and APN. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), apoptosis resistance of lamina propria T lymphocytes (LPL-T) is one of the mechanisms that maintains chronic inflammation. We addressed the mechanism by which leptin and APN regulate inflammation and apoptosis in IBD. METHODS: Immune cell infiltration, several factors expressed by adipose tissue (AT), and spontaneous release of cytokines by adipocytes were measured. The presence of APN and leptin in intestinal mucosa was detected and their effect on LPL-T apoptosis, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 (SOCS3), Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, and cytokine production was studied. In addition, the effects of globular and high-molecular-weight (HMW) APN on LPL-T cytokine production and apoptosis were studied. RESULTS: Higher levels of several chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors were present in AT near active than near inactive disease. A significantly higher amount of inflammatory infiltrate was present in AT near active CD than near ulcerative colitis, controls, and near the inactive area of CD. There were no changes in the ratios of APN molecular weight in control and IBD adipocyte products. Leptin and APN inhibited anti-CD3-stimulated-LPL-T apoptosis and potentiated STAT3 phosphorylation, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL expression in IBD and control mucosa. However, SOCS3 expression was suppressed only in IBD. Both globular and HMW APN have similar effects on LPL-T cytokine production and apoptosis. Leptin and APN enhanced interleukin (IL)-10 production by anti-CD3-stimulated LPL-T in IBD only. APN, but not leptin, increased anti-CD3-induced IL-6 levels in LPL-T only in IBD patients. IL-10 exerts its anti-inflammatory activity in the presence of SOCS3 suppression by leptin or APN. CONCLUSION: Leptin and APN maintain the inhibition of anti-CD3-stimulated LPL-T apoptosis by enhancing Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL overexpression and promoting STAT3 phosphorylation while suppressing SOCS3.},

   abstract = {Approximately 25 % of individuals with Crohn's disease (CD), a life-long relapsing-remitting disease, are diagnosed during childhood and adolescence. Symptoms of CD, including abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea, can lead to reduced food intake, which may negatively have an impact on nutritional status during this critical period of growth and development. The aims of the present study were to assess the growth and adequacy of dietary intakes of children with CD at Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, and compare with healthy controls. Sixty-three subjects aged 10-16 years were recruited, including: children with active CD (n 18), children with CD in remission (n 23) and healthy controls (n 22). Dietary intake was assessed using a FFQ and compared with current Australian recommended dietary intakes (RDI). Growth and dietary intakes were compared between groups. Subjects with active CD had lower weight and BMI Z scores than children in remission and controls. The energy intakes of children with active CD and those in remission were significantly lower than estimated energy requirements (P = 0.001 and P = 0.03 respectively). Children with active CD did not meet the RDI for Fe and their Ca intake was lower than the RDI (P = 0.04). In conclusion, the dietary intake of children with active CD was impaired, with inadequate intakes of energy, Ca and Fe. Reduced energy intakes during active disease may contribute to poor weight gain and impaired growth. Quantifying nutrient intake and ascertaining requirements for nutritional supplementation are essential components of successful management in paediatric CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to study fecal calprotectin in Scottish children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and compare its diagnostic accuracy with blood parameters. METHODS: Stool samples from 48 Scottish children (29 males, 19 females) had calprotectin measured at IBD diagnosis. The median age at diagnosis was 11.2 years (interquartile range [IQR] 8.7-13.0 years). There were 33 patients with Crohn's disease, 5 with ulcerative colitis, and 10 with IBD type unspecified. IBD was diagnosed by standard criteria. Calprotectin was measured using a commercially available kit (PhiCal Test) and 47/48 patients had comparative blood results available at diagnosis. RESULTS: The fecal calprotectin concentrations were raised in 96% (46/48) of patients studied. The median calprotectin value was 750 microg/g (IQR 235.8-1251 microug/g). In comparison with standard blood tests, 32/45 (71.1%) had abnormal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 19/38 (50.0%) had abnormal C-reactive protein, 29/46 (63.0%) had raised platelets, 12/45 (26.7%) had hypoalbuminemia, and 38/46 (82.6%) had abnormal hemoglobin. We identified 7/47 (14.9%) patients with raised calprotectin at diagnosis who did not have any abnormalities detected in the blood tests performed. All 48 patients (100%) had at least 1 abnormal blood test and/or raised calprotectin at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Calprotectin is significantly more likely to be raised than any commonly employed blood tests at IBD diagnosis. When used in combination with these bloods tests an abnormality was demonstrated in 1 or both tests in all patients at diagnosis in this study. Fecal calprotectin measurement is a significant advance when used contemporaneously and in addition to a routine panel of blood tests in the diagnosis of pediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are only a few studies on immune response to routine vaccinations in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), despite a strong need for this kind of study. The aim of the study was to evaluate the immunogenicity of an inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) in IBD pediatric patients compared with healthy controls. METHODS: This was an open, prospective, and controlled study on anti-HAV-negative children and adolescents age 2-18 years with IBD. HAV using 720 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) units were administered at 0 months and at 6-12 months. Seroconversion and geometric mean titers were measured after each vaccine dose. The evidence of local and systemic adverse effects for 3 days after the first and second dose of vaccine was registered. RESULTS: A total of 134 subjects (66 patients and 68 controls) completed the whole study course consisting of two doses of vaccine and six serum samples. There was no significant difference in the rate of seroconversion between IBD patients and controls when measured after the second dose of vaccine (97% versus 100%, P = 0.2407), but the rate was significantly lower in the IBD group when measured after the first dose (39% versus 64%, P = 0.00001). The mean geometric titers were statistically significantly lower in the IBD group than in the control group at all of the measured timepoints. There were no serious adverse events related to HAV during the study. CONCLUSIONS: HAV is both immunogenic and safe in pediatric patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {Many studies have looked at connections between diet, etiology, signs and symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although these connections are apparent to clinicians, they are difficult to prove qualitatively or quantitatively. Enteral feeding and polymeric diets are equally effective at bringing about remission in Crohn's disease (CD). Parenteral feeding is also effective, although none of these methods is as effective as corticosteroid therapy. However, enteral feeding is preferred in the pediatric population because linear growth is more adequately maintained via this route. Exclusion diets in patients brought into remission using an elemental diet have been shown to maintain remission for longer periods. Studies that aim to isolate culpable food groups have shown that individuals react differently on exposure to or exclusion of various foods. The commonly identified food sensitivities are cereals, milk, eggs, vegetables and citrus fruits. Studies that have looked at gut mucosal antigen behavior have shown higher rectal blood flow, in response to specific food antigens, in those with CD over healthy subjects. Exclusion of sugar shows little evidence of amelioration in CD. Omega 3 fatty acids show promise in the treatment of IBD but await larger randomized controlled trials. Patients frequently notice that specific foods cause aggravation of their symptoms. Whilst it has been difficult to pinpoint specific foods, with advances in the laboratory tests and food supplements available, the aim is to prolong remission in these patients using dietary measures, and reduce the need for pharmacotherapy and surgical intervention.},

   abstract = {Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease in which the insulin producing beta cell population is destroyed by the infiltrated T lymphocytes. Even though the exact cause of T1DM is yet to be ascertained, varying degree of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors have been linked to the disease progress and outcome. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is an obligate zoonotic pathogen that causes chronic infection of intestines in ruminants, the Johne's disease. MAP that can even survive pasteurization and chlorination has also been implicated to cause similar type of enteritis in humans called Crohn's disease. With the increasing recognition of the link between MAP and Crohn's disease, it has been postulated that MAP is an occult antigen which besides Crohn's could as well be thought to trigger T1DM. Epitope homologies between mycobacterial proteins (Hsp 65) and pancreatic glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD 65) and infant nutrition studies implicate MAP as one of the triggers for T1DM. PCR and ELISA analyses in diabetic patients from Sardinia suggest that MAP acts as a possible trigger for T1DM. Systematic mechanistic insights are needed to prove this link. Unfortunately, no easy animal model(s) or in-vitro systems are available to decipher the complex immunological network that is triggered in MAP infection leading to T1DM.},

Currently, the optimal management of patients who have undergone surgical resection is unknown and treatment remains subjective. Clinicians in conjunction with patients must balance the risks of recurrence against the potential risks associated with treatment. For those at very low risk of recurrence, no therapy may be needed; however, for patients at moderate risk immunomodulators should be considered. For those at highest risk of recurrence, biologic therapy, specifically antitumor necrosis factor agents, have emerged as appropriate treatment. Any postoperative management strategy should include a colonoscopy 6-12 months after surgery to identify recurrence. This review discusses current evidence for various pharmacologic approaches in the prevention of postoperative recurrence and provides guidance for clarifying patient risk.},

We evaluated whether the administration of infliximab after resective intestinal surgery for Crohn's disease reduces postoperative recurrence. METHODS: We randomly assigned 24 patients with Crohn's disease who had undergone ileocolonic resection to receive intravenous infliximab (5 mg/kg), administered within 4 weeks of surgery and continued for 1 year, or placebo. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with endoscopic recurrence at 1 year. Secondary end points were clinical recurrence and remission and histologic recurrence. RESULTS: The rate of endoscopic recurrence at 1 year was significantly lower in the infliximab group (1 of 11 patients; 9.1%) compared with the placebo group (11 of 13 patients; 84.6%) (P = .0006). There was a nonsignificant higher proportion of patients in clinical remission in the infliximab group (8 of 10; 80.0%) compared with the placebo group (7 of 13; 53.8%) (P = .38). The histologic recurrence rate at 1 year was significantly lower in the infliximab group (3 of 11 patients; 27.3%) compared with the placebo group (11 of 13 patients; 84.6%) (P = .01). The occurrence of adverse events was similar between the placebo and infliximab groups, and none occurred in the immediate postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of infliximab after intestinal resective surgery was effective at preventing endoscopic and histologic recurrence of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and both diseases lead to high morbidity and health care costs. Complex interactions between the immune system, enteric commensal bacteria and host genotype are thought to underlie the development of IBD although the precise aetiology of this group of diseases is still unknown. The understanding of the composition and complexity of the normal gut microbiota has been greatly aided by the use of molecular methods and is likely to be further increased with the advent of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approaches, which will allow an increasingly more holistic assessment of the microbiome with respect to both diversity and function of the commensal gut microbiota. Studies thus far have shown that the intestinal microbiota drives the development of the gut immune system and can induce immune homeostasis as well as contribute to the development of IBD. Probiotics which deliver some of the beneficial immunomodulatory effects of the commensal gut microbiota and induce immune homeostasis have been proposed as a suitable treatment for mild to moderate IBD. This review provides an overview over the current understanding of the commensal gut microbiota, its interactions with the mucosal immune system and its capacity to induce both gut homeostasis as well as dysregulation of the immune system. Bacterial-host events, including interactions with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on epithelial cells and dendritic cells (DCs) and the resultant impact on immune responses at mucosal surfaces will be discussed.},

In Crohn's disease placebo has been used in therapeutic trials in every relevant setting: active disease, prevention of relapse after induced medical remission and after surgery and fistulising disease. The analysis of the placebo response shows that in every setting there is a high heterogeneity demonstrating mainly that the selection of patients is not often homogeneous and that the outcome criteria used in the trials is not highly reliable. Better selection of patients and more precise definition of outcome measures are warranted to reduce the heterogeneity among placebo response in clinical trials.},

The aim of this study was to compare the body composition of outpatients with IBD during remission and active phase. In order to evaluate disease activity we used Crohn's Disease Activity Index for Crohn's disease (CD) patients and Lichtiger's Index for ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. All patients underwent the analysis of BMI, arm muscle area (AMA) and triceps plus subscapula skinfold thickness (TST+SST) to identify total, muscle and fat mass, respectively. In total 102 patients were evaluated (CD, n 50; UC, n 52) and the majority was young women. Malnutrition according to BMI was found in 14.0 % of patients with CD and 5.7 % of UC patients. Muscle mass depletion was detected in more than half of the CD and UC patients. The BMI, TST+SST and AMA values were lower in the active phase only in CD patients (P < 0.05). Fat mass depletion was associated with active phase in both CD and UC patients. Body composition parameters obtained using BMI, TST+SST and AMA were not correlated with the presence of fistula in CD patients (P>0.05). In conclusion, patients without signs of malnutrition had fat mass depletion especially in the active phase and muscle mass depletion occurred both in CD and UC patients.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that starch-entrapped microspheres would produce favourable fermentation profiles and microbial shifts during in vitro fermentation with the faecal microbiota from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In vitro fermentation was carried out using a validated, dynamic, computer-controlled model of the human colon (Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek gastro-intestinal model-2) after inoculation with pooled faeces from healthy individuals, patients with inactive IBD (Crohn's disease (CD)) or patients with active IBD (ulcerative colitis (UC)). Starch-entrapped microspheres fermented more slowly and produced more butyrate than fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) when fermented with the faecal microbiota from patients with active UC. When fermented with the microbiota from patients with inactive CD, starch-entrapped microspheres also fermented more slowly but produced similar amounts of butyrate compared with FOS. Starch-entrapped microspheres showed a greater ability to maintain a low pH during simulated-distal colon conditions compared with FOS. After fermentation with the microbiota from inactive CD patients, starch-entrapped microspheres resulted in lower concentrations of some potentially harmful gut bacteria, included in Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Fusobacterium and Veillonella, compared with FOS. These findings suggest that slow fermenting starch-entrapped microspheres may induce a favourable colonic environment in patients with IBD through high butyrate production, maintenance of low pH in the distal colon and inhibition of the growth of potentially harmful bacteria.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perianal fistulas are a debilitating manifestation of Crohn's disease (CD) in the pediatric population and present a management challenge. The aims of this study were to describe our experience using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) to guide management of perianal CD (PCD) in a pediatric population, and determine whether using EUS to monitor healing after seton placement improves outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 2 cohorts: pediatric subjects with PCD who underwent EUS and pediatric subjects who underwent seton placement between 2002 and 2007. RESULTS: In all, 25 children underwent a total of 42 EUS procedures. Of 28 EUSs performed to evaluate suspected perianal disease, complex fistulizing disease was identified in 15 (54%). Setons were placed after most EUSs demonstrating complex fistulizing disease and after none demonstrating superficial or no fistulizing disease. Of 14 EUSs performed to monitor healing around a seton, 7 (50%) demonstrated persistent peri-seton inflammation. Setons were more often left in place after an EUS revealing persistent inflammation (86% versus 0%), and the patients were more likely to have a biologic initiated or changed (57% versus 0%). Among all subjects who underwent seton placement, time from seton removal to recurrence was longer for those followed by EUS compared to those followed by physical exam only; however, we were not powered to test for statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: EUS to guide the combined medical and surgical management of PCD is feasible in the pediatric population. Larger prospective studies are needed to determine if EUS-directed management improves outcomes in pediatric patients with PCD.},

We present a case-series of 14 children with severe CD treated with adalimumab during a 3.5-year period. Fourteen children (nine boys, five girls), aged 13.9 years (range 1.9-19.1) were treated with adalimumab during 12.5 months (range 7-42). All had steroid or immunosuppression-drugs refractory disease. Ten patients (71%) had been previously treated with infliximab, 13/14 were treated with different immunosuppressive drugs and all were steroid-dependent or resistant. Seven children (50%) showed full clinical response and 5/14 (35%) improved partially. Two children (15%) had loss of response after a period of transient improvement. Adalimumab treatment enabled complete steroids withdrawal in 8/14 (57%) of steroid-dependent children. Currently, five children are in complete remission with adalimumab monotherapy for a median 14 months (range 9-24). Adalimumab may induce and maintain remission in children with severe, refractory CD. Prospective safety and efficacy confirmation of this data in children is necessary.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) is efficacious in inducing remission in severe forms of pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Adult studies indicate that IFX is also safe and well tolerated as maintenance therapy. The present study aimed to evaluate in a prospective manner the efficacy and safety of IFX as maintenance therapy of severe pediatric CD comparing scheduled and "on demand" treatment strategies. METHODS: Forty children with CD (nonpenetrating, nonstricturing as well as penetrating forms, mean age: 13.9 +/- 2.2 years) with a severe flare-up (Harvey-Bradshaw Index [HBI] > or =5, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] >20 mm/h) despite well-conducted immunomodulator therapy (n = 36 azathioprine, n = 1 mercaptopurine, n = 3 methotrexate) combined with steroids were included in this randomized, multicenter, open-label study. Three IFX infusions (5 mg/kg) were administered at week (W)0/W2/W6. At W10, clinical remission (HBI <5) and steroid withdrawal were analyzed and IFX responders were randomized to maintenance therapy over 1 year: group A, scheduled every 2 months; group B, "on demand" on relapse. RESULTS: In all, 34/40 children came into remission during IFX induction therapy (HBI: 6.7 +/- 2.5 (WO) vs. 1.1 +/- 1.5 (W10); P < 0.001). At the end of phase 2, 15/18 (83%) patients were in remission in group A compared to 8/13 (61%) children in group B (P < 0.01), with a mean HBI of 0.5 versus 3.2 points (group A versus B, P = 0.011). In group A, 3/13 (23.1%) children experienced a relapse compared to 11/12 (92%) children in group B. No severe adverse event occurred during this trial. CONCLUSIONS: IFX is well tolerated and safe as maintenance therapy for pediatric CD, with a clear advantage when used on a scheduled 2-month basis compared to an "on demand" basis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of preformed donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) as a barrier to isolated intestinal transplantation (ITx) remains ambiguous; thus, a positive cross-match has not been a contraindication to ITx. OBJECTIVE: To report the case of a patient with Crohn's disease who underwent ITx and developed immediate antibody-mediated rejection on reperfusion of the allograft. METHODS: Percent reactive antibody testing was performed using pretransplantation serum samples and at transplantation using bead-based assays (Luminex, Luminex Corp, Austin, Tex) and flow cytometry solid-phase assays (FlowPRA single-antigen beads (One Lambda, Inc, Canoga Park, Calif). Serologic tests, flow cytometry cross-matching, and flow cytometry assays of C4d-binding serum antibodies were also performed. Histologic and immunofluorescent analysis of biopsy specimens was performed. RESULTS: HLA typing revealed no sharing of class I or II antigens between donor and recipient. Pretransplantation donor-specific antibodies (DSA) were present at transplantation. Cross-matching (performed during surgery) was positive for class I and II by serologic testing and flow cytometry. After reperfusion, the graft immediately developed severe ischemic injury and arteritis on mucosal biopsy specimens, with immunoglobulin deposition. The DSA C4d binding antibodies were also present. After intense immunosuppression and plasmapheresis, the graft and the biopsy histologic findings showed marked improvement (day 2). By day 7 posttransplantation, patient and graft status were stable. The patient has remained clinically stable for more than a year after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Pretransplant DSA in ITx can be a risk factor for immediate (hyperacute) but potentially reversible antibody-mediated rejection. Thus, pretransplantation DSA and cross-match results are critical components to be considered in patients awaiting or undergoing ITx.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 301 Scottish patients with early-onset IBD-197 Crohn disease (CD), 76 ulcerative colitis (UC), 28 indeterminate colitis (IC)-and 78 healthy control individuals were studied. ASCA status (IgA, IgG) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ASCA status was then analyzed in relation to CD phenotype. RESULTS: Patients with CD had a higher prevalence of ASCA than patients with UC and healthy controls: 82/197 versus 12/76, odds ratio (OR) 3.80 (1.93-7.50) and 82/197 versus 6/78, OR 8.56 (3.55-20.62), respectively. Univariate analysis showed that positive ASCA status was associated with oral CD (17/25 vs 59/153, OR 3.39 [1.38-8.34]), perianal CD (39/77 vs 38/108, OR 1.89 [1.04-3.44]) and the presence of granulomata (63/132 vs 15/52, OR 2.25 [1.13-4.48]) and also with markers of disease severity: raised C-reactive protein (44/90 vs 12/49, OR 2.95[1.36-6.37]), hypoalbuminemia (44/85 vs 20/74, OR 2.28[1.19-4.37]), and surgery (27/49 vs 54/147, OR 2.11 [1.10-4.06]). From multivariate analysis, the presence of oral disease (adjusted P = 0.001, OR 22.22 [3.41-142.86]) and hypoalbuminemia (adjusted P = 0.01, OR 4.78 [1.40-16.39]) was found to be independently associated with ASCA status. No association was demonstrated between ASCA and IBD candidate genes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD had a higher prevalence of ASCA than did other patients with IBD. ASCA status described patients with CD who had a specific phenotype, showing an association with markers of disease severity and oral CD involvement.},

   abstract = {Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem and has an increased prevalence in patients with Crohn's disease due to their increased requirement for high-risk procedures. A balance between viral replication and host immune response exists and drugs such as the immunosuppressive agents used to treat Crohn's disease may alter this balance. These may result in a hepatic flare, which manifests as high viremia, increased transaminase levels, and hepatic decompensation. The present study describes two cases of hepatic flare thought to be caused by treatment of acute Crohn's disease with systemic corticosteroids and/or azathioprine. Both patients presented with raised transaminase and gamma glutamyl transferase levels and viremia. One patient experienced a decrease in hepatic function, as evidenced by a reduced serum albumin (2.5g/ dL) and jaundice (total bilirubin 5.2 mg/dL), and hepatic decompensation, with ascites. Both patients were treated with the nucleoside analogue entecavir 0.5 mg/day and experienced reductions in HBV-DNA and hepatic enzyme levels within 4-7 days. The patient with decompensation received diuretic therapy and parenteral nutrition to support hepatic function and a clinical improvement was seen. Both patients were discharged 2 weeks after admission and, during follow-up, HBV-DNA levels became negative after 1 and 5 months, respectively. No adverse events were reported in either patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented report of treatment of HBV flare with entecavir in patients co-affected with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Pediatric onset of Crohn disease (CD) is characterized by male sex predominance while adult-onset disease demonstrates female sex predominance. It has been postulated that this phenomenon may be genetically determined or due to an effect of estrogen on age of onset. Interleukin (IL)-6 modulates the TH17 pathway, and the IL-6 promoter is modulated by estrogen, possibly linking genetically determined inflammation and the presence of estrogen. The aim of our study was to investigate whether differences in IL-6 promoter genotype could explain male sex in earlier disease onset. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We genotyped 333 patients with CD and 100 controls, 162 pediatric-onset patients (age of onset 18 years and younger) for the IL-6-174 polymorphic site. Genotype, sex, and age of onset were compared. RESULTS: Males with IL-6-174GG genotype (the wild-type allele) had an increased risk for a younger age of onset compared to males with IL-6-174GC or CC genotype (G --> C genotype), hazard ratio (HR) 1.49, P = 0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-2.09. Females with GG genotype were not found to have an increased risk for a younger age of onset compared with females with G --> C genotype, HR 1.01, P = 0.96, 95% CI 0.72-1.41. CONCLUSIONS: Males with IL-6-174GG genotype are prone to develop CD at a younger age than males with the IL-6-174G --> C genotype. Our study suggests that age of onset may be modified by the IL-6-174GG genotype and this modification is sex dependent. This may be due to increased transcription of IL-6, an effect that may be repressed by estrogen in females.},

   abstract = {The current paradigm of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), involves the interaction between environmental factors in the intestinal lumen and inappropriate host immune responses in genetically predisposed individuals. The intestinal mucosal barrier has evolved to maintain a delicate balance between absorbing essential nutrients while preventing the entry and responding to harmful contents. In IBD, disruptions of essential elements of the intestinal barrier lead to permeability defects. These barrier defects exacerbate the underlying immune system, subsequently resulting in tissue damage. The epithelial phenotype in active IBD is very similar in CD and UC. It is characterized by increased secretion of chloride and water, leading to diarrhea, increased permeability via both the transcellular and paracellular routes, and increased apoptosis of epithelial cells. The main cytokine that seems to drive these changes is tumor necrosis factor alpha in CD, whereas interleukin (IL)-13 may be more important in UC. Therapeutic restoration of the mucosal barrier would provide protection and prevent antigenic overload due to intestinal "leakiness." Here we give an overview of the key players of the intestinal mucosal barrier and review the current literature from studies in humans and human systems on mechanisms underlying mucosal barrier dysfunction in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for developing coronary artery disease. An increase in inflammatory cytokines may result in a decrease in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) enzyme activity, leading to a characteristic lipoprotein profile with increased triglycerides and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels as seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Similar to SLE, patients with IBD have high circulatory levels of inflammatory cytokines. However, in these patients characteristic lipoprotein profiles have not been reported. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to identify and describe dyslipidemia and lipoprotein profiles in an IBD patient population. METHODS: Medical records of patients diagnosed with IBD (Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]) at an academic medical center between 2000 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed for lipoprotein lipid measurements, serum albumin levels, risk factors, and treatment to modify lipoprotein concentrations. The lipoprotein guidelines and risk factors are based on the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults. Only patients with documented IBD diagnosis and lipoprotein profiles are included in the study. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006 population database was used for control values. RESULTS: A total of 393 patients (152 men and 241 women) diagnosed with IBD (188 CD and 205 UC) who were not on statins qualified for the study. Patients were grouped on the basis of gender (male and female) and IBD disease type (CD and UC). Compared with the male NHANES samples (with similar mean age and body mass index), total cholesterol and HDL-C were significantly lower and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides were significantly greater in male patients with IBD. In female patients with IBD, the mean values for total cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglycerides were significantly lower and LDL-C significantly greater compared with the female NHANES samples. CONCLUSION: Given low levels of HDL-C and increased levels of LDL-C, a more aggressive approach in profiling and treating dyslipidemia seems warranted in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are immunologically mediated with genetic and environmental influences. Genetic factors include defective immunoregulation, mucosal integrity/repair and bacterial killing. Commensal bacteria activate pathogenic bacterial antigen-specific effector T cells that cause chronic inflammation in genetically susceptible hosts but induce protective immune responses in normal subjects. Both host and microbial specificities are important. Some bacterial species are aggressive, some are neutral and others protective, but each species has different effects in various hosts. Molecular techniques demonstrate contraction of certain bacterial populations in IBD, especially clostridial subsets, and expansion of others, including Enterobacteriaceae. The balance of beneficial and detrimental bacterial species determines homeostasis vs. inflammation; this balance can be manipulated by antibiotics, probiotics and prebiotics to treat and prevent relapses of IBD. Adherent/invasive Escherichia coli that adhere to and invade epithelial cells and resist killing by macrophages are increased in ileal CD. HYPOTHESIS: Invasive, translocating, intracellular commensal bacteria induce Th1 and Th17 responses that cause CD in susceptible individuals with genetically determined innate immune defects. UC is caused by bacterial metabolic products that induce epithelial injury by blocking epithelial metabolism or overwhelming the genetically susceptible host's ability to degrade reactive oxygen species.},

Sixteen patients (5 women and 11 men, mean age 36 year old, mean BMI 18.7 kg/m(2)) and 8 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. Measured resting energy expenditure (mREE) levels were determined by indirect calorimetry. The mREEs in CD patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls (24.4 +/- 2.4 kcal/kg/day vs 21.3 +/- 1.7 kcal/kg/day). However, mREEs in CD patients were significantly lower than predicted REEs (pREEs) calculated by the Harris-Benedict equation (26.4 +/- 2.5 kcal/kg/day). Furthermore, mREE/pREE values were lower in undernourished patients than in well-nourished patients. CD patients had hyper-metabolic statuses evaluated by mREE/body weight, but increased energy expenditure did not contribute to weight loss in these patients. In conclusion, nutritional therapy with 25-30 kcal/ideal body weight/day (calculated by mREE x active factor) may be optimal for active CD patients, while higher energy intake values pose the risk of overfeeding.},

   abstract = {Growth failure is common in paediatric disorders associated with inflammation and nutritional deficiency. Examples are Crohn's disease (CD), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and cystic fibrosis. Several factors contribute to the abnormal growth, notably excess pro-inflammatory cytokine production and nutritional deficiency, both of which can disturb the GH-IGF- I axis. Typically, growth hormone (GH) secretion is normal, whereas IGF-I production is compromised. Against this background of a disturbed IGF system, glucorticoid therapy, particularly in JIA, and to some extent in CD is frequently initiated to suppress inflammation and provide symptomatic relief. The availability of GH therapy and its efficacy in non-GH- deficient disorders has led to a number of trials in children with glucocorticoid-dependent diseases. In JIA, GH in pharmacological dosages of 0.066 and 0.047 mg/kg/day was effective in preventing the rapid decrease in height SDS values in the acute phase of the disease and in increasing adult height after long-term therapy respectively. In CD, fewer children are steroid-dependent because of widespread use of enteral nutrition, non-steroidal immunosuppressive agents and anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy. However, two trials of GH, using similar doses to those above, have demonstrated anabolic effects with increase in height velocity, bone mineral density and fat free mass compared to untreated controls. Collaboration between paediatric endocrinologists and other subspecialists will improve the opportunity for successful GH therapy. Treatment should be initiated before or during early puberty.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Total enteral nutrition (TEN) is frequently used as monotherapy in children with Crohn disease to prevent steroid toxicity. Liver disease is a known complication in inflammatory bowel disease, and liver enzymes are regularly obtained in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective follow-up of liver enzymes was performed in 11 new consecutive patients ages 7.6 to 17.1 years who were primarily treated with TEN for 6 weeks. Liver enzymes were measured before starting TEN and after 3, 6, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: At the beginning of TEN, the mean aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) was 18.4 U/L and the mean alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) 17.1 U/L. The mean ASAT and ALAT were 202.0 U/L and 269.0 U/L after 3 weeks and 109.6 U/L and 180.9 U/L at 6 weeks. After 12 weeks values decreased to 22.8 U/L (ASAT) and 20.9 U/L (ALAT). Overall, 9 of 11 patients had transient elevated ASAT and 10 patients showed elevated ALAT. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was slightly elevated in 3 patients during therapy, but alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin showed no changes. None of the patients developed liver disease during follow-up, and prolonged clinical remission was achieved in 9 patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that TEN can be associated with transient hypertransaminasemia without evidence of liver disease. We hypothesise that insulin resistance in patients with Crohn disease in combination with standard TEN formulae can result in transient hepatic steatosis causing the hypertransaminasemia. For the clinician it is important to be aware of this benign TEN-associated condition to prevent unnecessary investigations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Low bone mineral density (BMD) has recently been recognized as a potential health problem in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our aim was to investigate the familial resemblance of BMD in pediatric patients with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this population-based study from western Sweden, we assessed 144 children with IBD, 83 with ulcerative colitis, 45 with Crohn disease, 16 with indeterminate colitis, and their parents (136 mothers and 130 fathers) with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). After adjustment for sex, age, weight, height, and parental IBD, we correlated the BMD of the patients to the BMD of their mothers, fathers, and the midparent value ([mother's BMD + father's BMD]/2) at different skeletal sites and calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) to evaluate the extent of familial resemblance. RESULTS: The BMD of the children with IBD was clearly related to the BMD of their parents. The strongest correlation was found in the femoral neck with r = 0.55 (P < 0.001, 95% CI 0.41-0.66) between BMD of the children and the midparent value. The group of children with IBD had an odds ratio of 5.96 for decreased BMD (lumbar spine z score < -1 standard deviation) given that decreased BMD was diagnosed in both parents. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that BMD in children and adolescents with IBD is significantly related to that of their parents. In a clinical setting, it may be helpful to assess the parents of children with IBD with DEXA to interpret the children's DEXA measurements.},

In Crohn's patients PN is indicated when there are signs/symptoms of ileus or subileus in the small intestine, scars or intestinal fistulae. PN requires no specific compounding for chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. In both diseases it should be composed of 55-60% carbohydrates, 25-30% lipids and 10-15% amino acids. PN helps in the correction of malnutrition, particularly the intake of energy, minerals, trace elements, deficiency of calcium, vitamin D, folic acid, vitamin B12, and zinc. Enteral nutrition is clearly superior to PN in severe, acute pancreatitis. An intolerance to enteral nutrition results in an indication for total PN in complications such as pseudocysts, intestinal and pancreatic fistulae, and pancreatic abscesses or pancreatic ascites. If enteral nutrition is not possible, PN is recommended, at the earliest, 5 days after admission to the hospital. TPN should not be routinely administered in mild acute pancreatitis or nil by moth status <7 days, due to high costs and an increased risk of infection. The energy requirements are between 25 and 35 kcal/kg body weight/day. A standard solution including lipids (monitoring triglyceride levels!) can be administered in acute pancreatitis. Glucose (max. 4-5 g/kg body weight/day) and amino acids (about 1.2-1.5 g/kg body weight/day) should be administered and the additional enrichment of TPN with glutamine should be considered in severe, progressive forms of pancreatitis.},

   abstract = {The epithelium in inflamed intestinal segments of patients with Crohn's disease is characterized by a reduction of tight junction strands, strand breaks, and alterations of tight junction protein content and composition. In ulcerative colitis, epithelial leaks appear early due to micro-erosions resulting from upregulated epithelial apoptosis and in addition to a prominent increase of claudin-2. Th1-cytokine effects by interferon-gamma in combination with TNFalpha are important for epithelial damage in Crohn's disease, while interleukin-13 (IL-13) is the key effector cytokine in ulcerative colitis stimulating apoptosis and upregulation of claudin-2 expression. Focal lesions caused by apoptotic epithelial cells contribute to barrier disturbance in IBD by their own conductivity and by confluence toward apoptotic foci or erosions. Another type of intestinal barrier defect can arise from alpha-hemolysin harboring E. coli strains among the physiological flora, which can gain pathologic relevance in combination with proinflammatory cytokines under inflammatory conditions. On the other hand, intestinal barrier impairment can also result from transcellular antigen translocation via an initial endocytotic uptake into early endosomes, and this is intensified by proinflammatory cytokines as interferon-gamma and may thus play a relevant role in the onset of IBD. Taken together, barrier defects contribute to diarrhea by a leak flux mechanism (e.g., in IBD) and can cause mucosal inflammation by luminal antigen uptake. Immune regulation of epithelial functions by cytokines may cause barrier dysfunction not only by tight junction impairments but also by apoptotic leaks, transcytotic mechanisms, and mucosal gross lesions.},

   abstract = {AIM: To evaluate prospectively the clinical efficacy and safety of endoscopic hydrostatic balloon dilation in a consecutive cohort of symptomatic intestinal Crohn's disease strictures. METHODS: Between September 2003 and December 2008 we performed endoscopic balloon dilations in 37 Crohn's disease patients with 39 intestinal symptomatic strictures (4 naive and 35 postoperative). Dilations were performed using a Rigiflex through-the-scope balloon. Clinical success rate was claimed if a patient remained asymptomatic and did not require surgery or further endoscopic dilation, following technical success. Actuarial curves of clinical, endoscopic (redilation) and surgical recurrence were obtained by Kaplan-Meier method. Demographic and disease variables were related to the main outcomes. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 26.3 months (range, 2-61 months), the long-term global benefit rate was 89% (33/37). The 1-2-3 years cumulative symptom-free rates were respectively: 76%, 55% and 46%. Four patients were operated upon. Technical success predicts a lower rate of surgery. There were no complications related to the endoscopic procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic balloon dilation of symptomatic Crohn's disease strictures may achieve clinical benefit in many patients and is a valid alternative to surgery in the management of the disease. Dilation may be repeated in recurrent intestinal obstructions and appears safe without morbidity.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine current evidence for dietary supplementation with zinc and other micronutrients for primary prevention of multiple micronutrient deficiencies that are known to result from therapies used in the treatment of gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological observations and clinical findings have strengthened the concept that both nutritional deficiencies and nutritional excesses impair the gastrointestinal response(s) and alter susceptibility to inflammation and other diseases. The interaction of micronutrient intake, biochemical indicators of nutritional status, and four specific gastrointestinal inflammation states are reviewed. These conditions include celiac disease and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies resulting from the sustained adherence to a gluten-free diet; micronutrient nutrition as an important determinant of immunity for two major types of inflammatory bowel disease: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies which may be exacerbated by the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. SUMMARY: For each inflammation 'state', enhancement of micronutrient status can improve immunocompetance and minimize therapeutic side-effects. The impact of single-micronutrient deficiencies on immune responses, and the possible impact of uncorrected micronutrient status are discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is associated with a more severe Crohn's disease (CD) course. However, the effect of light consumption is not known. Our aim was to characterize the effect of a light tobacco consumption on the course of CD. METHODS: We analyzed the course of CD during the period 1995-2007 from data collected in 2795 consecutive patients in whom smoking habits were recorded. Patients were classified as nonsmokers (n = 1420), light smokers (1-10 cigarettes/day; n = 385), heavy smokers (>10 cigarettes/day; n = 638), and intermittent smokers (change in smoking habits; n = 352). Patient-years while smoking were compared to patient-years without smoking. The analyses considered patient-years regarding annual disease activity and therapeutic requirements. RESULTS: The percentage of years with active disease was 37% in nonsmokers versus 46% in light smokers (P < 0.001; adjusted hazard ratio 1.30 [1.19-1.43]) and 48% in heavy smokers (P < 0.001; adjusted hazard ratio 1.68 [1.57-1.81]), despite an increased use of immunosuppressants in smokers. Hospitalization rates were also increased in both groups of smokers, with 12% in nonsmokers versus 15% in both groups of smokers (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The annual rate of intestinal resection was 4.5% in nonsmokers, 5.1% in light smokers, and 5.5% in heavy smokers, with a significant difference observed between nonsmokers and heavy smokers only (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Light smokers are doing worse than nonsmokers regarding disease activity and the need for immunosuppressants. Complete smoking cessation should be advised in all smokers with CD.},

   abstract = {Nutrition plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) primarily in prevention and treatment of malnutrition and growth failure. Furthermore, in Crohn disease (CD), nutrition can induce remission, maintain remission, and prevent relapse. Malnutrition is common in IBD and the mechanisms involved include decreased food intake, malabsorption, increased nutrient loss, increased energy requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions. At the time of diagnosis, up to 85% of pediatric patients with CD and 65% of those with ulcerative colitis (UC) have weight loss. Growth failure occurs in 15% to 40% of children with IBD and is less common in UC compared with CD, both at diagnosis and during follow-up. In CD, nutritional therapy with enteral formulas induces remission at a rate comparable with that achieved with steroids. In adults with CD, limited information suggests that enteral nutrition (EN) may play a role in maintenance of remission. In children with CD colitis, one study suggested that children without colitis respond better to EN than children with colitis, and another study found no such difference but reported a trend toward earlier relapse in those with isolated colonic involvement. Finally, nutrition may play a role in IBD via the possible protective effect of breastfeeding against UC and CD. In summary, although only CD may benefit from nutrition as primary therapy for remission induction and possibly maintenance of remission, nutrition plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in IBD, and may have a protective role, via the effect of breast-feeding on disease occurrence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids remain one of the most popular medication choices for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. While corticosteroids may improve symptoms, they do not always result in mucosal healing and have significant adverse effects. Steroids which act topically, with less systemic side-effects may be more desirable. Oral budesonide, a topically acting corticosteroid with extensive first pass hepatic metabolism, is effective in Crohn's disease and in enema formulation for left-sided ulcerative colitis. Data are limited regarding the role of oral budesonide in ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the safety and efficacy of oral budesonide for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searching of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed. Two authors independently reviewed all identified titles and abstracts. Full text articles of all potentially relevant studies were retrieved. Reference lists of review articles were searched in an attempt to identify additional studies. Abstracts of the major gastroenterology scientific meetings, held over the past 3 years, were hand searched. The ClinicalTrials.gov website as well as the Cochrane Registry of Controlled Trials was searched to identify any ongoing trials. Direct communication with pharmaceutical manufacturers was established to identify any ongoing or unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis, with either a parallel arm or cross-over design, were considered eligible for inclusion. There were no exclusions based on patient age or the type, dose or duration of budesonide therapy. The primary outcome was the induction of clinical remission in ulcerative colitis. Secondary outcomes included clinical, histologic and endoscopic improvement, endoscopic mucosal healing, change in disease activity index scores, adverse events and study withdrawals. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Studies were reviewed for eligibility, data were extracted and quality assessed by 2 independent investigators. It was not possible to perform a meta-analysis of the included studies due to significant heterogeneity, with each study comparing budesonide to a different control medication. MAIN RESULTS: Three studies met the inclusion criteria. Oral budesonide was significantly less likely to induce clinical remission than oral mesalamine after 8 weeks of therapy (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91). There was no significant benefit of oral budesonide in comparison to placebo for inducing clinical remission after 4 weeks of treatment (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.39). A small pilot study reported no statistically significant difference in endoscopic remission between budesonide and prednisolone (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.42). The study was small and not powered to evaluate the impact of budesonide on clinical remission. Suppression of plasma cortisol was significantly more common in prednisolone treated patients (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.33). Two multicenter studies are ongoing. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At present, there is no evidence to recommend the clinical use of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis. Mesalamine is superior to budesonide for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most moderate-severe juvenile Crohn's disease (CD) patients are in a constant catabolic state resulting in poor weight gain and growth failure. Anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and monoclonal antibody drugs, as well as growth hormone (GH), frequently fail to achieve sustained remission or reverse growth failure. OBJECTIVE: To test whether an exclusion diet with nutraceutical therapy (DNT) could induce sustained clinical remission and weight gain, and if so does this enhance the ability for GH to reverse growth failure. METHODS: An uncontrolled prospective case study was undertaken in six moderate- severe CD patients, two of whom had completed growth. All were treated with DNT. Adequate caloric and protein ( >or= 3g/kg/d) intake for catch up weight was prescribed. Dairy products, certain grains and carrageenan containing foods were eliminated. Nutraceuticals, consisting of fish peptides, bovine colostrum, boswellia serrata, curcumin and a multivitamin were administered daily. Lactobacillus GG, a probiotic, was administered twice weekly. Recombinant human GH (rhGH) was administered daily. RESULTS: Within 2 months of starting DNT all six patients went into remission, with discontinuation of all pharmacological drugs. Three patients have remained in sustained remission for 4 to 8 years. One patient with very severe CD had recurrence of CD symptoms after being in complete remission for 18 months, one patient was in remission for 3 years but symptoms recurred when she became less compliant to DNT and one recently treated patient remains in remission after 6 months. With the addition of rhGH, the 4 growing patients had good-excellent growth response CONCLUSION: DNT engendered prolonged remission and restoration of normal weight in moderate-severe juvenile CD patients, providing conditions that enabled rhGH to stimulate growth. These findings justify larger controlled trials to evaluate the long-term benefit of compliance to DNT in both juvenile and adult CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disorder intrinsically associated with inflammation of mucosal surfaces. Because inflammation can result in enteric neuromuscular dysfunction we hypothesized that terminal ileitis in patients with CF may predispose to distal ileal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). METHODS AND PATIENTS: Full-thickness terminal ileal tissues from 6 children with CF and severe DIOS, 6 infants with complicated meconium ileus (MI), and 6 children with non-CF intestinal atresia were studied. RESULTS: Lymphocyte-predominant mucosal and transmural ileal inflammation was present in 6 of 6 patients with DIOS. Lymphocytic ganglionitis was present in 4 of 6 although numbers of myenteric neurons were not decreased (5/5). Myocyte proteins were preserved (6/6). Mild submucosal fibrosis was common in DIOS (5/6) and transformation of submucosal fibroblasts to a myofibroblastic phenotype was noted in 4 of 6. Inflammatory changes were distinct from those described in fibrosing colonopathy. Antroduodenal manometry in an individual who had experienced MI/DIOS was consistent with a neuropathic pseudo-obstructive process. Submucosal or transmural lymphocyte predominant inflammation was also present in 6 of 6 infants with complicated MI, which, when coupled with submucosal myofibroblast proliferation (5/6), appeared highly predictive of CF rather than non-CF atresia. Histological findings at birth were similar, although milder, than those seen in DIOS, suggesting that these changes are a primary abnormality in CF. CONCLUSIONS: Submucosal or transmural inflammation of the ileum is common in newborns with CF and MI and older children with DIOS. Severe recurrent DIOS should be investigated with seromuscular and mucosal biopsy of the ileum to seek a transmural ileitis potentially amenable to anti-inflammatory therapies.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract and is broadly classified into Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In the last decade, our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of this group of disorders has been improved. More specifically, recent development of biologics and use of immunomodulator agents in IBD have made it possible to robustly control mucosal inflammation and heal mucosal ulcerations and thus provide an opportunity to potentially modify disease course and prevent complications and future surgery. However, unfortunately we have not identified reliable, sensitive and specific markers to predict disease course and to identify those patients with aggressive and progressive course that would benefit from early use of biologics to prevent future complication and surgery. Thus, optimal medical management of IBD has remained multifaceted and individualized. Our primary therapeutic goals have remained unchanged and are to: [1] improve patient quality of life by treating flare ups [induction of remission], maintaining remission, and treating symptoms like diarrhea; [2] predict and prevent/treat complication; [3] prevent/treat nutritional deficiency and maintain optimal nutrition, [4] provide appropriate psychosocial support, and of course [5] attempt to modify disease course in those with aggressive disease. We can achieve these goals by appropriate use of therapeutic agents that include 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, antibiotics, nutritional support, and the biologic agents. Information from well designed double blind placebo controlled trials combined with knowledge of the potential impact of patient and disease characteristics on disease course which can assist us to individualized treatment plan will be the guide for us to appropriately use these therapeutic agents. For example, age of the onset of the disease, patient gender and race, mode of the disease presentation, disease location, disease-associated complications such as perianal disease/fistula, and serology and genetic markers can all help to individualize disease treatment. These factors can help to determine whether one should start with 5-ASA/antibiotic/steroid [step-up where there is no risk factors for aggressive disease course] or whether one should initiate biologic therapy at diagnosis [top-down approach], and whether it is most advisable to use monotherapy with biologic treatment [e.g. in young, Caucasian male or elderly] or use a combination therapy with a biologic and an immunomodulator. Ongoing research promises, in a near future, development of more robust set of markers to be able to model disease behavior to more accurately predict disease course and thus decide on therapeutic approach with most appropriate efficacy/risk ratio for a given patient. Furthermore, current basic laboratory research has provided a large number of potential therapeutic targets to treat IBD with new promising highly specific and targeted agents.},

METHODS: All consecutive patients with ileocolonic or ileal resection for active CD in Lariboisiere Hospital (Paris) between 1995 and 2006 were included. Clinical, surgical, histological and follow-up data were extracted from medical charts. Early clinical recurrence was defined as the reappearance of CD clinical manifestations requiring a specific treatment within 2 years postsurgery. The proximal resection margin was analysed using haematein eosin saffron (HES) staining and immunochemistry targeting mastocytes (anti-CD117 antibody) and lymphocytes (anti-CD3 antibody). Eosinophils were detected by HES staining. Ten cases of ileocolonic resections for caecal carcinoma served as controls. RESULTS: Data were available from 171 postoperative follow-up periods in 164 patients with CD. Early clinical recurrence of CD occurred in 28.1%. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with postoperative recurrence were active smoking (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.94; 95% CI 1.06 to 3.60; p = 0.033), submucosal plexitis with >or=3 mastocytes (HR = 1.87; 95% CI 1.00 to 3.46; p = 0.048) and a disease-free resection margin <5 cm (HR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.27 to 1.02; p = 0.059). CONCLUSIONS: Submucosal plexitis is associated with early clinical recurrence and could be taken into account in studies searching for new treatment strategies in the immediate postoperative period.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Concomitant use of immunosuppressants (IS) with scheduled infliximab (IFX) maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) is debated. The aim of this study was to assess whether IS co-treatment is useful in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on scheduled IFX infusions. METHODS: 121 consecutive patients with IBD (23 UC, 98 CD) treated by IFX and who received at least 6 months of IS co-treatment (azathioprine (AZA) or methotrexate (MTX)) were studied. In each patient, the IFX treatment duration was divided into semesters which were independently analysed regarding IBD activity. RESULTS: Semesters with IS (n=265) and without IS (n=319) were analysed. IBD flares, perianal complications and switch to adalimumab were less frequently observed in semesters with IS than in those without IS (respectively: 19.3% vs 32.0%, p=0.003; 4.1% vs 11.8%, p=0.03; 1.1% vs 5.3%, p=0.006). Maximal C-reactive protein (CRP) level and IFX dose/kg observed during the semesters were lower in semesters with IS. Within semesters with IS, IBD flares and perianal complications were less frequently observed in semesters with AZA than in those with MTX. In multivariate analysis, IS co-treatment was associated with a decreased risk of IBD flare (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.79) CONCLUSION: In patients with IBD receiving IFX maintenance therapy, IS co-treatment is associated with reduced IBD activity, IFX dose and switch to adalimumab. In this setting, co-treatment with AZA seems to be more effective than co-treatment with MTX. Benefit of such a combination treatment has to be balanced with potential risks, notably infections and cancers.},

METHODS: We studied 17 ulcerative colitis patients, 11 Crohn's disease patients, 7 patients with acute self-limited colitis (ASLC) and normal colonic biopsies from 5 subjects who underwent colonoscopy for colon cancer screening. A fluorescent in situ hybridization technique was applied to colonic biopsies to assess the microbiota composition of the crypts and crypt abscesses. RESULTS: Crypts colonized by bacteria were observed in 42.9% and 3.6% of ASLC and IBD patients, respectively (P = 0.019). Crypt abscesses colonized by bacteria were observed in 28.6% and 0.0% of ASLC and IBD patients, respectively (P = 0.035). CONCLUSION: These results do not support the hypothesis that crypt abscesses in IBD are the result of localized dysbiosis arising from persistence of living bacteria colonizing the crypts.},

   abstract = {Despite advances in our understanding of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis and increased ability to treat patients with severe and refractory disease, patients continue to suffer from disease complications, and increasing numbers of both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients are admitted annually in the USA. The rapid evolution in IBD medications and treatment paradigms has contributed to a disparity in clinical care which may vary between expert centers routinely treating large numbers of IBD patients and hospitals with low annual IBD admissions. High-volume centers handling in excess of 150 IBD annual admissions have improved operative and inpatient outcomes compared with hospitals caring for IBD patients less frequently. Although the precise reason for this disparity in clinical outcomes is not known, we hypothesize that expert centers provide superior IBD supportive therapy. This supportive care includes additional diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to help patients achieve optimal outcomes. We review information regarding disparities in the quality of IBD clinical care then focus on supportive therapy for IBD patients, including diagnostic approaches to identify confounding factors contributing to poor IBD outcome, supportive therapeutic approaches to optimize the outcome in hospitalized IBD patients, and future directions exploring brain-body interaction in the treatment of pain, stress and sleep deprivation in patients suffering from IBD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recurrence of Crohn's disease following surgical resection is common, but the optimal strategy to assess, prevent, and treat postoperative recurrence remains unclear. Recent developments in the prevention and management of postoperative recurrence have provided additional information. RECENT FINDINGS: Predictors of Crohn's disease recurrence after surgery include cigarette smoking, disease behavior, number of prior resections, family history, anastomotic type, and time to first surgery. Only penetrating disease behavior and continued cigarette smoking after surgery remain clear predictors of postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence. Ileocolonoscopy is the only modality to detect mucosal recurrence after surgery; however, surrogate markers of inflammation, specifically stool lactoferrin and calprotectin as well as small intestine contrast ultrasound, are promising. Due to the high rate of surgery for the treatment of complications of Crohn's disease, prevention of postoperative disease has received considerable attention. Recent studies of azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, nitroimidazole antibiotics, and infliximab have broadened the spectrum of medication options postoperatively. SUMMARY: Smoking cessation and ileocolonoscopy for early detection of Crohn's disease recurrence should be part of any postoperative management strategy. The selection of medication and optimal time to initiate treatment after surgery is less certain. Postoperative immunomodulators and antitumor necrosis factor agents may prevent Crohn's disease in those at high risk for recurrence. Treatment of patients by predictors of recurrence and personalization of management based on genotypes/phenotypes will be the focus of future study.},

Nutritional therapy with an elemental diet has been reported effective in improving nutritional state and suppressing inflammation, and might be expected to assist in minimizing the need for surgery. We evaluated the relationship between an elemental diet and the period that patients spent without intestinal resection. METHODOLOGY: A total of 153 patients with Crohn's disease who visited our hospital from July, 1999 to July, 2005 were enrolled. The relationship between the caloric content of an elemental diet and surgery as an endpoint was examined using Cox regression analysis. Cumulative non-operation rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical significance was determined using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Among patients with jejunoileal involvement, patients receiving an elemental diet providing 900 kcal or more per day showed a statistically significant improvement in cumulative non-operation rate. Among those without jejunoileal involvement, in contrast, the cumulative non-operation rate did not differ among those receiving an elemental diet of less or more than 900 kcal per day. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an elemental diet of 900 kcal per day may be effective in avoiding surgery in patients with jejunoileal lesions. This diet may be useful in improving long-term convalescence in these patients.},

There are no reports that have compared the effects on mid- and long-term prognosis among the induction and maintenance therapies, especially between infliximab, a chimeric antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and nutritional therapies. A total of 262 CD patients with induced remission were enrolled in the cohort study. Patients who failed to achieve remission, and patients who were lost to follow-up within 12 months were excluded. Induction therapies for CD included total elemental enteral nutrition, total parenteral nutrition, infliximab, prednisolone, and surgical resection. Maintenance therapies included home elemental diet, 5-aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, and scheduled infliximab therapy. We evaluated the possible predictive factors of relapse and surgical recurrence including the clinical backgrounds of the patients and medical therapies, using the Cox multivariate hazard analysis. The main factors that strongly affected the first relapse were scheduled infliximab therapy (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.24, p < 0.0001), surgical induction (HR = 0.19, p < 0.0001) and high frequency of previous relapse (HR = 2.56, p = 0.002). Penetrating (HR = 3.33, p = 0.009) and stricturing (HR = 6.60, p < 0.0001) disease behavior were main risk factors of surgical recurrence. Scheduled infliximab therapy is the most effective maintenance therapy in a real clinical setting with respect to the mid- and long-term prognosis.},

Forty-nine members of the research group on inflammatory bowel disease in Japan were asked to answer a questionnaire regarding educational brochures for CD patients. We obtained 15 Japanese and three foreign brochures and conducted content analyses for seven global brochures. We received 34 replies. Only 15 (44%) of 34 hospitals gave the brochures to all newly diagnosed CD patients. In the Japanese brochures, a lot of content was devoted to nutrition therapy and self-management in terms of diet. On the contrary, foreign brochures devoted more content to symptoms and drug therapy. The existing approaches for providing information in Japanese hospitals were unsatisfactory. Furthermore, Japanese educational brochures for CD patients emphasized nutritional therapy and dietary restriction. This reflected the differences in treatment strategies among countries.},

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled subjects with chronic abdominal pain, bloating and/or chronic diarrhea. All subjects underwent triple sugar screen hydrogen breath test (TSST) using the combined sugar solution. Breath hydrogen concentration >/= 20 ppm above baseline was interpreted a positive test for sugar malabsorption. RESULTS: A positive hydrogen breath test consistent with sugar malabsorption was found in 5 out of 31 (16%) subjects. Three of these subjects were confirmed to have lactose malabsorption based on small bowel lactase enzyme analysis or subsequent lactose hydrogen breath test. One subject with positive TSST was diagnosed with fructose malabsorption based on dietary history; he improved on a limited fructose diet, and one was diagnosed to have gastric Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: Approximately one in six children with symptoms of FGID had sugar intolerance as determined by the TSST.},

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional cohort study in children under 18 years of age who had OGD for the primary indication of abdominal pain, at Texas Children's Hospital and Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters from 1 January 2002 to 30 June 2005. RESULTS: Overall, OGD was diagnostic in 454 (38.1%) of the 1191 procedures, including reflux oesophagitis (23%, n = 271), Helicobacter pylori infections (5%, n = 55), peptic ulcers (3%, n = 32), eosinophilic oesophagitis (2%, n = 25), celiac disease (1%, n = 9) and Crohn's disease (0.5%, n = 7). Male gender, older age, elevated C-reactive protein and vomiting were associated with increased diagnostic yield. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that OGD is valuable for the evaluation of chronic abdominal pain in children, with a diagnostic yield of 38%. The majority of alarm symptoms and routine laboratory tests are not significantly associated with diagnostic yield.},

   abstract = {This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and 1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants. Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the response to infliximab in children and adolescents with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis up to week 22. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 21 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) received 5 mg/kg of infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14. The following parameters were evaluated: clinical manifestations; activity indices of IBD, including the Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index for Crohn disease, the Lightiger Colitis Activity Index and the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for ulcerative colitis, and the modified Harvey-Bradshaw Index for Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis; and the reduction or suspension of corticosteroid use. RESULTS: All of the patients had improvements in clinical manifestations after the first infusion of infliximab. At week 22, 18 of 21 (85.7%) patients were categorized as being in remission, 3 of 21 (14.3%) patients were categorized as having clinical improvement, and none of the patients were categorized as having no response. There was a statistically significant difference in all of the IBD activity indices at weeks 2, 6, 14, and 22 compared with time 0. The corticosteroid use was completely discontinued in 6 of 15 patients by week 22. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is effective in the treatment of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents up to week 22.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To analyze the IBD5 locus in a homogenous cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) children with Crohn disease (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 83 AJ children with CD and 73 AJ healthy controls were studied. Genotyping for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including OCTN1 (SLC22A4; 1672C-->T), OCTN2 (SLC22A5; 207G-->C), IGR2096, IGR2198, and IGR2230 genes was performed using the TaqMan system. NOD2/CARD15 variants also were typed using established methods. RESULTS: All IBD5 SNPs tested were in linkage disequilibrium (D'>0.8), and showed significant association with CD in our cohort of AJ children. The IGR2096 SNP, which is not located within the same linkage disequilibrium block as the OCTN1 and 2 SNPs, showed an even stronger association with CD (P = 0.017; odds ratio = 1.7). Patients with CD who had the OCTN1 susceptibility allele were more likely to carry 1 of the 3 NOD2/CARD15 SNPs tested (P = 0.01; odds ratio = 4.8). CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated a significant association between the IBD5 locus and CD in a homogenous cohort of pediatric AJ patients. Due to the tight linkage disequilibrium in the region, it is not possible to identify the causative IBD5 variant. Future functional studies will ultimately reveal the causative gene variant at this locus.},

   abstract = {Diet is known to play a major role in the symptoms of the inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease (CD). Although no single diet is appropriate to all individuals, most CD patients are aware of foods that provide adverse or beneficial effects. This study seeks to categorise foods in relation to their effects on symptoms of CD, in a New Zealand Caucasian population. Four hundred and forty-six subjects from two different centres in New Zealand were recruited into the study. An extensive dietary questionnaire (257 food items in 15 groups) recorded self-reported dietary tolerances and intolerances. Across each of the food groups, there were statistically significant differences among responses to foods. A two-dimensional graphical summary enabled stratification of foods according to the probability that they will be either beneficial or detrimental. A small number of foods are frequently considered to be beneficial, including white fish, salmon and tuna, gluten-free products, oatmeal, bananas, boiled potatoes, sweet potatoes (kumara), pumpkin, soya milk, goat's milk and yoghurt. Foods that are typically considered detrimental include grapefruit, chilli or chilli sauce, corn and corn products, peanuts, cream, salami, curried foods, cola drinks, high energy drinks, beer, and red wine. For a number of the food items, the same item that was beneficial for one group of subjects was detrimental to others; in particular soya milk, goat's milk, yoghurt, oatmeal, kiwifruit, prunes, apple, broccoli, cauliflower, linseed, pumpkin seed, sunflower seed, ginger and ginger products, beef, lamb, liver, and oily fish. It was not possible to identify a specific group of food items that should be avoided by all CD patients. The wide range of detrimental items suggests that dietary maintenance of remission is likely to be difficult, and to exclude a substantial number of foods. Personalised diets may be especially important to these individuals.},

   abstract = {Upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease has become increasingly recognized, even in the absence of specific localizing symptoms, as patients more frequently undergo upper endoscopy. Although the recent Montreal classification system allowed classification of upper GI involvement in Crohn's disease (CD), independent of other locations, a consensus regarding the definition of what qualifies as significant "involvement" is still lacking. Reported incidence data vary considerably depending on the definitions used and the selected target population. Pediatric data suggest that upper endoscopy is useful in differentiating CD from ulcerative colitis, when inflammation is otherwise predominantly confined to the colon; however, this question has yet to be studied in adults. Infliximab therapy for upper GI-CD seems as effective as that seen for more distal GI inflammation.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is extremely rare in infancy and can be present in severe forms. Infants with Crohn's disease might require intensive immunosuppressive therapy. Infliximab is a chimeric mouse/human monoclonal IgG1 antibody against tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and completely neutralizes its biologic activity. Though widely used in the treatment of pediatric Crohn's disease, there are few data regarding its applicability in infancy. We therefore report herein our experiences with infliximab therapy in two infantile patients with Crohn's disease who were resistant to conventional therapies; one patient showed a partial response while there was no response in the second. We were unable to achieve satisfactory results from infliximab therapy. It remains to be determined whether inflammatory bowel disease starting in infancy represents a separate pathogenetic subgroup and whether the inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis should follow the exclusion of an immunodeficiency state. Studies in larger series are needed to further clarify the efficacy, safety and timing of infliximab therapy for infantile Crohn's disease patients.},

We investigated MEFV mutations and prevalence of FMF disease in Turkish children with IBD and their relationship with the disease severity. METHODS: Sixteen patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 14 with Crohn's disease (CD) and three with indeterminate colitis (IC) were enrolled in the study (median age 13 years, range 0.6-16 years, n = 19 boys). Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients were evaluated as well as the parameters of disease severity. All patients were screened for 12 common MEFV mutations. RESULTS: MEFV mutations were detected in 17 of 66 (25.7%) alleles. Seven patients (four patients with CD, two with IC, and one with UC) were also diagnosed as FMF. FMF disease was found in seven of all IBD patients (21.2%) and four of them had CD. M694V was the leading mutation, and as a disease-causing mutation, it was found to be significantly more frequent in CD patients than UC patients (Fisher's exact test P = 0.03). Demographics, laboratory evaluations, growth parameters, extraintestinal manifestations, and treatment with immunosuppressive agents other than steroids were comparable between the patients with and without FMF in most aspects. CONCLUSIONS: Although this is a small cohort, disease-causing MEFV mutations and FMF disease rate were increased among our patients with IBD. The increase was prominent among CD patients, whereas in UC the rate was similar to the Turkish healthy control population.},

We evaluated the nutritional status at the beginning and during Infliximab treatment in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: Patients with moderate/severe flares of disease treated with Infliximab for induction and maintenance of remission were included in a prospective observational study. Body Mass Index and Nutritional Risk Index were calculated in each patient at 0, 6 weeks and than every 8 weeks for one year. RESULTS: From 30 patients treated with Infliximab 59.3% had low BMI, 35.7% being undernourished. The severity of Crohn's disease did not correlate with low BMI but did correlate with Nutritional Risk Index (p = 0.001). In all patients that responded to Infliximab treatment progressive weight gain was observed, all but one patient reaching normal BMI after one year. Mean weight gain was significantly more elevated (p = 0.001) and time needed to reach normal BMI was longer in the undernutrition group (p = 0.01). Clinical remission was the principal factor associated with weight gain (p = 0.001), while there was no influence of endoscopic remission on nutritional status. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate/severe forms of Crohn's disease malnutrition is frequently encountered. Induction and maintenance treatment with Infliximab determines weight gain and corrects malnutrition in all patients with clinical remission.},

Establishment of a registry and the clinical characteristics are presented in this study. METHODS: Two hundred ninety-three patients with ulcerative colitis and 207 with Crohn's disease, referred to tertiary referral gastrointestinal centers in Tehran from 2004 through 2007, were assessed. Demographic and clinical features, intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations, inflammatory bowel disease in relatives, measles infection and vaccination, nutrition during infancy, and drugs and surgical interventions were assessed. RESULTS: The mean+/-SD age at the diagnosis was 33.8+/-12.9 years in Crohn's disease and 37.1+/-13.7 years in ulcerative colitis. Male:female ratio was 0.9:1.0 for Crohn's disease and 0.7:1.0 for ulcerative colitis. A total of 177 (85.5%) patients with Crohn's disease, and 254 (86.7%) patients with ulcerative colitis had never smoked. Measles vaccination was mentioned in 150 (72.5%) of Crohn's disease and 214 (73%) of ulcerative colitis patients. Breastfeeding during infancy was reported in 178 (86%) and 257 (87.7%) of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients, respectively. Appendectomy was reported in 37 (17.9%) of Crohn's disease and 16 (5.5%) of ulcerative colitis patients, whereas tonsillectomy was reported in 11.6% of each group. CONCLUSION: Demographic and clinical characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease patients are similar to that of other developing countries, in this study, more inflammatory bowel disease cases have been assessed in comparison with previous studies, which may be due to different time scales of socioeconomic evolution and environmental factors in Iran.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although treatment with corticosteroids induces remission in Crohn's disease, prolonged exposure to corticosteroids is undesirable. This randomised clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (sargramostim), an activator of innate immunity, in corticosteroid-dependent patients with Crohn's disease. DESIGN: Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio, to sargramostim 6 microg/kg subcutaneously once daily or placebo for up to 22 weeks. The study consisted of (1) an adjunctive phase (weeks 1-4) in which patients received study drug plus corticosteroid therapy; (2) a forced corticosteroid tapering phase (weeks 4-14); and (3) an observation phase (4 weeks) in which patients received study drug plus prednisone < or =7.5 mg. The primary endpoint was corticosteroid-free remission (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) < or =150) 4 weeks after corticosteroid elimination. Secondary endpoints were corticosteroid-free response (CDAI decreased by > or =100) and induction of remission in patients who reduced the dose of corticosteroid to 2.5-7.5 mg. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were randomised to sargramostim and 42 to placebo. Significantly more sargramostim-treated patients than placebo patients achieved corticosteroid-free remission (18.6% vs 4.9%; p = 0.03). Similar differences were seen for corticosteroid-free response and in patients who tapered corticosteroids to 2.5-7.5 mg/day. Sargramostim treatment was also associated with significant improvements in health-related quality of life. Patients who received sargramostim were more likely to experience musculoskeletal pain, injection site reactions and dyspnoea. CONCLUSIONS: Sargramostim was more effective than placebo for inducing corticosteroid-free remission in patients with Crohn's disease with corticosteroid dependence. Sargramostim may provide significant benefit in this population if these findings are confirmed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Adipokines are fat-derived hormones and cytokines with immune-modulating and metabolic properties. Most of them are associated with insulin resistance. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate circulating levels of adipokines and glucose homeostasis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to evaluate possible associations with the course and characteristics of the disease. METHODS: Serum leptin, resistin, visfatin, retinol-binding protein-4, adiponectin, glucose, insulin, and inflammatory parameters were analyzed in 93 patients with inactive IBD (49 with Crohn's disease [CD], 44 with ulcerative colitis [UC]), 35 patients with active IBD (18 with CD, 17 with UC), and 37 age- and body mass index-matched healthy controls. Ninety-two patients were followed for 6 mo. RESULTS: Leptin was similar in patients with IBD and controls, whereas resistin and visfatin were increased in patients with active disease but not in those in remission. In active and inactive disease, adiponectin was decreased (P < 0.001) and retinol-binding protein-4 was increased (P < 0.001) compared with controls. About 60% of patients with IBD showed increased levels of insulin, whereas serum glucose remained normal, resulting in increased homeostasis model assessment values in most patients. Hyperinsulinemia was associated with the decrease in adiponectin (r = -0.572, P < 0.001) and proved to be an independent protective factor for 6-mo maintenance of remission (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: IBD led to largely similar alterations in circulating adipokines and hyperinsulinemia in patients with CD and those with UC. The unexpected protective effect of hyperinsulinemia on relapse rate denotes the role of the metabolic-inflammatory response as a modulator in IBD.},

   abstract = {The Dutch national practice guideline 'Diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in adults' describes the multidisciplinary approach for adult patients with (suspected) IBD, recommended following analysis of the literature according to the principles of evidence based guideline development. The symptoms on first presentation of a patient with IBD are mainly connected with the localisation and severity of the disease and less with the resulting diagnosis 'Crohn's disease' or 'ulcerative colitis'. There is no test by which the diseases can be distinguished with certainty. Clinical course, ileocolonoscopy and histopathological investigation following biopsy form the 'gold standard' for diagnosis of IBD. The final diagnostic step is disease assessment according to the Montreal classification in order to enable unambiguous communication with medical professionals. The first aim of treatment is to treat and stabilise active disease (induction therapy); at the same time maintenance therapy is initiated. A step-up approach is recommended for both treatment aims. Surgical intervention is indicated if the medical treatment is ineffective, in case of intractable gastrointestinal bleeding, in clinically significant gastrointestinal stenosis due to fibrotic scar tissue, or if complications of the inflammation occur such as abscess, peritonitis, or complicated fistula formation. Nutrition and diet do not play a primary therapeutic role in treatment of adult patients with IBD. However, supportive nutritional care is warranted. Probiotics have a demonstrable effect in preventing pouchitis, but not in the treatment of IBD. Alternative medicine has no role to play in the treatment of IBD. The risk of developing colorectal carcinoma is slightly elevated in IBD patients. Therefore, endoscopic surveillance strategies, aimed at early detection of dysplasia, is indicated according to a schedule in which the frequency increases according to the time elapsed since first clinical signs of IBD.},

Parenteral nutrition is not recommended as a primary treatment in CD and UC. The use of parenteral nutrition is however reliable when oral/enteral feeding is not possible. There is a lack of data supporting specific nutrients in these conditions. Parenteral nutrition is mandatory in case of intestinal failure, at least in the acute period. In patients with short bowel, specific attention should be paid to water and electrolyte supplementation. Currently, the use of growth hormone, glutamine and GLP-2 cannot be recommended in patients with short bowel.},

   abstract = {Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract commonly denoted as inflammatory bowel diseases. It has been proposed that these diseases result from aberrant mucosal immune responses to nonpathogenic microbial residents of the intestines. Recently, it was established that continuous interactions between the innate and the adaptive intestinal immune cells and the microbiota are directly involved in maintaining the physiological noninflammatory state of the intestinal mucosa. In light of the complexity of this mucosal homeostasis, it is astonishing that the inflammatory bowel diseases are relatively rare. Recently, altered functions of the innate immune system have been identified. As such, both hyperresponsiveness and hyporesponsiveness of innate cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {Autophagy is a cellular pathway involved in protein and organelle degradation, which is likely to represent an innate adaptation to starvation. In times of nutrient deficiency, the cell can self-digest and recycle some nonessential components through nonselective autophagy, thus sustaining minimal growth requirements until a food source becomes available. Over recent years, autophagy has been implicated in an increasing number of clinical scenarios, notably infectious diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmunity. The recent identification of the importance of autophagy genes in the genetic susceptibility to Crohn's disease suggests that a selective autophagic response may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of common complex immune-mediated diseases. In this review, we discuss the autophagic mechanisms, their molecular regulation, and summarize their clinical relevance. This progress has led to great interest in the therapeutic potential of manipulation of both selective and nonselective autophagy in established disease.},

   abstract = {From epidemiological data, based on concordance data in family studies, via linkage analysis to genome-wide association studies, we and others have accumulated robust evidence implicating more than 30 distinct genomic loci involved in the genetic susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD). These loci encode genes involved in a number of homeostatic mechanisms: innate pattern recognition receptors (NOD2/CARD15, TLR4, CARD9), the differentiation of Th17-lymphocytes (IL-23R, JAK2, STAT3, CCR6, ICOSLG), autophagy (ATG16L1, IRGM, LRRK2), maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity (IBD5, DLG5, PTGER4, ITLN1, DMBT1, XBP1), and the orchestration of the secondary immune response (HLA-region, TNFSF15/TL1A, IRF5, PTPN2, PTPN22, NKX2-3, IL-12B, IL-18RAP, MST1). While many of these loci also predispose to pediatric CD, an additional number of childhood-onset loci have been identified recently (e.g., TNFRSF6B). Not only has the identification of these loci improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of CD, this knowledge also holds real promise for clinical practice.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Growth retardation and malnutrition are major features of pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We examined nutritional and growth parameters from diagnosis to maximal follow-up in a population-based pediatric cohort, and we determined predictive factors. METHODS: A total of 261 patients (156 boys, 105 girls) with onset of CD before the age of 17 were identified from 1988 to 2004 through the EPIMAD registry (Registre des Maladies Inflammatoires Chroniques de l'Intestin) in northern France. Median age at diagnosis was 13 years (11.2-15.4) and median follow-up was 73 months (46-114). Z-scores of height/age, weight/age, and body mass index (BMI)/age were determined. Multivariate stepwise regression analysis identified predictive factors for malnutrition and growth retardation at maximal follow-up. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 25 children (9.5%) showed height less than -2 s.d., 70 (27%) weight less than -2 s.d., and 84 (32%) BMI less than -2 s.d. At maximal follow-up, growth retardation was present in 18 children (6.9%), whereas 40 (15%) had malnutrition. Nutritional status was more severely impaired in children with stricturing disease. Growth and nutritional retardation at diagnosis, young age, male gender, and extraintestinal manifestations at diagnosis were indicators of poor prognosis. A significant compensation was observed for weight and BMI in both genders and for height in girls. No treatment was associated with height, weight, or BMI at maximal follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In our pediatric population-based study, growth retardation and severe malnutrition were still present at maximal follow-up in 6.9 and 15% of CD children, respectively. Young boys with substantial inflammatory manifestations of CD have a higher risk of subsequent growth failure, especially when growth retardation is present at diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Patients with chronic colitis (ulcerative colitis or colonic Crohn's disease) have an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Although most of the molecular alterations reported in sporadic CRC have also been observed in colitis-associated CRC, they do not occur at the same timing and frequency, indicating a different pathophysiology. In particular, recent work highlighted the importance of chronic mucosal inflammation as a key factor favouring colorectal carcinogenesis in these patients. This may also be one of the reasons explaining the role of 5-aminosalicylates as chemopreventive agents for CRC in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with colonic involvement. Beside chemoprevention, colonoscopic screening and surveillance have been shown to be the cornerstone for CRC prevention and early detection in this particular patients' population. Periodic surveillance colonoscopy to detect dysplasia has been shown to decrease the mortality attributed to CRC. More recently, progress in imaging techniques increased our ability to identify dysplasia, and should probably now be considered to be an integral part of surveillance colonoscopy. In the future, further improvement of our knowledge of CRC biology, refinement of imaging techniques, as well as molecular discovery (e.g. identification of specific mutations in stool DNA extracts), might lead to develop more accurate diagnostic strategies to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to CRC in patients with ulcerative colitis or colonic Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease manifests during childhood or adolescence in up to 25% of patients. The potential for linear growth impairment as a complication of chronic intestinal inflammation is unique to pediatric patient populations. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), produced by the liver in response to growth hormone (GH) stimulation, is the key mediator of GH effects at the growth plate of bones. An association between impaired growth in children with Crohn's disease and low IGF-I levels is well recognized. Early studies emphasized the role of malnutrition in suppression of IGF-I production. However, a simple nutritional hypothesis fails to explain all the observations related to growth in children with Crohn's disease. The direct, growth-inhibitory effects of proinflammatory cytokines are increasingly recognized and explored. The potential role of noncytokine factors, such as lipopolysaccharides, and their potential to negatively influence the growth axis have recently been investigated with intriguing results. There is now reason for optimism that the modern anticytokine therapeutic agents available for treating children and adolescents with Crohn's disease will reduce the prevalence of this otherwise common complication. As our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie growth impairment advance, so too should the opportunity for developing further novel and targeted therapies.},

   abstract = {We present 3 cases of Crohn's disease that developed in patients with previously diagnosed short bowel syndrome from another cause. There are characteristics unique to patients with short bowel syndrome that may increase their likelihood to develop Crohn's disease, based on current concepts of the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease. These patients may have a higher than average prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. This may lead to an increase in bacterial translocation and dysregulation of the intestinal immune response. In addition, these patients often require parenteral nutrition (PN) because of macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies. Some patients receiving PN, particularly those with bowel obstructions, may be at risk for septicemia due to bacterial translocation. It is thought that PN may enhance intestinal dysmotility and impair gut immunity, contributing further to an antigenic immune response in the intestinal immune system, although supporting data is lacking. Finally, studies have demonstrated that patient's with Crohn's disease have a shorter bowel length before any intestinal resections and not related to disease activity. Although the significance of this is unclear, a shorter bowel length may potentially predispose people to the development of Crohn's disease via an alteration of intestinal motility and intestinal flora.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with relapse and remission. CD patients are admitted to hospital when bowel inflammation flares up severely, which lowers their quality of life. Enteral nutrition (EN) with an elemental diet plays an important role in the treatment for CD patients in Japan, because of its few adverse effects, and it is thought to be effective in maintaining remission. We investigated the effectiveness of EN with an elemental diet with regard to the avoidance of hospitalization. METHODS: A total of 268 patients with CD who visited hospital from 2003-2008 were enrolled. The relationship between the caloric content of an elemental diet and hospitalization as an end-point was examined retrospectively using Cox regression analysis. Cumulative non-hospitalization rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Of the 268 patients, 155 received an elemental diet providing 900 kcal/day or more. Among 237 patients with ileal involvement, 135 patients receiving an elemental diet providing 900 kcal/day or more showed a statistically significant improvement in cumulative non-hospitalization rate. Among 31 patients without ileal involvement, in contrast, the cumulative non-hospitalization rate did not differ among those receiving an elemental diet of less or more than 900 kcal/day. CONCLUSION: The use of an elemental diet of 900 kcal/day may be effective in avoiding hospitalization in CD patients with ileal lesions. This diet may be useful in improving the long-term convalescence of these patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Commercially available bile-acid sequestrants are not well tolerated by >80% of patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of colesevelam hydrochloride in patients who developed bile-acid malabsorption after cancer therapy. METHODS: The present study comprised 2 parts: a retrospective chart review of the electronic patient records and a patient questionnaire assessing outcome measures. All patients included in this study had a diagnosis of cancer and were being followed up in a cancer clinic at The Royal Marsden Hospital. In addition, all had symptoms of bile-acid malabsorption for >3 months and had been prescribed colesevelam in the gastroenterology clinic at the hospital. The electronic records of patients who were prescribed colesevelam between 2004 and 2007 were obtained from the hospital pharmacy. Those patients who were prescribed colesevelam and did not take any of the prescribed medication or did not return for a follow-up clinical review were excluded. To help further assess outcomes, a questionnaire was mailed to patients who were still residing in the United Kingdom, were not terminally ill, and were not lost to follow-up. The questionnaire comprised questions that assessed medication history (ie, whether patients were still taking colesevelam or not [and the reason for not taking colesevelam]), dosage, effectiveness for symptom relief, and adverse events. RESULTS: In total, 45 patients (37 women and 8 men; median age, 58 years [range, 32-89 years]) who received treatment with colesevelam between 2004 and 2007 were included. Of these, 36 were sent a questionnaire and 30 responded. Identifiable causes of bile acid malabsorption in this sample population were pelvic radiotherapy (n = 29), small-bowel resection (12), upper gastrointestinal surgery (2), high-dose chemotherapy (1), and new-onset Crohn's disease (1). Of these patients, 67% (30/45) had not previously responded to cholestyramine treatment, but following treatment with colesevelam, this group had a recorded improvement in: diarrhea, 83% (25/30); urgency of defecation, 74% (20/27); frequency of defecation, 72% (21/29); steatorrhea, 71% (12/17); abdominal pain, 68% (15/22); and fecal incontinence, 62% (13/21). Based on the medical chart review and the patient questionnaire, after colesevelam treatment, the following proportions of all 45 patients studied experienced improvement in symptoms: loose stool (diarrhea), 88% (medical chart) and 80% (questionnaire); frequency of defecation, 77% and 83%, respectively; steatorrhea, 76% and 80%; urgency of defecation, 76% and 80%; abdominal pain, 74% and 58%; and fecal incontinence, 69% and 74%. During the study period, 15 patients discontinued colesevelam: ineffectiveness, 5; adverse events, 5 (because >or=1 of the following: bloating, constipation, heartburn, abdominal pain, flatulence, or perianal soreness); and other reasons, 7 (too many tablets or tablets difficult to swallow [3]; symptoms resolved [2]; colesevelam replaced with another medication [1]; and lost to follow-up [1]). Sixty-seven percent (30/45) of patients continued using colesevelam for up to 4 years. CONCLUSION: In view of the data found in this retrospective chart review and patient questionnaire, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of colesevelam for bile acid malabsorption are warranted.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Effectiveness of enteral nutrition therapy is not only connected with improvement of the nutritional status of the patient, but also with its strong anti-inflammatory activity. Angiogenic growth factors play an important role in the early stage of inflammation. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) stimulate the angiogenesis and healing processes. The objective of our study was to assess the influence of the enteral nutrition therapy on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) concentrations in serum in children with different diseases of gastro-intestinal tract, in which enteral nutrition therapy is effective method of treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty two children (29 boys, 33 girls, mean age: 12.5 yrs, range: 6-18 yrs) and 25 healthy controls were included into the study. The Crohn's disease group (CD) consisted of 25 patients, ulcerative colitis group (UC)-18 patients, acute pancreatitis (AP) group-12 patients and severe malnutrition (N) group-7 patients. Serum VEGF and TGF-beta 1 concentrations were assessed at baseline, before starting and after 2 and 4 weeks of enteral nutrition therapy using ELISA immunoassays (R and D Systems, USA). RESULTS: Before starting enteral nutrition, we found increased VEGF concentration in CD group (Me = 600 pg/ml) compared to UC group (266.9 pg/ml), AP group (552.6 pg/ml), N group (238.5 pg/ml) and controls (172 pg/ml) (p < 0.05). We found decrease of VEGF concentrations during enteral nutrition in CD, UC and N group and increase in AP at the beginning, followed by decrease to the initial values. Assessing TGF-beta 1, we found its concentration increased before starting enteral nutrition in UC group (37.5 ng/ml) compared to CD group (29.7 ng/ ml) and controls (24.8 ng/ml) (p < 0.05). During enteral nutrition we observed decrease of TGF-beta 1 concentration in UC group and increase in CD group (32,7 ng/ml) and AP group (26,6 ng/ml) (p < 0.05) The best improvement of nutritional status was observed in CD patients compared to N and AP patients. CONCLUSIONS: Differentiation of serum VEGF and TGF-beta 1 concentrations, what was observed in various gastro-intestinal diseases, reflects different mechanisms of enteral nutrition therapy acting on the inflammatory process. The most efficient therapeutic effect was seen in CD, where stimulation of TGF-beta 1 production was observed.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Factors influencing response to medications in Crohn's disease (CD) patients are not fully understood. We aimed to evaluate the relationships between NOD2/CARD15 mutations, disease phenotype and age of CD diagnosis and response to medical treatment with systemic steroids, azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), and infliximab. METHODS: A retrospective medical records analysis was made of patients previously tested for the CD-associated NOD2/CARD15 mutations. Harvey- Bradshaw score was used to assess remission or response to therapy. RESULTS: CD-associated NOD2/CARD15 mutations were not related to the rate of steroids dependency or clinical response to AZA/6-MP and infliximab. Steroid dependency was associated with colonic involvement. Thirty-three of 127 (26%) patients with colonic disease were steroid dependent, compared with 7/72 (9.7%) patients with isolated small bowel disease (ISBD), (p = 0.009). ISBD was mildly associated with a better remission/response to AZA/6-MP treatment. Disease behavior and age of diagnosis were not related to response to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Response to treatment with systemic steroids, AZA/6-MP and infliximab are not related to NOD2/CARD15 mutations, age of diagnosis and disease behavior. Patients with colonic disease have higher rates of steroid dependency.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunomodulatory drugs play a major role in maintaining remission and steroid sparing in children with Crohn disease. Although thiopurine agents are commonly used, unresponsiveness or intolerance to these drugs is common. The efficacy of methotrexate in maintenance of remission has been shown in adult Crohn disease; however, pediatric data are limited. Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate in induction and maintenance of clinical remission in children with active Crohn disease who failed thiopurine treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter study, efficacy of methotrexate in inducing and maintaining remission or response was assessed by Harvey-Bradshaw activity index, paediatric Crohn disease activity index and steroid use, in 25 children with Crohn disease, refractory or intolerant to thiopurine analogues. RESULTS: Crohn disease was diagnosed at a mean age of 11.1 +/- 3.1 years and methotrexate was initiated at age 14.5 +/- 3.1 years. The median methotrexate dose was 12.5 mg/m2. Remission was achieved in 16 patients (64%), and response in 6 patients (24%). Out of 18 patients treated for longer than 6 months, 83% were in remission or response after 12 months of treatment. The mean duration of remission and response was 10.8 +/- 8.8 months. Steroid withdrawal was possible in 12/16 patients (75%) receiving steroids at methotrexate introduction. Adverse effects were observed in 6 patients (24%) including nausea and vomiting in 3, elevation of liver enzymes in 2 and pancreatitis in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Methotrexate is beneficial in maintaining remission and steroid-sparing treatment in children with Crohn disease following failure of thiopurine therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor bone acquisition and increased fracture risk are significant complications associated with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to determine the effects of 8 weeks of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) therapy upon markers of bone turnover in children with newly diagnosed CD. METHODS: Twenty-three children with newly diagnosed CD and 20 controls (without CD) were enrolled. Children with CD were treated with 8 weeks of EEN. Inflammatory markers [C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), albumin, platelets], nutritional markers (height, weight), and bone markers [C-terminal telopeptides of Type-1 collagen (CTX) and bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP)] were measured prior to and following therapy. RESULTS: At diagnosis, children with CD had elevated serum CTX (2.967 +/- 0.881 ng/ml) compared to controls (2.059 +/- 0.568 ng/ml; P = 0.0003). Following the period of EEN, CTX levels fell significantly (2.260 +/- 0.547 ng/ml; P = 0.002), while serum BAP levels (51.24 +/- 31.31 microg/L at diagnosis; control serum BAP = 66.80 +/- 23.23 microg/L; P = 0.07) increased significantly (64.82 +/- 30.51 microg/L; P = 0.02), with both normalizing to control levels. CONCLUSIONS: As well as reducing inflammation, decreasing disease activity, and improving nutrition in children with newly diagnosed CD, EEN therapy also normalized serum markers of bone turnover, suggesting an improvement in bone health. Further investigations of short- and long-term effects of EEN on bone density and overall bone health are now required.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence base for the medical (pharmaceutical and nutritional) treatment of paediatric inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Key clinical questions were formulated regarding different treatment modalities used in the treatment of paediatric (not adult-onset) IBD, in particular the induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Electronic searches were performed from January 1966 to December 2006, using the electronic search strategy of the Cochrane IBD group. Details of papers were entered on a dedicated database, reviewed in abstract form, and disseminated in full for appraisal. Clinical guidelines were appraised using the AGREE instrument and all other relevant papers were appraised using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology, with evidence levels given to all papers. RESULTS: A total of 6285 papers were identified, of which 1255 involved children; these were entered on the database. After critical appraisal, only 103 publications met our criteria as evidence on medical treatment of paediatric IBD. We identified 3 clinical guidelines, 1 systematic review, and 16 randomised controlled trials; all were of variable quality, with none getting the highest methodological scores. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive review of the evidence base for the treatment of paediatric IBD, highlighting the paucity of trials of high methodological quality. As a result, the development of clinical guidelines for managing children and young people with IBD must be consensus based, informed by the best-available evidence from the paediatric literature and high-quality data from the adult IBD literature, together with the clinical expertise and multidisciplinary experience of paediatric IBD experts.},

   abstract = {Involvement of intestinal microbes in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis) is well established. However, the mechanisms by which bacteria lead to intestinal injury in IBD remain unclear and are the focus of current research. Using adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) strain LF82, which is linked to Crohn disease, we recently demonstrated the ability of these intestinal microbes to disrupt the integrity of epithelial cells in an in vitro cell model. This disruption provides the bacteria a capacity to penetrate into and beyond the epithelial monolayer, replicate in cells, disseminate within the host, and induce a chronic immune response. These findings provide a link between microbes related to IBD, disruption of the intestinal epithelial cell barrier, and disease pathogenesis.In this addendum, we provide a synopsis on current data concerning the role of AIEC in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation, summarise our recent findings, and highlight the central role of the epithelium in mucosal defence. We also discuss, in more detail, the potential implications of our findings and present ideas for future studies and targets for intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Exclusive enteral nutrition is used as primary therapy in Crohn's disease. Nutrition support is frequently required in children with both Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis when acutely unwell and during periods of recovery. There is considerable controversy about nutritional needs during phases of active and inactive disease. It is, for example, often assumed that in acute illness a child requires increased nutritional support however the precise relationship between illness severity and energy expenditure is uncertain. This study explores the relationship between disease activity and resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Patients were recruited from the regional paediatric gastroenterology unit at Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust. Disease activity was assessed using standard scoring systems (Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index; Simple Colitis Activity Index) and biochemical markers of inflammation (C-Reactive Protein, CRP). Fat free mass was estimated from skinfold thickness and Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis. Resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry. A logarithmic correction and a linear regression model were used for analysis of REE corrected for body size. RESULTS: 55 children were studied; 37 (67%) with Crohn's disease and 18 (33%) with Ulcerative Colitis. Median PCDAI was 10 (range 0-60), 22 (59%) had PCDAI > or =10 (active disease). Median SCAI was 1.5 (range 0-12). Within disease groups there were strong correlations between REE/KgFFM(0.52) and disease activity; PCDAI (r -0.386, p 0.018) in Crohn's disease and SCAI (r -0.456, p 0.057) in Ulcerative Colitis. In the cohort as a whole there was no increase in REE/KgFFM(0.52) with increasing CRP (r 0.129, p 0.361). Using the regression model each mg/l increase in CRP was associated with a reduction in REE of nearly 1.5 kCal/day. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to demonstrate a significant relationship between REE and disease activity in children with inflammatory bowel disease.},

Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range 6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), - 0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of enteral nutrition(EN) therapy for active Crohn disease(CD) complicated with incomplete intestinal obstruction. METHODS: Clinical data of 37 patients with active CD complicated with incomplete intestinal obstruction treated with EN(n=37) between January 2003 and September 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. CD activity index (CDAI) was between 150 and 450. The patients received total enteral nutrition (TEN) 125 kJ/kg by nasogastric tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy/jejunostomy(PEG/J) tube. Clinical response was defined as a decrease in CDAI>/=70 from baseline since EN therapy, and clinical remission was defined as CDAI<150. Nutritional status, disease activity index, and side effects were recorded at the 0, 4th, and 12th week after EN therapy. RESULTS: Stricture or stenosis location included ileum in 8 (21.6%) patients, ileocolon in 19(51.4%), colon in 4(10.8%), jejunoileum in 5(13.5%), and duodenum in 1(2.7%). At 4 weeks after EN, CDAI significantly decreased(112.0+/-39.6 vs.174.6+/-34.7,P<0.05). The ratio of clinical response was 43.2%(16/37) and clinical remission was 72.9%(27/37). At 12 weeks, CDAI was 70.2+/-32.9, lower than that at week 4(P<0.05). The ratio of clinical response was 70.2%(26/37) and clinical remission was 78.4%(29/37). Other disease activity indexes such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and nutritional status such as BMI, serum albumin, prealbumin, transferrin and hemoglobin showed similar trend. During therapy, 7 cases had progressive intestinal obstruction resulting in bowel resection, 11 cases had diarrhea and/or abdominal distention due to inadequate infusion of home EN whose symptoms were improved after correction by the doctor. CONCLUSIONS: EN therapy can induce clinical response and remission in CD complicated with incomplete intestinal obstruction, relieve obstruction, alleviate the inflammatory response which plays positive role in the treatment of CD.},

We aimed to elucidate the effect of 2 different therapies on LFA-1 expression in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and correlate LFA-1 expression with disease activity. METHODS: In all, 30 patients with active CD were recruited for the present investigation. Eleven patients were treated with infliximab and 19 patients with total parenteral nutrition. The clinical activity and the expression of LFA-1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were assessed prior to and 4 weeks after treatment. Clinical activity was determined by measuring the Crohn's Disease Activity Index and LFA-1 expression was measured by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) under fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. RESULTS: In each treatment group the clinical disease activity index decreased significantly 4 weeks after treatment. In patients treated with infliximab, LFA-1 expression decreased significantly (mean MFI decreased from 1983 to 1487, P < 0.05). However, LFA-1 expression remained unchanged in the total parenteral nutrition group (mean MFI elevated from 1684 to 1902, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of therapeutic action on CD is different between infliximab and total parenteral nutrition.},

AIM: To identify dietary constituents as risk factors for development of IBD and the therapeutic efficacy of dietary modifications or enteral nutrition in IBD. METHODS: The Medline and the Cochrane Library were searched for clinical trials and meta-analyses in the scope of diet and nutrition in IBD. RESULTS: There are many studies in small cohorts of patients that claim that intake of certain diet constituents like fat, refined sugar, fruits, vegetables and fibre affect the expression of IBD. These are often compromised by insufficient data or methodological limitations and do not provide unequivocal evidence to incriminate any particular dietary factor. Among various dietary interventions, none has shown striking efficacy with the possible exception of complete enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition appears effective in both active and quiescent Crohn's disease (CD), but independent meta-analyses have shown enteral nutrition to be inferior to corticosteroids in the management of active CD, when assessed on an intention-to-treat basis. CONCLUSIONS: The current levels of knowledge concerning dietary risk factors for IBD, and the therapeutic efficacy of dietary and nutritional interventions need to be supported by well-designed trials in large cohorts of patients.},

METHODS: The Medline, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane database search of literature was carried out to identify studies that reported the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission in CD. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of clinical or endoscopic relapse. RESULTS: Ten studies were included: one randomized controlled trial, three prospective non-randomized trials, and six retrospective studies. Elemental, semielemental or polymeric diets were used as an oral supplement or a nocturnal tube feeding in addition to ordinary foods. Comparing outcomes between patients who received EN and those who did not, the clinical remission rate was significantly higher in those with EN in all seven studies. In two studies, EN showed suppressive effects on endoscopic disease activity. In all four studies investigating impacts of the quantity of enteral formula on clinical remission, higher amounts of enteral formula were associated with higher remission rates: > or =30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day (vs. <30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day), > or =1200 kcal/day (vs. <1200 kcal/day), and > or =1600 kcal/day (vs. <1600 kcal/day). Quantitative pooling of studies was not feasible because of the diversity of interventions and outcome measures among the studies. CONCLUSION: Although the evidence level is not high, the available data suggest that EN may be useful for maintaining remission in patients with CD. Large randomized controlled trials are necessary to assess a definite efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission.},

This prospective study was to assess the efficacy of EN on the maintenance rate of clinical remission in patients with quiescent CD receiving infliximab as maintenance therapy. METHODS: Fifty-six patients who achieved clinical remission with infliximab induction therapy received infliximab as maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg, every 8 weeks). Thirty-two of the 56 patients received concomitant EN: elemental diet infusion during night-time and a low fat diet during daytime (EN group), while the remaining 24 patients received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). All patients were followed for 56 weeks; CD activity index (CDAI) was assessed and CDAI < 150 was defined as clinical remission. RESULTS: During the 56-week observation, the mean CDAI was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Seven patients in the EN group ceased EN therapy because they maintained complete remission. On an intention-to-treat basis, 25 patients in the EN group (78%) and 16 patients in the non-EN group (67%) remained in clinical remission during the 56-week observation (P = 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this prospective study showed that concomitant EN during infliximab maintenance therapy does not significantly increase the maintenance rate of clinical remission in patients with CD.},

Different drugs have been focused to get clinical remission during the flare, maintenance of remission and improving the quality of life of inflammatory bowel disease patients. Recently, new therapeutic agents blocking the tumoral necrosis factor alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine have been approved for the use in these kind of patients. OBJECTIVE: To establish the first Mexican Consensus for the use of anti tumoral necrosis factor alpha agents in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A group of gastroenterologist and colorectal surgeons from different regions of the country were invited to attend to this meeting. The consensus was divided in 7 sections and a total of 53 items were evaluated for all participants. The Delphi system was used in this consensus and several clinical trials were considered in order to provide recommendations according to evidence based medicine. Finally, conclusions were obtained after discussing all items. RESULTS: This is the first mexican Consensus that provides the recommendations about the use of anti tumoral necrosis factor alpha agents in inflammatory bowel disease patients CONCLUSIONS: It is important to have a deep knowledge about the anti tumoral necrosis factor alpha in the following conditions: indications and contraindications; parameters of clinical efficacy; predicting factors of medical treatment response; strategies for preventing and treating immunogenicity; efficacy and safety as well as the clinical factors for using these agents as first line of therapy (top-down).},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective database analysis of all patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who underwent colectomy between January of 1990 and December of 2006. Demographic data, clinical, laboratory, and histopathological results were analyzed. RESULTS: We found 80 patients in the database who had undergone total colectomy whose average age was 44.8 years. IC was found in 7 patients (8.7%) from colectomy specimens among Mexican patients with IBD, with a mean age at diagnosis of 33.6 years. Subgroup analysis showed that a younger age at diagnosis and toxic megacolon were factors of statistical significance associated with IC. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IC was 8.7% in our group. A younger age of onset and toxic megacolon were the most important associated factors in patients with IC.},

Teduglutide, being developed by NPS Allelix and licensee Nycomed, is a protease-resistant analog of GLP-2 for the potential treatment of gastrointestinal disease. Teduglutide has prolonged biological activity compared with native GLP-2, and preclinical studies demonstrated significant intestinotrophic activity in models of SBS, experimental colitis and chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis. Patients with SBS rely on parenteral nutrition (PN) following bowel resection, and in a phase III clinical trial with teduglutide, > 20% reduction in PN was observed in patients with SBS receiving teduglutide. A phase II clinical trial for teduglutide in Crohn's disease observed remission rates of 55.6% in patients. At the time of publication, phase III clinical trials for SBS were ongoing, as were preclinical studies for chemotherapy-induced mucositis and pediatric indications. Teduglutide represents a novel, efficacious drug capable of increasing intestinal growth and improving intestinal function, and may change clinical management of intestinal disease and damage.},

AIM: To report retrospectively the results of pre-operative management for penetrating Crohn's disease focusing on the rate of post-operative major morbidities and need for faecal diversion. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2007, 78 patients with penetrating Crohn's disease underwent a first ileocaecal resection after a pre-operative management consisting in bowel rest, nutritional therapy, intravenous antibiotics, weaning off steroids and immunosuppressors, and drainage of abscesses when appropriate. RESULTS: Resection was performed for terminal ileitis associated with (n = 41), abscesses (n = 37) or both (n = 5). A pre-operative nutritional therapy was performed in 50 patients (68%) for 23 days (range, 7-69 days) along with a weaning off steroids and immunosuppressors. A diverting stoma was performed for six patients (7.7%). There was no post-operative death. Post-operative complications were classified as minor in 10 patients (12.8%), and major in four patients (5%). Overall, the post-operative course was uneventful in 58 patients (74%). CONCLUSION: Pre-operative management for penetrating Crohn's disease allowed ileocaecal resection with low rates of post-operative morbidity and faecal diversion.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To better understand the occurrence of Crohn's disease in mainland China and to give an updated overview of the current status of the disease. METHODS: We previously performed a computer-based literature search using 50 years of records from the Chinese Database of Biology and Medicine (1979 to 2002), combined with a manual year-by-year search of the literature from 1950 to 1978. Using a similar method, descriptive epidemiological data of the last 5 years (2003 to September 2007) were collected, pooled with our previous data and re-analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 3618 cases of Crohn's disease since 1950 have been reported from 29 provinces and cities in mainland China, comprising 2112 male and 1506 female patients, with a male predominance of 1.40:1. More than 75 percent of the patients were aged from 20 to 50 years old, with a mean age of 36.9 +/- 4.4 (1- 84) years. The extrapolated disease incidence and prevalence rates are 0.848/10(5) and 2.29/10(5) person/year, respectively. CONCLUSION: The incidence and prevalence rates of Crohn's disease have been increasing rapidly, and the disease is no longer uncommon in China, but these rates are still lower than those in developed countries and other Asian countries. An underestimation may occur because patients who were misdiagnosed or did not seek medical advice could not be included in the study. A future population-based survey is warranted.},

Whether taste perception exerts any influence on an increased consumption of carbohydrates is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nutritional habits and taste perception in CD patients, either in active or inactive disease stages. DESIGN: A prospective study was performed with 31 active and 27 inactive CD patients, and 30 age and sex-matched healthy subjects. Nutritional behavior was determined using an extensive optical nutrition questionnaire and taste perception was assessed by a 3-drop method with exceeding dilution tests. RESULTS: Active and inactive CD patients exhibited a significant increased taste threshold for the detection of all solutions (bitter: P=0.0012; salty: P=0.0198; sour: P=0.0021; and sweet: P=0.0208). For recognition, the determination of bitter solution (P=0.0014) was significantly reduced in CD patients compared with healthy subjects. No impact of clinical or objective parameters of inflammation on taste perception could be established. The consumption of refined sugar in CD patients was higher than in healthy subjects, though not significant. CONCLUSIONS: An increased taste threshold for the detection of all 4 taste qualities in active and inactive CD patients suggests a systemic pathogenesis, such as an inflammation of the oral cavity, as a manifestation of CD. In this study, changes in taste threshold were not associated with altered sugar consumption.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human polymorphisms affecting gut epithelial barrier and interactions with bacteria predispose to the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The intestinal transporter PepT1, encoded by the SLC15A1 gene, mediates intracellular uptake of bacterial products that can induce inflammation and NF-kappaB activation upon binding to NOD2, a protein often mutated in CD. Hence, we tested SLC15A1 polymorphisms for association with IBD. METHODS: Twelve SLC15A1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 1783 individuals from 2 cohorts of Swedish and Finnish IBD patients and controls. An in vitro system was set up to evaluate the potential impact of SLC15A1 polymorphism on PepT1 transporter function by quantification of NOD2-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. RESULTS: The common allele (C) of a coding polymorphism (rs2297322, Ser117Asn) was associated with CD susceptibility both in Sweden and in Finland, but with genetic effects in opposite directions (risk and protection, respectively). The best evidence of association was found in both populations when the analysis was performed on individuals not carrying NOD2 common risk alleles (Sweden allelic P = 0.0007, OR 1.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-2.92; Finland genotype P = 0.0013, OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.90). The PepT1 variant encoded by the C allele (PepT1-Ser117) was associated with reduced signaling downstream of NOD2 (P < 0.0001 compared to Pept1-Asn117). CONCLUSIONS: A functional polymorphism in the SLC15A1 gene might be of relevance to inflammation and antibacterial responses in IBD. Whether this polymorphism truly contributes to disease susceptibility needs to be further addressed, and should stimulate additional studies in other populations.},
