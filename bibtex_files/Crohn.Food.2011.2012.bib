   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists mainly of Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). Although its aetiology is still not clearly established, it is thought to be due to overly aggressive immune response to enteric bacteria in genetically predisposed individuals. Manipulating the microbiota using probiotics or prebiotics is considered as a promising field of new therapeutic strategies used to attenuate immune disorders observed during IBD. The production of nitric oxide (NO) seems to be implicated in IBD pathogenesis. In our study, an acute UC was induced in Swiss mice using 3% Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS). The preventive effects of "Ultrabiotique(R)" (a probiotic) and inulin (a prebiotic) on the colitis were investigated. The production of NO was evaluated in the supernatants of peritoneal macrophages (pMphi) cultures. Colonic mucosa histology was subsequently examined. Results showed severe acute UC after administration of DSS. High levels of NO in pMphi cultures were also observed compared to control samples. These findings correlated with a significant destruction of the colonic mucosa. Oral administration of Ultrabiotique(R) or inulin decreased the severity of DSS-induced colitis. These treatments lead to a decrease in NO levels in pMphi cultures. A considerable reduction of colonic lesions was also noticed. Our findings suggest the involvement of NO in experimental UC pathogenesis. Pre- and pro-biotics, as discussed herein, seem to have an anti-inflammatory effect.},

The organism is excreted in animal faeces and can contaminate water catchment areas. This coupled with Map's survival in the environment means that water destined for domestic use may be a source of exposure. This work was designed to determine the occurrence of Map in Lough Neagh (the largest freshwater lake in the British Isles), used as a reservoir, and in two water treatment works (WTW1 and WTW2) which abstract from the lough and which have slow sand filtration (SSF) and dissolved air flotation respectively as their principal treatment regimes. The organism was not detected in lough water samples by culture (n=70) but 29% (20/70) were positive by PCR. In the raw water to WTW1 and WTW2 no culture positives were detected but 54% (13/24) and 58% (14/24) respectively were PCR positive. In WTW1 there were no culture positives at the SSF or final water but 31% (8/26) and 45% (9/20) respectively were PCR positive. In WTW2 similar results were obtained with 26% (6/23) and 48% (11/23) in the floccules and final water respectively. At WTW2 however one culture positive was detected in the final water. This latter finding is of concern. The inability to reach definitive conclusions indicates the need for further research, particularly in the detection methods for viable Map.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the environmental factors leading to inflammatory bowel disease should help to prevent occurrence of the disease and its relapses. AIM: To review current knowledge on dietary risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library were searched for studies on diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Established non-diet risk factors include family predisposition, smoking, appendectomy, and antibiotics. Retrospective case-control studies are encumbered with methodological problems. Prospective studies on European cohorts, mainly including middle-aged adults, suggest that a diet high in protein from meat and fish is associated with a higher risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Intake of the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid may confer risk of ulcerative colitis, whereas n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective. No effect was found of intake of dietary fibres, sugar, macronutrients, total energy, vitamin C, D, E, Carotene, or Retinol (vitamin A) on risk of ulcerative colitis. No prospective data was found on risk related to intake of fruits, vegetables or food microparticles (titanium dioxide and aluminium silicate). CONCLUSIONS: A diet high in protein, particular animal protein, may be associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease and relapses. N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids may predispose to ulcerative colitis whilst n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid may protect. These results should be confirmed in other countries and in younger subjects before dietary counselling is recommended in high risk subjects.},

Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that provide beneficial health effects on the host when administered in adequate amounts. Various probiotics have been shown to suppress bacterial growth, modulate the immune system and improve intestinal barrier function. However, despite several studies with promising results, most trials are small and many have substantial methodological limitations. However, with better targeting and appropriate randomised controlled trials, this area may soon yield important therapeutic strategies to optimise GI health.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Probiotics appear to be beneficial in inflammatory bowel disease, but their mechanism of action is incompletely understood. We investigated whether probiotic-derived sphingomyelinase mediates this beneficial effect. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase) activity was measured in sonicates of the probiotic L. brevis (LB) and S. thermophilus (ST) and the non-probiotic E. coli (EC) and E. faecalis (EF). Lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) were obtained from patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy volunteers, analysing LPMC and PBMC apoptosis susceptibility, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and JNK activation. In some experiments, sonicates were preincubated with GSH or GW4869, a specific NSMase inhibitor. NSMase activity of LB and ST was 10-fold that of EC and EF sonicates. LB and ST sonicates induced significantly more apoptosis of CD and UC than control LPMC, whereas EC and EF sonicates failed to induce apoptosis. Pre-stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 induced a significant and time-dependent increase in LB-induced apoptosis of LPMC and PBMC. Exposure to LB sonicates resulted in JNK activation and ROS production by LPMC. NSMase activity of LB sonicates was completely abrogated by GW4869, causing a dose-dependent reduction of LB-induced apoptosis. LB and ST selectively induced immune cell apoptosis, an effect dependent on the degree of cell activation and mediated by bacterial NSMase. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that induction of immune cell apoptosis is a mechanism of action of some probiotics, and that NSMase-mediated ceramide generation contributes to the therapeutic effects of probiotics.},

This paper reports on the prevalence of decreased BMD in a referral cohort study of CD-patients next to the change of BMD over time in relation with CD-associated clinical characteristics. METHODS: 205 CD patients of a referral hospital were enrolled between January1998-January 2010 when measurement of BMD by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was available. Follow-up DXA scan was performed in subjects with known risk factors besides Crohn indicative for low BMD. Treatment of CD patients was according to a protocol which is comparable to the current (inter)national guidelines. In osteopenic patients, supplemental vitamin D (800 IU) and Calcium (500-1000 mg) were prescribed. RESULTS: Mean BMD at baseline was 0.97 +/- 0.16 gram/cm(2) in lumbar spine and 0.87 +/- 0.12 gram/cm(2) in the total hip. At baseline, higher age and low Body Mass Index (BMI), were negatively correlated with BMD. Eighty-four patients underwent a second BMD assessment with a median interval period of 4 years (IQR 3-6). A mean annual increase of +0.76% (95%CI: -2.63%; +3.87%) in lumbar spine and +0.43% (95%CI: -2.65% ; +1.11%) in total hip was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Higher age, male sex, low BMI, and a higher age at diagnosis of CD were associated with low BMD. Follow-up of BMD in CD patients showed a contraintuitive small increase of BMD at lumbar spine and total hip in CD patients only using supplemental vitamin D and calcium next to strict treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprising of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) is a major ailment affecting the small and large bowel. In clinics, IBD is treated using 5-amninosalicylates, antibiotics, the steroids and immunomodulators. Unfortunately, the long term usages of these agents are associated with undue side effects and compromise the therapeutic advantage. Accordingly, there is a need for novel agents that are effective, acceptable and non toxic to humans. Preclinical studies in experimental animals have shown that curcumin, an active principle of the Indian spice turmeric (Curcuma longa Linn) is effective in preventing or ameliorating UC and inflammation. Over the last few decades there has been increasing interest in the possible role of curcumin in IBD and several studies with various experimental models of IBD have shown it to be effective in mediating the inhibitory effects by scavenging free radicals, increasing antioxidants, influencing multiple signaling pathways, especially the kinases (MAPK, ERK), inhibiting myeloperoxidase, COX-1, COX-2, LOX, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, iNOS; inhibiting the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Clinical studies have also shown that co-administration of curcumin with conventional drugs was effective, to be well-tolerated and treated as a safe medication for maintaining remission, to prevent relapse and improve clinical activity index. Large randomized controlled clinical investigations are required to fully understand the potential of oral curcumin for treating IBD.},

   abstract = {The underlying biochemical consequences of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on the systemic and gastrointestinal metabolism have not yet been fully elucidated but could help to better understand the disease pathogenesis and to identify tissue-specific markers associated with the different disease stages. Here, we applied a metabonomic approach to monitor metabolic events associated with the gradual development of Crohn's disease (CD)-like ileitis in the TNF(DeltaARE/WT) mouse model. Metabolic profiles of different intestinal compartments from the age of 4 up to 24 weeks were generated by combining proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). From 8 weeks onward, mice developed CD similar to the immune and tissue-related phenotype of human CD with ileal involvement, including ileal histological abnormalities, reduced fat mass and body weight, as well as hallmarks of malabsorption with higher energy wasting. The metabonomic approach highlighted shifts in the intestinal lipid metabolism concomitant to the histological onset of inflammation. Moreover, the advanced disease status was characterized by a significantly altered metabolism of cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, plasmalogens, and sphingomyelins in the inflamed tissue (ileum) and the adjacent intestinal parts (proximal colon). These results describe different biological processes associated with the disease onset, including modifications of the general cell membrane composition, alteration of energy homeostasis, and finally the generation of inflammatory lipid mediators. Taken together, this provides novel insights into IBD-related alterations of specific lipid-dependant processes during inflammatory states.},

   abstract = {The health impacts of air pollution have received much attention and have recently been subject to extensive study. Exposure to air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) has been linked to lung and cardiovascular disease and increases in both hospital admissions and mortality. However, little attention has been given to the effects of air pollution on the intestine. The recent discovery of genes linked to susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) explains only a fraction of the hereditary variance for these diseases. This, together with evidence of increases in incidence of IBD in the past few decades of enhanced industrialization, suggests that environmental factors could contribute to disease pathogenesis. Despite this, little research has examined the potential contribution of air pollution and its components to intestinal disease. Exposure of the bowel to air pollutants occurs via mucociliary clearance of PM from the lungs as well as ingestion via food and water sources. Gaseous pollutants may also induce systemic effects. Plausible mechanisms mediating the effects of air pollutants on the bowel could include direct effects on epithelial cells, systemic inflammation and immune activation, and modulation of the intestinal microbiota. Although there is limited epidemiologic evidence to confirm this, we suggest that a link between air pollution and intestinal disease exists and warrants further study. This link may explain, at least in part, how environmental factors impact on IBD epidemiology and disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {Microparticles are small (<1 microm), nonbiological particles that are used in many areas of daily life. As food additive they are used as anticaking agents or food colorants. The most common food-derived ingested compounds are aluminium silicate and titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), the latter being a white pigment used in toothpaste or sugar toppings. The increasing abundance of microparticles in the Western diet raises the question of the potential risks associated with gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease (CD). Accumulation of particles has been shown in cells of Peyer's patches, but it is not clear whether this also has pathological effects. NLRP3 is a member of the intracellular pattern recognition receptor family and it is part of the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex containing caspase-1 which activates the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18. With regard to recent findings identifying small particles such as asbestos and monosodium urate as NLRP3 activators, TiO(2) may be another potential target for inflammasome studies. We found that macrophage-like cells readily take up TiO(2) after 6 h. Incubation of cells with TiO(2) resulted in the assembly of NLRP3 with caspase-1. This inflammasome assembly correlated with secretion of IL-1beta. In intestinal epithelial cells, TiO(2) also was found to be ingested. The counting of particles localized intracellularly revealed a dose-dependent increase of TiO(2)-positive cells. This points to the fact that in humans with a leaky intestinal barrier (such as IBD patients), TiO(2) microparticles may be taken up by macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells, may activate the inflammasome and induce IL-1beta and IL-18 secretion. This may aggravate inflammation in susceptible individuals.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Limited data suggest the absence of infliximab in breast milk, thereby implying the safety of this drug during breast-feeding. We aimed to re-evaluate the presence of infliximab in breast milk of nursing IBD patients. METHODS: Serum and breast milk were obtained post-partum from 3 breast-feeding patients with Crohn's disease before and after re-initiation of infliximab. ELISA assay was employed to measure infliximab level in maternal serum and in breast milk. The level of infliximab was also measured in breast milk of a control group of 8 nursing healthy mothers. RESULTS: Infliximab was undetectable in breast milk prior to the first infusion and was also not measurable in 8 lactating women not exposed to infliximab. Infliximab levels in breast milk rose up to 101ng/ml within 2-3days of the infusion. These levels of infliximab in breast milk were roughly 1/200th of the level in blood. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with prior reports, infliximab can be detected in the breast milk of nursing mothers. The miniscule amounts of infliximab transferred in breast milk are unlikely to result in systemic immune-suppression of the infant. Nonetheless, local effects of this exposure on the neonates' intestine and potential immune sensitization or tolerization towards the drug can not be excluded and merit further investigations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased intestinal permeability (IP) has been implicated in the etiopathogenesis, disease activity and relapse of Crohn's disease (CD). Glutamine, the major fuel for the enterocytes, may improve IP. AIM: We evaluated the effect of oral glutamine on IP and intestinal morphology in patients with CD. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, consecutive patients with CD in remission phase with an abnormal IP were randomized to a glutamine group (GG) or active control group (ACG) and were given oral glutamine or whey protein, respectively, as 0.5 g/kg ideal body weight/day for 2 months. IP was assessed by the lactulose mannitol excretion ratio (LMR) in urine, and morphometry was performed by computerized image analysis system. RESULTS: Patients (age 34.5 +/- 10.5 years; 20 males) were assigned to the GG (n = 15) or ACG (n = 15). Fourteen patients in each group completed the trial. The LMR [median (range)] in GG and ACG at 2 months was 0.029 (0.006-0.090) and 0.033 (0.009-0.077), respectively, with P = 0.6133. IP normalized in 8 (57.1%) patients in each group (P = 1.000). The villous crypt ratio (VCR) [mean (SD)] in GG and ACG at 2 months was 2.68 (1.02) and 2.49 (0.67), respectively, (P = 0.347). At the end of 2 months LMR improved significantly in GG from 0.071 (0.041-0.254) to 0.029 (0.006-0.090) (P = 0.0012) and in ACG from 0.067 (0.040-0.136) to 0.033 (0.009-0.077) (P = 0.0063). VCR improved in the GG from 2.33 (0.77) to 2.68 (1.02) (P = 0.001), and in ACG from 2.26 (0.57) to 2.49 (0.67) (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal permeability and morphology improved significantly in both glutamine and ACG.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The commensal intestinal microbiota drive the inflammation associated with Crohn's disease. However, bacteria such as bifidobacteria and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii appear to be immunoregulatory. In healthy subjects the intestinal microbiota are influenced by prebiotic carbohydrates such as fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). Preliminary data suggest that FOS increase faecal bifidobacteria, induce immunoregulatory dendritic cell (DC) responses and reduce disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease. AIMS AND METHODS: To assess the impact of FOS in patients with active Crohn's disease using an adequately powered randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with predefined clinical, microbiological and immunological end points. Patients with active Crohn's disease were randomised to 15 g/day FOS or non-prebiotic placebo for 4 weeks. The primary end point was clinical response at week 4 (fall in Crohn's Disease Activity Index of >/= 70 points) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. RESULTS: 103 patients were randomised to receive FOS (n = 54) or placebo (n = 49). More patients receiving FOS (14 (26%) vs 4 (8%); p = 0.018) withdrew before the 4-week end point. There was no significant difference in the number of patients achieving a clinical response between the FOS and placebo groups in the ITT analysis (12 (22%) vs 19 (39%), p = 0.067). Patients receiving FOS had reduced proportions of interleukin (IL)-6-positive lamina propria DC and increased DC staining of IL-10 (p < 0.05) but no change in IL-12p40 production. There were no significant differences in the faecal concentration of bifidobacteria and F prausnitzii between the groups at baseline or after the 4-week intervention. CONCLUSION: An adequately powered placebo-controlled trial of FOS showed no clinical benefit in patients with active Crohn's disease, despite impacting on DC function. ISRCTN50422530.},

   abstract = {The pregnant patient with inflammatory bowel disease presents a number of challenges to the clinician. In addition to the management of the patient's disease activity and the potential effects of disease on pregnancy, the clinician must also take into consideration any iatrogenic complications that may arise from the medical management of these conditions. Furthermore, should the patient elect to breastfeed her infant, the effect of drugs that may be passed through the breast milk must also be considered. This article focuses specifically on the issues of drug transfer to the fetus and to the breastfeeding infant. Meperidine is the sedative of choice for endoscopic procedures on pregnant patients, while benzodiazepines and propofol may be used with certain caveats. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and metronidazole are preferred if antibiotics are indicated for perianal Crohn's disease or pouchitis. The majority of medications used in the treatment of luminal IBD in pregnancy are not associated with significant adverse effects, and thus can generally be used safely. Certain medications, such as aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and cyclosporine, appear low risk, while others such as methotrexate and thalidomide are clearly contraindicated. The role of other immunomodulators and biologics remains to be clearly defined, although early experience with infliximab and similar agents appear to be low risk. Safety in breastfeeding varies considerably among medications. There are many issues to address when considering pharmaceutical intervention in the pregnant patient, and patients should be carefully counseled regarding potential teratogenicity or adverse outcomes of medication used during pregnancy and breastfeeding.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A significant fraction of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) is not sufficiently controlled with conventional therapy or suffers from therapy related side effects. Anthocyanins, highly abundant in bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus), were shown to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. We aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of bilberries in active UC. METHODS: In an open pilot trial with a total follow-up of 9 weeks the effect of a daily standardized anthocyanin-rich bilberry preparation was tested in 13 patients with mild to moderate UC. Clinical, biochemical, endoscopic and histologic parameters were assessed. RESULTS: At the end of the 6 week treatment interval 63.4% of patients achieved remission, the primary endpoint, while 90.9% of patients showed a response. In all patients a decrease in total Mayo score was detected (mean: 6.5 and 3.6 at screening and week 7, respectively; p<0.001). Fecal calprotectin levels significantly decreased during the treatment phase (baseline: mean 778 mug/g, range 192-1790 mug/g; end of treatment: mean 305 mug/g, range <30-1586 mug/g; p=0.049), including 4 patients achieving undetectable levels at end of treatment. A decrease in endoscopic Mayo score and histologic Riley index confirmed the beneficial effect. However, an increase of calprotectin levels and disease activity was observed after cessation of bilberry intake. No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the promising therapeutic potential of a standardized anthocyanin-rich bilberry preparation in UC in humans. These results clearly indicate a therapeutic potential of bilberries in UC. Further studies on mechanisms and randomized clinical trials are warranted.},

The potential role of MAP in Crohn's disease in humans and the contribution of dairy products to human exposure to MAP continue to be the subject of scientific debate. The occurrence of MAP in bulk raw milk from dairy herds was assessed using a stochastic modeling approach. Raw milk samples were collected from bulk tanks in dairy plants and tested for the presence of MAP. Results from this analytical screening were used in a Bayesian network to update the model prediction. Of the 83 raw milk samples tested, 4 were positive for MAP by culture and PCR. We estimated that the level of MAP in bulk tanks ranged from 0 CFU/ml for the 2.5th percentile to 65 CFU/ml for the 97.5th percentile, with 95% credibility intervals of [0, 0] and [16, 326], respectively. The model was used to evaluate the effect of measures aimed at reducing the occurrence of MAP in raw milk. Reducing the prevalence of paratuberculosis has less of an effect on the occurrence of MAP in bulk raw milk than does managing clinically infected animals through good farming practices.},

   abstract = {Dietary methyl donors and their genetic determinants are associated with Crohn's disease risk. We investigated whether a methyl-deficient diet (MDD) may affect development and functions of the small intestine in rat pups from dams subjected to the MDD during gestation and lactation. At 1 month before pregnancy, adult females were fed with either a standard food or a diet without vitamin B12, folate and choline. A global wall hypotrophy was observed in the distal small bowel (MDD animals 0.30 mm v. controls 0.58 mm; P< 0.001) with increased crypt apoptosis (3.37 v. 0.4%; P< 0.001), loss of enterocyte differentiation in the villus and a reduction in intestinal alkaline phosphatase production. Cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining (MDD animals 3.37% v. controls 0.4%, P< 0.001) and the Apostain labelling index showed increased crypt apoptosis (3.5 v. 1.4%; P= 0.018). Decreased proliferation was observed in crypts of the proximal small bowel with a reduced number of minichromosome maintenance 6 (MDD animals 52.83% v. controls 83.17%; P= 0.048) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells (46.25 v. 59 %; P= 0.05). This lack of enterocyte differentiation in the distal small bowel was associated with an impaired expression of beta-catenin and a decreased beta-catenin-E-cadherin interaction. The MDD affected the intestinal barrier in the proximal small bowel by decreasing Paneth cell number after immunostaining for lysosyme (MDD animals 8.66% v. controls 21.66%) and by reducing goblet cell number and mucus production after immunostaining for mucin-2 (crypts 8.66 v. 15.33%; villus 7 v. 17%). The MDD has dual effects on the small intestine by producing dramatic effects on enterocyte differentiation and barrier function in rats.},

The dietary suggestions derived from sources found in this article include nutritional deficiency screening, avoiding foods that worsen symptoms, eating smaller meals at more frequent intervals, drinking adequate fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, taking vitamin/mineral supplementation, eliminating dairy if lactose intolerant, limiting excess fat, reducing carbohydrates and reducing high-fiber foods during flares. Mixed advice exists regarding probiotics. Enteral nutrition is recommended for Crohn's disease patients in Japan, which differs from practices in the USA.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will be discussed.},

   abstract = {Epileptic seizures are a common and poorly understood comorbidity for individuals with primary brain tumors. To investigate peritumoral seizure etiology, we implanted human-derived glioma cells into severe combined immunodeficient mice. Within 14-18 d, glioma-bearing mice developed spontaneous and recurring abnormal electroencephalogram events consistent with progressive epileptic activity. Acute brain slices from these mice showed marked glutamate release from the tumor mediated by the system x(c)(-) cystine-glutamate transporter (encoded by Slc7a11). Biophysical and optical recordings showed glutamatergic epileptiform hyperexcitability that spread into adjacent brain tissue. We inhibited glutamate release from the tumor and the ensuing hyperexcitability by sulfasalazine (SAS), a US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that blocks system x(c)(-). We found that acute administration of SAS at concentrations equivalent to those used to treat Crohn's disease in humans reduced epileptic event frequency in tumor-bearing mice compared with untreated controls. SAS should be considered as an adjuvant treatment to ameliorate peritumoral seizures associated with glioma in humans.},

   abstract = {Besides their possible effects on the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), some environmental factors can modulate the clinical course of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This review is mainly devoted to describing the current knowledge of the impact of some of these factors on the outcome of IBD, with special emphasis on smoking and diet. Although the impact of smoking on the susceptibility to develop CD and UC is firmly established, its influence on the clinical course of both diseases is still debatable. In CD, active smoking is a risk factor for postoperative recurrence. Beyond this clinical setting, smoking cessation seems to be advantageous in those CD patients who were smokers at disease diagnosis, while smoking resumption may be of benefit in ex-smokers with resistant UC. The role of dietary habits on the development of IBD is far from being well established. Also, food intolerances are very frequent, but usually inconsistent among IBD patients, and therefore no general dietary recommendations can be made in these patients. In general, IBD patients should eat a diet as varied as possible. Regarding the possible therapeutic role of some dietary components in IBD, lessons should be drawn from the investigation of the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in CD. Low-fat diets seem to be particularly useful. Also, some lipid sources, such as olive oil, medium-chain triglycerides, and perhaps omega-3 fatty acids, might have a therapeutic effect. Fermentable fiber may have a role in preventing relapses in inactive UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIM: Despite their well known anti-inflammatory actions, the clinical usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel disease is controversial. We aimed to systematically review the available data on the performance of omega-3 PUFA as therapeutic agents in these patients. METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched for RCT of fish oil or omega-3 PUFA therapy in both active and inactive ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, without limitation on either the length of therapy or the form it was given, including nutritional supplements and enteral formula diets. Eligible articles were assessed for methodological quality on the basis of the adequacy of the randomisation process, concealment of allocation, blinding of intervention and outcome, possible biases, and completeness of follow-up. The five-point Oxford quality score was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 19 RCT were finally selected for this review. Overall, available data do not allow to support the use of omega-3 PUFA supplementation for the treatment of both active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease. Negative results are quite consistent in trials assessing the use of omega-3 PUFA to maintain disease remission, particularly ulcerative colitis, and to a lesser extent Crohn's disease. Trials on their use in active disease do not allow to draw firm conclusions mainly because the heterogeneity of design (ulcerative colitis) or their short number (Crohn's disease). In most trials, the appropriateness of the selected placebo is questionable. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review does not allow to make firm recommendations about the usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel disease.},

Despite widespread use of these natural therapies by patients, health care providers may be unfamiliar with probiotics as a treatment modality. This review describes the rationale for use of probiotics in IBD, the history behind current research directions, and recent controlled clinical studies in which efficacy of probiotics has been explored in patients with IBD. Emphasis is placed upon critical analysis of study designs for investigations that used lactic acid-producing bacteria or Saccharomyces boulardii in management of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. While there is suggestion of benefit when patients with ulcerative colitis use bacterial therapies and when patients with Crohn's disease use S boulardii, small sample sizes and methodological flaws in study designs necessitate that additional investigations be conducted before probiotics can be routinely recommended in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Intestinal epithelial cell damage is frequently seen in the mucosal lesions of inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Complete remission of these diseases requires both the cessation of inflammation and the migration of enterocytes to repair the damaged epithelium. Lyophilized Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb, Biocodex) is a nonpathogenic yeast widely used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment and prevention of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disorders. In this study, we determined whether Sb could accelerate enterocyte migration. Cell migration was determined in Sb force-fed C57BL6J mice and in an in vitro wound model. The impact on alpha2beta1 integrin activity was assessed using adhesion assays and the analysis of alpha2beta1 mediated signaling pathways both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that Sb secretes compounds that enhance the migration of enterocytes independently of cell proliferation. This enhanced migration was associated with the ability of Sb to favor cell-extracellular matrix interaction. Indeed, the yeast activates alpha2beta1 integrin collagen receptors. This leads to an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic molecules, including focal adhesion kinase and paxillin, involved in the integrin signaling pathway. These changes are associated with the reorganization of focal adhesion structures. In conclusion Sb secretes motogenic factors that enhance cell restitution through the dynamic regulation of alpha2beta1 integrin activity. This could be of major importance in the development of novel therapies targeting diseases characterized by severe mucosal injury, such as inflammatory and infectious bowel diseases.},

Some researchers have indicated a possible role of MAP in Crohn's disease. Despite extensive research and large and important advances in the past few decades, the etiology of Crohn's disease remains indefinite. The most probable transmission route of MAP from animals to humans is milk and dairy products. Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis has already been detected in milk samples worldwide, and some studies have reported that MAP is resistant to pasteurization. In Brazil, MAP has been reported in raw milk samples; however, Brazilian retail pasteurized milk has not yet been tested for viable MAP. The aim of this study was to investigate MAP in pasteurized milk in the region of Vicosa (Minas Gerais, Brazil). Thirty-seven samples were collected and processed for culture of MAP. One colony similar to MAP was observed and confirmed by IS900-nested PCR and sequencing. Analysis revealed 97 to 99% identity with the MAP K-10 strain. This study is the first report of the presence of MAP in retail pasteurized whole milk in Brazil.},

Cytotoxic CD8alphabeta(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) contribute to the development of Crohn's disease-like ileitis in TNF(DeltaARE/+) mice. In this study, we characterized the role of ER-UPR mechanisms in contributing to the disease-associated phenotype of cytotoxic IEL under conditions of chronic inflammation. Inflamed TNF(DeltaARE/+) mice exhibited increased expression of Grp78, ATF6, ATF4, and spliced XBP1 in CD8alphabeta(+) IEL but not in CD8alphaalpha(+) IEL or in lamina propria lymphocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis in CD8alphabeta(+) T cells showed selective recruitment of ER-UPR transducers to the granzyme B gene promoter. Heterozygous Grp78(-/+) mice exhibited an attenuated granzyme B-dependent cytotoxicity of CD8alphabeta(+) T cells against intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting a critical activity of this ER-associated chaperone in maintaining a cytotoxic T cell phenotype. Granzyme B-deficient CD8alphabeta(+) T cells showed a defect in IL-2-mediated proliferation in Grp78(-/+) mice. Adoptively transferred Grp78(-/+) CD8alphabeta(+) T cells had a decreased frequency of accumulation in the intestine of RAG2(-/-) recipient mice. The tissue pathology in TNF(DeltaARE/+) x Grp78(-/+) mice was similar to TNF(DeltaARE/+) mice, even though the cytotoxic effector functions of CD8alphabeta(+) T cells were significantly reduced. In conclusion, ER stress-associated UPR mechanisms promote the development and maintenance of the pathogenic cytotoxic CD8alphabeta(+) IEL phenotype in the mouse model of Crohn's disease-like ileitis.},

The aim of the present work was to determine whether the anti-inflammatory effects reported for yoghurt in acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced intestinal inflammation in mice also could prevent or attenuate the recurrent intestinal inflammation, thus maintaining remission. The innate response also was evaluated through participation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the analysis of T-cell populations to determine the effects of yoghurt in an acute inflammatory bowel disease model. Yoghurt exerted a beneficial effect on acute intestinal inflammation by regulating T-cell expansion and modulating the expression of TLRs, with decrease of TLR4(+) and increase of TLR9(+) cells. The anti-inflammatory effect of yoghurt also was demonstrated in a recurrent inflammation model. Yoghurt administration during the remission phase prevented the recurrence of inflammation without producing undesirable side effects. The yoghurt effect may be mediated by increased interleukin 10 production and changes in intestinal microbiota.},

Such exposure avenues are especially relevant for dairy farms practicing good management procedures since calves on these farms could be infected via dams that have yet to be identified as MAP-positive. Indeed, of 18 calves in the present study that became paratuberculosis parameter-positive, five had dams that were negative for all parameters pre-calving. Parameters used herein to define paratuberculosis status were serum ELISA, serum agar gel immunodiffusion, cultureable fecal MAP, histopathology at necropsy and clinical disease. Thirty-four newborn calves, whose dams were paratuberculosis-positive, were assigned to four different treatment groups. Ten were treated daily for 60 days with viable Dietzia added to their antibiotic-free milk feedings; none became positive for any parameter with age. In contrast, seven of eight calves that were not treated became positive for one or more paratuberculosis-associated parameter. Sixteen calves were treated with viable Dietzia for the first two days of life; eight were then not treated further, whereas the other eight were treated an additional 58 days with Dietzia added to tetracycline-fortified milk (Dietzia is sensitive to tetracycline). In these two groups, positivity developed in five of eight and six of eight, respectively. These results indicated that (a) a daily, 60-day treatment with viable Dietzia effectively prevented development of parameters indicative of paratuberculosis and (b) this treatment, in combination with good management practices, has the potential to eradicate MAP from animals/herds, which should curtail the spread of MAP. Such results should significantly reduce human exposure to MAP, which in turn, could have relevance for the controversial role of MAP in Crohn's disease, type-1 diabetes mellitus, sarcoidosis, Blau syndrome, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and multiple sclerosis.},

   abstract = {A naturally occurring gastrointestinal disease, primarily of ruminants (Johne disease), is a chronic debilitating disease that is caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). MAP infection occurs primarily in utero and in newborns. Outside our Dietzia probiotic treatment, there are no preventive/curative therapies for bovine paratuberculosis. Interestingly, MAP is at the center of controversy as to its role in (cause of) Crohn disease (CD) and more recently, its role in diabetes, ulcerative colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); the latter two, like CD, are considered to be a result of chronic intestinal inflammation. Treatments, both conventional and biologic agents, which induce and maintain remission are directed at curtailing processes that are an intricate part of inflammation. Most possess side effects of varying severity, lose therapeutic value, and more importantly, none routinely result in prevention and/or cures. Based on (a) similarities of Johne disease and Crohn disease, (b) a report that Dietzia inhibited growth of MAP under specific culture conditions, and (c) findings that Dietzia when used as a probiotic, (i) was therapeutic for adult bovine paratuberculosis, and (ii) prevented development of disease in MAP-infected calves, the goal of the present investigations was to design protocols that have applicability for IBD patients. Dietzia was found safe for cattle of all ages and for normal and immunodeficient mice. The results strongly warrant clinical evaluation as a probiotic, in combination with/without dexamethasone.},

Conventional therapy and more recently biologic agents, all with varying degrees of drawbacks, have resulted in improved control of these diseases.

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), results in substantial morbidity and is difficult to treat. New strategies for adjunct therapies are needed. One candidate is the semi-essential amino acid, L-arginine (L-Arg), a complementary medicine purported to be an enhancer of immunity and vitality in the lay media. Using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) as a murine colonic injury and repair model with similarities to human UC, we assessed the effect of L-Arg, as DSS induced increases in colonic expression of the y(+) cationic amino acid transporter 2 (CAT2) and L-Arg uptake. L-Arg supplementation improved the clinical parameters of survival, body weight loss, and colon weight, and reduced colonic permeability and the number of myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils in DSS colitis. Luminex-based multi-analyte profiling demonstrated that there was a marked reduction in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression with L-Arg treatment. Genomic analysis by microarray demonstrated that DSS-treated mice supplemented with L-Arg clustered more closely with mice not exposed to DSS than to those receiving DSS alone, and revealed that multiple genes that were upregulated or downregulated with DSS alone exhibited normalization of expression with L-Arg supplementation. Additionally, L-Arg treatment of mice with DSS colitis resulted in increased ex vivo migration of colonic epithelial cells, suggestive of increased capacity for wound repair. Because CAT2 induction was sustained during L-Arg treatment and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) requires uptake of L-Arg for generation of NO, we tested the effect of L-Arg in iNOS(-/-) mice and found that its benefits in DSS colitis were eliminated. These preclinical studies indicate that L-Arg supplementation could be a potential therapy for IBD, and that one mechanism of action may be functional enhancement of iNOS activity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Probiotics are increasingly advocated in the management of various gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the current attitudes and prescribing practices of surgeons and gastroenterologists for probiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: A questionnaire was designed to look at the frequency of probiotic prescribing, types of probiotics used, indications for and duration of treatment and clinicians' experiences with probiotic use. A total of 220 questionnaires were mailed to consultant gastroenterologists and surgeons practicing in the UK. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 80.5%, of which 69.5% of respondents said they recommended or prescribed probiotic food supplements to their patients, including 53.4% of surgeons and 80.8% of gastroenterologists (P = 0.00013). The most popular probiotic supplements among surgeons were probiotic-containing yoghurt and drinks (79.5% and 71.8%, respectively), whereas VSL#3 was more popular with gastroenterologists (83.3%). The most popular indications were irritable bowel syndrome (70.7% of prescribers) and pouchitis (67.5% of prescribers). Many respondents prescribed long-term probiotics. Most consultants had been prescribing probiotics for a period of 1 to 5 years. CONCLUSION: Probiotics are popular among gastroenterologists and surgeons in the UK for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Further evidence to support their routine use, by way of large, well-designed randomized controlled trials, is necessary.},

AIM: To assess, in a group of patients with IBD in remission or with a mild disease activity, whether serological markers of eosinophil activation, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil protein X (EPX), are related to evidence of IgE hypersensitivity and to the eosinophilia in gut mucosa. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with IBD (21 Crohn's disease and 40 ulcerative colitis) in remission or with a mild disease activity were screened for IgE hypersensitivity and serological levels of ECP and EPX. Colonic biopsies were taken to assess mucosal eosinophilic infiltration. RESULTS: Skin prick test were positive in 31.1% of the patients with IBD, showing skin reactions to food allergens in 17.7%. Skin prick test findings were unrelated to ECP or EPX levels, or to clinical activity or eosinophil counts in the gut mucosa. A significant correlation was found between ECP and EPX levels (r=0.77; P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Serological ECP and EPX findings did not correlate with IgE hypersensitivity findings or eosinophilic colonic infiltration in patients with IBD in remission or with mild disease activity. The role of eosinophils in IBD needs to be better characterized in the colonic mucosa, instead of relying on serological tests.},

Nutritional interventions either alone or associated to drug therapy may be effective to achieve and maintain inflammation remission. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate usual food intake as quantitative and qualitatively, in CD patients; and describe the effect of a supplement containing whey proteins and TGF- on their body composition. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dietary intake was assessed considering 42 consecutive patients, followed in a tertiary center, and by using the 3-day food recall and food intake frequency questionnaire. Body composition was assessed previously and 8 weeks after supplementation with a diet containing whey proteins and TGF-beta (N = 22). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Considering carbohydrates and lipids, most patients had adequate dietary intake according recommendations. Protein, saturated fat, B12 vitamin and zinc intakes were higher than the recommended values. The dietary fiber, A, D, C and E vitamins, calcium, iron, folate, potassium and sodium intakes did not reach the recommended requirements in most patients. Patients supplemented with the whey protein and TGF-beta dietary presented a positive increment in their lean body mass, when compared to non-supplemented group. CONCLUSION: CD patients require nutritional orientation. Whey protein intake resulted in significant differences, such as improvement in Lean Body Mass and reduction in Fat percentage.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A six-week course of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is recommended as first treatment in active paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to assess short-term and long-term outcome of EEN, and to identify predictive factors of treatment success. METHODS: The medical records of newly diagnosed paediatric CD patients initiating EEN as remission induction therapy between January 2008 and October 2011 were retrospectively studied. Treatment outcome was assessed using a previously described pattern recognition model. RESULTS: 77 CD patients (median age 13.9 years, 57% male) initiated a six-week course of EEN, combined with azathioprine maintenance treatment in 92%. Patients received EEN as either hyperosmolar sip feeds or polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. In patients completing a six-week course of EEN (n=58), complete remission was achieved in 71%, partial remission in 26%, and no response in 3%. Complete remission rates were higher in children presenting with isolated ileal/ileocaecal disease and malnutrition. Nineteen patients discontinued EEN before the intended treatment period due to worsening of symptoms (n=9) or adherence issues (n=10). Non-adherence occurred more often in older children, females, children from non-Dutch parents, and patients taking hyperosmolar sip feeds compared with polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. The likelihood of relapsing disease within the first year after EEN treatment was 59%. CONCLUSION: A six-week course of EEN is effective in newly diagnosed paediatric CD, with response rates that seem to be influenced by disease location and nutritional status, but not by type of formula. Non-adherence occurs frequently and limits the success of this treatment in everyday clinical practice.},

We sought to review all cases of T-cell NHL reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors for all approved indications and examine the risk of T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors in comparison with the use of thiopurines in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) was queried for all lymphomas following treatment with the following TNF-alpha inhibitors: infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, and their trade names. Full reports for T-cell NHL cases were identified using the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, T-cell NHL reported in patients IBD with the use of the thiopurines-azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and their trade names were also collected. A search of MEDLINE was performed for additional T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors or thiopurines, not reported to the FDA but available in published literature. The histological subtypes of T-cell NHL reported with TNF-alpha inhibitors were compared with reported subtypes in Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) -17 registry. Reported risk of T-cell NHL in IBD with TNF-alpha inhibitors, thiopurines, or concomitant use was calculated using Fisher's exact test using 5-aminosalicylates as control drugs. RESULTS: A total of 3,130,267 reports were downloaded from the FDA AERS (2003-2010). Ninety-one cases of T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors were identified in the FDA AERS and nine additional cases were identified on MEDLINE search. A total of 38 patients had rheumatoid arthritis, 36 cases had Crohn's disease, 11 had psoriasis, 9 had ulcerative colitis, and 6 had ankylosing spondylitis. Sixty-eight of the cases (68%) involved exposure to both a TNF-alpha inhibitor and an immunomodulator (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, leflunomide, or cyclosporine). Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) was the most common reported subtype, whereas mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome and HSTCL were identified as more common with TNF-alpha-inhibitor exposure compared with SEER-17 registry. Nineteen cases of T-cell NHL with thiopurines were identified in the FDA AERS and one additional case on MEDLINE. Reported risk of T-cell NHL was higher with TNF-alpha inhibitor use in combination with thiopurines (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.98-354.09; P<0.0001) and thiopurines alone (95% CI 8.32-945.38; P<0.0001) but not with TNF-alpha inhibitor use alone (95% CI 0.13-10.61; P=1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of T-cell NHL is increased with TNF-alpha inhibitor use in combination with thiopurines but not with TNF-alpha inhibitors alone.},

   abstract = {Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is the most important anti-inflammatory cytokine at intestinal level, and its absence is involved in inflammatory bowel diseases. However, oral treatment with IL-10 is difficult because of its low survival in the gastrointestinal tract and systemic treatments lead to undesirable side effects. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of the administration of milks fermented by Lactococcus lactis strains that produce IL-10 under the control of the xylose-inducible expression system using a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis murine model. Mice that received milks fermented by L. lactis strains producing IL-10 in the cytoplasm (Cyt strain) or secreted to the product (Sec strain) showed lower damage scores in their large intestines, decreased IFN-gamma levels in their intestinal fluids and lower microbial translocation to liver, compared to mice receiving milk fermented by the wild-type strain or those not receiving any treatment. The results obtained in this study show that the employment of fermented milks as a new form of administration of IL-10-producing L. lactisis effective in the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease in a murine model.},

This group includes approximately 80 disorders, some of which can at times be associated in a single patient. In psoriasis, Crohn's disease may be observed slightly more frequently, but ulcerative colitis and celiac disease are also an issue. The underlying relations between these disorders comprise: i) genetic data obtained by genome-wide association studies that show the involvement of shared predisposing loci and/or genes, for example, in innate immunity; ii) immunological data: these disorders share inflammation effector mechanisms, particularly the activation pathway of Th17 lymphocytes, which explains the efficacy of anti-TNF antibodies and anti-IL-12/23; and iii) environmental co-factors such as smoking, possibly certain food proteins (gliadin, etc.), and bacterial infections that are probably decisive elements in the genesis of these diseases.},

Most studies are limited by design or do not show that probiotic treatment is effective. Only a few randomised controlled trials have demonstrated any beneficial effect of probiotic use in IBD; namely, the use of VSL#3 in patients with pouchitis and ulcerative colitis. So far, the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of Crohn's disease has not been clearly demonstrated. Furthermore, issues pertaining to their mechanisms of action, dosages and dosing intervals, safety, and health insurance coverage are currently unresolved. Given the limited body of evidence of their efficacy from controlled trials and the many unanswered questions on probiotic treatment, we recommend following the evidence obtained from well-designed randomised controlled trials and only prescribing probiotic treatment (e.g. VSL #3) for the prevention of pouchitis and the treatment of patients with mildly active ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {Autism is a heterogeneous group of life-long neurologic problems that begin in childhood. Success in efforts to understand and treat autism has been mostly elusive. The role of autoimmunity in autism has gained recognition both for associated systemic autoimmune disease and the presence of brain autoantibodies in autistic children and their family members. There is an acknowledged genetic susceptibility to autism--most notably allotypes of complement C4. C4 defects are associated with several autoimmune diseases and also confer susceptibility to mycobacterial infections. Mycobacterium avium ss. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes an enteric inflammatory disease in ruminant animals (Johne's disease) and is the putative cause of the very similar Crohn's disease in humans. Humans are widely exposed to MAP in food and water. MAP has been also linked to ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, sarcoidosis, Blau syndrome, autoimmune (Type 1) diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and multiple sclerosis. Environmental agents are thought to trigger autism in the genetically at risk. Molecular mimicry is the proposed mechanism by which MAP is thought to trigger autoantibodies. Autoantibodies to brain myelin basic protein (MBP) is a common feature of autism. This article considers the subset of autoimmunity-related autism patients and postulates that MAP, through molecular mimicry to its heat shock protein HSP65, triggers autism by stimulating antibodies that cross react with myelin basic protein (MBP).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a severe, lifelong disease characterised by inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa. The impact on patients and society is high as ill health can be lifelong and can negatively affect patients' quality of life. Costs to the NHS are high, particularly for patients needing hospitalisation. Conventional treatment pathways are complex. More recently, a group of drugs called tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (anti-TNF-alpha agents) have been evaluated for their effectiveness in CD. One of these, infliximab, is currently recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE; 2002) for patients with severe, active CD where patients are refractory to or intolerant of conventional treatment. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether there is evidence for greater clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness for either adalimumab or infliximab. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Library (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) 2007 Issue 2; MEDLINE (Ovid) 2000 to May/June 2007; MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (Ovid) 4 June and 26 June 2007; EMBASE (Ovid) 2000 to May/June 2007. The European Medicines Agency, the US Food and Drug Administration and other relevant websites. REVIEW METHODS: Standard systematic review methods were used for study identification and selection, data extraction and quality assessment. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing adalimumab or infliximab with standard treatment (placebo), RCTs comparing adalimumab with infliximab, or RCTs comparing different dosing regimens of either adalimumab or infliximab in adults and children with moderate-to-severe active CD intolerant or resistant to conventional treatment were eligible for inclusion. A systematic review of published studies on the cost and cost-effectiveness of adalimumab and infliximab was undertaken. The economic models of cost-effectiveness submitted by the manufacturers of both drugs were critically appraised and, where appropriate, rerun using parameter inputs based on the evidence identified by the authors of the technology asessment report. A de novo Markov state transition model was constructed to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for adalimumab and infliximab therapy compared with standard care. RESULTS: Based on 11 trials, there was evidence from both induction and maintenance trials that both adalimumab and infliximab therapy were beneficial compared with placebo (standard care) for adults with moderate-to-severe CD and, for infliximab, for adults with fistulising CD; results were statistically significant for some time points. Between 6% and 24% (adalimumab), and 21% and 44% (infliximab) more patients achieved remission with anti-TNF-alpha antibodies than with placebo in the induction trials. Between 24% and 29% (adalimumab), and 14% and 24% (infliximab) more patients achieved remission with anti-TNF-alpha antibodies in the two large maintenance trials at reported follow-up. In fistulising CD, between 29% and 42% (induction trial) and 23% (maintenance trial) more patients achieved a > 50% reduction in fistulas with infliximab than with placebo at reported follow-up. There was no direct evidence to show that 'responders' were more likely to benefit from treatment than 'non-responders' in the longer term. Few differences were found between treatment and standard care arms for selected adverse events, though high proportions of scheduled crossovers resulted in a lack of a true placebo group in most of the maintenance trials. No published studies on the cost-effectiveness of adalimumab were identified. The four independently funded studies identified for infliximab suggested high cost-effectiveness ratios [all above pound50,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for non-fistulising disease and all above pound100,000/QALY for fistulising disease]. A budget impact assessment suggested that total cost to the NHS in England and Wales for induction in severe disease only could range between pound17M and pound92M and for maintenance for 1 year between pound140M and pound200M. LIMITATIONS: Regarding clinical effectiveness, there were concerns about the trial design and lack of clarity, which may have affected interpretation of results. None of the trials matched exactly the licence indications or NICE guidance, which specify the use of these drugs in patients with 'severe' disease. All trials were multicentre, and applicability to UK populations, particularly in terms of standard care being provided and in terms of patients having failed or having become intolerant to conventional treatment, was uncertain. The published economic models relied heavily on little information and data from small samples. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF therapy with adalimumab or infliximab may have a beneficial effect compared with standard care on outcome measures for induction and maintenance. The findings were that for induction, both adalimumab and infliximab are cost-effective (dominant relative to standard care) in the management of severe CD, and adalimumab (but not infliximab) is cost-effective for moderate CD, according to limits generally accepted by NICE. On the basis of the analysis presented here, neither drug is likely to be cost-effective as maintenance therapy for moderate or severe disease. Perhaps, most importantly, the analysis reflected the fact that a substantial number of patients would achieve remission under standard care and that the incidence of relapse among those in remission was such that maintenance therapy would have to show greater effectiveness than at present and/or be much less costly than it currently is in order to reach the levels of generally accepted cost-effectiveness. Any future trials need to be designed to meet the particular challenges of measuring and quantifying benefit in this patient group. FUNDING: The research was funded by the HTA programme on behalf of NICE.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human ex vivo evidence indicating that an inappropriate immune response(s) to nonpathogenic bacteria contributes to disease pathogenesis in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is limited. The aim of the present study was to compare and contrast the early innate immune response of pediatric "healthy" versus CD mucosa to pathogenic, probiotic, and commensal bacteria. METHODS: "Healthy control" and CD pediatric mucosal biopsies (terminal ileum and transverse colon) were cocultured for 8 hours with E. coli O42, Lactobacillus GG (LGG), Bacteroidesthetaiotaomicron (B. theta), or stimulated with interleukin (IL)-1beta (positive control). Matched nonstimulated biopsies served as experimental controls. IL-8 was the immune marker of choice. IL-8 mRNA and protein levels were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. RESULTS: IL-8 secretion was observed when control, ileal biopsies were exposed to pathogenic O42 and probiotic LGG, with no response noted to commensal B. theta. In comparison, Crohn's ileal biopsies showed impaired ability to induce IL-8 in response to O42 and LGG. Control colonic tissue showed a limited response to O42 or B. theta and LGG significantly reduced IL-8 secretion. Unlike control tissue, however, Crohn's ileal and colonic tissue did respond to B. theta, with more enhanced expression in the colon. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first ex vivo data to support the notion that aberrant mucosal recognition of commensal bacteria may contribute to pediatric CD. While IL-8 responses to O42 and LGG varied with disease status and anatomical location, B. theta consistently induced significant IL-8 both in ileal and colonic CD tissue, which was not seen in control, healthy tissue.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Many species within the phylum Firmicutes are thought to exert anti-inflammatory effects. We quantified bacteria belonging to the genus Butyricicoccus in stools of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). We evaluated the effect of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in a rat colitis model and analysed the ability to prevent cytokine-induced increases in epithelial permeability. DESIGN: A genus-specific quantitative PCR was used for quantification of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC or CD and healthy subjects. The effect of B pullicaecorum on trinitrobenzenesulfonic (TNBS)-induced colitis was assessed and the effect of B pullicaecorum culture supernatant on epithelial barrier function was investigated in vitro. RESULTS: The average number of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC and CD in active (UC: 8.61 log10/g stool; CD: 6.58 log10/g stool) and remission phase (UC: 8.69 log10/g stool; CD: 8.38 log10/g stool) was significantly lower compared with healthy subjects (9.32 log10/g stool) and correlated with disease activity in CD. Oral administration of B pullicaecorum resulted in a significant protective effect based on macroscopic and histological criteria and decreased intestinal myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-12 levels. Supernatant of B pullicaecorum prevented the loss of transepithelial resistance (TER) and the increase in IL-8 secretion induced by TNFalpha and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in a Caco-2 cell model. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have lower numbers of Butyricicoccus bacteria in their stools. Administration of B pullicaecorum attenuates TNBS-induced colitis in rats and supernatant of B pullicaecorum cultures strengthens the epithelial barrier function by increasing the TER.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Proper interactions between the intestinal mucosa, gut microbiota and nutrient flow are required to establish homoeostasis of the host. Since the proximal part of the small intestine is the first region where these interactions occur, and since most of the nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum, it is important to understand the dynamics of metabolic responses of the mucosa in this intestinal region. DESIGN: Germ-free mice aged 8-10 weeks were conventionalised with faecal microbiota, and responses of the jejunal mucosa to bacterial colonisation were followed over a 30-day time course. Combined transcriptome, histology, (1)H NMR metabonomics and microbiota phylogenetic profiling analyses were used. RESULTS: The jejunal mucosa showed a two-phase response to the colonising microbiota. The acute-phase response, which had already started 1 day after conventionalisation, involved repression of the cell cycle and parts of the basal metabolism. The secondary-phase response, which was consolidated during conventionalisation (days 4-30), was characterised by a metabolic shift from an oxidative energy supply to anabolic metabolism, as inferred from the tissue transcriptome and metabonome changes. Detailed transcriptome analysis identified tissue transcriptional signatures for the dynamic control of the metabolic reorientation in the jejunum. The molecular components identified in the response signatures have known roles in human metabolic disorders, including insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the dynamic jejunal response to the microbiota and supports a prominent role for the jejunum in metabolic control, including glucose and energy homoeostasis. The molecular signatures of this process may help to find risk markers in the declining insulin sensitivity seen in human type 2 diabetes mellitus, for instance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), which includes both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is caused by a complex interplay involving genetic predisposition, environmental factors and an infectious agent. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is a promising pathogen candidate since it produces a chronic intestinal inflammatory disease in ruminants that resembles CD in humans. MAP is a ubiquitous microorganism, although its presence in the food chain, especially in milk from infected animals, is what made us think that there could be an association between lactase persistence (LP) and IBD. The LCT mutation has brought adaptation to dairy farming which in turn would have increased exposure of the population to infection by MAP. NOD2 gene mutations are highly associated to CD. METHODS: In our study, CD and UC patients and controls from the North of Spain were genotyped for the lactase gene (LCT) and for three NOD-2 variants, R702W, G908R and Cins1007fs. MAP PCR was carried out in order to assess MAP infection status and these results were correlated with LCT and NOD2 genotypes. RESULTS: As for LP, no association was found with IBD, although UC patients were less likely to present the T/T-13910 variant compared to controls, showing a higher C-allele frequency and a tendency to lactase non-persistence (LNP). NOD2 mutations were associated to CD being the per-allele risk higher for the Cins1007fs variant. MAP infection was more extended among the healthy controls (45.2%) compared to CD patients (21.38%) and UC patients (19.04%) and this was attributed to therapy. The Asturian CD cohort presented higher levels of MAP prevalence (38.6%) compared to the Basque CD cohort (15.5%), differences also attributed to therapy. No interaction was found between MAP infection and LCT or NOD2 status. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that LP is not significantly associated with IBD, but that MAP infection and NOD2 do show not mutually interacting associations with IBD.},

Similarly, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are also prevalent in these regions. Evidence exists to support that factors, such as lack of zinc (it is common in patients with IBD, in particular Crohn's patients) may significantly affect the activity of some enzymes, such as, disaccharidases and other digesting enzymes of carbohydrates and that would lead to the recruitment of incompletely digested carbohydrates to the terminal ileum and continual stimulation of the immune-response accordingly. This concept may explain the observation of the existence of higher significant percentage of severe disease in Caucasian patients with IBD comparable with the respected Asian patients who consume less.},

   abstract = {Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis CRL 581, a thermophilic lactic acid bacterium used as a starter culture for the manufacture of several fermented dairy products, possesses an efficient proteolytic system that is able to release a series of potentially bioactive peptides (i.e., antihypertensive and phosphopeptides) from alpha- and beta-caseins. Considering the potential beneficial health effects of the peptides released by L. delbrueckii ssp. lactis CRL 581 from milk proteins, the aim of this work was to analyze the anti-mutagenic and anti-inflammatory properties of the casein hydrolysates generated by the cell envelope-associated proteinase of this bacterium. The ability of alpha- and beta-casein hydrolysates to suppress the mutagenesis of a direct-acting mutagen 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide on Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 increased concomitantly with the time of casein hydrolysis. The anti-inflammatory effect of the beta-casein hydrolysate was evaluated using a trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced Crohn's disease murine model. The hydrolysate was administered to mice 10 d before the intrarectal inoculation of TNBS. The mice that received beta-casein hydrolysate previously to TNBS showed decreased mortality rates, faster recovery of initial body weight loss, less microbial translocation to the liver, decreased beta-glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase activities in the gut, and decreased colonic macroscopic and microscopic damage compared with the animals that did not receive this hydrolysate. In addition, beta-casein hydrolysate exerted a beneficial effect on acute intestinal inflammation by increased interleukin 10 and decreased IFN-gamma production in the gut. Our findings are consistent with the health-promoting attributes of the milk products fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. lactis CRL 581 and open up new opportunities for developing novel functional foods.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing condition that has no certain cure. Both genetic susceptibility and nutrition have key roles, but their level of involvement varies between patients. Interacting gene pathways influence the probability of disease development, but these are affected by stress and various environmental factors, including diet. In addition, the role of the gut microbiome must not be underestimated, as it is substantially altered in patients with Crohn's disease. Although an elemental diet might lead to disease remission, reintroducing real foods and sustainable diets in patients with Crohn's disease is currently difficult, and would benefit from the sensitivity and rapid feedback provided by the field of nutrigenomics. Nutrigenomics utilizes high-throughput genomics technologies to reveal changes in gene and protein expression that are modulated by the patient's nutrition. The most widely used technique thus far is transcriptomics, which permits measurement of changes in the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously in one sample. Given the volume of numbers generated in such studies, data-basing and bioinformatics are essential to ensure the correct application of nutrigenomics at the population level. These methods have been successfully applied to animal models of Crohn's disease, and the time is right to move them to human studies.},

It is here where a single layer of epithelial cells mediates the intricate encounters that occur between the host's immune system and a multitude of potential threats present in the intestinal lumen. Several key factors play an important role in the final outcome of this interaction, including the state of oxidative stress, the level of activation of the immune cells, and the integrity of the epithelial barrier. This chapter describes the main evidence demonstrating the impact that l-carnitine has on each of these factors. These findings, combined with the demonstrated safety profile of l-carnitine, underscore the potential therapeutic value of l-carnitine supplementation in humans suffering from intestinal inflammation and highlight the functional data supporting an association between Crohn's disease and mutations in the l-carnitine transporter genes.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions, which are increasing in incidence, prevalence, and severity, in many countries. While there is genetic susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways. Distinguishing cause from effect, and characterizing the relative roles of human and microbial genes, diet, age of onset, gender, life style, smoking history, ethnic background, environmental exposures, and medications, will require innovative and internationally integrated approaches.},

Recent weight loss remains one of the triad of clinical manifestations and a cornerstone for the diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD), although significantly fewer patients now present as being underweight. Recent evidence suggests that the introduction of medical treatment will quickly restore body weight, although this does not reflect concomitant changes in body composition. CD children present with features of nutritional cachexia with normal fat stores but depleted lean mass. Poor bone health, delayed puberty and growth failure are additional features that further complicate clinical management. Suboptimal nutritional intake is a main determinant of undernutrition, although activation of the immune system and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines exert additional independent effects. Biochemically low concentrations of plasma micronutrients are commonly reported in IBD patients, although their interpretation is difficult in the presence of an acute phase response and other indices of body stores adequacy are needed. Anaemia is a common extraintestinal manifestation of the IBD child. Iron-deficient anaemia is the predominant type, with anaemia of chronic disease second. Decreased dietary intake, as a result of decreased appetite and food aversion, is the major cause of undernutrition in paediatric IBD. Altered energy and nutrient requirements, malabsorption and increased gastrointestinal losses are additional factors, although their contribution to undernutrition in paediatric CD needs to be studied further.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy is the primary treatment for active pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) in the UK/Europe, improving disease activity and anthropometry. This study assessed changes in micronutrient status during exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). METHODS: Seventeen children (male/female: 8/9; median age: 12.7 years) with active CD were treated exclusively for 6-8 weeks on a polymeric feed (Modulen IBD; Nestle, UK). Body impedance was measured at baseline, during EEN, and posttreatment on normal diet and converted to z-scores of fat and lean mass. Blood samples for nutrient analysis were collected from 13 children at baseline, end of EEN, and posttreatment. RESULTS: Lean but not fat mass improved at the end of EEN (initiation vs. end of EEN; fat mass [z-score]: -0.5 vs. -0.3; P = 0.141; lean mass [z-score]: -2.1 vs. -0.8; P < 0.0001). At baseline several children presented with suboptimal concentrations of carotenoids, trace elements, vitamin C, B6, and folate in plasma but not in erythrocytes. EEN improved concentrations for several nutrients, but more than 90% of patients had depleted concentrations of all carotenoids. The latter improved on normal diet but other micronutrients, which improved during EEN, returned toward pretreatment concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Lean but not fat mass improved at the end of EEN. Median concentrations for several plasma micronutrients improved on EEN but carotenoids were depleted. These findings may have implications for clinical practice and producers of enteral feeds. As plasma concentrations for many micronutrients can be affected by the acute phase response, measurements in erythrocytes may be a better marker of actual body stores.},

   abstract = {Paratuberculosis (PTB), or Johne's disease, is a chronic infectious granulomatous enteritis of ruminants, caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Map). It is characterized by diarrhea and progressive cachexia, which may cause the death of the animal. Calves are the most susceptible to infection. Infected animals excrete Map mainly by the feces. PTB is endemic worldwide, with high prevalence levels, strong economic impact and public health relevance because of its possible association with Crohn's disease. Although the current reference diagnostic test is identification of Map in the bacterial culture, there are different diagnostic tests to identify infected individuals and/or herds. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests vary according to the stage of the disease in the animals to be evaluated. The correct choice and application of each of these diagnostic tests will ensure their success and may allow to establish a control program. The aim of this work is to review and discuss the different diagnostic tests used in the detection of Map-infected animals, focusing on their advantages and disadvantages.},

Map also may be involved in Crohn's disease and type 1 diabetes in humans. Although the role of Map in human diseases has not been established, minimizing the exposure of humans to the organism is considered desirable as a precautionary measure. Infected animals can shed Map in feces and milk, and the organism can become disseminated in tissues remote from the gut and its associated lymph nodes. The presence of at least some Map in raw milk and meat and in natural waters is likely, but the numbers of Map in those foods and waters should be reduced through cooking or purification. The available information relating to Map in milk and dairy products, meats, and drinking water is reviewed here for assessment of the risks of exposure to Map from consumption of such foods and water.},

   abstract = {Mastic (Pistacia lentiscus) of the Anacardiaceae family has exhibited anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in patients with Crohn's disease. This study was based on the hypothesis that mastic inhibits intestinal damage in inflammatory bowel disease, regulating inflammation and oxidative stress in intestinal epithelium. Four different dosages of P. lentiscus powder in the form of powder were administered orally to trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitic rats. Eighty-four male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to seven groups: A, control; B, colitic; C-F, colitic rats daily supplemented with P. lentiscus powder at (C) 50 mg/kg, (D) 100 mg/kg, (E) 200 mg/kg, and (F) 300 mg/kg of body weight; and G, colitic rats treated daily with cortisone (25 mug/kg of body weight). Colonic damage was assessed microscopically. The cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10 and malonaldehyde were measured in colonic specimens. Results were expressed as mean +/- SE values. Histological amelioration of colitis (P</=.001) and significant differences in colonic indices occurred after 3 days of treatment. Daily administration of 100 mg of P. lentiscus powder/kg of body weight decreased all inflammatory cytokines (P</=.05), whereas 50 mg of P. lentiscus powder/kg of body weight and cortisone treatment reduced only ICAM-1 (P</=.05 and P</=.01, respectively). Malonaldehyde was significantly suppressed in all treated groups (P</=.01). IL-10 remained unchanged. Cytokines and malonaldehyde remained unaltered after 6 days of treatment. Thus P. lentiscus powder could possibly have a therapeutic role in Crohn's disease, regulating oxidant/antioxidant balance and modulating inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are more likely to have Crohn's disease (CD) than ulcerative colitis (UC) and their disease tends to be more extensive and severe than in adults. We hypothesized that the prevalence of anemia would therefore be greater in children and adolescents than in adults attending IBD outpatient clinics. METHODS: Using the WHO age-adjusted definitions of anemia we assessed the prevalence, severity, type, and response to treatment of anemia in patients attending pediatric, adolescent, and adult IBD clinics at our hospital. RESULTS: The prevalence of anemia was 70% (41/59) in children, 42% (24/54) in adolescents, and 40% (49/124) in adults (P < 0.01). Overall, children (88% [36/41]) and adolescents (83% [20/24]) were more often iron-deficient than adults (55% [27/49]) (P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression showed that both active disease (odds ratio [OR], 4.7 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5, 8.8) and attending the pediatric clinic (OR 3.7; 95% CI, 1.6, 8.4) but not the adolescent clinic predicted iron deficiency anemia. Fewer iron-deficient children (13% [5/36]) than adolescents (30% [6/20]) or adults (48% [13/27]) had been given oral iron (P < 0.05); none had received intravenous iron compared with 30% (6/20) adolescents and 41% (11/27) adults (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is even more common in children than in older IBD patients. Oral iron was given to half of adolescents and adults but, despite similar tolerance and efficacy, only a quarter of children with iron-deficient anemia. Reasons for the apparent underutilization of iron therapy include a perceived lack of benefit and concerns about side effects, including worsening of IBD activity.},

   abstract = {AIM: The general use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) as therapy for children with Crohn's disease (CD) in Sweden has not previously been studied. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate how EEN is used as therapy in Sweden for children with CD. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all 37 paediatric units in Sweden that treat children with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: The response rate was 78%, which covers nearly 90% of Sweden's paediatric population between 0 and 17 years of age. Ninety-six per cent of the units used EEN as a treatment option for children with CD, and 65% of the units used EEN as their primary therapy in newly diagnosed CD. The standard duration of EEN was 6 weeks, but the questionnaire revealed a span of 4-8 weeks. The use of polymeric formula was just as common as a combination of polymeric and elemental formulas. Fifty-seven per cent used oral nutrition supplements, and 81% allowed some extent of concomitant feeding, the addition of food and fluids, during EEN. All units used enteral nutrition to some extent as maintenance therapy after EEN was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: In Sweden, EEN is used as therapy for children with Crohn's disease (CD), but the EEN protocols vary as to choice of formula and type of food and fluids allowed during EEN. Standardized EEN protocols would enable multicentre studies in Sweden, with the objective of investigating how EEN treatment can be improved and employed in the most efficient way.},

METHODS: Newly diagnosed CD children were randomized to EF or PF for 6 weeks. Change in the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), fecal calprotectin, and plasma fatty acids were measured at 0 and 6 weeks. Patients were followed up for 2 years. Time and treatment choice for first relapse were documented. RESULTS: Thirty-four children completed the study; EF: 15 (7 M, 8 F), PF: 19 (13 M, 6 F). The mean age was (years) EF: 12.6, PF: 11.7. Ninety-three percent of children (14/15) achieved remission in the EF group and 79% (15/19) in the PF group. One-third of patients maintained remission for 2 years. Mean time to relapse (days); EF: 183 (63-286), PF: 162 (53-301). Most children who relapsed used feed as a treatment for that relapse (EF: 9/10 and PF: 8/13). With PF, an increase of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and alpha linolenic acid was found with a reciprocal decrease in arachidonic acid (AA). With EF, AA and EPA levels were reduced with a significant decrease in docosahexaenoic acid. Fecal calprotectin measurements decreased significantly but did not normalize at the end of week 6. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference between EF and PF in inducing remission. One-third of children maintained remission. Changes in plasma polyunsaturated fatty acid status were subtle and may be relevant; however, further evaluation is recommended.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are chronically relapsing, immune-mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. A major challenge in the treatment of IBD is the heterogenous nature of these pathologies. Both, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are of multifactorial etiology and feature a complex interaction of host genetic susceptibility and environmental factors such as diet and gut microbiota. Genome-wide association studies identified disease-relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms in approximately 100 genes, but at the same time twin studies also clearly indicated a strong environmental impact in disease development. However, attempts to link dietary factors to the risk of developing IBD, based on epidemiological observations showed controversial outcomes. Yet, emerging high-throughput technologies implying complete biological systems might allow taking nutrient-gene interactions into account for a better classification of patient subsets in the future. In this context, 2 new scientific fields, "nutrigenetics" and "nutrigenomics" have been established. "Nutrigenetics," studying the effect of genetic variations on nutrient-gene interactions and "Nutrigenomics," describing the impact of nutrition on physiology and health status on the level of gene transcription, protein expression, and metabolism. It is hoped that the integration of both research areas will promote the understanding of the complex gene-environment interaction in IBD etiology and in the long-term will lead to personalized nutrition for disease prevention and treatment. This review briefly summarizes data on the impact of nutrients on intestinal inflammation, highlights nutrient-gene interactions, and addresses the potential of applying "omic" technologies in the context of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: enteral (EN) and parenteral (TPN) nutrition exert variable therapeutic effects on the induction and maintenance of remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This review aims to provide an updated discussion on the complex relationship between diet and IBD. METHODS: medline, Cochrane and Scopus database searches were conducted. Sources cited in the articles obtained were also searched to identify other potential sources of information. RESULTS: nutritional status is significantly compromised in IBD patients, especially those with Crohn's disease (CD). Apart from restoring malnourishment, dietary components contribute to modulate intestinal immune responses. Nutritional treatment is divided into support therapy and primary therapy to induce and maintain remission through TPN and EN. EN is considered a first-line therapy in children with active CD whereas it is usually used in adult CD patients when corticosteroid therapy is not possible. TPN has limited effects on IBD.En formula composition, in terms of carbohydrates, nitrogen source and bioactive molecules supplementation, differentially influence on IBD treatment outcomes. Other dietary components, such as poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrate, polyols, and exogenous microparticles, also participate in the etiopathogenesis of IBD. Finally, new approaches to understanding the complex relationship between IBD and diet are provided by nutrigenenomic. CONCLUSION: further long-term, well-powered studies are required to accurately assess the usefulness of nutrition in treating IBD. In future research, the potential role of nutrient-gene interaction in drug trials and specific dietary formula compositions should be investigated in order to incorporate new knowledge about the etiopathology of IBD into nutritional intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to determine therapeutic efficacy of the biological agents for the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, the external validity of findings from RCTs might be compromised by their stringent selection criteria. We investigated the proportion of patients encountered during routine clinical practice who would qualify for enrollment into a pivotal RCT of biological agents for IBD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with moderate-severe IBD who presented to a tertiary referral center. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were extracted from published RCTs of biologics approved by the Food and Drug Administration and applied to the study population. RESULTS: Only 31.1% of 206 patients with IBD (34% with Crohn's disease [CD], 26% with ulcerative colitis) would have been eligible to participate in any of the selected RCTs. Patients would have been excluded because they had stricturing or penetrating CD, took high doses of steroids, had comorbidities or prior exposure to biologics, or received topical therapies. Of the trial-ineligible patients with ulcerative colitis, 23.3% had colectomies, and 31.7% received infliximab, with a 63.2% response rate. Approximately half (49.4%) of the 82 trial-ineligible patients with CD received biological therapies, with lower response rates (60%) than trial-eligible patients (89%; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with moderate-severe IBD evaluated in an outpatient practice would not qualify for enrollment in a pivotal RCT of biological reagents; this finding raises important questions about their therapeutic efficacy beyond the clinical trial populations. Additional evaluation of the transparency of RCT design and selection criteria is needed to determine whether trial results can be generalized to the population.},

Due to ongoing bowel and arthritic complaints, she was started on infliximab infusions and within 2 treatments, she had complete resolution of the angioedema and urticaria, as well as of the bowel and arthritic symptoms. Unfortunately she developed allergic reactions to the infliximab and was switched to another anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha agent, adalimumab. Since then, she has had no further angioedema or urticaria, and her Crohn's disease has been quiescent.

   abstract = {With the use of molecular techniques, numerous studies have evaluated the composition of the intestinal microbiota in health and disease. However, it is of major interest to supplement this with a functional analysis of the microbiota. In this review, the different approaches that have been used to characterize microbial metabolites, yielding information on the functional end products of microbial metabolism, have been summarized. To analyze colonic microbial metabolites, the most conventional way is by application of a hypothesis-driven targeted approach, through quantification of selected metabolites from carbohydrate (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) and protein fermentation (e.g., p-cresol, phenol, ammonia, or H(2)S), secondary bile acids, or colonic enzymes. The application of stable isotope-labeled substrates can provide an elegant solution to study these metabolic pathways in vivo. On the other hand, a top-down approach can be followed by applying metabolite fingerprinting techniques based on (1)H-NMR or mass spectrometric analysis. Quantification of known metabolites and characterization of metabolite patterns in urine, breath, plasma, and fecal samples can reveal new pathways and give insight into physiological regulatory processes of the colonic microbiota. In addition, specific metabolic profiles can function as a diagnostic tool for the identification of several gastrointestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, future research will have to evaluate the relevance of associations between metabolites and different disease states.},

   abstract = {Bacteria play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), its complications and its symptoms. Antibiotics can decrease tissue invasion and eliminate aggressive bacterial species. They are used in IBD to treat infective complications and for altering bacterial flora, which may result in specific anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, suppression of bacterial metabolic activities or direct effects of antibiotics on intestinal structures and functions may result in symptoms which cannot be differentiated from symptoms caused by inflammation. Although current clinical trials do not fulfill criteria of evidence-based treatment, a few placebo- or standard treatment-controlled studies suggest that metronidazole and ciprofloxacin are effective in Crohn's colitis and ileocolitis, perianal fistulae and pouchitis. Administration of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics can restore a predominance of beneficial species. However, beneficial effects of probiotics in IBD are modest, strain-specific and limited to certain manifestations of disease and duration of use of the probiotic. For probiotics there is reasonable evidence of efficacy in relapse prevention in chronic pouchitis and ulcerative colitis, and suggestive evidence for postoperative prevention in pouchitis. Therapeutic manipulation of the intestinal flora offers considerable promise for treating IBD, but must be supported by large controlled therapeutic trials before widespread clinical acceptance. These agents may become a component of treating IBD in combination with traditional anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. Probiotic strategies, based on metagenomic or metabonomic analyses, and new classes of probiotics might play an important role in the future management of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: 6-Mercaptopurine is often used as maintenance therapy in patients with Crohn's disease. However, toxicities like myelosuppression limit its clinical benefit. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of elemental diet versus 6-mercaptopurine as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. METHODS: Ninety-five eligible patients with Crohn's disease activity index </=150 were randomly assigned to: 6-mercaptopurine (0.5-1.5mg/kg/day, n=30); Elental as an elemental diet (>/=900 kcal/day, n=32); none (control, n=33). In the three groups, patients were and remained on 5-aminosalicylic acid (2250-3000 mg/day). Patients were observed for 2 years and the rate of relapse (Crohn's disease activity index >/=200) was monitored. RESULTS: At 24 months, the fractions of patients who had maintained remission were 60%, 46.9% and 27.2% for 6-mercaptopurine, Elental and the control groups, respectively. Log-rank test showed better efficacy for 6-mercaptopurine (P=0.0041) and Elental (P=0.0348) versus control. No significant difference was found between 6-mercaptopurine and Elental. Further, in the 6-mercaptopurine group, 2 patients experienced liver injury and one developed alopecia. CONCLUSIONS: This 24 months comparison study showed that Elental as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease patients was as effective as 6-mercaptopurine. Elental should be useful for long-term maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. This is the first comparison study evaluating nutritional therapy versus 6-mercaptopurine.},

   abstract = {Ganoderma lucidum Karst is well known as 'Reishi', a traditional food in China and Japan. It contains a polysaccharide component known to induce granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production from murine splenocytes. Moreover, GM-CSF may be a therapeutic agent for Crohn's disease. In this study, we investigated the water-soluble, polysaccharide components of Reishi (designated as MAK) in murine colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS). We examined the concentration of GM-CSF in peritoneal macrophage cells (PMs) of C57BL/6 mice during in vitro and in vivo stimulation with MAK. After feeding with chow or MAK for 2 weeks, 2 mg of TNBS/50% ethanol was administered to each mouse. After 3 days of TNBS treatment, intestinal inflammation was evaluated, and mononuclear cells of the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and colon were cultured for ELISA. To determine the preventive role of GM-CSF, the mice were pre-treated with or without anti-GM-CSF antibody before TNBS administration. In vitro and in vivo MAK-stimulated PMs produced GM-CSF in a dose-dependent manner. Intestinal inflammation by TNBS was improved by feeding with MAK. MLNs of mice treated with TNBS produced IFN-gamma, which was inhibited by feeding with MAK. In contrast, MLNs of mice treated with TNBS inhibited GM-CSF production, which was induced by feeding with MAK. The colon organ culture assay also revealed that IFN-gamma was decreased and GM-CSF was increased by MAK. The preventive effect was blocked by the neutralization of GM-CSF. We concluded that the induction of GM-CSF by MAK may provide the anti-inflammatory effect.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes Johne's disease in ruminants and may contribute to Crohn's disease in humans. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and quantity of MAP in cattle feces and milk in the Iranian context. In addition, we evaluated the effect of cattle age as well as farming system as risk factors contributing to MAP load. For this, a total sample of 373 consisting of 150 cattle feces (CF), 150 individual cow's milk (ICM), as well as 73 bulk-tank milk (BTM) was collected randomly and regardless of the cattle health status. The samples were assayed using F57 quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and culture method. According to the results of qPCR which was found approximately 10 times more sensitive than culture assay, MAP was detected in 68.66% (103/150) of the CF, 12% (18/150) of the ICM and 52.05% (38/73) of the BTM samples. In contrast to the previous reports, the quantity of MAP in the BTM (2.03-5.97 log cfu/50 ml) was statistically (p<0.01) higher than the ICM (0.90-1.97 log cfu/50 ml). Data suggested a direct relation (p<0.01) between the cattle age and the quantity of MAP in the CF samples, while the relation was not statistically significant (p>0.05) for the ICM. In addition, MAP load in the BTM samples obtained from traditional farms was significantly (p<0.01) higher than that of the industrial ones, while the differences in CF and ICM was not significant (p>0.05).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of environmental factors in development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains uncertain. The aim of the present study was to assess a number of formerly suggested environmental factors in a case-control study of an unselected and recently diagnosed group of patients with IBD and a control group of orthopaedic patients. METHODS: A total of 123 patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) and 144 with ulcerative colitis (UC) in Copenhagen (2003-2004) were matched 1:1 on age and gender to 267 orthopaedic controls. Participants received a questionnaire with 87 questions concerning environmental factors prior to IBD/orthopaedic admission. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by logistic regression. RESULTS: Being breastfed >6 months (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.23-1.11) and undergoing tonsillectomy (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31-0.78) decreased the odds for IBD, whereas appendectomy decreased the odds for UC only (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12-0.71). Vaccination against pertussis (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.07-4.03) and polio (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.04-5.43) increased the odds for IBD, whereas measles infection increased the odds for UC (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.15-10.6). Low consumption of fibres and high consumption of sugar were significantly associated with development of CD and UC. Smoking increased the risk for CD and protected against UC. CONCLUSION: Among Danish patients with CD and UC belonging to an unselected cohort, disease occurrence was found to be associated both with well-known factors such as smoking and appendectomy, and with more debated factors including breastfeeding, tonsillectomy, childhood vaccinations, childhood infections, and dietary intake of fibres and sugar.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In normal mucosa, intestinal lamina propria macrophages (IMACs) maintain tolerance against food antigens and the commensal bacterial flora. Several mechanisms have been identified that mediate tolerance. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a large multiprotein complex that degrades cellular proteins. As the UPS may modulate immune functions of IMACs, we performed a detailed investigation of UPS expression and function under normal conditions and in cells derived from patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: IMACs were isolated from intestinal mucosa. mRNA expression of macrophages differentiated in vitro (i.v. MACs) and IMACs was compared by Affymetrix(R) oligonucleotide arrays. Quantitative Taqman-PCR was performed on five exemplary proteasomal and five ubiquitinylation genes each. Proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Proteasome function was assessed by a fluorimetric test. RESULTS: Affymetrix analysis showed downregulation of mRNA expression of almost all represented proteasomal and of 22 ubiquitination-associated genes in IMACs as compared to i.v. MACs and monocytes. By quantitative PCR, up to tenfold higher mRNA expression of 10 exemplary genes of the UPS (UBE2A, UBE2D2, UBE2L6, USP14, UBB and ATPase2, beta2, beta5, beta2i/MECL-1, beta5i/LMP7) was demonstrated in i.v. MACs as compared to IMACs. Immunohistochemistry and Western blots confirmed these findings in intestinal mucosa of controls and patients suffering from diverticulitis. In contrast, a significant increase in protein amounts was found in mucosa of patients with IBD. CONCLUSION: Reduced expression of subunits of the UPS in IMACs of normal mucosa supports the concept of the presence of a nonreactive, anergic macrophage phenotype in the gut under normal conditions. Reinduction in IMACs of IBD mucosa reflects activated IMACs which can present antigenic peptides and thus support inflammation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing. Dietary factors such as the spread of the "Western" diet, high in fat and protein but low in fruits and vegetables, may be associated with the increase. Although many studies have evaluated the association between diet and IBD risk, there has been no systematic review. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using guideline-recommended methodology to evaluate the association between pre-illness intake of nutrients (fats, carbohydrates, protein) and food groups (fruits, vegetables, meats) and the risk of subsequent IBD diagnosis. Eligible studies were identified via structured keyword searches in PubMed and Google Scholar and manual searches. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included, encompassing 2,609 IBD patients (1,269 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,340 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients) and over 4,000 controls. Studies reported a positive association between high intake of saturated fats, monounsaturated fatty acids, total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), total omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, mono- and disaccharides, and meat and increased subsequent CD risk. Studies reported a negative association between dietary fiber and fruits and subsequent CD risk. High intakes of total fats, total PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of UC. High vegetable intake was associated with a decreased risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: High dietary intakes of total fats, PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of CD and UC. High fiber and fruit intakes were associated with decreased CD risk, and high vegetable intake was associated with decreased UC risk.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis is the causative agent of Johne's disease (JD) in cattle and may be associated with Crohn's disease (CD) in humans. It is the slowest growing of the cultivable mycobacteria, and culture from clinical, veterinary, food, or environmental specimens can take 4 months or even longer. Currently, the insertion element IS900 is used to detect M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis DNA. However, closely related IS900 elements are also present in other mycobacteria, thus limiting its specificity as a target. Here we describe the use of novel primer sets derived from the sequences of two highly specific single copy genes, MAP2765c and MAP0865, for the quantitative detection of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis within 6 h by using real-time PCR. Specificity of the target was established using 40 M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis isolates, 67 different bacterial species, and two intestinal parasites. Using the probes and methods described, we detected 27 (2.09%) M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-positive stool specimens from 1,293 individual stool samples by the use of either IS900 or probes deriving from the MAP2765c and MAP0865 genes described here. In general, bacterial load due to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was uniformly low in these samples and we estimated 500 to 5,000 M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis bacteria per gram of stool in assay-positive samples. Thus, the methods described here are useful for rapid and specific detection of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in clinical samples.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis represent distinct phenotypic forms of inflammatory bowel disease and continue to be a common cause of morbidity. The corticosteroids and the immunomodulatory drugs, which are the basis of treatment for the inflammatory bowel diseases, do not assure always satisfactory outcomes. Nutrition has been used in order to modify the inflammatory response of various chronic inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestinal microflora and the intestinal mucosal disorders play a crucial role. Also, the release of reactive oxygen species is a significant factor of initiation and preservation of the inflammatory reaction in these diseases. The advantages of the nutritional treatment derive from the sequestration of intraluminal agents which may promote the inflammatory bowel response or, alternatively, nutrition is able to modify the immune response, reducing the uncontrolled inflammatory reaction. Furthermore, nutrition can enhance the mucosal barrier function and consists a significant source of antioxidants. This review focuses on certain nutritional components that modulate the inflammatory response of the bowel and aims to present a rational thesis regarding the use of nutritional agents in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009. Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions, infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1 (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4))); high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)). Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5 (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)). CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD. Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), such as Crohn's disease (CD), involve a poorly understood and complex immune response to both the biota of the human gut and the gut itself. The role of the gut biota in human health has been ill defined and attitudes toward the intestinal flora have ranged from judging them largely irrelevant to declaring them a human organ system. A better way to view the intestinal flora is as a group of evolutionarily self-interested species that form large, potentially interbreeding populations that utilize human beings as a series of semi-isolated habitats, like islands in an archipelago. Here we propose that the imposition of modern sanitation and hygiene standards has drastically attenuated the connection between the "islands" inhabited by the gut flora, and that existing work drawn from evolutionary biology studies of island ecosystems, rather than medicine, predicts that the evolution of gut flora should now be pushed toward limited-dispersion forms of intestinal microorganisms - a proposition borne out by the discovery of so-called "adherent invasive Escherichia coli." This pathogenic variant of the gut bacterium E. coli clings to and invades the intestinal epithelium and has been implicated in CD. Gut flora and diseases of the gut should arguably be studied as ecology as much as medicine, and treated within this context.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Mounting evidence suggests an important role for the intestinal microbiota in the chronic mucosal inflammation that occurs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and novel molecular approaches have further identified a dysbiosis in these patients. Several mechanisms of action of probiotic products that may interfere with possible aetiological factors in IBD have been postulated. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to discuss the rationale for probiotics in IBD and to systematically review clinical intervention studies with probiotics in the management of IBD in adults. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed up to 1 October 2011, using defined keywords. Only full-text papers in the English language addressing clinical outcomes in adult patients were included. The 41 eligible studies were categorized on disease type (ulcerative colitis [UC] with/without an ileo-anal pouch and Crohn's disease [CD]) and disease activity. Pooled odds ratios were only calculated per probiotic for a specific patient group when more than one randomized controlled trial was available. RESULTS: Well designed randomized controlled trials supporting the application of probiotics in the management of IBD are still limited. Meta-analyses could only be performed for a limited number of studies revealing overall risk ratios of 2.70 (95% CI 0.47, 15.33) for inducing remission in active UC with Bifido-fermented milk versus placebo or no additive treatment (n = 2); 1.88 (95% CI 0.96, 3.67) for inducing remission in active UC with VSL#3 versus placebo (n = 2); 1.08 (95% CI 0.86, 1.37) for preventing relapses in inactive UC with Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 versus standard treatment (n = 3); 0.17 (95% CI 0.09, 0.33) for preventing relapses in inactive UC/ileo-anal pouch anastomosis (IPAA) patients with VSL#3 versus placebo; 1.21 (95% CI 0.57, 2.57) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive CD with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG versus placebo (n = 2); and 0.93 (95% CI 0.63, 1.38) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive CD with Lactobacillus johnsonii versus placebo (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Further well designed studies based on intention-to-treat analyses by several independent research groups are still warranted to support the promising results for E. coli Nissle in inactive UC and the multispecies product VSL#3 in active UC and inactive pouch patients. So far, no evidence is available to support the use of probiotics in CD. Future studies should focus on specific disease subtypes and disease location. Further insight into the aetiology of IBD and the mechanisms of probiotic strains will aid in selecting probiotic strains for specific disease entities and disease locations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) decreases intestinal inflammation and cytokine levels in an animal model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Luminal omega-3 (OM-3) is anti-angiogenic, reduces inflammation, and may decrease symptoms in patients with Crohn's disease. This study evaluates the synergism of HGF and OM-3. METHODS: Twenty adult female transgenic HLA-B27 rats were divided into 4 groups: group 1: regular feeds, IV saline; group 2: OM-3-enriched feeds, IV saline; group 3: regular feeds, IV HGF (150 microg/kg per day); and group 4: OM-3-enriched feeds, IV HGF(150 microg/kg per day). Rats were killed at 14 days after pump placement. Small and large bowel mucosa was harvested, and DNA and protein were extracted and quantified. Statistical analysis was done by analysis of variance with post-hoc Tukey's HSD test. RESULTS: Content of protein and DNA in the ileum were significantly increased by supplementation of HGF (P < .001, P < .01, respectively) alone. OM-3 significantly increased protein content but not DNA (P = .02, P = 0.3, respectively). Combined, they had a synergistic effect greater than either supplement alone (P = .0001, P = .002, respectively). In the colon, HGF and OM-3 did not significantly increase protein or DNA content individually or together. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of the synergistic effect of a growth factor (HGF) and a dietary supplement (OM-3) in an immunologic model of IBD.},

The aim of this study was to determine if serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] was associated with inflammatory cytokines, IL-10, and TNF-alpha levels in patients with inactive CD. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 75 adults with quiescent CD. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by radioimmunoassay and serum IL-10 and TNF-alpha by ELISA. Disease activity was assessed by the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: IL-10 levels were significantly lower in patients with vitamin D insufficiency compared with the vitamin D replete group (mean and SE 2.48 +/- 0.51 v 6.77 +/- 2.49 pg/mL, p < 0.001). There were, however, no differences in serum TNF-alpha or CRP levels based on vitamin D status. The use of a vitamin D supplement at a low dose (200 IU) did not significantly influence IL-10 levels. CONCLUSION: Circulating levels of IL-10, but not TNF-alpha, were significantly lower in CD patients with inadequate serum 25(OH)D. This suggests that poor vitamin D status may be linked to reduced anti-inflammatory capacity in this group.},

   abstract = {Nutritional factors, as sources of luminal antigens, have been thought to be important factors in the immunopathogenesis of numerous gastrointestinal diseases. In some diseases, the role of the nutritional component is causal in the susceptible host. Such diseases include celiac disease, a common heritable chronic inflammatory condition of the small intestine induced by dietary wheat, rye and barley, in susceptible individuals. Specific HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 risk alleles are necessary, but not sufficient, for disease development. The well-defined role of HLA-DQ heterodimers encoded by these alleles is to present cereal peptides to CD4+ T cells, activating an inflammatory immune response in the intestine. Genome-wide association studies have been performed which identified the IL2-IL21 risk locus and other genes with immune functions and key roles in thymic T-cell selection. Another example for this group is Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutation of the ATP7B gene, resulting in a defect of biliary copper excretion and toxic accumulation in the body, especially in the liver, brain and cornea, resulting in hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. In other diseases, however, the association is less well established. In such endeavor, epidemiological observations may become a valuable part of the overall investigations aimed at identifying dietary factors, which are involved in the initiation and perpetuation of the specific disease. As an example, relationships between nutrition and colorectal cancer have been hypothesized early on (e.g. folate, calcium, vitamin D, red meat). Similarly, intake of certain diet constituents like fat, refined sugar, fruits, vegetables and fiber was reported to be associated with the expression of inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, in children with active Crohn's disease, enteral nutrition was found to be equally effective as corticosteroids in induction of remission, with mucosal healing induced by downregulation of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in both the ileum and the colon after enteral nutrition. However, the particular effect of the consumption of each type of food remains questionable in most cases, at least in part because of insufficient data and serious methodological limitations (e.g. recall bias, heterogeneity between collected data, lack of correction for covariates, difficulties in double blinding).},

Decreasing their levels using antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) could therefore be useful in the prevention of certain diseases. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are ideal candidates to deliver these enzymes in the gut. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of CAT or SOD producing LAB were evaluated using a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) induced Crohn's disease murine model. Engineered Lactobacillus casei BL23 strains producing either CAT or SOD, or the native strain were given to mice before and after intrarectal administration of TNBS. Animal survival, live weight, intestinal morphology and histology, enzymatic activities, microbial translocation to the liver and cytokines released in the intestinal fluid were evaluated. The mice that received CAT or SOD-producing LAB showed a faster recovery of initial weight loss, increased enzymatic activities in the gut and lesser extent of intestinal inflammation compared to animals that received the wild-type strain or those that did not receive bacterial supplementation. Our findings suggest that genetically engineered LAB that produce antioxidant enzymes could be used to prevent or decrease the severity of certain intestinal pathologies.},

The weight was 33.3 kg (68% of IBW) in the severe underweight and suffered from ascites and subcutaneous edema with hypoalbuminemia (1.3 g/dL) at the time of hospitalization. The patient consumed food restrictively due to abdominal discomfort. Despite various attempts of oral feeding, the levels of calorie and protein intake fell into 40-50% of the required amount, which was 800-900 kcal/d (24-27 kcal/kg/d) for calorie and 34 g/d (1 g/kg/d) for protein. It was planned to supplement the patient with caloric supplementation (40-50 kcal/kg) and protein supplementation (2.5 g/kg) to increase body weight and improve hypoproteinemia. It was also planned to increase the level of protein intake slowly to target 55 g/d in about 2 weeks starting from 10 g/d and monitored kidney load with high protein supplementation. The weight loss was 1.0 kg when the patient was discharged from the hospital (hospitalization periods of 4 weeks), however, serum albumin was improved from 1.3 g/dL to 2.5 g/dL and there was no abdominal discomfort. She kept supplement of protein at 55 g/d for 5 months after the discharge from the hospital and kept it at 35 g/d for about 2 months and then 25 g/d. The body weight increased gradually from 32.3 kg (65% of IBW) to 44.0 kg (89% of IBW) by 36% for the period of F/u and serum albumin was kept above 2.8 g/dL without intravenous injection of albumin. The performance status was improved from 4 points of 'very tired' to 2 points of 'a little tired' out of 5-point scale measurement and the use of diuretic stopped from the time of 4th month after the discharge from the hospital owing to improvement in edema and ascites. During this period, the results of blood test such as BUN, Cr, and electrolytes were within the normal range. In conclusion, hypoproteinemia and weight loss were improved by increasing protein intake through utilization of protein supplements in protein-losing enteropathy.},

The role of psychosocial distress in children with CD should not be overlooked and thus biobehavioral techniques should be considered and incorporated when possible. Considering the potential for growth failure and need for surgical intervention in CD, any CAM therapies that are not harmful should be used only in combination with conventional medical treatment. The importance of all health care providers partnering with their patients and asking about CAM use, as well as maintaining an awareness of efficacy, safety, harm, drug-supplement interactions, and appropriate referral sources, should be kept in mind when caring for those afflicted with this chronic disease.},

   abstract = {Alum (AlK(SO(4))(2)) is an adjuvant commonly utilized in vaccines, and is a ubiquitous element used extensively in contemporary life. Food, air, water, waste, the earth's surface, and pharmaceuticals all represent pathways of aluminum (Al) exposure. Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals and is caused by yet unidentified environmental factors. Al is a potential factor for the induction of inflammation in CD, and its immune activities share many characteristics with the immune pathology of CD: many luminal bacterial or dietary compounds can be adsorbed to the metal surface and induce Th1 profile cytokines, shared cytokines/chemokines, co-stimulatory molecules, and intracellular pathways and stress-related molecular expression enhancement, affecting intestinal macrobiota, trans-mural granuloma formation, and colitis induction in an animal CD model. The inflammasome plays a central role in Al mode of action and in CD pathophysiology. It is suggested that Al adjuvant activity can fit between the aberrations of innate and adaptive immune responses occurring in CD. The CD mucosa is confronted with numerous inappropriate bacterial components adsorbed on the Al compound surface, constituting a pro-inflammatory supra-adjuvant. Al fits the diagnostic criteria of the newly described autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants. If a cause and effect relationship can be established, the consequences will greatly impact public health and CD prevention and management.},

   abstract = {For treatment of moderate-to-severe active Crohn's disease, clinicians generally rely on immunosuppressants (including azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine), corticosteroids, and antibodies against tumor necrosis factor alpha. However, a significant proportion of patients do not respond to these therapies, lose response over time, or are intolerant to these therapies. In such cases, one of the only remaining pharmacologic treatment options is natalizumab, an alpha4 integrin-targeted antibody. Unfortunately, 3 cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in natalizumab-treated patients in 2005, shortly after natalizumab's approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Natalizumab was subsequently withdrawn from the market but was then reintroduced in 2006 under close supervision by the FDA. Careful review of postmarketing data revealed 3 major risk factors for the development of natalizumab-associated PML, the most significant of which is prior exposure to the JC virus (JCV). To help identify patients who may be at higher risk for developing natalizumab-associated PML, a JCV antibody assay was developed that can detect anti-JCV antibodies in patients' blood. Clinicians can now consider a patient's anti-JCV antibody status together with the other major risk factors for natalizumab-associated PML-duration of natalizumab therapy and prior immunosuppressant use-to more accurately gauge the risks and benefits of natalizumab therapy in a particular patient.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Biologic therapies have demonstrated efficacy and safety in several chronic systemic disorders. The authors indirectly compared response rates and costs per responder associated with biologic treatments for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (CD), psoriasis (Ps), and/or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify phase 3 randomized controlled trials of biologics for CD (adalimumab, infliximab), Ps (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, ustekinumab 45 mg, ustekinumab 90 mg), or methotrexate-refractory RA (abatacept, adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, rituximab, tocilizumab). Food and Drug Administration-approved dosing schedules were evaluated. Published response rates were extracted, with response defined in CD, Ps, and RA as: >/=70-point reduction in CD Activity Index at 12 months; >/=75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index at 3 months; and >/=50% improvement in American College of Rheumatology component scores at 6 months. Within each indication, mixed-treatment comparison meta-analyses were conducted to derive pooled estimates and 95% CIs of response rate difference versus placebo for each biologic, adjusting for cross-trial variation in control-arm response rates. Cost per responder was estimated for each biologic as projected per patient drug costs (2011 US$) divided by response rate difference. RESULTS: Altogether, 23 publications were selected. In CD, 12-month cost per responder was estimated at $116,291 (95% CI $71,637-208,348) for adalimumab and $125,169 (95% CI $60,532-267,101) for infliximab. Among biologics approved in Ps, 3-month cost per responder was lowest for adalimumab ($9,756; 95% CI $8,668-11,131), infliximab ($12,828; 95% CI $11,772-13,922), and ustekinumab 45 mg ($13,821; 95% CI $12,599-15,167). In RA, biologics with the lowest 6-month cost per responder were adalimumab ($27,853; 95% CI $19,284-40,270), etanercept ($29,140; 95% CI $14,170-61,030), and tocilizumab ($31,363; 95% CI $14,713-64,232). CONCLUSION: Meta-analyses of clinical trials found considerable variation in cost-effectiveness of biologic therapies for CD, Ps, and RA. These results may help determine biologic utilization in these chronic diseases.},

   abstract = {Nutritional assessment and dietary advice are fundamental to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient management and all patients should have access to a dietitian. Newly diagnosed patients often think that their pre-illness diet has contributed to the development of their IBD. However, epidemiological evidence to support diet as a risk factor is lacking. How the diet contributes to the gastrointestinal microbiota is interesting, although the role is not yet clearly defined. Nutritional problems in IBD are common. Malnutrition occurs in up to 85% of patients and weight loss affects up to 80% of patients with Crohn's disease and 18-62% of patients with ulcerative colitis. Nutritional deficiencies are prevalent, particularly in relation to anaemia and osteoporosis. Intestinal strictures can be problematic in Crohn's disease and limiting fibrous foods that may cause a mechanical obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract is helpful. Patients often explore dietary exclusion to alleviate symptoms but such changes may be self-directed or inappropriately advised and can lead to further nutritional deficiencies. Some patients experience concurrent functional symptoms (e.g. abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence and diarrhoea) that can significantly affect quality of life. Recently, a group of poorly absorbed carbohydrates that occur naturally in the diet called fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols have been associated with functional symptoms by intestinal bacterial fermentation leading to rapid gas production, and an osmotic effect increasing fluid delivery to the colon. Emerging evidence indicates that a diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols can alleviate functional symptoms in IBD.},

   abstract = {Complex and highly variable site-dependent bacterial ecosystems exist throughout the length of the human gastrointestinal tract. Until relatively recently, the majority of our information on intestinal microbiotas has come from studies on feces, or from aspirates taken from the upper gut. However, there is evidence showing that mucosal bacteria growing in biofilms on surfaces lining the gut differ from luminal populations, and that due to their proximity to the epithelial surface, these organisms may be important in modulating the host's immune system and contributing to some chronic inflammatory diseases. Over the past decade, increasing interest in mucosal bacteria, coupled with advances in molecular approaches for assessing microbial diversity, has begun to provide some insight into the complexity of these mucosa-associated communities. In gastrointestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), it has been shown that a dysbiosis exists in microbial community structure, and that there is a reduction in putatively protective mucosal organisms such as bifidobacteria. Therefore, manipulation of mucosal communities may be beneficial in restoring normal functionality in the gut, thereby improving the immune status and general health of the host. Biofilm structure and function has been studied intensively in the oral cavity, and as a consequence, mucosal communities in the mouth will not be covered in this chapter. This review addresses our current knowledge of mucosal populations in the gastrointestinal tract, changes that can occur in community structure in disease, and therapeutic modulation of biofilm composition by antibiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics.},

At present, there is little evidence for the benefit of currently used probiotic microbes in Crohn's disease or associated conditions affecting extra-intestinal organs. However, clinical practice guidelines are now including a probiotic as an option for recurrent and relapsing antibiotic sensitive pouchitis and the use of probiotics in mild ulcerative colitis is provocative and suggests potential for benefit in select patients but concerns remain about proof from trials.},

   abstract = {Dendritic cells and macrophages play an essential role in immune homeostasis in the intestine. They have the critical task of maintaining the balance between tolerance to the intestinal microflora and potential food antigens while retaining the ability to initiate immunity against pathogens. For patients with Crohn's Disease, the tolerance/immunity balance is disturbed and these individuals suffer from chronic intestinal inflammation driven by aberrant T cell reactivity to intestinal bacteria. As antigen presenting cells are required for T cell activation, intestinal phagocytes with the capacity to present antigens from intestinal bacteria to T cells are likely involved in initiating and propagating Crohn's Disease. Recent data describe unique subsets of human intestinal phagocytes that may be involved in the aberrant reactivity to commensal flora that drives Crohn's Disease pathogenesis. This review summarizes the current knowledge of phagocyte subsets in the intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes in healthy individuals and Crohn's Disease patients. Deciphering the function of intestinal phagocytes in health and disease is crucial to advance our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying this debilitating disease, provides a potential way to improve treatment for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant chronic pouchitis causes significant morbidity. Elemental diet is effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Since pouchitis shares some similarities to Crohn's disease we hypothesised that elemental diet may be an effective treatment. METHOD: Seven pouchitis patients (with ulcerative colitis) were studied. All had active pouchitis with a pouch disease activity index (PDAI) >/=7. Exclusion criteria were recent NSAIDs, antibiotics or probiotics. Sufficient elemental diet to achieve energy requirements was provided. Flexible-pouchoscopy was performed, and the Cleveland Global Quality of Life score (CGQoL), Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and BMI were recorded at baseline and following 28 days of elemental diet. Faecal samples were also collected at these time points and analysed for major bacterial groups using culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Data were analysed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Following 28 days of exclusive elemental diet, median stool frequency decreased from 12 to 6 per day (p=0.028), median clinical PDAI decreased from 4 to 1 (p=0.039). There was no significant difference in quality of life scores or PDAI before and following treatment. There was a trend towards an increase in the concentration of Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale (median 7.9 to 8.5 log(1)(0)/g, p=0.08) following exclusive elemental diet. CONCLUSION: Treatment with four weeks elemental diet appeared to improve the symptoms of chronic pouchitis in some patients but is not an effective strategy for inducing remission. Although a potential symptom modifier, elemental diet cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of active pouchitis.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis after ileal pouch anal anastomosis in ulcerative colitis patients are often refractory to standard therapy. Over the last decade, the rational to use probiotics and its beneficial efficacy in the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasingly under scrutiny. Although it has become clear that intestinal epithelial-mucosal immune interactions and enteric bacteria play a critical role in the development of IBD, the substantial clinical efficacy of probiotics in these disorders is less evident. This review outlines the clinical studies regarding probiotics before October 2007. These studies formed the foundation of probiotic clinical trials in IBD, but they also indicated the need of larger and better-controlled studies than the past experimental approaches. Furthermore, this review also examines in-depth the probiotic clinical trials published between 2007 and December 2010, providing new insights into the role of probiotics for inducing and maintaining remission of IBD, and highlighting some of the breakthroughs, especially regarding induction of remission for ulcerative colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adipocytes from mesenteric white adipose tissue amplify the inflammatory response and participate in inflammation-driven immune dysfunction in Crohn's disease by releasing proinflammatory mediators. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-alpha and -gamma, pregnane x receptor (PXR), farnesoid x receptor (FXR) and liver x-receptor (LXR) are ligand-activated nuclear receptor that provide counter-regulatory signals to dysregulated immunity and modulates adipose tissue. AIMS: To investigate the expression and function of nuclear receptors in intestinal and adipose tissues in a rodent model of colitis and mesenteric fat from Crohn's patients and to investigate their modulation by probiotics. METHODS: Colitis was induced by TNBS administration. Mice were administered vehicle or VSL#3, daily for 10 days. Abdominal fat explants obtained at surgery from five Crohn's disease patients and five patients with colon cancer were cultured with VSL#3 medium. RESULTS: Probiotic administration attenuated development of signs and symptoms of colitis, reduced colonic expression of TNFalpha, IL-6 and IFNgamma and reserved colonic downregulation of PPARgamma, PXR and FXR caused by TNBS. Mesenteric fat depots isolated from TNBS-treated animals had increased expression of inflammatory mediators along with PPARgamma, FXR, leptin and adiponectin. These changes were prevented by VSL#3. Creeping fat and mesenteric adipose tissue from Crohn's patients showed a differential expression of PPARgamma and FXR with both tissue expressing high levels of leptin. Exposure of these tissues to VSL#3 medium abrogates leptin release. CONCLUSIONS: Mesenteric adipose tissue from rodent colitis and Crohn's disease is metabolically active and shows inflammation-driven regulation of PPARgamma, FXR and leptin. Probiotics correct the inflammation-driven metabolic dysfunction.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have access to a growing number of probiotic products marketed to improve digestive health. It is unclear how patients make decisions about probiotics and what role they expect their gastroenterologists to play as they consider using probiotics. Understanding patients' knowledge, attitudes and expectations of probiotics may help gastroenterologists engage patients in collaborative discussions about probiotics. STUDY: Focus groups were conducted with patients with IBD and IBS at the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and Johns Hopkins University. Inductive analytic methods were used to identify common themes and draw interpretations from focus group narratives. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six patients participated in 22 focus groups between March and August 2009. Patients viewed probiotics as an appealing alternative to pharmaceutical drugs and understood probiotics as a more "natural," low-risk therapeutic option. Many patients were hesitant to use them without consulting their gastroenterologists. Patients would weigh the risks and benefits of probiotics, their disease severity and satisfaction with current treatments when considering probiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: Patients are interested in probiotics but have many unanswered questions about their use. Our findings suggest that patients with IBD and IBS will look to gastroenterologists and other clinicians as trustworthy advisors regarding the utility of probiotics as an alternative or supplement to pharmaceutical drugs. Gastroenterologists and other clinicians who care for patients with these diseases should be prepared to discuss the potential benefits and risks of probiotics and assist patients in making informed decisions about their use.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a chronic condition of the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous inflammation that occurs in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form fistulae. The cause is unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of medical treatments to induce remission in adults with Crohn's disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce and maintain remission in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce remission in adults with colonic Crohn's disease? What are the effects of medical interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease; and to maintain remission following surgery? What are the effects of lifestyle interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 93 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aminosalicylates, antibiotics, azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral), enteral nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection, segmental colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.},

   abstract = {Transport of molecules across the intestinal epithelium takes place through 2 major routes, ie, trans-cellular and paracellular. Assessment of intestinal permeability is performed to assess the overall function of transport through the intestinal epithelial paracellular route. Urinary excretion of disaccharides and monosaccharides and ratio of their excretion is a basis for measurement of intestinal permeability. Lactulose and mannitol ratio is the most commonly used test for assessment of small intestinal permeability and the most reliable method for measurement of concentration of lactulose and mannitol in the urine is high performance liquid chromatography. After the measurement of concentration of probes in the urine; the results are expressed as the ratio of percentage excretion of the ingested dose of lactulose and mannitol in the urine. Testing of intestinal permeability is not required for routine patient care, however it is an important tool to understand the function of the paracellular transport in the research setting. Increase in intestinal permeability has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases including celiac disease, Crohn's disease, type I diabetes and food allergy.},

The histological examination reveals mainly two subtypes of MC, lymphocytic or collagenous colitis. Despite the fact that the incidence in MC has been rising over the last decades, research has been sparse and our knowledge about MC remains limited. Specialists in the field have initiated the European Microscopic Colitis Group (EMCG) with the primary goal to create awareness on MC. The EMCG is furthermore a forum with the intention to promote clinical and basic research. In this article statements and comments are given that all members of the EMCG have considered being of importance for a better understanding of MC. The paper focuses on the newest updates in epidemiology, symptoms and diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology and highlights some unsolved problems. Moreover, a new treatment algorithm is proposed on the basis of new evidence from well-designed, randomized control trials.},

   abstract = {Paratuberculosis is an infectious, chronic, and incurable disease that affects ruminants, caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. This bacterium is shed primarily through feces of infected cows but can be also excreted in colostrum and milk and might survive pasteurization. Since an association of genomic sequences of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in patients with Crohn's disease has been described; it is of interest to rapidly detect M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in milk for human consumption. IS900 insertion is used as a target for PCR amplification to identify the presence of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in biological samples. Two target sequences were selected: IS1 (155 bp) and IS2 (94 bp). These fragments have a 100% identity among all M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains sequenced. M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was specifically concentrated from milk samples by immunomagnetic separation prior to performing PCR. The amplicons were characterized using DNA methylase Genotyping, i.e., the amplicons were methylated with 6-methyl-adenine and digested with restriction enzymes to confirm their identity. The methylated amplicons from 100 CFU of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis can be visualized in a Western blot format using an anti-6-methyl-adenine monoclonal antibody. The use of DNA methyltransferase genotyping coupled to a scintillation proximity assay allows for the detection of up to 10 CFU of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis per ml of milk. This test is rapid and sensitive and allows for automation and thus multiple samples can be tested at the same time.},

Current research has shown cannabis to be a useful remedy for many diseases, including multiple sclerosis, dystonia, and chronic pain. Cannabinoids are used to improve food intake in anorexia of AIDS patients and to prevent vomiting due to cancer chemotherapy. In inflammatory conditions cannabinoids improve pain in rheumatoid arthritis and pain and diarrhea in Crohn's disease. Cannabinoids reduce the size of brain infarct and cardiac reperfusion injury. However, cannabinoid treatment is not free of side effects including euphoria, psychosis, anxiety, paranoia, dependence and abuse. Since the cannabinoid system is involved in many physiological and pathological processes, the therapeutic potential is great. We must not be blind to the opportunity offered to us by medical cannabis just because it is an illicit drug, nor should we be temped by the quick response of patients to the central effect of cannabis. More research is warranted to explore the full potential of cannabis as medicine.},

   abstract = {In vitro and animals models have long been used to study human diseases and identify novel therapeutic approaches that can be applied to combat these conditions. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two main entities of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is an intricate relationship between IBD features in human patients, in vitro and animal colitis models, mechanisms and possible therapeutic approaches in these models, and strategies that can be extrapolated and applied in humans. Malnutrition, particularly protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies, as well as dysregulation of the intestinal microbiota, are common features of IBD. Based on these observations, dietary supplementation with essential nutrients known to be in short supply in the diet in IBD patients and with other molecules believed to provide beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, as well as with probiotic organisms that stimulate immune functions and resistance to infection has been tested in colitis models. Here we review current knowledge on nutritional and probiotic supplementation in in vitro and animal colitis models. While some of these strategies require further fine-tuning before they can be applied in human IBD patients, their intended purpose is to prevent, delay or treat disease symptoms in a non-pharmaceutical manner.},

Vitamin D appears to have several important actions beyond the maintenance of bone health, including various effects on the immune system. Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in the development of CD, and its analogues may have a role in the treatment of CD. Current research also suggests a role for vitamin D in counteracting some IBD-specific complications, including osteopenia, colorectal neoplasia, and depression. There remains a need for prospective studies to further delineate these relationships. Given current evidence and the apparent safety of vitamin D supplementation, it appears reasonable to screen for and treat vitamin D deficiency in patients with IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Up to one-third of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) do not respond to, or are intolerant of conventional immunosuppressive drugs. Although biological agents are alternative treatments, they may not be suitable or available to some patients. AIM: To review the evidence for use of nonbiological drugs in the treatment of patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines. METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed for English language publications with predetermined search criteria to identify relevant studies. RESULTS: Published evidence from uncontrolled series and controlled clinical trials has been used to produce a practical approach relevant to clinical practice which incorporates the indication, optimal dose, and side effects of various therapies including tacrolimus, methotrexate, thalidomide, tioguanine, mycophenolate mofotil, leucocyte apheresis, nutritional therapy, antibiotics, probiotics, allopurinol, rectal acetarsol and ciclosporin in the treatment of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Approaches to optimise thiopurine efficacy are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines may respond to alternative anti-inflammatory chemical molecules, but the evidence base for many of these alternatives is limited and further trials are needed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: The effect of vitamin D supplementation on immune disorders has been a topical research focus. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the current evidence of the effect of vitamin D supplementation as a therapy for colitis. METHODS: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Cinicaltrials.gov and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using the terms 'inflammatory bowel disease' 'Crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'colitis' [and] 'vitamin D'. Both human and animal studies published in English language were examined. The reference lists of included studies and review articles were manually searched for any relevant studies. RESULTS: Four studies were included in this systematic review. All reported an improvement in disease activity with vitamin D supplementation. The only high quality human study reported a non-significant reduction of relapse rate for Crohn's disease. No major adverse effects of vitamin D supplementation were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is some evidence that supplemental vitamin D, as an adjunctive treatment, may help in controlling colitis, this evidence is not enough to justify using vitamin D in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Large high quality placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials are needed to explore a possible benefit of using vitamin D in treating IBD.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with intestinal dysbiosis evidenced by an altered microbiome forming thick biofilms on the epithelium. Additionally, adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) strains are frequently isolated from ileal lesions of CD patients indicating a potential role for these strains in disease pathogenesis. The composition and characteristics of the host microbiome are influenced by environmental factors, particularly diet. Polysaccharides added to food as emulsifiers, stabilizers or bulking agents have been linked to bacteria-associated intestinal disorders. The escalating consumption of polysaccharides in Western diets parallels an increased incidence of CD during the latter 20(th) century. In this study, the effect of a polysaccharide panel on adhesiveness of the CD-associated AIEC strain LF82 was analyzed to determine if these food additives promote disease-associated bacterial phenotypes. Maltodextrin (MDX), a polysaccharide derived from starch hydrolysis, markedly enhanced LF82 specific biofilm formation. Biofilm formation of multiple other E. coli strains was also promoted by MDX. MDX-induced E. coli biofilm formation was independent of polysaccharide chain length indicating a requirement for MDX metabolism. MDX exposure induced type I pili expression, which was required for MDX-enhanced biofilm formation. MDX also increased bacterial adhesion to human intestinal epithelial cell monolayers in a mechanism dependent on type 1 pili and independent of the cellular receptor CEACAM6, suggesting a novel mechanism of epithelial cell adhesion. Analysis of mucosa-associated bacteria from individuals with and without CD showed increased prevalence of malX, a gene essential for MDX metabolism, uniquely in the ileum of CD patients. These findings demonstrate that the ubiquitous dietary component MDX enhances E. coli adhesion and suggests a mechanism by which Western diets rich in specific polysaccharides may promote dysbiosis of gut microbes and contribute to disease susceptibility.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dairy products have been perceived as having the potential to cause adverse effects in individuals with Crohn's disease (CD) and are often avoided, potentially increasing the risk of osteoporosis and related morbidity associated with inadequate dietary calcium intake. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the self-reported effects of dairy products on CD symptoms and to determine whether these effects differed between types of dairy products consumed and disease state or location. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of dietary survey and clinical data from participants in the Genes and Diet in Inflammatory Bowel Disease study based in Auckland, New Zealand. SUBJECTS/SETTING: One hundred and sixty-five men and women diagnosed with CD for which both dietary survey data and clinical information were available. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: chi(2) analysis was conducted to assess whether significant differences in the proportions of responses relating to a worsening of CD symptoms from individual dairy products were evident between individuals with active or quiescent CD, or ileal or colonic disease locations. Odds ratios with confidence interval were calculated to determine whether CD location was associated with risk of any type of adverse reaction to milk products. Logit scales were utilized to depict self-reported CD symptoms associated with individual dairy product consumption for ileal and colonic CD patients. RESULTS: Dairy products had no effect on self-reported CD symptoms for most people. Dairy products with a high fat content were most frequently reported to worsen perceived CD symptoms. Clinically, self-reported CD activity status did not influence responses to dairy products; however, colonic inflammation was more frequently associated with adverse CD effects in comparison to ileal CD involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Research outcomes question the necessity of dairy product avoidance in CD patients and illustrate the highly individual nature of dairy product tolerance in this clinical population.},

   abstract = {IBD is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gut that demands long-lasting treatment targeting both flare-up periods and maintenance of remission. Oral systemic steroids have been used to induce remission in patients with active IBD for over 50 years due to their potent anti-inflammatory effects. The efficacy of systemic steroids in this setting has been largely demonstrated. However, the wide range of adverse events associated with these drugs has prompted the development of equally effective but less toxic steroid compounds. Currently, topically acting oral steroids are an important therapeutic option for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis, being oral budesonide and oral beclomethasone established elements of the IBD armamentarium. At present, oral budesonide is the first-line therapy to induce remission in microscopic colitis and mild to moderate ileocaecal CD patients and oral beclomethasone is effective treating mild to moderate UC patients with left-sided or extensive disease. This review aims at evaluating the current role of these compounds in IBD clinical practice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental factors, including diet, seem to participate in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. The kind of dietetic habits before the appearance of the illness in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) has not been studied extensively. AIM: To prospectively assess the kind of food consumption in patients with CD exactly at the time of diagnosis and to identify dietary constituents as risk factors for development of CD. PATIENTS - METHODS: Twenty eight patients with a newly established diagnosis of CD (2-4 weeks), (12 men and 16 women), 30 patients with previously (between 2 - 11 years) established diagnosis of CD (14 men and 16 women) and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (16 men and 22 women) were included in the study. Dietary intake was assessed by means of special questionnaire. RESULTS: Comparisons between controls and newly diagnosed patients showed that increased consumption of milk and yogurt (P = 0.042), fruits (P = 0.0001), citrus (P = 0.0001), vegetables (P = 0.0001), carrots (P = 0.0001), legumes (P = 0.036), fish and selfish (P = 0.001), honey (P = 0.003), and nuts (P = 0.038), was associated with decreased risk for CD. On the other hand, significantly increased intake of fat (P = 0.041), olive oil (P = 0.038), margarine (P = 0.038), sugar (P = 0.02), alcohol drinks (P = 0.009), fried food (P = 0.0001), and pasta (P = 0.0001), was noticed on recently diagnosed patients in comparison with the healthy control group. On logistic regression analysis foods remaining statistically significant were: margarine, pasta, fried foods, fat, olives, sugar (increased risk), and yogurt, honey, fruits, nuts, fish, and citrus fruits (decreased risk). Newly diagnosed patients were significantly overweighed (64%) compared to healthy people (26%) and old patients (7%). CONCLUSION: Significant differences in many kinds of food between newly diagnosed patients with CD, patients with established CD and normal people certainly exist. Our results suggest that specific dietary patterns could be associated with higher or lower risks for CD in adults. However, whether these dietary factors are important for the development of CD or modulate the effect of other environmental factors is unknown.},

   abstract = {Presence of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in milk for human consumption is a concern due to its possible relationship with Crohn's disease in humans. Pasteurization effectively reduces the MAP load by four to five logs, but the efficacy depends on the MAP concentration, which depends on the prevalence among contributing herds and individuals. Considerable variation of MAP in bulk tank milk (BTM) and individual cow's milk (IM) is reported, but factors associated with MAP occurrence in milk at farm level have not been described. This study systematically reviewed published studies aiming at estimating the occurrence of MAP in on-farm BTM and IM by meta-analysis. A total of 692 articles were identified through electronic databases and initially screened using title and abstract. The quality of the 61 potentially relevant articles was assessed using full text and 31 articles were eventually included in the meta-analysis. The apparent prevalence (AP) of MAP in BTM and IM on farm were summarized in relation to strata defined by the test used to identify MAP and the infection status of the herds/animals. There was considerable inconsistency in the reporting, resulting in missing information potentially explaining the dispersion in the estimated AP. The overall AP and 95% confidence intervals based on PCR and culture of MAP were summarized to 0.10 (0.04-0.22) in BTM and 0.20 (0.12-0.32) in IM. Quantifying the MAP load in test-positive milk samples was not possible because very few articles provided quantitative information on individual samples.},

Rheumatoid arthritis and myeloproliferative disorder or myelodysplastic disorder often coexist, and treatment with standard immunosuppressants becomes complex.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study design, patients with confirmed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), and >/=18 years old, attending outpatient clinics at 14 hospitals in Norway were eligible to complete questionnaires including demographics, clinical variables, and the International CAM Questionnaire (I-CAM-Q). RESULTS: Of 460 patients included in the study, 430 had evaluable questionnaires (response rate 93%). Forty-nine percent (95% CI: 44-54) had used some type of CAM within the past 12 months. CAM services were utilized by 27% (95% CI: 23-31) of the patients, 21% (95% CI: 16-23) reported use of CAM products, and 28% (95% CI: 23-31) used CAM self-help practices. The most common pattern of CAM use was to combine CAM services and CAM products. Significantly, more UC patients (56%) than CD patients (44%) reported CAM use, p = 0.03. In UC, only the presence of at least one comorbid condition was directly related to CAM use. In CD, being a woman, being aged 31-50 years, having a higher education level, and experiencing adverse drug reactions from IBD medication were factors independently associated with the use of CAM. CONCLUSION: Use of CAM was common among IBD patients attending outpatient clinics. Both demographic and clinical factors were associated to CAM use, but the factors differed in their significance for UC and CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood is a rapidly developing research field with clear clinical implications for the staging and monitoring of cancer patients. Current CTC assays, including the US Food and Drug Administration-cleared CellSearch(R) system, typically use markers [e.g., cytokeratins (CKs), the transmembrane protein EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule)] that are expressed on normal and malignant epithelial cells but not on the surrounding normal leukocytes. METHODS: We enrolled 53 patients with benign colon diseases (e.g., diverticulosis, benign polyps, Crohn disease, ulcerative rectocolitis, colonic endometriosis) and analyzed their peripheral blood with 2 previously validated CTC assays: the epithelial immunospot (EPISPOT) assay and the CellSearch system. The EPISPOT assay detects only viable, CK19-releasing CTCs that were enriched by depletion of CD45(+) leukocytes, whereas the CellSearch system detects CK-positive CTCs after positive EpCAM-based immunomagnetic enrichment. RESULTS: In patients with benign colon diseases, positive events that met the criteria for "tumor cells" were detected with both the CellSearch system (11.3%) and the CK19-EPISPOT assay (18.9%), whereas no positive events were detected in samples from healthy volunteers. Positive events were detected most frequently in patients with diverticulosis and Crohn disease. All positive events lacked expression of CD45, a common leukocyte antigen. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that patients with benign inflammatory colon diseases in particular can harbor viable circulating epithelial cells that are detectable with current CTC assays. This finding points to the need for further molecular characterization of circulating epithelial cells and has important implications for the use of CTC testing.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There are very few published studies of agents having the potential to improve bone health in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective of this study was to establish the efficacy and safety of intranasal calcitonin in improving bone mineral density (BMD) in young patients with IBD and to define additional factors that impact bone mineral accrual. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial in 63 participants, ages 8-21 years, with a spinal BMD Z-score </= -1.0 s.d. measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Subjects were randomized to 200 IU intranasal calcitonin (n=31) or placebo (n=32) daily. All received age-appropriate calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Subsequent BMD measurements were obtained at 9 and 18 months. RESULTS: Intranasal calcitonin was well tolerated. Adverse event frequency was similar in both treatment groups, and such events were primarily minor, reversible, and limited to the upper respiratory tract. The BMD Z-score change documented at screening and 9 months and screening and 18 months did not differ between the two therapeutic arms. In participants with Crohn's disease, the spinal BMD Z-score improved between screening and 9 months (change in spine BMD Z-score (DeltaZSBMD)(9-0)) in the calcitonin group (DeltaZSBMD(9-0)(calcitonin)=0.21 (0.37), DeltaZSBMD(9-0)(placebo)=-0.15 (0.5), P=0.02); however, this was only a secondary subgroup analysis. Bone mineral accrual rate during the trial did not lead to normalization of BMD Z-score in this cohort. Factors favoring higher bone mineral accrual rate were lower baseline BMD and higher baseline body mass index Z-score, improvement in height Z-score, higher serum albumin, hematocrit and iron concentration, and more hours of weekly weight-bearing activity. Factors associated with lower bone mineral accrual rate were more severe disease-as indicated by elevated inflammatory markers, need for surgery, hospitalization, and the use of immunomodulators-and higher daily caffeine intake. CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal calcitonin is well tolerated but does not offer a long-term advantage in youth with IBD and decreased BMD. Bone mineral accrual rate remains compromised in youth with IBD and low BMD raising concerns for long-term bone health outcomes. Improvement in nutritional status, catch-up linear growth, control of inflammation, increase in weight-bearing activity, and lower daily caffeine intake may be helpful in restoring bone density in children with IBD and low BMD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) is a rare, lethal disease generally seen in young male patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The study of biologic and immunomodulator naive patients in Crohn's disease (SONIC), advocates combining infliximab with an immunomodulator in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Unfortunately, combined immunosuppression increases risk for HSTCL. We herein review all cases of HSTCL reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors. METHODS: Individual reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database for lymphomas from the biological agents - infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab, and etanercept were downloaded and analyzed with Microsoft Access. Full reports for all identified HSTCL cases were obtained from the FDA. RESULTS: Twenty-five cases of HSTCL were identified. Twenty-two (88%) patients had inflammatory bowel disease and three had rheumatoid arthritis. Four cases (16%) were in women and four patients were above 65 years of age. Twenty-four cases (96%) also received an immunomodulator (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate). Two patients received adalimumab alone. CONCLUSION: HSTCL is no longer restricted to the previously identified risk group of young male patients, but can also occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, females and older adults receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors and immunomodulators. Improved disease outcomes using combination therapy should be tempered by the risk of developing HSTCL.},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis (MAP), excreted in the feces and milk, is reported to be not easily inactivated by pasteurization and thermal treatments as other bacteria infecting humans and animals do. The D values of all MAP strains tested were considerably higher than those published for other pathogens. Culturing techniques for this organism are labor intensive. Although an increasing amount of scientific evidence suggests that this organism can be responsible for at least some cases of Crohn's disease (CD), there is controversy about MAP being a cause of CD in humans. In general, although some studies have described an association between the presence of MAP and CD, the role of Mycobacterium species and MAP in the etiology of this human disease remains unestablished. Although published reports indicate that it may not be completely inactivated by pasteurization of milk, the effectiveness of increasing the time or temperature in the pasteurization process has not been established and hence any potential benefit to human health cannot be determined. This article summarizes the incidences of MAP in milk and milk products with respect to human health and brief discussion of various serological as well as molecular techniques used for their isolation, enumeration, and characterization.},

AIM: To compare the efficacy of the three anti-TNFs for CD in clinical practice. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients initiated on anti-TNF between 2004 and 2008. Disease activity, quality of life, and remission rates were compared between groups over 1 year. RESULTS: Sixty patients with CD were initiated on anti-TNF from 2004 to 2008: 31 on infliximab (IFX) and 29 on adalimumab (ADA) or certolizumab pegol (CTZ). More patients in the ADA/CTZ scores group had prior exposure to anti-TNF (76 versus 10%, p < 0.01). Mean Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) scores in the IFX group were lower than in the ADA/CTZ group at 12 months (2.72 +/- 3.34 versus 5.63 +/- 5.33, p = 0.03). At 12 months, more IFX patients were in remission compared with those on ADA/CTZ (88 versus 53%, p </= 0.01). Mean short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) scores were not different between the IFX and ADA/CTZ groups at 12 months. Stratified analyses and logistic regression based on prior anti-TNF use did not show differences in remission rates at any time point post-baseline between groups. CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for prior anti-TNF there was no difference in remission rates between the IFX and ADA/CTZ groups at any time point post-baseline. This suggests that differences between groups were accounted for by a higher rate of prior anti-TNF in the ADA/CTZ group. Our results should be reviewed with caution given the small sample size.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of Lacto-Wolfberry (LWB), both in vitro and using a mouse model of experimental colitis. METHODS: The effects of LWB on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interleukin (IL)-6 secretion were assessed in a murine macrophage cell line. in vitro assessment also included characterizing the effects of LWB on the activation of NF-E2 related 2 pathway and inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, utilizing reporter cell lines. Following the in vitro assessment, the anti-inflammatory efficacy of an oral intervention with LWB was tested in vivo using a preclinical model of intestinal inflammation. Multiple outcomes including body weight, intestinal histology, colonic cytokine levels and anti-oxidative measures were investigated. RESULTS: LWB reduced the LPS-mediated induction of ROS production [+LPS vs 1% LWB + LPS, 1590 +/- 188.5 relative luminescence units (RLU) vs 389 +/- 5.9 RLU, P < 0.001]. LWB was more effective than wolfberry alone in reducing LPS-induced IL-6 secretion in vitro (wolfberry vs 0.5% LWB, 15% +/- 7.8% vs 64% +/- 5%, P < 0.001). In addition, LWB increased reporter gene expression via the anti-oxidant response element activation (wolfberry vs LWB, 73% +/- 6.9% vs 148% +/- 28.3%, P < 0.001) and inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced activation of the NF-kappaB pathway (milk vs LWB, 10% +/- 6.7% vs 35% +/- 3.3%, P < 0.05). Furthermore, oral supplementation with LWB resulted in a reduction of macroscopic (-LWB vs +LWB, 5.39 +/- 0.61 vs 3.66 +/- 0.59, P = 0.0445) and histological scores (-LWB vs +LWB, 5.44 +/- 0.32 vs 3.66 +/- 0.59, P = 0.0087) in colitic mice. These effects were associated with a significant decrease in levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta (-LWB vs +LWB, 570 +/- 245 mug/L vs 89 +/- 38 mug/L, P = 0.0106), keratinocyte-derived chemokine/growth regulated protein-alpha (-LWB vs +LWB, 184 +/- 49 mug/L vs 75 +/- 20 mug/L, P = 0.0244), IL-6 (-LWB vs +LWB, 318 +/- 99 mug/L vs 117 +/- 18 mug/L, P = 0.0315) and other pro-inflammatory proteins such as cyclooxygenase-2 (-LWB vs +LWB, 0.95 +/- 0.12 AU vs 0.36 +/- 0.11 AU, P = 0.0036) and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (-LWB vs +LWB, 0.51 +/- 0.15 AU vs 0.1 +/- 0.04 AU, P = 0.057). Moreover, antioxidant biomarkers, including expression of gene encoding for the glutathione peroxidase, in the colon and the plasma anti-oxidant capacity were significantly increased by supplementation with LWB (-LWB vs +LWB, 1.2 +/- 0.21 mmol/L vs 2.1 +/- 0.19 mmol/L, P = 0.0095). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the anti-inflammatory properties of LWB and suggest that the underlying mechanism is at least in part due to NF-kappaB inhibition and improved anti-oxidative capacity.},

   abstract = {Probiotics have been suggested as an alternative therapeutical approach in the intervention of inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Application of single strains or probiotic mixtures has shown promising results in animal models and patients of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We recently demonstrated potent inhibitory capacity of a Bifidobacterium bifidum S17 on LPS-induced inflammatory events in cell culture models using intestinal epithelial cells and verified these anti-inflammatory effects in two mouse models of colitis. In the present study we analyze the anti-inflammatory effect of this potential probiotic strain in a chemically-induced model of colitis in C57BL/6 mice. This model is characterized by a strong type 1T helper (Th1) response resembling Crohn's disease, one of the two most prevalent forms of IBD. We performed macroscopic analysis and determined the effect of B. bifidum S17 on the cytokine balance in biopsies of the colonic mucosa. While treatment with B. bifidum S17 only had a marginal effect on weight loss, no difference was observed in the macroscopic parameters. However, a significant reduction in histology scores and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and the inflammatory markers cyclooxigenase 2 (Cox-2) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) was observed. These results indicate that treatment with B. bifidum S17 is able to partially inhibit the strong Th1-driven intestinal inflammation induced in our model of colitis.},

   abstract = {In vitro and animal studies point to numerous mechanisms by which fatty acids, especially long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), can modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. These data strongly suggest that improving the fatty acid supply of young children in low-income countries might have immune benefits. Unfortunately, there have been virtually no studies of fatty acid/immune interactions in such settings. Clinical trial registers list over 150 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving PUFAs, only one in a low-income setting (the Gambia). We summarize those results here. There was evidence for improved growth and nutritional status, but the primary end point of chronic environmental enteropathy showed no benefit, possibly because the infants were still substantially breastfed. In high-income settings, there have been RCTs with fatty acids (usually LCPUFAs) in relation to 18 disease end points, for some of which there have been numerous trials (asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis). For these diseases, the evidence is judged reasonable for risk reduction for childhood asthma (but not in adults), as yielding possible benefit in Crohn's disease (insufficient evidence in ulcerative colitis) and for convincing evidence for rheumatoid arthritis at sufficient dose levels, though formal meta-analyses are not yet available. This analysis suggests that fatty acid interventions could yield immune benefits in children in poor settings, especially in non-breastfed children and in relation to inflammatory conditions such as persistent enteropathy. Benefits might include improved responses to enteric vaccines, which frequently perform poorly in low-income settings, and these questions merit randomized trials.},

   abstract = {Tissues of cattle intended for human consumption can be contaminated by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Although different studies attribute varying roles of MAP in Crohn's disease progression it is thought that the exposure of humans to this bacterium should in any case be minimised. In this study, we have collected samples of intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, muscles of diaphragm (musculus diaphragma) and masseter muscles (musculus masseter) from twenty-five cows in a slaughterhouse. The infectious status of all animals was confirmed by culture of faeces. MAP was found in almost all the intestines and mesenteric lymph nodes examined, including three faecal culture-negative animals indicating intermittent shedding. As intestine is used for the traditional production of sausages, it is alarming that 84.2% of intestine samples were positive for MAP. F57 and IS900 real time PCR revealed MAP in 40 to 68% of diaphragms and 11.1 to 38.9% of masseters. A noticeable dependence of the probability of MAP positivity of faeces versus gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and of GIT and muscles was observed. Due to the changing behaviour of consumers, both of these muscles have started to be widely used in cuisine. Therefore, the results of this paper imply that the processing of cows with paratuberculosis in abattoirs without any precautions (restrictions) and the usage of meat for human consumption should be rethought.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which may result in nutrition problems that impact on patient health, nutritional status and quality of life. Subjective reports of how IBD patients experience these problems as part of their disease process, including comparisons between patient groups, or the need for tailored nutrition advice as perceived by these patients, have not been widely studied. This survey aimed to identify and explore nutritional problems that are important to CD and UC patients and to investigate their views on the IBD health services provided to help them with these. METHODS: Eighty-seven IBD patients were invited to take part in a nutrition survey using face-to-face questionnaire interviews. The survey asked about food and nutrition problems that patients have experienced, identifying which were most significant and the extent to which they had been addressed by the clinical service. RESULTS: Seventy-two IBD patients completed the evaluation (47 CD, 25 UC). Of these, 45 (62.5%) felt that food and nutrition were either 'important' or 'extremely important' in their experience of IBD, and 59 (82%) reported problems with food and nutrition. Patients with CD and UC reported similar frequencies of most nutritional problems. However, 44 (94%) CD vs. 16 (64%) UC patients reported problems with weight (p=0.002). Less than half of patients had seen a dietitian for tailored nutritional advice to address these problems. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional problems experienced and reported by IBD patients are numerous and varied. They are considered important by patients with CD and UC, both of whom would generally value specific dietary counselling, highlighting a need for further research in this area and adequate and equal provision of services for both groups.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The frequency of diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) in India is increasing. This case-control study was designed to detect associations of environmental and dietary factors with the diagnosis of CD. METHODS: In 200 consecutive patients with CD and 200 control subjects without gastrointestinal disease, environmental hygiene exposures in childhood and in the past one year, and dietary preferences were recorded using a questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, CD showed positive association with urban residence (at birth and current), availability of protected drinking water (childhood and current), availability of piped water in the house (childhood and current), and strict vegetarian dietary habit, and negative association with regular fish consumption and presence of cattle in the house compound. Multivariate analysis showed that regular fish consumption (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33-0.80, p = 0.003), and presence of cattle in the house compound currently (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.92, p = 0.023) were significant protective associations, whereas use of safe drinking water was positively associated (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.02-2.47, p = 0.042) with the disease. CONCLUSION: Occurrence of CD was associated with dietary and environmental exposures, which indicate that diet and hygiene may influence the development of this disease.},

   abstract = {AIM: Exclusion diets have been shown to prolong remission in Crohn's disease (CD). We assessed IgG4-targeted exclusion diets in patients with CD. METHOD: Forty patients with symptomatic CD were recruited. Their sera were tested for IgG4 antibodies to 14 specific food antigens and each subject's four most reactive foods were excluded for 4 weeks. Disease activity was assessed using a modified CD activity index (mCDAI). Questionnaire and inflammatory markers were measured before and on completion of the exclusion diet. RESULTS: Eleven patients did not complete the study, leaving 29 for analysis. Of these, 26 (90%) reported symptomatic improvement with a reduction in mCDAI from a mean of 171-97.5 (P = 0.0001). The ESR fell from 23 to 17 mm/h (P = 0.021) and the IgG4 titres for the excluded foods fell from a mean of 3015-2306 mcgA/l (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: IgG4-guided exclusion diets resulted in significant symptomatic improvement with an objective fall in an inflammatory marker. This approach may be useful in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) encompasses conditions characterized by non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation of the oral and maxillofacial region that present clinically as labial enlargement, perioral and/or mucosal swelling, oral ulcerations, and gingivitis. The unifying term "OFG" has been introduced to integrate the spectrum of various disorders, including Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome and granulomatous cheilitis (which is sometimes considered to be a monosymptomatic form of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome), and has been shown to be associated with Crohn's disease, sarcoidosis, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. Although various etiological agents such as food substances, food additives, dental materials, and various microbiological agents have been implicated in the disease process, its precise pathogenesis is yet to be elucidated. Delayed type of hypersensitivity reaction appears to play a significant role, although the exact antigen inducing the immunological reaction varies in individual patients. However, evidence for the role of genetic predisposition to the disease is sparse. The underlying immunological mechanism appears to show some similarities between OFG and Crohn's disease, emphasizing the need for more comparative studies of the two entities. The aim of this article is to report a case of OFG, along with a detailed literature review of the facts and variations associated with its nomenclature, clinical presentation, and etiology. It also projects the challenges that a professional has to face in the diagnosis and treatment planning of such cases.},

   abstract = {The essential micronutrient zinc has long been known to be a functional component of diverse structural proteins and enzymes. More recently, important roles for free or loosely bound intracellular zinc as a signaling factor have been reported. Insufficient zinc intake was shown to exacerbate symptoms in mouse models of inflammation such as experimental colitis, while zinc supplementation was found to improve intestinal barrier function. Herein, we provide evidence that intracellular zinc is essential for maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity when cells are exposed to the inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)alpha. Using the human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cell line as an in vitro model, we demonstrate that depletion of intracellular zinc affects TNFalpha-triggered signaling by shifting intestinal cell fate from survival to death. The mechanism underlying this effect was investigated. We show that TNFalpha promotes a zinc-dependent survival pathway that includes modulation of gene expression of transcription factors and signaling proteins. We have identified multiple regulatory steps regulated by zinc availability which include the induction of cellular Inhibitor of APoptosis (cIAP2) mRNA, possibly through activation of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-kappaB), as both nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and up-regulation of cIAP2 mRNA were impaired following zinc depletion. Moreover, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein level was profoundly reduced by zinc depletion. Our results provide a possible molecular explanation for the clinical observation that zinc supplements ameliorate Crohn's disease symptoms and decrease intestinal permeability in experimental colitis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is suspected to be a causative agent in human Crohn's disease (CD). Recent evidence suggests that pathogenic mycobacteria and MAP can induce the expression of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP), which are the main proteases in the pathogenesis of mucosal ulcerations in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Within this study we assessed the prevalence of intestinal MAP specific DNA in patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and healthy controls. We further analysed regulation patterns of MMPs in mucosal tissues of UC patients with and without intestinal MAP DNA detection. METHODS: Colonic biopsy samples were obtained from 63 Norwegian and German IBD patients and 21 healthy controls. RNA was quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study MMP gene expression in both pathological and healthy mucosal specimens. The presence of MAP DNA in colonic mucosa was examined using MAP specific PCR. RESULTS: MAP DNA was detected in 20% of UC patients and 33% of healthy controls but only in 7% of patients with CD. UC patients treated with corticosteroids exhibited a significantly increased frequency of intestinal MAP DNA compared to those not receiving corticosteroids. Expression of MMP-1, -2, -7, -9, -13, -19, -28 and TNF-alpha did not differ between UC patients with presence of intestinal MAP DNA compared to those without. MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13 were significantly decreased in UC patients receiving corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of intestinal MAP specific DNA is not associated with altered MMP expression in UC in vivo. Corticosteroids are associated with increased detection of intestinal MAP DNA and decreased expression of certain MMPs. Frequent detection of MAP DNA in healthy controls might be attributable to the wide environmental distribution of MAP and its presence in the food-chain.},

   abstract = {Multiple internal and external sites of the healthy human body are colonized by a diversity of symbiotic microbes. The microbial assemblages found in the intestine represent some of the most dense and diverse of these human-associated ecosystems. Unsurprisingly, the enteric microbiome, that is the totality of microbes, their combined genomes, and their interactions with the human body, has a profound impact on physiological aspects of mammalian function, not least, host immune response. Lack of early-life exposure to certain microbes, or shifts in the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome have been linked to the development and progression of several intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases, including childhood asthma development and inflammatory bowel disease. Modulating microbial exposure through probiotic supplementation represents a long-held strategy towards ameliorating disease via intestinal microbial community restructuring. This field has experienced somewhat of a resurgence over the past few years, primarily due to the exponential increase in human microbiome studies and a growing appreciation of our dependence on resident microbiota to modulate human health. This review aims to review recent regulatory aspects related to probiotics in food. It also summarizes what is known to date with respect to human gastrointestinal microbiota - the niche which has been most extensively studied in the human system - and the evidence for probiotic supplementation as a viable therapeutic strategy for modulating this consortium.},

   abstract = {Adalimumab (ADA) is a biologic medication that dampens inflammatory pathways by binding to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved ADA as a medication for use in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This year marks 10 years of clinical experience with ADA. Long-term extension studies of some of the initial clinical trials, as well as data from large patient registries, are demonstrating ongoing benefit for responders. Potential side effects such as increased risk of infection, lymphoma, congestive heart failure, and demyelination continue to be examined, as the available data are not unanimous in showing an increase in incidence. In balancing both the advantages and the disadvantages of using ADA, the drug's overall effectiveness and its availability for use in patients with hepatic or renal comorbidities are weighed against the high cost. ADA is expected to have a leading role in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions for years to come. Future studies will need to address the optimal sequence of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics to use, combinations of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics, and head-to-head comparisons of biologics in clinical trials. For those who go into clinical remission on an anti-tumor necrosis factor medication, unanswered questions remain about identifying the patients who can maintain the remission off all drugs, or at least off injected medication. Given the cost of biologic drugs, even studies that increase the interval between drug doses in well-controlled patients could provide financial benefits.},

The presence of MAP in food for human consumption and in affected tissues of patients with CD has been detected. Therefore, a causal association between this microorganism and the disease in humans, has been postulated. However, several related studies have failed to confirm this hypothesis and the scientific acceptance of MAP as a zoonotic agent remains controversial. This review presents the main findings related to this issue, contrasting evidences for and against an association between MAP and CD. The need to promote national studies focusing on this area is suggested.},

   abstract = {The second scientific workshop of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) focused on the relevance of intestinal healing for the disease course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective was to better understand basic mechanisms, markers for disease prediction, detection and monitoring of intestinal healing, impact of intestinal healing on the disease course of IBD as well as therapeutic strategies. The results of this workshop are presented in four separate manuscripts. This section describes basic mechanisms of intestinal healing, identifies open questions in the field and provides a framework for future studies.},

   abstract = {During the last few years a significant advance has been achieved in the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). From twin studies it was evident that there is more that 50% concordance of Crohn's disease (CD) in monozygotic twin pairs, however it is only 3.6% among dizygotic twins. These data indicate that the genetic background may be responsible for 50% of the risk or 'susceptibility' to develop CD. Obviously it is not a sufficient condition as otherwise there would be 100% concordance of disease in monozygotic twin pairs. Environmental factors as well must play an important role. This is further supported by the fact that there is only low development in genetic risk factors over ten thousands of years. In contrast, the incidence of CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) has dramatically increased in Western countries in the last 100 years. This further supports the concept of a 'Western lifestyle factor(s)' that triggers chronic intestinal inflammation in a genetically susceptible host. The proof of the concept of a genetic susceptibility was achieved in 2001 with the discovery that NOD2 is the most important susceptibility gene for CD. The function of NOD2 has been investigated in detail. NOD2 is an intracellular 'alarm button', a receptor recognizing invading bacteria that entered the mucosal wall. NOD2 mutants associated with susceptibility to CD seem to be deficient in their recognition of bacterial wall products. In a genome-wide association study a disease association was found in the autophagy-related 16-like 1 gene (ATG16L1). The ATG16L1 gene encodes a protein in the autophagosome pathway that processes intracellular bacteria. Based on these findings, CD is now discussed as an impaired and inadequate immune reaction to the gut bacteria which are a part of our environment (or perhaps 'in-vironment'). In addition to NOD2 and ATG16L1, there are more 'innate' pathways by which commensal and pathogenic bacteria can directly interact with cells of the intestinal mucosa. The 'environment concept' and the 'genetic concept' of IBD pathophysiology are converging. With the finding that most susceptibility genes for CD and UC are involved in innate immune mechanisms and the primary defense against bacteria entering the mucosa, for the first time a unifying concept of the 'genetic pathophysiology hypothesis' and the 'environment pathophysiology hypothesis' of IBD was possible. Bacteria are the link between the environment and mucosal defense system.},

This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a dietary EA-enriched pomegranate extract (PE) in a murine chronic model of Cronh's disease (CD). Colonic injury was induced by intracolonic instillation of trinitrobenzensulfonic acid (TNBS). Rats were fed with different diets during 30 days before TNBS instillation and 2 weeks before killing: (i) standard, (ii) PE 250 mg/kg/day, (iii) PE 500 mg/kg/day, (iv) EA 10 mg/kg/day and (v) EA 10 mg/kg/day enriched-PE 250 mg/kg/day. Inflammation response was assessed by histology and MPO activity and TNF-alpha production. Besides, colonic expressions of iNOS, COX-2, p38, JNK, pERK1/2 MAPKs, IKBalpha and nuclear p65 NF-kappaB were studied by western blotting. MPO activity and the TNF-alpha levels were significantly reduced in dietary fed rats when compared with TNBS group. Similarly, PE and an EA-enriched PE diets drastically decreased COX-2 and iNOS overexpression, reduced MAPKs phosporylation and prevented the nuclear NF-kappaB translocation. Dietary supplementation of EA contributes in the beneficial effect of PE in this experimental colitis model and may be a novel therapeutic strategy to manage inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).},

Several studies have investigated the association between NHPH and human disease, including Crohn's disease, lithiasis, liver disease, coronary disease, gastritis, and pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulcers. Novel Helicobacter taxa were identified in new vertebrate hosts, and new methodologies in the fields of identification of Helicobacter spp. and evaluation of antibiotic resistance were described. The genome of the first human-derived gastric NHPH strain (Helicobacter bizzozeronii CIII-1) was sequenced, and several studies elucidated functions of different genes in NHPH. A number of important investigations regarding pathogenesis and immunopathobiology of NHPH infections have been published including the description of a new urease in Helicobacter mustelae. Finally, the effects of the gut microbiota and probiotics on NHPH infections were investigated.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic inflammatory disorders that can affect the gastrointestinal tract of children and adults. Like other autoimmune processes, the cause(s) of these disorders remain unknown but likely involves some interplay between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. Children, in particular with UC or CD, can present to their primary care providers with similar symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody stool. Although UC and CD are more predominant in adults, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that a significant percentage of these patients were diagnosed during childhood. The chronic nature of the inflammatory process observed in these children and the waxing and waning nature of their clinical symptoms can be especially disruptive to their physical, social, and academic development. As such, physicians caring for children must consider these diseases when evaluating patients with compatible symptoms. Recent research efforts have made available a variety of more specific and effective pharmacologic agents and improved endoscopic and radiologic assessment tools to assist clinicians in the diagnosis and interval assessment of their patients with IBD; however, as the level of complexity of these interventions has increased, so too has the need for practitioners to become familiar with a wider array of treatments and the risks and benefits of particular diagnostic testing. Nonetheless, in most cases, and especially when frequent visits to subspecialty referral centers are not geographically feasible, primary care providers can be active participants in the management of their pediatric patients with IBD. The goal of this article is to educate and assist pediatricians and adult gastroenterology physicians caring for children with IBD, and in doing so, help to develop more collaborative care plans between primary care and subspecialty providers.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Variations in chronic illness care are common in our health care system and may lead to suboptimal outcomes. Specifically, inconsistent use and suboptimal medication dosing have been demonstrated in the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Quality improvement (QI) efforts have improved outcomes in conditions such as asthma and diabetes mellitus, but have not been well studied in IBD. We hypothesized that QI efforts would lead to improved outcomes in our pediatric IBD population. METHODS: A QI team was formed within our IBD center in 2005. By 2007, we began prospectively capturing physician global assessment (PGA) and patient-reported global assessment. Significant QI interventions included creating evidence-based medication guidelines, joining a national QI collaborative, initiation of preclinic planning, and monitoring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2010, 505 patients have been followed at our IBD center. During this time, the frequency of patients in clinical remission increased from 59% to 76% (P < 0.05), the frequency of patients who report that their global assessment is >7 increased from 69% to 80% (P < 0.05), and the frequency of patients with a Short Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (sPCDAI) <15 increased from 60% to 77% (P < 0.05). The frequency of repeat steroid use decreased from 17% to 10% (P < 0.05). We observed an association between the use of a vitamin D supplement (P = 0.02), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (P < 0.05), and quiescent disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that significant improvements in patient outcomes are associated with QI efforts that do not rely on new medication or therapies.},

All other remaining blood components are also returned to the patient. The purpose of this procedure is immunomodulation. The treated leukocytes, specifically T-cells, are returned to the patient's circulation and will induce cytotoxicity and reduce proliferation of new T-cells. In the United States, ECP was initially approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma by the US Food and Drug Administration in the late 1980s. Since that time, it has been used as an "off-label" therapy to treat several other autoimmune diseases in the United States and even more extensively in Europe and Asia. The following review is limited to the current clinical use of ECP in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, Crohn's disease, systemic sclerosis, graft versus host disease, and emerging data on nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.},

   abstract = {Many foods have been implicated in theories about the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. While evidence has accumulated that nutritional factors as part of overall lifestyle changes may play a role in the growing incidence, no specific dietary recommendations except the promotion of breastfeeding can currently be given to decrease the risk of developing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. For the treatment of Crohn's disease in children and adolescents, however, enteral feeding with a semi-elemental diet seems to be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing and maintaining remission. In the meta-analyses, advantages of one formula over the other are evened out, and more research is warranted into the anti-inflammatory properties of different nutrients, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, butyrate, glutamine, and cytokines, such as transforming growth factors-beta. Unfortunately, for practical reasons, nutritional therapy remains underutilized, even though pediatric patients are most vulnerable to the harmful effects of nutrient deficiencies on growth, pubertal development, and bone health. There is hope that in the future the new field of nutrigenomics may enable physicians to more accurately tailor a specific diet to the patient genotype.},

   abstract = {This review looks at the critical role of vitamin D in improving barrier function, production of antimicrobial peptides including cathelicidin and some defensins, and immune modulation. The function of vitamin D in the innate immune system and in the epithelial cells of the oral cavity, lung, gastrointestinal system, genito-urinary system, skin and surface of the eye is discussed. Clinical conditions are reviewed where vitamin D may play a role in the prevention of infections or where it may be used as primary or adjuvant treatment for viral, bacterial and fungal infections. Several conditions such as tuberculosis, psoriasis, eczema, Crohn's disease, chest infections, wound infections, influenza, urinary tract infections, eye infections and wound healing may benefit from adequate circulating 25(OH)D as substrate. Clinical diseases are presented in which optimization of 25(OH)D levels may benefit or cause harm according to present day knowledge. The safety of using larger doses of vitamin D in various clinical settings is discussed.},

   abstract = {Poorly controlled Crohn's disease (CD) often requires surgery for such complications as strictures, fistulas, and abscesses. The goal of postoperative treatment is to suppress or prevent inflammation and maintain mucosal healing. Probiotics, antibiotics, 5-aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, and antibodies to tumor necrosis factor are all used to prevent postoperative recurrence. In this article, recent studies are reviewed. Azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine are moderately effective at preventing and treating postoperative CD, whereas infliximab/adalimumab are highly effective and probiotics and 5-aminosalicylates minimally effective. We base the choice of postoperative medical therapy on the patient's risk profile for postoperative recurrence. Whatever postoperative therapy is used, the mucosa should be assessed within 12 months to determine if the approach is effective. If active inflammation is found, then treatment should be intensified. By treating CD aggressively after a first surgery, future surgeries can be delayed or averted.},

   abstract = {The probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) is one of the few probiotics licensed as a medication in several countries. Best documented is its effectiveness in keeping patients suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission. This might be due to its ability to induce the production of human beta-defensin 2 (HBD2) in a flagellin-dependent way in intestinal epithelial cells. In contrast to ulcerative colitis, for Crohn's disease (CD) convincing evidence is lacking that EcN might be clinically effective, most likely due to the genetically based inability of sufficient defensin production in CD patients. As a first step in the development of an alternative approach for the treatment of CD patients, EcN strains were constructed which were able to produce human alpha-defensin 5 (HD5) or beta-defensin 2 (HBD2). For that purpose, codon-optimized defensin genes encoding either the proform with the signal sequence of human alpha-defensin 5 (HD5) or the gene encoding HBD2 with or without the signal sequence were cloned in an expression vector plasmid under the control of the T7 promoter. Synthesis of the encoded defensins was shown by Western blots after induction of expression and lysis of the recombinant EcN strains. Recombinant mature HBD2 with an N-terminal His-tag could be purified by Ni-column chromatography and showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes. In a second approach, that part of the HBD2 gene which encodes mature HBD2 was fused with the yebF gene. The resulting fusion protein YebFMHBD2 was secreted from the encoding EcN mutant strain after induction of expression. Presence of YebFMHBD2 in the medium was not the result of leakage from the bacterial cells, as demonstrated in the spent culture supernatant by Western blots specific for beta-galactosidase and maltose-binding protein. The dialyzed and concentrated culture supernatant inhibited the growth of E. coli, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and L. monocytogenes in radial diffusion assays as well as in liquid culture. This demonstrates EcN to be a suitable probiotic E. coli strain for the production of certain defensins.},

Food nutrients were believed to play a certain role in the causation of the disease, in conjunction with genetic, immunologic, environmental and other factors (especially intestinal microbiota). Various nutrients were found to be involved, sometimes with controversial results, possibly pertaining to geographic regions. Nutrition has to be especially considered in children as disease itself and/or the medication can severely impair normal growth and development, sometimes with permanent long-term sequels. We reviewed the data on the possible roles of diet in preventing the disease and relapses. We emphasize the crucial importance of enteral nutrition in inducing and maintaining the remission of Crohn's disease, according to the existing consensuses (benefits, indications, routes of administration, types of formula, duration, results).

Clinical samples contained Clostridium botulinum spores and botulinum neurotoxins (types A and B) for extended periods (range 41-61 days), indicative of intestinal toxemia botulism. Patients' clinical signs improved with supportive care and administration of botulinum antitoxin. Peanut butter from the residence of 1 case-patient yielded C. botulinum type A, which corresponded with type A spores found in the patient's feces. The food and clinical isolates from this case-patient could not be distinguished by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Two of the case-patients had Crohn disease and had undergone previous bowel surgery, which may have contributed to infection with C. botulinum. These cases reinforce the view that an underlying gastrointestinal condition is a risk factor for adult intestinal toxemia botulism.},

Elemental diet and total parenteral nutrition are effective therapies for Crohn's disease; however, changes of microbiota as a result of both treatments have not been fully elucidated. AIM: To elucidate changes of faecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients treated with elemental diet and total parenteral nutrition. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 33 active Crohn's disease patients and 17 healthy subjects, and recollected after elemental diet (8 patients) and total parenteral nutrition (9 patients). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of bacterial 16srDNA was performed to evaluate the whole microbiota. Specific quantitative PCR was then used to determine populations of predominant bacterial groups. RESULTS: In Crohn's disease patients, the number of terminal restriction fragments, which reflects bacterial species, was significantly lower. Populations of total bacteria and Bifidobacterium were significantly lower and the ratio of Enterococcus was higher. The number of terminal restriction fragments was significantly decreased after total parenteral nutrition, but not after elemental diet. Population of Bacteroides fragilis significantly decreased after elemental diet, while population of Enterococcus significantly increased after total parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Faecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients was markedly different from healthy subjects. Species diversity was reduced by total parenteral nutrition, but not by elemental diet.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of budesonide for the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). DATA SOURCES: Literature was accessed through PubMed/MEDLINE (1966-June 2011) and Web of Science (1965-June 2011) using the terms autoimmune hepatitis and budesonide. Literature was limited to English-language publications. In addition, references from publications identified were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles in English identified from the data sources were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: The initial treatment of choice for AIH is prednisone alone or with azathioprine. However, a significant number of patients do not respond adequately or have adverse reactions to this regimen; therefore, alternative treatments are required. Budesonide is an orally administered synthetic corticosteroid with high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor that undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. It has Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling for the treatment and maintenance of remission of mild-to-moderate Crohn disease involving the ileum and/or ascending colon. One prospective, active-controlled study of budesonide in the treatment of AIH was identified, as well as 5 small open-label studies and 1 retrospective chart review. Budesonide appears to have efficacy in the treatment of AIH, including in patients intolerant to standard therapy with prednisone alone or with azathioprine, with a reduced incidence of corticosteroid-related adverse reactions. However, in patients with AIH and cirrhosis, the efficacy of budesonide may be reduced and the incidence of corticosteroid-related adverse reactions may be increased. CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide may be an additional treatment option for patients with AIH but without cirrhosis who are intolerant to standard therapy with prednisone or prednisone with azathioprine.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease have an increased frequency of osteopenia and osteoporosis. This randomized, controlled, double-blind study assessed the efficacy of risedronate versus placebo in treating low bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: 88 Crohn's disease outpatients with BMD T-score<-1.0 by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups for the two year study duration: one group received risedronate 35 mg weekly while another received placebo. Both groups received daily calcium (Ca; 500 mg) and vitamin D (D; 400 IU) supplementation. Percent change in BMD relative to baseline was compared between the two therapies at 12 and 24 months. RESULTS: Using intent-to-treat analysis, at 12 months, risedronate+Ca+D increased BMD, relative to baseline, more than placebo+Ca+D in the femoral trochanter (1.4+/-3.4% vs -0.1+/-3.1%; p=0.03) and total hip (1.1+/-2.7% vs -0.1+/-2.5%;p=0.04). This trend in greater BMD continued for the 24 month duration of the study. There was no difference between the two treatment groups for changes in spine BMD. Subgroup analysis revealed that risedronate+Ca+D resulted in significantly better improvement in femoral trochanter BMD in non-smokers (p=0.01), males (p=0.01), those with a history of corticosteroid use in the preceding year (p=0.01), and current users of immunosuppressants (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Risedronate, in addition to daily calcium and vitamin D supplementation, is superior to calcium and vitamin D alone in improving femoral trochanter and total hip BMD in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) mediate pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation. We characterized the role of the gelatinase (GelE), a metalloprotease from Enterococcus faecalis, in the development of colitis in mice. METHODS: Germ-free, interleukin-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) mice were monoassociated with the colitogenic E faecalis strain OG1RF and isogenic, GelE-mutant strains. Barrier function was determined by measuring E-cadherin expression, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), and translocation of permeability markers in colonic epithelial cells and colon segments from IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice. GelE specificity was shown with the MMP inhibitor marimastat. RESULTS: Histologic analysis (score 0-4) of E faecalis monoassociated IL-10(-/-) mice revealed a significant reduction in colonic tissue inflammation in the absence of bacteria-derived GelE. We identified cleavage sites for GelE in the sequence of recombinant mouse E-cadherin, indicating that it might be degraded by GelE. Experiments with Ussing chambers and purified GelE revealed the loss of barrier function and extracellular E-cadherin in mice susceptible to intestinal inflammation (IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice) before inflammation developed. Colonic epithelial cells had reduced TER and increased translocation of permeability markers after stimulation with GelE from OG1RF or strains of E faecalis isolated from patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: The metalloprotease GelE, produced by commensal strains of E faecalis, contributes to development of chronic intestinal inflammation in mice that are susceptible to intestinal inflammation (IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice) by impairing epithelial barrier integrity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease, a chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, presents in two variations, Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Given that treatment of CD differs from UC, a single test that provided strong diagnostic ability would offer great clinical value. Two previous studies have indicated that CD can be distinguished from UC, and that both can be distinguished from non-IBD-type gastrointestinal disease, based on urinary and faecal metabolite profiling. METHODS: Analysis of healthy as well as CD and UC patients attending an IBD clinic was performed. IBD patients were classified into two groups (CD or UC) based on chart review of clinical, endoscopic, and histological assessment. Urine samples were obtained and analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with targeted profiling techniques, followed by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: Based on urinary metabolomics, individuals with IBD could be differentiated from healthy. Major differences between IBD and healthy included TCA cycle intermediates, amino acids, and gut microflora metabolites. Comparison of CD and UC patients revealed discrimination, but removal of patients with the surgical intervention confounder revealed that CD could not be discriminated from UC. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential for metabolomics to distinguish IBD from the healthy state but shows that careful consideration must be given to establishing disease-representative cohorts that are free of confounding factors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vitamin D deficiency impacts on bone health and has potential new roles in inflammation. We aimed to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for vitamin D deficiency and to explore vitamin D supplement usage in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in an outpatient setting, compared with controls. METHODS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay in 151 participants, comprising 81 CD patients and 70 age-, sex- and socio-economic status-matched healthy controls. Levels of 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L were classed as deficient. Data on vitamin supplement usage were recorded for all participants at interview. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency was common in patients with CD (63%) and significantly higher in winter than summer (68% v 50%; p<0.001, chi(2)). Notably, the deficiency rate remained high even in summer (50%). On regression analysis, 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with winter season. Disease-specific factors for lower serum 25(OH)D levels were longer disease duration and smoking. Overall, 43% of patients reported using a vitamin D-containing supplement, primarily at low dosages (200-400 IU/d); however, this level of supplement did not prevent deficiency. For the majority of CD patients, 25(OH)D remained below optimal levels proposed to confer bone and immune health benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency was common in patients with CD and associated with longstanding disease, smoking and winter. While over 40% of patients used a vitamin D-containing supplement, the dosages were inadequate to prevent deficiency. Appropriate vitamin D screening and supplementation should be considered in the context of health promotion of outpatients with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration currently approves three types of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) therapy for treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease. There are no guidelines to clarify which of the drugs may be better suited to individual clinical scenarios. AIMS: We gathered national data on the prescribing pattern, comfort levels, and algorithms gastroenterologists use for management of their biologic-requiring Crohn's disease patients. METHODS: An internet survey was mailed to members of the American Gastroenterology Association. Responses were separated into "non-expert" and "expert" physician groups on the basis of whether a practice consisted of >50% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We compared experts with non-experts with regard to the use of the three anti-TNF agents, attitudes regarding their relative efficacy, and their experience with adverse events. RESULTS: Of 3,990 eligible gastroenterologists, 473 replied in full (11.9%). Sixty (12.6%) respondents met the criterion for IBD expert physician. Experts were comfortable using both immunomodulators and anti-TNFalpha therapy. Community physicians were equally comfortable prescribing 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, infliximab, and adalimumab, but less comfortable than experts with methotrexate (56 vs. 86%, P<0.05) and certolizumab (68 vs. 89%, P<0.05). Expert physicians were much more likely to have encountered adverse reactions to anti-TNFalpha therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that experts are more comfortable using a broader array of medical therapy than non-expert physicians. Although both groups had similar concerns regarding side-effects of anti-TNFalpha therapy, expert physicians were much more likely to have managed a broad range of complications in their patient population.},

To identify published studies, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, The Cochrane Library, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 2009 (January) to 2011 (October). We also searched the US Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research website for additional unpublished data, requested dossiers of information from pharmaceutical manufacturers, and retrieved relevant citations from reference lists of included studies. Study selection, data abstraction, validity assessment, grading the strength of the evidence, and data synthesis were all carried out according to our standard review methods. Overall, targeted immune modulators are highly effective medications for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and plaque psoriasis that substantially improve the burden of disease and are generally safe for short-term treatment. For rheumatoid arthritis, low-and moderate-strength evidence indicated that some targeted immune modulators are more efficacious than others. These results were based on three head-to-head trials, several large observational studies, and indirect comparisons of placebo-controlled trials. The evidence is currently insufficient to reliably determine the comparative effectiveness for other indications and in subgroups. Low-strength evidence indicated that serious infections are less common with abatacept than the other drugs and that the rate of adverse events is greater with infliximab than adalimumab or etanercept. Likewise, more patients receiving infliximab withdrew due to adverse events than abatacept, adalimumab, etanercept, and golimumab. Infusion or allergic reactions contributed to the difference in risk.},

   abstract = {Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb) is a probiotic yeast that has demonstrated efficacy in pilot studies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Microbial antigen handling by dendritic cells (DC) is believed to be of critical importance for immunity and tolerance in IBD. The aim was to characterize the effects of Sb on DC from IBD patients. Highly purified (>95%), lipopolysaccharide-stimulated CD1c(+)CD11c(+)CD123(-) myeloid DC (mDC) from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 36), Crohn's disease (CD; n = 26), or infectious controls (IC; n = 4) were cultured in the presence or absence of fungal supernatant from Sb (SbS). Phenotype and cytokine production and/or secretion of IBD mDC were measured by flow cytometry and cytometric bead arrays, respectively. T cell phenotype and proliferation were assessed in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) with allogenic CD4(+)CD45RA(+) naive T cells from healthy donors. Mucosal healing was investigated in epithelial wounding and migration assays with IEC-6 cells. SbS significantly decreased the frequency of CD40-, CD80-, and CD197 (CCR7; chemokine receptor-7)-expressing IBD mDC and reduced their secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 while increasing IL-8. In the MLR, SbS significantly inhibited T cell proliferation induced by IBD mDC. Moreover, SbS inhibited T(H)1 (TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma) polarization induced by UC mDC and promoted IL-8 and transforming growth factor-beta-dependent mucosal healing. In summary, we provide novel evidence of synergistic mechanisms how Sb controls inflammation (inhibition of T cell costimulation and inflammation-associated migration and mobilization of DC) and promotes epithelial restitution relevant in IBD.},

   abstract = {Mycobacteria have thwarted detection by scientists for centuries. Mycobacterium paratuberculosis is one of the most fastidious of the Mycobacteriaceae, and has been implicated in both animal and human diseases. In domestic livestock, M. paratuberculosis has been associated with Johne's disease, which given its increasing incidence, is currently a cause for concern, due to the potential for M. paratuberculosis to enter our food chain. In addition, a tenuous link has been reported between M. paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease, however evidence to support this link is hampered by the lack of accurate methodologies for detection of M. paratuberculosis in humans. This review compares the sensitivity and specificity of traditional and more recent techniques to the culture and molecular detection of M. paratuberculosis. While serology and culture are popular choices for the livestock industry they have not produced useful data for human infection. Although the advent of molecular biology has enabled faster diagnosis of M. paratuberculosis in human infection, there is currently no gold standard such as culture on which to validate these findings. Even with DNA/RNA detection methods, there is the ever present issue of the genetic relatedness of M. paratuberculosis to other mycobacteria of the Mycobacterium avium complex, some of which also infect humans with very different pathological outcomes. Recent developments in this field include more rapid methods of M. paratuberculosis culture as well as the development of more accurate and sensitive PCR assays. The application of these techniques should offer a greater insight as to the role of M. paratuberculosis in human gastrointestinal diseases.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a first-line treatment in children with active Crohn's disease (CD) but is seldom used in adults with active disease. The mode of action of EEN in suppressing mucosal inflammation is not fully understood, but modulation of intestinal microflora activity is one possible explanation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 6-week EEN in children with active CD, with special reference to intestinal microflora function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fecal samples from 18 children (11 boys, 7 girls; median age 13.5 years) with active CD (13 children with small bowel/colonic and 5 with perianal disease) were analyzed for short chain fatty acid (SCFA) pattern as marker of gut microflora function. The children were studied before and after EEN treatment. Results from 12 healthy teenagers were used for comparison. RESULTS: Eleven (79%) of the children with small bowel/colonic CD responded clinically positively to EEN treatment showing decreased levels of pro-inflammatory acetic acid as well as increased concentrations of anti-inflammatory butyric acids and also of valeric acids, similar to the levels in healthy age-matched children. In children with active perianal CD, however, EEN had no positive effect on clinical status or inflammatory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The authors present new data supporting the hypothesis that the well-documented anti-inflammatory effect of EEN in children with active small bowel/colonic CD is brought about by modulation of gut microflora activity, resulting in an anti-inflammatory SCFA pattern. By contrast, none of the children with perianal disease showed clinical or biochemical improvement after EEN treatment.},

   abstract = {The gut of a healthy adult harbours a myriad of different microbial species. It is estimated that approximately 10 14 are present in total bacterial colony forming units (CFU). Each colony colonizes a specific intestinal tract. In healthy adult, the main control of intestinal bacterial colonization occurs through gastric acidity but also other factors can influence the intestinal microenvironment such as pH, temperature, competition among different bacterial strains, peristalsis, drugs, radiotherapy and much more. Impaired microbial homeostasis leads to an alteration of the permeability of tissue, together with the activation of the intestinal immune system MALT (mucosal associated lymphoid tissue). In this regard we discuss the increasing experimental evidences of the role of commensal microbiota in the activation of specific intestinal immunocompetent cells. The aforementioned micro-environmental changes provide the substrate for the etiopathogenetic outbreak of numerous pathologies of gastro-intestinal tract, such as intestinal chronic inflammation (Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis), together with a miscellany of extra intestinal disorders. This article is an overview of the latest scientific findings about the close causal relationship between intestinal microbial flora and inflammatory bowel diseases or other extra-intestinal diseases; it is also mentioned the possible relationship between mycobacteria and Chron's disease. Finally we analyse the beneficial role of probiotics.},

METHODS: Eight patients with Crohn's disease in remission were studied. They followed a strict diet during phase I. Then, provocations with two, three-day periods (phases II and III) followed: in phase II, pure forms of foods with high IgG antibodies and in phase III, off-the-shelf forms of those foods were added. Stool samples were collected for fecal calprotectin assay. Blood samples were taken on the 11th and 17th days for highly sensitive C-reactive protein, ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cells, and platelets. Patients kept a diet-symptom diary. RESULTS: Increased Crohn's disease activity index scores were found statistically significant (p=0.012) between pre- and during the provocation weeks. There were significant increases according to Harvey-Bradshaw Index when the highest values during the phases I, II (p=0.027) and I, III (p=0.027) were compared. The increases in highly sensitive C-reactive protein (p=0.025) and white blood cells (p= 0.036) were found statistically significant. Fecal calprotectin levels showed day-to-day variability. When compared, the levels of fecal calprotectin increased in all patients on the last day of the restriction (10th day) and the first day of the provocation (11th day) with the exception of one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Foods with raised IgG antibody levels and food additives can provoke the symptoms and may stimulate the inflammation in patients with Crohn's disease. Addition of a proper diet with restriction of those foods may be beneficial in the medical treatment.},

METHODS: In all, 98 consecutive adult patients (age 25-55 years) with CD (n = 70) and UC (n = 28) were enrolled and assessed at three timepoints over 1 year. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in levels of homocysteine, B vitamins, or dietary intake by disease type, disease activity, or across visits. 13% of all inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients had elevated homocysteine at least once during the study. Nine patients with CD had fluctuating homocysteine levels during the study but these were inconsistent, ranging from within normal range to elevated levels in any individual. Six of these nine patients were persistently in remission. 30% of all IBD patients had vitamin B6 deficiency, 11% had vitamin B12 deficiency, and one patient (CD) had folate deficiency. All vitamins showed a significant correlation between intake and serum levels (B6; r = 0.46, P < 0.001, B12; r = 0.42, P < 0.001, and folate; r = 0.26, P = 0.008). There was an inverse relationship between serum homocysteine in the blood and serum vitamin B12 (r = -0.241, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Serum homocysteine was mostly normal in patients with IBD and changed minimally over time. There was no association between disease activity and elevation of serum homocysteine. 30% of patients have vitamin B6 deficiency but vitamin B6 is not associated with elevated homocysteine. The routine measurement of homocysteine is not warranted.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Up to 75% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) will have intestinal resection during their life. Most patients will, however, develop postoperative recurrence (endoscopic, clinical or surgical). Several medical and surgical strategies have been attempted to prevent postoperative recurrence. This review evaluates the efficacy of different drug regimens and surgical techniques in the prevention of clinical, endoscopic and surgical postoperative recurrence of CD. METHODS: A literature search for randomized controlled trials on medical or surgical interventions was performed. The endpoints for efficacy were clinical, endoscopic and surgical recurrence. Meta-analyses were performed in case two or more RCTs evaluated the same drug or surgical technique. RESULTS: Mesalamine is more effective in preventing clinical recurrence than placebo (P=0,012), as well as nitroimidazolic antibiotics at one year follow-up (P<0.001) and thiopurines (P=0.018). Nitroimidazolic antibiotics are also more effective than placebo in preventing endoscopic recurrence (P=0.037), as well as thiopurines (P=0.015) and infliximab (P=0.006). Budenoside, probiotics, Interleukin-10 nor any of the different surgical procedures showed any significant difference compared to placebo in postoperative recurrence rates of CD. CONCLUSION: Among the different drug regimens and surgical techniques, only thiopurines and nitroimidazolic antibiotics are able to reduce postoperative clinical as well as endoscopic recurrence of CD. Mesalamine and infliximab also seem to be superior to placebo in preventing clinical recurrence and endoscopic recurrence, respectively. There is a paucity of trials evaluating long-term follow-up and prevention of surgical recurrence of CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present qualitative study was to develop the items and support the content validity for the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module for pediatric patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and organic GI diseases, hereafter referred to as GI disorders. METHODS: The iterative process included multiphase qualitative methods. A literature review of GI disorders was conducted to generate domains for the focus interviews. Six pediatric gastroenterologists with extensive clinical experience in GI disorders provided expert opinion regarding the conceptual framework. A total of 98 participants, 46 pediatric patients ages 5 to 18, and 52 parents of patients ages 2 to 18 with physician-diagnosed GI disorders (chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease [Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis], gastroesophageal reflux disease), participated in the focus interviews and cognitive interviewing phases, including think-aloud and cognitive debriefing protocols. RESULTS: Eleven domains were derived from the qualitative methods involving patient and parent interviews and expert opinion, with content saturation achieved, resulting in 76 items. The 11 domains consisted of items measuring stomach pain, stomach upset, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, gas and bloating, constipation, diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods involving pediatric patients and their parents in the item generation process support the content validity for the new PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module. The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module is undergoing national multisite field testing as the next iterative phase.},

   abstract = {Vitamins are micronutrient chemical compounds that cannot be synthesized by an organism but are essential for human metabolism and life. They act as required intermediaries, cofactors or coenzymes in many of the reactions of normal metabolism. In addition, anti-inflammatory effects have been reported for specific vitamins. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), vitamin deficiency is often due to malnutrition (due to a decreased food intake) or malabsorption (due to inflamed, malfunctioning mucosa and diarrhea) which results in anemia. Vitamin B(12) and folic acid supplementation may be necessary in IBD patients, especially those with Crohn's disease (CD) with either inflammation of the terminal ileum or after resection of the terminal ileum. It is also recommended during therapy with sulfasalazine as this compound inhibits the absorption of vitamin B(12). Patients with high or continuous inflammatory CD activity and frequent therapy with steroids have an increased risk of low bone mineral density and vitamin D deficiency. These should be monitored regularly and vitamin D should be supplemented. In a recent trial, a trend towards a reduced risk of relapses in CD patients treated with vitamin D was reported. Only limited studies and case reports exist on other vitamin deficiencies, e.g. vitamins A, B(1), B(2), niacin, B(6), C, E and K, found in IBD patients. These are summarized in this review. Regular nutritional monitoring in IBD patients is warranted and requires the special attention of treating physicians and dieticians.},

With recent evidence implicating a disruption in the balance of the gastrointestinal microbiome and intestinal immunity as a potential trigger for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there has been growing interest in using probiotics as an adjunct to standard anti-inflammatory and immune suppressing therapy. Animal models describe potential and plausible mechanisms of action for probiotics to counter inflammation of colonic mucosa. Although there are insufficient data to recommend probiotics in ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, good evidence supports the use of specific probiotics for maintenance of remission in pouchitis. Although there are limited regulatory standards for the agents, probiotics are relatively safe with minimal reported side effects or contraindications. More rigorous studies need to be published supporting efficacy and safety of these agents before they become a mainstay of IBD medical treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is used to describe a state of idiopathic, chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The two main phenotypes of IBD are Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The major cause of IBD-associated mortality is colorectal cancer. Although both host-genetic and exogenous factors have been found to be involved, the aetiology of IBD is still not well understood. In this study we characterized thirteen Escherichia coli strains from patients with IBD by comparative genomic hybridization employing a microarray based on 31 sequenced E. coli genomes from a wide range of commensal and pathogenic isolates. RESULTS: The IBD isolates, obtained from patients with UC and CD, displayed remarkably heterogeneous genomic profiles with little or no evidence of group-specific determinants. No IBD-specific genes were evident when compared with the prototypic CD isolate, LF82, suggesting that the IBD-inducing effect of the strains is multifactorial. Several of the IBD isolates carried a number of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC)-related virulence determinants such as the pap, sfa, cdt and hly genes. The isolates were also found to carry genes of ExPEC-associated genomic islands. CONCLUSIONS: Combined, these data suggest that E. coli isolates obtained from UC and CD patients represents a heterogeneous population of strains, with genomic profiles that are indistinguishable to those of ExPEC isolates. Our findings indicate that IBD-induction from E. coli strains is multifactorial and that a range of gene products may be involved in triggering the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the current literature concerning the medical treatment of acute and chronic pouchitis. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched (both 1965-February 2011) using the following terms: pouchitis, Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment. Bibliographies from key articles were also searched, and all pertinent articles were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All available primary literature published in English on treatment for pouchitis was considered, with controlled trials receiving highest priority. DATA SYNTHESIS: Pouchitis occurs in up to 50% of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) patients with inflammatory bowel disease within 10 years of the procedure. Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, and fecal incontinence with frequent diarrhea. The diagnosis of pouchitis is usually made based on symptoms as well as endoscopic and histologic findings. Treatment of acute pouchitis includes antimicrobials such as ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and rifaximin. If these fail, limited data suggest that oral budesonide, mesalamine, or infliximab may be effective treatments. Surgical revision may be necessary if medical treatments fail. Emerging evidence suggests that the probiotic compound VSL#3 may be effective in preventing the recurrence of pouchitis. CONCLUSIONS: Pouchitis is a common complication of IPAA surgery. The strongest data suggest that antimicrobial therapy is an effective first-line treatment for acute pouchitis, and VSL#3 may be effective for prevention of recurrence.},

   abstract = {In patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), malnutrition is frequently observed and is an important complication, frequently associated with nutritional deficiencies, especially vitamins (both water- and fat-soluble) and essential trace elements. It is often a result of the disease activity, poor oral intake and/or restrictive diets. Nutrition plays an important role in disease management and helps to maintain remission in CD patients. Deficiencies occur in patients with active Crohn's disease, and also in those in remission. Specific supplementation of vitamins and micro- and macronutrients might be helpful or even necessary in this group of patients. This review outlines the most frequent nutritional deficiencies and their complications in relation to the Crohn's Disease Activity Index, and provides an overview of therapeutic perspectives for CD patients in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Biological therapy, which is being used with increasing frequency, seems not only to mitigate the inflammatory process in the gastrointestinal tract, but also has significant impact on the nutritional status of patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective method of treatment in achieving remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. The objective of our study was to assess the influence of EEN on serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in children and adolescents with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine children and adolescents with IBD (24 with Crohn disease [CD] and 15 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 25 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. VEGF and TGF-beta1 were assessed at the baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of EEN in CD and UC groups and once in controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoassays. RESULTS: At the baseline, we found increased serum VEGF in the CD versus UC group and controls (P < 0.05) and serum TGF-beta1 in the UC versus CD group and controls (P < 0.05). During EEN, VEGF decreased in the UC and CD groups, whereas TGF-beta1 increased in the CD group and decreased in the UC group. The CD group achieved disease remission faster than the UC group, and the weight gain of patients with CD during EEN was higher compared with patients with UC. Additionally, TGF-beta1 concentration correlated with protein and energies daily intake in the CD group (R = 0.95; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different effectiveness of EEN in achieving remission in CD and UC may result from a modification of growth factor production. EEN stimulated TGF-beta1 production in CD but not in UC, which possibly resulted in higher effectiveness of EEN in this group of patients.},

The SenseWearPro(2) armband allows to measure physical activity under everyday life conditions. METHODS: Thirty-nine IBD patients (27 Crohn's disease, 12 ulcerative colitis, 24 boys) in remission (n=26) or with only mild disease activity (n=13) were compared to 39 healthy age and sex-matched controls. Body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), lean body mass as phase angle alpha (determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis), and dynamometric grip force were expressed as age- and sex-related Z-scores. SenseWearPro(2) armbands were applied for three consecutive days to record number of steps, duration of physical activity and sleeping time. Quality of life was assessed with the German KINDL and IMPACT III questionnaires, energy intake with prospective food protocols. Differences between patients and pair-matched controls were analysed by paired t-test. RESULTS: Patients showed lower Z-scores for phase angle alpha (difference -0.72; 95% CI [-1.10; -0.34]) and lower grip strength (-1.02 [-1.58; -0.47]) than controls. They tended towards lesser number of steps per day (-1339 [-2760; 83]) and shorter duration of physical activity (-0.44 h [-0.94; 0.06]), particularly in females and patients with mild disease. Quality of life and energy intake did not differ between patients and controls. CONCLUSION: In spite of quiescent disease lean body mass and physical activity were reduced. Interventions to encourage physical activity may be beneficial in this lifelong disease.},

This study aimed to ascertain the protocols currently utilized in different pediatric centers around the world and to highlight their similarities and differences. METHODS: A questionnaire was circulated to individuals at pediatric centers in countries in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific. Respondents were asked to indicate the number of children treated with EEN at their centers in the previous years and to provide details of their protocol used for administering EEN to these children. RESULTS: Responses were received from 35 separate centers (42% of those asked). The duration of EEN varied from <6 weeks to >12 weeks, but was most commonly 6 to 8 weeks. Although 23 different formulas were utilized across the centers, most (90%) used polymeric formulas. Flavourings were commonly added to formulas but wide variations existed between centers with the prescription of food and fluids permitted during the EEN period. The reintroduction of food after EEN also varied greatly: the most common recommendations were for an initial low-fiber diet (26%) or the gradual introduction of food quantity as the formula volume decreased (52%). CONCLUSIONS: This questionnaire-based study has shown the wide variations in EEN protocols used in different areas of the world. The development of consistent protocols may enhance the acceptance, efficacy and wider utilization of this therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research in the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) supports anti-inflammatory benefits of n-3 fatty acids from fish oil, prebiotics, and antioxidants. A nutritionally balanced inflammatory bowel disease nutrition formula (IBDNF) enriched with these compounds has the potential to improve nutrition status and disease activity in CD. METHODS: This is an open-label pilot study investigating the effects of IBDNF on nutrition status in CD patients. Twenty-eight patients with active CD on stable medication were asked to consume 16 oz of IBDNF/d for 4 months. Nutrition status was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans and serum micronutrient levels. Disease activity and quality of life were measured using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). RESULTS: Twenty patients completed the final visit. After 4 months, there was a significant decrease in plasma phospholipid levels of arachidonic acid with increases in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid. Ten patients had a final EPA concentration of >2%. There was improvement in fat-free and fat mass in patients with final EPA >2% (P = .014 and P = .05). Vitamin D (25-OH) levels improved in all patients (18.5-25.9 ng/mL, P < .001). Those with EPA >2% had significantly lower CDAI (116 +/- 94.5 vs 261.8 +/- 86.5; P = .005) and higher IBDQ (179.1 +/- 26.6 vs 114.6 +/- 35.9, P < .001) compared to those with EPA <2%. CONCLUSIONS: IBDNF has the potential to deposit fat-free and fat mass, improve vitamin D status, and improve quality of life in CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To investigate the clinical effect of treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (Probio-Tec AB-25) to maintain remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis in remission - including proctitis and at least one relapse within the last year were randomised (2:1) in a double-blind placebo-controlled study to Probio-Tec AB-25 or placebo for 52 weeks. The patients were evaluated clinically, endoscopically and histologically at entry and if relapsing. No other medication for ulcerative colitis than the study drug was allowed during the study. Primary endpoint was maintenance of clinical remission, secondary endpoints comparisons of days to relapse, and safety and tolerability of the study drug. The concentrations of the probiotic bacterial strains in stool were analysed in a subset of patients. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were randomised. Twenty patients received Probio-Tec AB-25 and twelve patients received placebo. Five patients (25%) in the Probio-Tec AB-25 group and one patient (8%) in the placebo group maintained remission after 1 year of treatment (p=0.37). The median time to relapse was 125.5days (range 11-391 days) in the probiotic group and 104 days (range 28-369 days) in the placebo group respectively, (p=0.683). Probio-Tec AB-25 was overall well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In this small randomised placebo-controlled trial no significant clinical benefit of Probio-Tec AB-25 could be demonstrated in comparison with placebo for maintaining remission in patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis. A difference may be achieved in larger studies, but the clinical significance of this would be questionable. This study was registered in ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT00268164).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is administered subcutaneously to Crohn's Disease (CD) patients. There are very few studies evaluating the use of oral (PO) MTX in CD. A drug and its pharmaceutical alternative are equivalent (bioequivalence) when the bioavailability of the alternative falls within 80-125% of the bioavailability of the standard (US Food and Drug Administration - FDA). AIM: To compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of PO and subcutaneous (SC) MTX in CD patients to determine the bioequivalence of these two routes. METHODS: Eleven patients received a PO and an SC MTX dose (25 mg) separated by one week over a two-week interval. Blood samples were collected at specified times over a 24-h period for each patient on two separate days. MTX plasma levels were obtained using sensitive mass spectrometry. Areas under the curve (AUC) were compared between the two routes. RESULTS: The mean AUC values were 3375 ng/mL x h (PO MTX) and 3985 ng/mL x h (SC MTX). The mean AUC ratio (PO/SC) was 0.86 (0.62-1.08). This correlates with a relative PO bioavailability of 86% in comparison to SC. The 90% confidence interval for the mean AUC (PO/SC) ratio is (0.785, 0.929). There were no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The mean MTX AUC (PO/SC) in these patients falls outside the 90% confidence interval for the bioequivalence limit. SC MTX is more bioavailable than PO MTX; however, the mean relative MTX bioavailability (PO/SC) nearly met the FDA bioequivalence standard and PO MTX could be proposed in responders who would prefer this route.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of enteral nutrition (EN) as a maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) patients following surgery. METHODS: This study was an extension of our previous study to prolong the duration of intervention and follow-up from 1 to 5 years. Forty consecutive patients who underwent resection for ileal or ileocolic CD were included. Following surgery, 20 patients received continuous elemental diet infusion during the nighttime plus a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group). Another 20 patients received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (control group). All patients were followed for 5 years after operation. No patient received corticosteroid, immunosuppressants, or infliximab except patients who developed recurrence. The end point of this study was recurrence requiring biologic therapy or reoperation. Recurrence rates were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: In the EN group, four patients could not continue tube intubation for elemental diet intake. Two patients (10 %) in the EN group and nine patients (45 %) in the control group developed recurrence requiring infliximab therapy (P = 0.03). The cumulative recurrence incidence rate requiring infliximab was significantly lower in the EN group vs the control group (P = 0.02). One patient (5 %) in the EN group and five patients (25 %) in the control group required reoperation for recurrence (P = 0.18). The cumulative incidence of reoperation was lower in the EN group vs the control group, the difference not being significant (P = 0.08). CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study suggest that EN therapy reduces the incidence of postoperative CD recurrence.},

   abstract = {The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex and abundant microbial community reaching as high as 10(13)-10(14) microorganisms in the colon. This endogenous microbiota forms a symbiotic relationship with their eukaryotic host and this close partnership helps maintain homeostasis by performing essential and non-redundant tasks (e.g. nutrition/energy and, immune system balance, pathogen exclusion). Although this relationship is essential and beneficial to the host, various events (e.g. infection, diet, stress, inflammation) may impact microbial composition, leading to the formation of a dysbiotic microbiota, further impacting on health and disease states. For example, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively termed inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have been associated with the establishment of a dysbiotic microbiota. In addition, extra-intestinal disorders such as obesity and metabolic syndrome are also associated with the development of a dysbiotic microbiota. Consequently, there is an increasing interest in harnessing the power of the microbiome and modulating its composition as a means to alleviate intestinal pathologies/disorders and maintain health status. In this review, we will discuss the emerging relationship between the microbiota and development of colorectal cancer as well as present evidence that microbial manipulation (probiotic, prebiotic) impacts disease development.},
