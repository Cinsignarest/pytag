   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD) seems to be a common disorder in north Africa; however, to our knowledge no data are yet available on its prevalence in Egypt. This study was undertaken to investigate the frequency of CD in Egyptian children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated a sample of the general pediatric population (1500 individuals, 656 girls and 844 boys, age range 7 months to 18 years, median age 8.0 years) (group A); 150 children (age range 6 months to 13 years, median age 16 months) admitted for diarrhea or failure to thrive (group B); and 250 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (group C). The screening test was serum class A anti-transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody; immunoglobulin A (IgA) antiendomysium, total IgA, and IgG anti-tTG, and small bowel biopsy was performed for confirmation of diagnosis. RESULTS: In group A, 8 of 1500 children fulfilled the criteria for CD diagnosis; the prevalence of CD was at least 1 in 187 individuals (0.53%; 95% CI 0.17%-0.89%). In group B, 7 of 150 children had CD (4.7%, 95% CI 1.4-7.9). In group C, 16 of 250 sera showed positive results to both the IgA anti-tTG and the IgA antiendomysium test (6.4%; 95% CI 3.4-9.4). CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is a frequent disorder among Egyptian children, both in the general population and in at-risk groups. Therefore, our data do not support the theory of a Middle East-Europe CD prevalence gradient secondary to the pattern of agriculture spreading from the so-called Fertile Crescent.},

   abstract = {This position paper on complementary feeding summarizes evidence for health effects of complementary foods. It focuses on healthy infants in Europe. After reviewing current knowledge and practices, we have formulated these conclusions: Exclusive or full breast-feeding for about 6 months is a desirable goal. Complementary feeding (ie, solid foods and liquids other than breast milk or infant formula and follow-on formula) should not be introduced before 17 weeks and not later than 26 weeks. There is no convincing scientific evidence that avoidance or delayed introduction of potentially allergenic foods, such as fish and eggs, reduces allergies, either in infants considered at increased risk for the development of allergy or in those not considered to be at increased risk. During the complementary feeding period, >90% of the iron requirements of a breast-fed infant must be met by complementary foods, which should provide sufficient bioavailable iron. Cow's milk is a poor source of iron and should not be used as the main drink before 12 months, although small volumes may be added to complementary foods. It is prudent to avoid both early (<4 months) and late (>or=7 months) introduction of gluten, and to introduce gluten gradually while the infant is still breast-fed, inasmuch as this may reduce the risk of celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and wheat allergy. Infants and young children receiving a vegetarian diet should receive a sufficient amount ( approximately 500 mL) of breast milk or formula and dairy products. Infants and young children should not be fed a vegan diet.},

   abstract = {Bread is a traditional food generally prepared from wheat flour. The main wheat component responsible for bread quality is gluten, which is an essential structure-binding protein. Although important, this protein can cause health problems in predisposed individuals, and is avoided in the diet of celiac disease patients. As diagnosis methods are improved, revealing the high incidence of gluten-intolerance in the western world, the demand for novel, nutritious and high-quality gluten-free foods also ascends. However, for the production of gluten-free breads the absence of gluten is critical and challenging in regards to the bread structure. Various gluten-free formulations have applied hydrocolloids to mimic the viscoelastic properties of gluten. They comprise a number of water-soluble polysaccharides with varied chemical structures providing a range of functional properties that make them suitable to this application. This paper reviews some actual facts about celiac disease and focuses on the reported applications of hydrocolloids in gluten-free breads.},

The study comprised 33 patients with celiac disease and 35 pediatric patients undergoing endoscopy for other causes. Biopsy specimens were reanalyzed for (1) intraepithelial lymphocytes, (2) goblet cells, (3) villous height, and (4) villous/crypt ratio. The morphometric parameters of the patients were compared with controls. Then celiac patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of total villous atrophy and clinical and laboratory findings were compared. Histologic examination revealed that goblet cells, villus height, and villous/crypt ratio were significantly lower and intraepithelial lymphocytes were significantly higher in celiac patients. Cutoff values for intraepithelial lymphocytes and goblet cells in celiac patients were 31/100 and 7.8/100 epithelial cells, respectively. Moreover, for villus height and villous/crypt ratio, cutoff values were 633 microm and 0.72, respectively. Serum folic acid and vitamin B(12) levels were significantly lower in patients with total villous atrophy and were positively correlated with the severity of villous atrophy. We suggest that morphologic examination and laboratory data are important for definitive diagnosis. Villous/crypt ratio is the most sensitive and specific parameter, and intraepithelial lymphocytes may be used along with villous/crypt ratio, especially in the early phase. Folic acid and vitamin B(12) levels are good indicators of villous atrophy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in children with celiac disease (CD) and to examine the role of H. pylori infection in clinical, laboratory and histopathological presentations of CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data on 96 children with CD and 235 children who underwent endoscopy were compared for the prevalence and gastric histology pattern of H. pylori. Clinical presentation, laboratory and histological findings of CD children with and without H. pylori infection were compared. RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects (21.8%) in the CD group and 56 subjects (23.8%) in the control group had H. pylori gastritis. Gastric metaplasia is higher in CD patients with H. pylori gastritis (19%) than in patients without H. pylori gastritis (1.3%) and in the control group (3.5%) (p<0.05 for all groups). Abdominal distension is more common at initial admission in CD patients with H. pylori gastritis (57.1% versus 14.6%, p<0.05). No significant difference was found between H. pylori (+) and (-) CD patients in terms of prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. Only mild duodenal histological findings were more common in H. pylori patients (57.1% versus 26.7%, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CD may be associated with H. pylori gastritis, but it does not affect the clinical presentation of the disease, except for abdominal distension; CD is associated with mild duodenal lesions. A gluten-free diet improves the symptoms in all patients independently of the presence of H. pylori gastritis. Gastric metaplasia increases in the presence of H. pylori gastritis. Further prospective studies are needed to examine the clinical and histopathological outcomes of gastric metaplasia associated with H. pylori gastritis in CD patients.},

   abstract = {We sought to analyze the long-term growth in children with celiac disease (CD) as well as the association of height and weight SD score at the end of 4 years with the demographic and clinical presentation at initial admission. Thirty-four children with CD were enrolled in the study and followed for at least 4 years. Patients were divided into three groups (Group 1: patients <or=5 years old, Group 2: patients 5-10 years old, and Group 3: patients >10 years, at the time of diagnosis). Patients' charts were reviewed for demographic and clinical features at initial admission. Anthropometric measurements at initial admission, at 6th months, and 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years were recorded. Gluten-free diet led to rapid increase in weight SD and height SD score in patients <or=5 years old at the time of diagnosis (Group 1). Increment in height SD score was the highest in patients 5-10 years old (Group 2) at the end of 4 years. A negative correlation was found between age at the time of diagnosis and weight and height SD score at the end of 4 years (r = -0.503, P = 0.03 and r = -0.554, P = 0.01). Multiple regression analysis revealed that height SD score at the end of the 4 years was associated with age at the time of diagnosis. The other factors had no effect on the weight and height SD score at the end of 4 years. Early diagnosis and good adhesion to a gluten-free diet are essential for long-term growth in CD. Celiac societies and the mass media must expand an effort to educate the community regarding the symptoms of the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficiency of determining IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies (IgA- and IgG-AGA, respectively), antitransglutaminase (TgA), and anti-endomysial antibodies (AEA) in human umbilical cord (CO) and monkey esophagus for diagnosis of celiac disease; to determine the correlation between serological markers and celiac disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 400 patients were divided in 3 groups: group 1 with 37 patients with celiac disease, group 2 with 208 patients with no enteropathies, and group 3 with 155 patients with other enteropathies. IgA-AGA, IgG-AGA, and TgA were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas AEA was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of IgA-AGA were 81.1% and 95.2%, of IgG-AGA 89.2% and 95.2%, of TgA 83.9% and 96.8%, of AEA-CO 87.9% and 100%, and of AEA of monkey esophagus 88.6% and 100%, respectively. Positive predictive values were 75.0%, 76.7%, 83.9%, and 100%. Negative predictive values were 96.6%, 98.0%, 96.8%, and 97.7% for IgA-AGA, IgG-AGA, TgA, and AEA, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed a strong association between AEA-CO and celiac disease and a good correlation with other markers (TgA, IgA-AGA, and IgG-AGA). CONCLUSIONS: TgA has been recommended for screening patients with celiac disease. Considering the similar sensitivity and specificity of IgA-AGA and TgA and their correlations in the multivariate analysis, both are applicable for this purpose. However, because TgA tests are highly costly and celiac disease is associated with IgA deficiency, the determination of IgA-AGA and IgG-AGA, followed by AEA-CO, is suitable for screening in developing countries, provided a cutoff point for these examinations is established. The results of antiendomysial antibodies in umbilical cord overlapped those in monkey esophagus. Therefore, umbilical cord should be used as a substrate instead of specimens from endangered species.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a digestive disease, considered as an autoimmune disorder, that damages the small intestine and interferes with absorption of nutrients. Individuals affected by celiac disease cannot tolerate a protein called gluten, present in wheat, rye, and barley, but also in other common products such as stamp and envelope adhesive, medicines, and vitamins. Celiac disease is a genetic condition that is triggered--or becomes active for the first time--after surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, viral infection, or severe emotional stress. Symptoms may occur in the digestive system, or in other parts of the body. Diagnosis involves blood tests and a biopsy of the small intestine. Recent findings estimate that about 2 million people in the United States have celiac disease, or about 1 in 133 people, as in Europe. Recent studies have shown that it may be more common in Africa, South America, and Asia than previously believed. The only treatment for celiac disease is to follow a gluten-free diet. Various other approaches are being studied that would reduce the need of dieting. One of those promising new approaches involves treating celiac patients with AT-1001, a paracellular permeability inhibitor, and with R-spondin1, a recombinant, secreted protein that early animal studies have shown to act as a highly specific stimulator of the gastrointestinal (GI) epithelial cells.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assay the efficiency for celiac disease (CD) screening of 2 immunochromatographic visual stick assays based on human recombinant tissue transglutaminase (tTG). One was the antitissue transglutaminase antibodies (AtTGA) stick for IgA/G antibodies to tTG detection, the other was the AtTGA/antigliadin antibodies (AGA) stick for IgA antibodies for tTG and/or gliadins. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective multicenter study, 4 pediatric gastroenterology units from Spain and 2 from Latin America enrolled 72 control children with a normal small bowel mucosa and 113 untreated patients with CD with Marsh type 3 lesions. RESULTS: Evaluation of results by the gastroenterologists and by 2 independent observers at the coordination center showed a remarkably low interobserver variability. For the AtTGA stick, sensitivity was 96.5% and specificity was 98.6%. The AtTGA/AGA stick displayed a sensitivity of 94.5% and a specificity of 98.6% for AtTGA and a sensitivity of 63.1% and a specificity of 95.2% for AGA. The highest efficiency and positive likelihood ratio was obtained for the AtTGA stick, higher than for IgA AtTGA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. One additional advantage was that previous investigation of total serum IgA levels could be eluded. The IgA AtTGA/AGA stick, with an efficiency of 95.1%, compared with 89.2% when the combined results of the 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were considered, turned out to be an excellent diagnostic tool for infants with no IgA deficiency. CONCLUSION: These 2 assays are extremely efficient for CD screening, by combining a high diagnostic accuracy with the simplicity and rapidity of visual methods.},

Several types can be observed: a) typical cases presenting early in life with signs of intestinal malabsorption; b() atypical cases showing milder, often extraintestinal symptoms; c() silent cases that are occasionally discovered because of serological screening and (d) potential/latent cases showing isolated positivity of celiac serology at first testing and eventually the typical intestinal damage later in life. To date, the method of choice to make a diagnosis is the dosage of anti-transglutaminase IgA antibodies (including total IgA to prevent false negative results), followed by intestinal biopsy. Addition of moderate amounts of oats to a gluten-free diet does not prevent clinical or small bowel mucosal healing in children.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Celiac disease (CD)-related lesions have been reported in duodenal bulb biopsies, sometimes the bulb mucosa being the only one affected. The aim was to verify in a significant series whether histological lesions are always present in the bulb of celiac patients, what is the prevalence of lesions when isolated to the bulb, and if similar lesions are present in nonceliac subjects. METHODS: We studied 665 children with CD (241 males, range 9 months-15 years, 8 months), at diagnosis on a gluten-containing diet, and 348 age- and sex-matched gastroenterological controls submitted to upper endoscopy for gastroenterological complaints. During endoscopy, multiple biopsies (1 bulb and 4 distal duodenum samples) were taken. Anti-endomysium antibodies were evaluated by immunofluorescence method, anti-human tissue-transglutaminase antibodies by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or radioimmunoassay. Human leukocyte antigen-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 genes were typed by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primers repeat method. RESULTS: In all of the patients with CD, histological lesions were present in the bulb sample; in 16 of them, the lesions were present only in the bulb. Patchy villous atrophy was found in 20 children. All of the patients with CD were anti-endomysium and/or antitransglutaminase positive. The controls showed neither autoantibody positivity nor mucosal changes compatible with CD. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that CD-related histological lesions are always present in the bulb; sometimes this specific site is the only one affected. Therefore, we suggest taking 2 biopsies from the bulb and 2 from the distal duodenum for CD diagnosis.},

This study evaluated the reactivity of IgA of celiac patients to prolamins of wheat and gluten-free (maize and rice flours) breads mTG-treated or not. Prolamins extracted from wheat and gluten-free breads were analyzed by ELISA and immunodetected on membranes with individual or pooled sera from nine celiac patients recently diagnosed. Sera pool IgA titers were higher against prolamins of mTG-treated wheat or gluten-free breads than against mTG-untreated, mainly due to two individual patients' sera. The electrophoretic pattern of gluten-free bread prolamins was changed by the mTG treatment, and a new 31000 band originated in maize was recognized by three CD patients' IgA.},

METHODS: Electroencephalography, electromyography, and somatosensory evoked potentials were performed in children with CD receiving a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The neurophysiological tests revealed subclinical neurological abnormalities associated with CD in 3 (11%) of 27 children: 2 had peripheral polyneuropathy documented with electromyography, and 1 had prolonged latencies in somatosensory evoked potential. Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormalities in 2 (7.4%) of children: pontine demyelinization in 1 and cortical atrophy in the other. CONCLUSIONS: Because the rate of neurological problems is increased in children with CD, neurological abnormalities should be carefully investigated early after the diagnosis of CD is made.},

Thus, there is an urgent need to develop and implement nutritional approaches and policies for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Patients with some chronic inflammatory diseases appear to be more likely to develop osteopenia, and in some cases earlier in life, which is of particular concern as the incidence of inflammatory diseases in the Western world is increasing. While the cause of bone loss in patients with inflammatory disease is multifactorial, nutrition may have a role. Many of these patients may have one or more nutritional deficiencies, which can lead to altered rates of bone metabolism. On the other hand, some nutritional factors may attenuate the inflammatory process itself, and thus may indirectly benefit bone metabolism and bone health in patients with inflammatory disease. The present review will consider these issues, particularly in the context of inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease and atherosclerosis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of celiac disease (CD) is based on the avoidance of gluten-containing food. However, it is not known whether trace amounts of gluten are harmful to treated patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to establish the safety threshold of prolonged exposure to trace amounts of gluten (ie, contaminating gluten). DESIGN: This was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 49 adults with biopsy-proven CD who were being treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD) for > or =2 y. The background daily gluten intake was maintained at < 5 mg. After a baseline evaluation (t0), patients were assigned to ingest daily for 90 d a capsule containing 0, 10, or 50 mg gluten. Clinical, serologic, and histologic evaluations of the small intestine were performed at t0 and after the gluten microchallenge (t1). RESULTS: At t0, the median villous height/crypt depth (Vh/Cd) in the small-intestinal mucosa was significantly lower and the intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) count (x 100 enterocytes) significantly higher in the CD patients (Vh/Cd: 2.20; 95% CI: 2.11, 2.89; IEL: 27; 95% CI: 23, 34) than in 20 non-CD control subjects (Vh/Cd: 2.87; 95% CI: 2.50, 3.09; IEL: 22; 95% CI: 18, 24). One patient (challenged with 10 mg gluten) developed a clinical relapse. At t(1), the percentage change in Vh/Cd was 9% (95% CI: 3%, 15%) in the placebo group (n = 13), -1% (-18%, 68%) in the 10-mg group (n = 13), and -20% (-22%, -13%) in the 50-mg group (n = 13). No significant differences in the IEL count were found between the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The ingestion of contaminating gluten should be kept lower than 50 mg/d in the treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common lifelong disorders in western countries. However, most cases remain currently undiagnosed in North America, mostly due to poor awareness of CD by primary care physicians. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were (a) to determine whether an active case-finding strategy in primary care could increase the frequency of CD diagnosis and (b) to determine the most common clinical presentations of the condition. METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective study involving adult subjects during the years 2002-2004, attending one of the participating practices. All individuals with symptoms or conditions known to be associated with CD were tested for immunoglobulin A anti-transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies, and those with elevated anti-tTG were subsequently tested for IgA antiendomysial antibodies (EMA). All subjects who were positive for EMA were advised to undergo an intestinal biopsy and HLA typing. RESULTS: The study group included 737 women and 239 men, with a median age of 54.3 yr. A positive anti-tTG test was found in 30 out of 976 investigated subjects (3.07%, 95% CI 1.98-4.16). CD was diagnosed in 22 patients (18 women, 4 men). The most frequent reasons for CD screening in these 22 cases were bloating (12/22), thyroid disease (11/22), irritable bowel syndrome (7/22), unexplained chronic diarrhea (6/22), chronic fatigue (5/22), and constipation (4/22). The prevalence of CD in the serologically screened sample was 2.25% (95% CI 1.32-3.18). The diagnostic rate was low at baseline (0.27 cases per thousand visits, 95% CI 0.13-0.41) and significantly increased to 11.6 per thousand visits (95% CI 6.8-16.4, P < 0.001) following active screening implementation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that an active case-finding strategy in the primary care setting is an effective means to improve the diagnostic rate of CD in North America.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is a condition in which genetically predisposed people have an autoimmune reaction to gluten proteins found in all wheat types and closely related cereals such as barley and rye. This reaction causes the formation of autoantibodies and the destruction of the villi in the small intestine, which results in malabsorption of nutrientsand other gluten-induced autoimmune diseases. Sorghum is a cereal grain with potential to be developed into an important crop for human food products. The flour produced from white sorghum hybrids is light in color and has a bland, neutral taste that does not impart unusual colors or flavors to food products. These attributes make it desirable for use in wheat-free food products. While sorghum is considered as a safe food for celiac patients, primarily due to its relationship to maize, no direct testing has been conducted on its safety for gluten intolerance. Therefore studies are needed to assess its safety and tolerability in celiac patients. Thus the aim of the present study was to assess safety and tolerability of sorghum flour products in adult celiac disease patients, utilizing an in vitro and in vivo challenge. RESULTS: Sorghum protein digests did not elicit any morphometric or immunomediated alteration of duodenal explants from celiac patients. Patients fed daily for 5 days with sorghum-derived food product did not experience gastrointestinal or non-gastrointestinal symptoms and the level of anti-transglutaminase antibodies was unmodified at the end of the 5-days challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Sorghum-derived products did not show toxicity for celiac patients in both in vitro and in vivo challenge. Therefore sorghum can be considered safe for people with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut bifidobacteria are believed to influence immune-related diseases. The objective of this study was to assess the possible relationships between the gut bifidobacteria composition and coeliac disease (CD) in children. A total of 48 faecal samples (30 and 18 samples from active and no active CD patients, respectively) and 33 duodenal biopsy specimens of CD patients (25 and 8 samples from active and non-active CD patients, respectively) were analysed. Samples (30 faecal samples and 8 biopsies) from a control age-matched group of children were also included for comparative purposes. Gut Bifidobacterium genus and species were analyzed by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Active and non-active CD patients showed lower numbers of total Bifidobacterium and B. longum species in faeces and duodenal biopsies than controls, and these differences were particularly remarkable between active CD patients and controls. B. catenulatum prevalence was higher in biopsies of controls than in those of active and non-active CD patients, whereas B. dentium prevalence was higher in faeces of non-active CD patients than in controls. Correlations between levels of Bifidobacterium and B. longum species in faecal and biopsy samples were detected in both CD patients and controls. CONCLUSION: Reductions in total Bifidobacterium and B. longum populations were associated with both active and non-active CD when compared to controls. These bacterial groups could constitute novel targets for adjuvant dietary therapies although the confirmation of this hypothesis would require further investigations.},

METHODS: 30 and 18 faecal samples from untreated and treated CD patients and 25 and 8 biopsy samples from untreated and treated CD patients, respectively, were analysed. In addition, 30 faecal and 8 biopsy samples from control children were evaluated for comparative purposes. Gut bacterial groups were quantified by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Bacteroides and Clostridium leptum groups were more abundant in faeces and biopsies of CD patients than in controls regardless of the stage of the disease. E coli and Staphylococcus counts were also higher in faeces and biopsies of non-treated CD patients than in those of controls, but their levels were normalised after treatment with a GFD. Bifidobacterium levels were lower in faeces of both groups of CD patients and in biopsies of untreated CD patients compared to controls. Similar bacterial groups were related to CD in biopsies and faeces, indicating that faecal microbiota partly reflects that of the small intestine in CD patients, and could constitute a convenient biological index of this disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Duodenal and faecal microbiota is unbalanced in children with untreated CD and only partially restored after long-term treatment with a GFD, constituting a novel factor linked to this disorder.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease may be associated with autoimmune diseases. The aims of the present study were to determine in celiac patients which factors modulate the risk of autoimmune disease and to evaluate the effect of the gluten-free diet. METHODS: The occurrence of autoimmune disease and compliance to gluten-free diet were specified retrospectively in 924 celiac patients recruited from 27 French pediatric and adult gastroenterology centers. RESULTS: One or several autoimmune diseases had developed in 178 patients. The cumulative risk of autoimmune disease was 8.1% +/- 1% at age 15, and 15.7% +/- 1.5% at age 30. Factors associated with an increased risk were family history of autoimmunity (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.71-3.31) and diagnosis of celiac disease before 36 years of age (hazard ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.79-3.85). After diagnosis of celiac disease, 55 of 788 patients developed an autoimmune disease. The cumulative risk of subsequent autoimmune disease was lower in patients compliant to a gluten-free diet versus noncompliant patients (at 10 years, 6% +/- 2% vs 15.6% +/- 5.9%, respectively; P = .02). The incidence of autoimmune diseases was 5.4 per 1000 patient-years during adherence to a gluten-free diet versus 11.3 per 1000 patient-years during nonadherence to the diet (P = .002). Results were similar in both the pediatric and the adult populations. CONCLUSIONS: Celiac patients most at risk for autoimmune disease are those diagnosed early in life and having a family history of autoimmunity. The gluten-free diet has a protective effect.},

The aim of this study is to make a brief review of the literature about celiac disease and to report on a clinical case, showing the impact it may have on the general and oral health. A 39-year-old woman reported the presence of diarrhea, nauseas, flatulence, colic, difficulty with falling asleep, lack of appetite and loose of 18 Kg in the last two years. She also noted the appearance of symptomatic lesions in the mouth. These lesions had a mean duration of a month and occurred in any region of the oral mucosa, particularly on the tongue. Multiples ulcerations were found in the sublingual caruncula region, at the vestibular fornix and at the lingual apex. Topical treatment was instituted for the oral lesions with immediately relief of the symptoms. The diagnosis of celiac disease was established by means of medical clinical exam, biopsy of the small intestine, and by the presence of specific antibodies in the blood. The patient has been instructed to follow a gluten-free diet. Multiprofessional action with the involvement of a gastroenterologist and other health professionals, such as dentists, is important for diagnosing the disease and guiding the patient with celiac disease to achieve a good quality of life.},

   abstract = {Stress has been defined as an acute threat to the homeostasis of the organism. The mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract, a single layer of epithelial cells held together by tight junctions, provides a barrier between the external environment and the body's internal milieu. Any mechanism that breaches the tight junction exposes the body to foreign material be it protein, microorganisms or toxins. Stresses include physiological (exercise), psychological, disease-related or drug-induced factors. Stress associated gastrointestinal disorders include functional dyspepsia irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease peptic ulcer disease, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Some disease states disrupt gastrointestinal barrier function, e.g. infectious diarrhea, IBD, or celiac disease, whilst in others such as eczema it can be indirectly related to antigenic disruption of the barrier. Drugs, e.g. chemotherapy agents and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also disrupt barrier function. Malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies (zinc, folic acid, vitamin A) also predispose to mucosal damage. Assessment of gastrointestinal mucosal health has proved problematic as invasive techniques, whilst useful, provide limited data and no functional assessment. Noninvasive tests particularly breath tests do provide functional assessment and many can be used together as biomarkers to improve our ability to define a stressed mucosa. Therapeutic options include pharmacotherapies, immunomodulation or immunotherapy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV/CD26) is involved in the degradation of proline-rich proteins such as gliadin and in modulation of the immune response. The aim of this study was to examine the possible causal connection between DPP IV enzyme activities and celiac disease (CD) in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Intestinal mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained from 97 patients. The patients were divided into 3 groups: patients with active CD (n = 38), patients with malabsorption syndrome (MS) of other causes (n = 37), and control patients (n = 22). In addition, blood samples were collected from 48 patients with active CD and 50 control patients without gastrointestinal diseases. DPP IV enzyme activity was measured in the intestinal mucosal biopsy specimens and in the serum samples. RESULTS: DPP IV activity in the small intestine correlated inversely with the grade of mucosal damage in the CD (r = -0.92, P < 0.001) and MS groups (r = -0.90, P < 0.001). Intestinal DPP IV activity was statistically significantly lower in the CD and MS groups than in the control group (P < 0.001). By contrast, serum DPP IV activity was not significantly different between the CD and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the decrease in intestinal DPP IV activity is not specific to CD because it correlates with the level of mucosal damage in both patients with CD and those with MS. In addition, it seems that serum DPP IV activity cannot be used as a specific noninvasive diagnostic or prognostic marker of CD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Besides the central role of the adaptive immune system, a disturbance of innate immunity is also involved in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD). Inasmuch as CD and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) frequently coexist because of a common genetic predisposition, our aim was to study the frequency of CD14 C-260T and TLR4 A+896G single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the distribution of HLA-DQ genotypes in children affected by CD, T1DM, or both. PATIENTS AND METHODS: TLR4 and CD14 SNPs were tested by polymerase chain reaction, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 80 children with T1DM, 100 children with CD, and 47 children with both CD and T1DM. Determination of HLA-DQ alleles was done by sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction. Frequencies were compared with those of healthy control children. RESULTS: The prevalence of the homozygous CD14 C-260TT genotype was significantly (P = 0.0081) lower in children with T1DM but not in those with CD and T1DM, compared with control children. No difference was found in the genotype and allele frequencies of TLR4 between the studied groups. In patients with T1DM, the frequency of the homozygous HLA-DQ8 genotype was significantly higher than in CD, whereas the frequency of homozygous or heterozygous HLA-DQ2 genotypes did not differ from that in control children. In patients with CD, both homozygous and heterozygous HLA-DQ2 genotypes were significantly more frequent than in the control and T1DM groups, and no elevation in the frequency of the HLA-DQ8 genotypes was observed. In patients with T1DM and those with CD and T1DM, the occurrence of HLA-DQ2/8 heterozygosity was significantly higher than in children with CD only and in control children. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in patients with T1DM, the CD14 C-260TT homozygous genotype increases the risk for the development of CD. The distribution of HLA-DQ genotype is different in children with CD and T1DM than in children with CD or T1DM only. Determination of the HLA-DQ genotype in children with T1DM may help in estimating the risk for the development of CD.},

Recognition of this entity is highly relevant to avoid malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality. Therapy for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is based on the oral administration of pancreatic enzymes aiming at providing the duodenal lumen with sufficient active lipase at the time of gastric emptying of nutrients. Administration of enzymes in the form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres avoids acid-mediated lipase inactivation and ensures gastric emptying of enzymes in parallel with nutrients. Nevertheless, such factors as acidic intestinal pH and bacterial overgrowth may prevent normalization of fat digestion even in compliant patients. The present article critically reviews current therapeutic approaches to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.},

   abstract = {(Table is included in full-text article). The suitability of oats as part of a gluten-free diet is controversial. Contamination of many oats products with wheat, rye and particularly barley, together with inadequacy of available gluten-testing systems may account, at least in part, for the confusion. Some clear evidence has, however, emerged in the past few years that a small number of gluten-sensitive patients display a specific small intestinal T cell response to oat peptides that cannot be explained by contamination with other cereals. Oats could form a potentially useful part of a gluten-free diet, but patients require careful advice and monitoring, backed by robust gluten-assay techniques.},

With impaired nutrient absorption, different deficiency syndromes may occur and these may be manifested clinically with neurological changes. However, in patients with deficiency syndromes, extensive involvement of the small intestine with celiac disease is often evident. There are a number of reports of celiac disease associated with neuropathy, ataxia, dementia and seizure disorder. In these reports, there is no clear relationship with nutrient deficiency and a precise mechanism for the neurological changes has not been defined. A small number of patients have been reported to have responded to vitamin E administration, but most do not. In some, gluten antibodies have also been described, especially in those with ataxia, but a consistent response to a gluten-free diet has not been defined. Screening for celiac disease should be considered in patients with unexplained neurological disorders, including ataxia and dementia. Further studies are needed, however, to determine if a gluten-free diet will lead to improvement in the associated neurological disorder.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Malignant complications of celiac disease (CD) include carcinomas and lymphomas. The genetic basis behind cancer development in CD is not known, but acquisition of genetic abnormalities and genomic instability has been involved. The aim of this study was to explore molecular characteristics of genomic instability in CD patients by analyzing microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozygosis (LOH) with carefully selected microsatellites. METHODS: We genotyped small bowel biopsies and peripheral blood samples from 20 untreated CD patients using five microsatellites related to MMR genes (panel A), and five repeats associated with tumor suppressor genes, chromosome instability, inflammation, and cancer (panel B). RESULTS: Genomic instability was found in seven out of 20 (35%) cases at: D5S107, D18S58, GSTP, TP53 or DCC, being TP53 the most frequently affected (five out of seven cases; 71%). Microsatellite alterations were significantly found using panel B markers (P=0.04). No cases with high frequency of MSI and replication error phenotype were detected. Only one case displayed MSI-L alone. Three patients exhibited LOH and three other cases showed LOH with low level of MSI, being classified as having chromosome instability phenotype. CONCLUSION: Two novel observations were found in this study: first, the finding that non-neoplastic cells from a group of untreated CD patients present genomic instability at nucleotide level; and second, the advantage to use carefully selected microsatellites to identify celiac patients with molecular instability. Our data support the existence of chromosome instability phenotype in CD, suggesting that stable and unstable patients are genomically distinct subtypes that may follow a different evolution.},

The cause of pain is usually multifactorial with a complex interplay of factors contributing to a varying degree to the pain in an individual patient and, therefore, a rigid standardized approach for pain control tends to lead to suboptimal results. Pain management usually proceeds in a stepwise approach beginning with general lifestyle recommendations. Low fat diet, alcohol and smoking cessation are encouraged. Analgesics alone are needed in almost all patients. Maneuvers aimed at suppression of pancreatic secretion are routinely tried. Patients with ongoing symptoms may be candidates for more invasive options such as endoscopic therapy, and resective or drainage surgery. The role of pain modifying agents (antidepressants, gabapentin, peregabalin), celiac plexus block, antioxidants, octreotide and total pancreatectomy with islet cell auto transplantation remains to be determined.},

   abstract = {In susceptible individuals, the adaptive response, mediated by the activation of antigen-specific T lymphocytes, drives a proinflammatory response, which ends in an immune-mediated enteropathy characterized by villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and recruitment of intraepithelial lymphocytes. In addition, some gluten peptides are able to induce an innate immune response in intestinal mucosa. The molecular mechanisms and the cells involved in the initial stages of the gluten-intestinal mucosa interaction are poorly understood to date. There is evidence of a direct toxic effect of gluten peptides in several biological models. However, the failure to control the inflammatory response may be one of the factors underlying gluten intolerance in these individuals. The cytokine network involved in celiac disease is characterized by abundant interferon-gamma in the intestinal mucosa. In addition, the production of interleukin (IL)-15, IL-18, and IL-21 is linked to gluten intake, which can drive the inflammatory response probably sustained by IL-18, IL-21, and perhaps IL-27 through STAT1 and STAT5 pathways, whereas neither IL-12 nor IL-23 plays a significant role in pathogenic mechanisms. Herein we describe the involvement of these activation pathways in the context of the pathogenesis of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Conjugated bile acids promote absorption of dietary lipids by solubilizing them in mixed micelles. Bile acids are not considered to facilitate the digestion of other nutrients. METHODS: The effect of conjugated bile acids on the rate of protein hydrolysis by trypsin and chymotrypsin was examined in vitro. Common dietary proteins and 2 bacterial glutenases (proposed oral therapies for celiac sprue) were proteolyzed in the absence or presence of a 10 mmol/L conjugated bile acid mixture, simulating human bile composition. Lipolysis products (monoolein) and fatty acid were also evaluated to simulate postprandial intestinal contents. RESULTS: Conjugated bile acids dramatically enhanced the proteolysis of several dietary proteins, including beta-lactoglobulin, bovine serum albumin, myoglobin, and a commercially available dietary protein supplement. For beta-lactoglobulin, a cow's milk allergen that is resistant to pepsin cleavage, bile acids enhanced its proteolysis by pancreatic proteases even after incubation under gastric conditions. Exposure of prolyl endopeptidases to bile acids made them more susceptible to pancreatic proteases under simulated intestinal conditions. The conjugated bile acid effect was most pronounced in the presence of dihydroxy bile acids and was observable at bile concentrations below the critical micellar concentration but to a much greater extent at concentrations above the critical micellar concentration. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that, in addition to promoting lipid absorption, conjugated bile acids affect the digestion and assimilation of dietary proteins by accelerating hydrolysis by pancreatic proteases. These findings have implications for intraluminal protein breakdown and assimilation in the upper small intestine.},

Chronic enteropathy with subsequent persistent diarrhea and associated vicious cycles of malnutrition, increased gut permeability and secondary immunodeficiency are particularly devastating in the childhood population. The major causes of chronic enteropathy differ significantly between developed countries and developing countries. In developed countries, infectious and postinfectious diarrhea as well as abnormalities in immune response including celiac disease, food-induced allergic enteropathy and idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease account for most cases of chronic enteropathy. In developing countries, syndromic persistent diarrhea associated with malnutrition and secondary immunodeficiency due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection predominate as the major causes of chronic enteropathy. These latter two causes account for a disproportionate share of the more than 2.5 million deaths of children under 5 years of age due to diarrhea each year worldwide. From a practical perspective, diagnostic evaluation of chronic enteropathy in developing countries is often limited to identifying potential causative enteropathogens and antimicrobial treatment. Proper management with an emphasis on fluid homeostasis and protocolized nutritional therapy and rehabilitation is essential to successful treatment of syndromic persistent diarrhea.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the growth response to growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy during a gluten-free diet in patients with celiac disease (CD) associated with GH deficiency (GHD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 14 prepubertal children affected by CD and GHD with no catch-up growth after >/=12 months of gluten-free diet and a reversion to seronegativity for antiendomysium antibodies and 10 age-matched prepubertal children with idiopathic GHD (IGHD) entered the study. All of the patients were treated with the same GH dosage (0.25 mg/kg subcutaneously each week). Height, growth rate, and body mass index were measured at the time of diagnosis of CD, at the time of endocrinological evaluation, and after the first, second, and third year of GH replacement therapy. RESULTS: Growth rate strikingly increased (P < 0.005) during the first year of therapy in a similar way in subjects with CD/GHD and IGHD (from a median standard deviation score [SDS] of -2.34 to an SDS of 3.25 and from an SDS of -1.29 to an SDS of 2.79, respectively). During the second and third years of GH treatment, the growth rate tended to decrease but the values at the third year were always positive (CD/GHD, median SDS, 1.10; IGHD, median SDS, 0.11), indicating continued catch-up growth. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CD with GH deficiency confirmed after >/=12 months of gluten-free diet, GH replacement therapy should be started to allow complete catch-up growth in children. In addition, the effect of GH treatment in patients who comply with a gluten-free diet seems to be comparable to that observed in children with IGHD.},

In monogenic diseases (phenylketonuria, galactosemia, lactose intolerance etc.) diet influence phenotypic expression and nutrigenomics will improve the prevention or treatment by the early identification of specific mutations or haplotype combinations that modulate dietary response in affected subjects. In the multifactor diseases, like cardiovascular diseases (CVD), obesity, type II diabetes mellitus or cancer, the nutrigenomics approach has begun to reveal that some of them are susceptible to dietary intervention and may modulate the onset and progression of disorders.},

Primary causes of lactose malabsorption due to loss of intestinal lactase activity include genetic/racial lactase nonpersistence, congenital lactase deficiency, and developmental lactase deficiency. Secondary lactose malabsorption can be caused by any disorder that injures the small intestinal mucosa, such as viral gastroenteritis, celiac disease, allergic (eosinophilic) gastroenteritis, and radiation enteritis. The diagnosis depends on careful clinical evaluation and is customarily confirmed with a lactose breath hydrogen test. As the symptoms are nonspecific, many adults diagnosed with lactose malabsorption actually have irritable bowel syndrome. Treatment consists of a trial of eliminating lactose-containing dairy foods, with supplementation of alternative calcium and protein sources. Commercial enzyme products containing beta-galactosidases can be prescribed to help patients digest dietary lactose. Long-term lactose restriction usually is not necessary and can lead to reduced bone mineral density.},

FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease is a genetic autoimmune disease affecting up to 1% of the population. The majority of people with celiac disease do not know they have it. With new diagnostic tests available on the marketplace, increasing numbers of people are being diagnosed with celiac disease. Case managers are likely to encounter patients with celiac disease as either a primary or secondary diagnosis. Celiac disease may cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as gas, diarrhea, or bloating, and is also associated with osteoporosis, other autoimmune disorders, and certain types of cancer. For children, it is a common disorder underlying growth delays. Celiac disease is present in 3%-8% of persons with diabetes and may affect glycemic control in these patients. The only known treatment of celiac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet. The increased number of individuals diagnosed with celiac disease has led to an increase in products available, as well as in research on treatment alternatives. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: People with celiac disease report challenges in adhering to the gluten-free diet. Case managers can assist patients in accessing appropriate therapy, including nutrition counseling and monitoring services. They may also advocate for testing of patients in high-risk groups such as persons with diabetes, and those with unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms. In working with celiac patients, case managers should address psychosocial issues as well as knowledge deficits. Patients may need particular support integrating the gluten-free diet with other requirements, including heart healthy or diabetic diets. Case managers can help patients identify reliable sources of information and products. Case managers still have a role to play in educating patients and supporting adherence with this lifelong dietary regimen.},

   abstract = {In most developed countries, gluten is currently most commonly introduced between 4 and 6 months of age, in spite of little evidence to support this practice. As for infants at risk of developing food allergies, there is clear evidence that introducing solid foods before the end of the 3rd month is detrimental and should be avoided. A recent growing body of evidence however challenges the notion that solids (and among them, gluten-containing foods) should be introduced beyond the 6th month of life. Another important aspect of gluten introduction into the diet has to do with its possible role in causing type-1 diabetes (IDDM). Recently, a large epidemiological investigation in a cohort of children at risk for IDDM found that exposure to cereals (rice, wheat, oats, barley, rye) that occurred early (< or = 3 months) as well as late (> or = 7 months) resulted in a significantly higher risk of the appearance of islet cell autoimmunity compared to the introduction between 4 and 6 months. As for celiac disease, the protective role of breastfeeding can be considered ascertained, especially the protection offered by having gluten introduced while breastfeeding is continued. Evidence is emerging that early (< or = 3 months) and perhaps even late (7 months or after) first exposure to gluten may favor the onset of celiac disease in predisposed individuals. Additionally, large amounts of gluten at weaning are associated with an increased risk of developing celiac disease, as documented in studies from Scandinavian countries. In celiac children observed in our center, we could show that breastfeeding at the time of gluten introduction delays the appearance of celiac disease and makes it less likely that its presentation is predominantly gastrointestinal. Based on current evidence, it appears reasonable to recommend that gluten be introduced in small amounts in the diet between 4 and 6 months, while the infant is breastfed, and that breastfeeding is continued for at least a further 2-3 months.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Research in celiac disease is unraveling new findings at a high rate, and major advances seem to occur in all areas such as genetics, environmental factor, pathophysiology, and even prospective therapeutic implications. RECENT FINDINGS: New insight is being gained into the interplay between genetic and environmental factors causing celiac disease. In addition to the known human leukocyte antigen haplotypes, genome-wide studies have now identified additional susceptibility loci and the majority of newly discovered risk regions harbor genes controlling immune pathways. The mechanism of translocation of gliadin peptides across the intestinal barrier has been the subject of much investigation, and there is now evidence that the toxic 33-mer peptide can also be translocated transcellularly. As for the paracellular route, this appears to be enhanced by gliadin's stimulation of zonulin release. The growing role of the innate immunity is being recognized and the increased expression of some Toll-like receptors appears to delineate a new inherent defect in this branch of innate immunity. Finally, new perspectives are opening in the treatment of celiac disease based on new detoxified grains, enzymatic degradation of gluten, and prevention of its crossing the mucosal barrier. SUMMARY: The pace of new knowledge in this 'ancient' disease is very fast, and this review outlines the principal lines of such exciting developments.},

   abstract = {Current nutrition recommendations, directed towards populations, are based on estimated average nutrient requirements for a target population and intend to meet the needs of most individuals within that population. They also aim at preventing common diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. For infants with specific genetic polymorphisms, e.g. some inborn errors of metabolism, adherence to current recommendations will cause disease symptoms and they need personalized nutrition recommendations. Some other monogenic polymorphisms, e.g. adult hypolactasia, are common but with varying prevalence between ethnic groups and within populations. Ages at onset as well as the degree of the resulting lactose intolerance also vary, making population-based as well as personalized recommendations difficult. The tolerable intake is best set by each individual based on symptoms. For polygenetic diseases such as celiac disease, type-1 diabetes and allergic disease, current knowledge is insufficient to suggest personalized recommendations aiming at primary prevention for all high-risk infants, although it may be justified to provide such recommendations on an individual level should the parents ask for them. New technologies such as nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics are promising tools with which current nutrition recommendations can possibly be refined and the potential of individualized nutrition be explored. It seems likely that in the future it will be possible to offer more subgroups within a population personalized recommendations.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: In coeliac disease (CD) there is a gluten-induced small bowel enteropathy leading to malabsorption of various nutrients, vitamins and trace elements. Low levels of serum zinc have been reported in adults with untreated CD. In the present study we related the serum concentration of zinc to the morphology of the small bowel mucosa in 58 children, all under 4 years of age and under investigation for coeliac disease. The mean serum concentration of zinc (mean +/- SD; mumol/L) was significantly lower in children with untreated CD (9.7 +/- 2.0) (n = 11) compared to non-coeliac children without enteropathy (15.1 +/- 2.3) (n = 16) (p < 0.001), coeliac children on a gluten-free diet without enteropathy (14.2 +/- 1.6) (n = 14) (p < 0.001), coeliac children on gluten challenge with enteropathy (14.1 +/- 2.1) (n = 12) (p < 0.001) and coeliac children on gluten challenge without enteropathy (13.8 +/- 1.9) (n = 6) (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Serum zinc concentration is decreased in untreated coeliac children with enteropathy and normalizes on gluten-free diet. A low serum zinc value in a child being investigated for possible CD on clinical grounds can thus be used as a complementary marker for enteropathy indicating further investigation with small bowel biopsy. The hypothetical role of zinc in the pathogenesis of CD is discussed.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search with no date restriction was conducted using PubMed and PsychInfo electronic databases and bibliographies of relevant articles. RESULTS: Adherence rates in inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease range considerably from 16% to 62% and 5% to 70%, respectively, across treatments and assessment method; nonadherence frequency was generally not reported. Measures used to assess adherence included self-report, interview, diet record, and bioassay methods, and each measure demonstrated strengths and limitations. Limited evidence suggests that adherence in both disease populations is related to patient and family behavioral factors and that nonadherence is related to poor disease outcome. Treatment outcome research for nonadherence is scant in the current literature. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should focus on refining assessment method, examining adherence and concomitant behavioral factors longitudinally, testing theoretical models of adherence, and developing efficacious treatments for nonadherence.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic association. It is caused by a T-cell-mediated immune response to wheat gluten. The treatment is a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the naturally gluten-free cereal Eragrostis tef (tef) is associated with health problems when used by CD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In March 2006, all 7990 members of the Dutch Celiac Disease Society were invited to complete a questionnaire on tef use and the development of symptoms after tef consumption. Respondents and their family members willing to participate were sent an extended questionnaire on the use of commercially available tef products and on the character of their subsequent symptoms. RESULTS: Thirty-six percent responded to the first questionnaire of whom 53% consumed tef and 15% reported complaints. For the second questionnaire, out of the 1828 participants willing to complete it, 1545 had biopsy-proven CD (median duration GFD: 6.5 years (range: 0-66.5 years)). Of these, 66% used tef (median duration 1.4 years (range: 0.1-5 years)) and 17% reported symptoms after consumption. The percentage for symptoms was significantly lower than that in patients without tef consumption reporting on their regular GFD (17% versus 61%; p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Tef is frequently used by Dutch CD patients and a wide majority can consume tef without experiencing any clinical symptoms. CD patients using tef reported a significant reduction in symptoms, possibly related to a reduction in gluten intake or to an increase in fiber intake. Hence, tef can be a valuable addition to the GFD of CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In light of the possibly preventive role of timing and amount of gluten in celiac disease, it would be helpful to have a questionnaire to assess the gluten intake in infants. AIMS: Development and validation of a food questionnaire to assess gluten consumption in healthy infants aged 0-12 months (FQ-gluten). METHODS: A food frequency questionnaire, previously developed for the Generation R study, was adapted for the assessment of gluten intake. The results of a 2-day food record (FR) were compared with the results of this FQ-gluten. RESULTS: Eighty-seven parents filled in the FR and the FQ-gluten. The number of children who consume gluten and who are breast-fed is higher, reported in the FQ-gluten. The amount of gluten is comparable from the age of 3 up to 10 months, but at 11 and 12 months a higher gluten intake is reported using the FR, probably due to a larger variety of food products not detectable by the FQ-gluten. However, there is a high agreement in the food groups (Cohens' kappa=0.6-0.8). CONCLUSIONS: This new, short, standardized, validated and easy to use FQ-gluten may be a useful instrument to assess gluten intake in infants, both at the individual and at the population level. The use of this method by investigators in other countries provides the opportunity for a better comparison of the results of gluten consumption in (co-operative) studies throughout different countries.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is believed to be a permanent intolerance to gluten. A number of patients, however, discontinue the gluten-free diet (GFD) without developing symptoms or signs. The aim of our study was to investigate whether CD patients are capable of developing tolerance to gluten. METHODS: All 77 adult patients from our hospital known to have biopsy-proven CD for more than 10 years were invited to participate. We investigated symptoms, gluten consumption, antibodies for CD and other autoimmunity, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typing, bone mineral density, and performed small bowel biopsies. Tolerance was defined as no immunological or histological signs of CD while consuming gluten. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients accepted participation, but after review of the diagnostic biopsies 53 were found to have true CD. Twenty-three percent of patients had a gluten-containing diet, 15% admitted gluten transgression and 62% followed the GFD. Patients on a GFD had significantly more osteoporosis. Normal small bowel mucosa was found in four of eight on gluten-containing diet and in four of four with gluten transgression. Two patients were considered to have developed tolerance to gluten. One of them was HLA-DQ2/DQ8 negative. CONCLUSION: Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.},

We investigated the development of transglutaminase antibodies and analysed potential risk factors for coeliac disease autoimmunity in first-degree relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: The study was conducted by prospective observational follow-up from birth of 1,511 children at increased risk of type 1 diabetes or coeliac disease born in Germany between 1989 and 2000. Mean follow-up was to age 7.6 years. Children were tested for transglutaminase and islet autoantibodies. Children were classified as transglutaminase antibody-positive if antibodies were detected by both ELISA and radiobinding assays. RESULTS: The risk of developing transglutaminase antibodies was 4.9% by age 8 years (n=63; 95% CI, 3.7-6.1%). Transglutaminase antibodies developed at an older age than islet autoantibodies (median age, 4.9 vs 2.3 years; p<0.005), and only three children developed both transglutaminase antibodies and islet autoantibodies. Multivariate analysis indicated an increased risk of transglutaminase antibodies in children with the HLA-DRB1*03 allele (hazard ratio for heterozygous DR3, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.9-10.2; hazard ratio for homozygous DR3, 16.2; 95% CI, 6.7-39; p<0.0001) and in children with impaired uterine growth (birth weight < or = 1st percentile, hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-7.8, p=0.03). Neither breast-feeding or its duration nor the age of first exposure to gluten was associated with the risk of developing transglutaminase antibodies. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Coeliac disease autoimmunity is initiated later than islet autoimmunity in children who are at risk. An influence of infant nutrition on the development of coeliac disease autoimmunity could not be confirmed in this prospective study.},

   abstract = {The expression of the protein crosslinking enzyme tissue transglutaminase (TG2, tTG), the ubiquitous member of transglutaminase family, can be regulated by multiple factors. Although it has been suggested that TG2 can be involved in apoptotic cell death, high levels of enzyme have also been associated with cell survival in response to different stimuli. Furthermore, evidence indicates that increases in TG2 production cause enzyme translocation to cell membrane. Cell stress can also lead to TG2 accumulation on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix resulting in changes in cell-matrix interactions.Here, we discuss the underlying mechanisms of TG2 up-regulation induced by various stimuli including glutamate exposure, calcium influx, oxidative stress, UV, and inflammatory cytokines. These findings agree with a postulated role for transglutaminases in molecular mechanisms involved in several diseases suggesting that cross-linking reactions could be a relevant part of the biochemical changes observed in pathological conditions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Coeliac disease (CD) is a lifelong disorder with gluten-induced manifestations in different organs. Gluten-free diet (GFD) is required to achieve remission and prevent complications; however, study reports on GFD growth effect are not consistent. METHODS: Compliance with GFD was estimated according to current body mass and height; presence of anaemia and other signs and symptoms; and attitude toward GFD. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients with CD (mean age = 12 years; mean age after CD diagnosis = 9 years) were examined and their blood sampled for determination of endomysial antibodies (EMA), haemoglobin, and red blood cell count. Questionnaire analysis revealed 42 (59.1%; 4 EMA positive) patients to be on strict GFD, 19 (26.8%; 5 EMA positive) were taking small amounts of gluten, and 10 (14.1%; all EMA positive) were not on a diet at all. The patients on strict GFD had greatest body height, yet the difference was not significant. These patients also had a higher mean body mass (P = 0.05) and significantly higher mean haemoglobin and mean cell haemoglobin levels (P = 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively). Apart from chronic fatigue in patients on partial diet (P = 0.05), patient groups did not differ significantly in the frequency of symptoms. Anaemia and delayed puberty were recorded only in noncompliers (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Noncompliers often found the specific diet to pose a major life burden (P < 0.01) and did not visit a gastroenterologist on a regular basis (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of the coeliac patients were likely to abandon GFD without experiencing major symptoms, thus increasing the risk for developing complications later in life. An active attitude is required in the follow-up of patients with CD.},

Recommendations for UGIE use in children were published recently by the French-language Paediatric Hepatology, Gastroenterology, and Nutrition Group (GFHGNP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the 293 UGIE procedures undertaken in 251 children between January 1, 2001 and June 30, 2003 by 2 senior endoscopists. The UGIE procedures were categorized as appropriate or inappropriate based on GFHGNP recommendations, and diagnostic efficiency was compared in the 2 groups with the chi2 test followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the 293 UGIE procedures, 52 (17.7%) were considered inappropriate. Diagnostic efficiency was 51% in the appropriate group versus 17.3% in the inappropriate group (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% CI, 2-8.7; P < 10(-3)). The proportion of appropriate UGIE procedures was higher among inpatients than outpatients (odds ratio, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.24-5.08; P = 0.01). Inappropriate reasons for performing UGIE included isolated failure to thrive and follow-up after neonatal esophagogastroduodenitis. Nine inappropriate UGIE procedures contributed useful information: ulcerative esophagitis in 1 patient, hemorrhagic esophagitis in 4 patients, duodenitis in 1 patient, and malabsorption in 3 patients caused in 1 case by cow's milk allergy and in 2 cases to fully documented celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: UGIE was usually performed appropriately in our pediatric hospital. Inappropriate UGIE procedures were more common in outpatients than in admitted patients. Awareness of the recommendations for appropriate UGIE use needs to be improved among office-based and hospital-based physicians.},

The objective of the present study was to clarify its applicability by analysing local cellular immunological responses after 5 years' consumption of oats by adult coeliac patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-two coeliac patients took part in an earlier oats intervention study for 6-12 months. Twenty-two of these patients originally consumed oats as part of their gluten-free diet. During the 5-year follow-up 10 patients had felt uncertain about the safety of long-term consumption of oats and gave up this part of their diet. Finally, 12 of the 22 patients consumed oats for the whole 5-year period. The control group consisted of the remaining 20 coeliac patients using a strict, conventional, gluten-free diet without oats. Intraepithelial CD3, alphabetaTCR (alphabetaIEL) and gammadeltaTCR (gammadeltaIEL) T cells were counted after specific staining of small intestinal biopsy specimens. RESULTS: There were no differences in the densities of CD3, alphabetaIEL and gammadeltaIEL T cells between the oat and the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use of oats included in the gluten-free diets of patients with coeliac disease does not stimulate an immunological response locally in the mucosa of the small intestine.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is evidence for the long-term safety of oats as part of a gluten-free diet in coeliac disease (CD). Oats is generally processed by kilning, which theoretically may change its antigenic properties and be the reason that it is tolerated by patients with CD. The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of large amounts of unkilned oats, comparing its use with kilned oats in adult coeliac patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group included 13 men and 19 women with CD in remission. The goal of daily intake of oats was 100 g during one year. These patients using oats as part of their gluten-free diet were randomized to two treatment groups. One group used regular oats and the other unkilned oats. After 6 months the patients changed the treatment groups. Food intake, symptoms, histology of the small intestine and the levels of endomysial antibodies were noted. RESULTS: No marked changes were found in the duodenal biopsies, in the levels of endomysial antibodies or in the well-being of the patients. Compliance with the diet did not change during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Large amounts of both unkilned and regular kilned oats are well tolerated by adult patients with CD. Oats is therefore not harmful, even in its unkilned form, which indicates that its antigenic nature is not changed by common industrial food processing in such a way that would prevent the provoking of CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (-13910 C/T and -22018 G/A) upstream of the lactase gene (LCT) have been found to be associated with lactose tolerance in Europeans. METHODS: In one hundred and twenty Austrian outpatients, who visited the physician's office for symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), hydrogen breath testing (HBT) and LCT genotyping by polymerase chain reaction and reverse-hybridisation were performed in parallel. RESULTS: The coincidence between a genotype suggesting lactase non-persistence (lactose intolerance) and a positive HBT result was almost perfect (97.4% for LCT-13910 C/T and 100% for LCT-22018 G/A). Between a genotype indicating lactase persistence (lactose tolerance) and a negative HBT result the coincidence was lower (72% and 71.4%, respectively). Among heterozygotes, there was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of positive HBT results with age. Both SNPs were in accordance in 117/120 (97.5%) patients. CONCLUSION: Genetic analysis of LCT-13910 C/T and LCT-22018 G/A is a good indicator for the presence of lactose intolerance. Because age, as well as a number of secondary causes (e.g. celiac disease), can influence HBT results, it is useful to combine HBT and genetic analysis in the diagnostic assessment of IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malabsorptive diarrhea due to short bowel syndrome (SBS) results in nutrition compromise, often requiring parenteral nutrition (PN). Activation of latent celiac disease can occur after gastrointestinal surgery. Our objective was to determine whether undiagnosed celiac disease contributes to malabsorption in patients with SBS. METHODS: Adult subjects with SBS were tested for celiac disease using immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibody and total IgA level. Subjects with an elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase were offered upper endoscopy with biopsies of the duodenum. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects were enrolled. The subjects were predominantly white, and the most common cause of SBS was Crohn's disease. The mean length of remaining small bowel was 93.1 +/- 54.6 cm. All subjects had undergone surgeries, resulting in loss of the ileocecal valve. Five subjects were found to have an elevated total IgA. A single patient was found to have an elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody, and subsequent endoscopy demonstrated active gastroduodenal Crohn's disease, without features of celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: No subjects were IgA deficient, but 5 subjects were found to have elevated IgA levels. Undiagnosed celiac disease did not contribute to malabsorption in our small cohort of predominantly white SBS patients. Larger studies are warranted.},

To compare dietary intakes of people with CD to the dietary intake of the general population. The nutritional contribution of gluten-free products (GFPs) and current purchasing trends was also evaluated. SUBJECTS/METHODS: 106 patients were invited to participate via post. Three-day food diary to assess intake and a short simple questionnaire that looked at purchasing trends of GFP. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients returned the food diary and 48 returned the questionnaire. Patients were found to have a low intake of energy, non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs), vitamin D and calcium. They were obtaining a significantly lower proportion of energy from fat and a significantly higher proportion of energy from protein than the DRVs (P<0.05). Intake was comparable to the general population for most nutrients, except they had a significantly greater intake of protein, a lower intake of fat and a significantly lower intake of vitamin D (P<0.05). Specialist GFP, especially those obtained on prescription, were an important source of energy, carbohydrate, NSP, calcium and iron. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD are at risk of having an inadequate intake of calcium, NSP and vitamin D. Specialist GFP, which were obtained on prescription, helped patients get a balanced diet and without these patients would be at an increased risk of many deficiencies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Deamidated gliadin peptides are efficient antigens in diagnostic tests for celiac disease, and results correlate better with transglutaminase 2-based assays than those with native gliadin. We investigated whether deamidated gliadin antigens are structurally similar to transglutaminase 2 or could mimic transglutaminase epitopes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples from 74 celiac and 65 control patients, and 13 different transglutaminase 2-specific monoclonal mouse antibodies were investigated for their binding to commercially available deamidated gliadin peptides using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, competition studies, and molecular modelling. RESULTS: The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with deamidated gliadin peptides had 100% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity in patients. Deamidated gliadin epitopes also were recognized by 3 transglutaminase-specific monoclonal antibodies, and antibodies affinity-purified with deamidated gliadin peptides from celiac patient sera reacted with transglutaminase but did not show endomysial binding. The binding of the monoclonal antibodies to deamidated gliadin was inhibited dose dependently by full-length recombinant human transglutaminase, its fragments containing the binding sites of these monoclonal antibodies, or by celiac patient antibodies. Deamidated gliadin peptides decreased the binding of transglutaminase-specific monoclonal antibodies to transglutaminase. Three different cross-reacting transglutaminase epitopes were found, of which 2 are located in the C-terminal domain and 1 is conformational. The binding of celiac serum samples to deamidated gliadin peptides could not be abolished by transglutaminase or by any of the transglutaminase-specific monoclonals, indicating that celiac sera also contain additional antibodies to gliadin epitopes different from transglutaminase. CONCLUSIONS: Certain deamidated gliadin-derived peptides and transglutaminase 2 epitopes have similar 3-dimensional appearance. This homology may contribute to the induction of transglutaminase autoantibodies by molecular mimicry.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In coeliac disease, immunoglobulin (Ig)A-class autoantibodies against transglutaminase-2 are produced in the small intestinal mucosa, where they are deposited extracellularly. It remains unclear whether positive intestinal transglutaminase-2-targeted IgA deposits in subjects having normal small bowel mucosal morphology are signs of early-stage coeliac disease. We evaluated the gluten dependency of these deposits in overt and mild enteropathy coeliac disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All together 48 subjects suspected of coeliac disease but having normal small bowel mucosal villi were enrolled; 28 of them had latent coeliac disease. The remaining 20 having positive intestinal IgA deposits adopted a gluten-free diet before villous atrophy had developed. For comparison, 13 patients with overt coeliac disease and 42 noncoeliac controls were studied. Small bowel mucosal transglutaminase-2-specific autoantibodies were compared with villous morphology, intraepithelial lymphocyte densities, and serum coeliac autoantibodies. RESULTS: Intestinal IgA deposits were seen in all but 1 of the patients with latent coeliac disease, when the morphology was still intact; the intensity of these deposits increased as villous atrophy developed and decreased again on a gluten-free diet. In 20 patients with intestinal IgA deposits in normal villi, the intensity of the deposits decreased with the diet similarly to that seen in patients with overt coeliac disease. Mucosal IgA deposits were seen initially only in 5% of noncoeliac controls and in 8% after extended gluten consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The response of small bowel mucosal transglutaminase-2-specific IgA deposits for dietary intervention was similar in overt and mild enteropathy coeliac disease. Detection of such IgA deposits thus offers a good diagnostic tool to uncover early-stage coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: To the reasons of disturbances of bone mineralization in celiac disease belong: absorption impairment due to the changes in mucosa including calcium and vitamin D adsorption, the activation of osteoclasts by proinflammatory cytokines and the decrease in concentration of growth hormone and IGF-1 in the serum. THE AIM OF THE STUDY was to analyze mineral bone density in children with celiac disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis included 37 children aged 5 to 17 years, treated in our clinic since November 2004 to June 2007 with diagnosed celiac disease. In all children examination of total body bone mineral density (TBMD) was performed using DPX(+) densitometer (Lunar). RESULTS: The disturbances of mineral bone density were observed in 15 out of 37 children with diagnosed celiac disease which amounted to 40.5%. In patients with celiac disease diagnosed de novo such disturbances were present in 75%. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of mineral bone density was present in 40.54% of children with diagnosed celiac disease and in 75% of patients with celiac disease diagnosed de novo. The decrease of BMD correlated with nutritional status and was present only in 30% of properly nourished children and in much higher percent in severely malnourished children. Reduced bone mineral density was observed in 50% of children with mucosa villous atrophy and merely in 8% with proper small intestine mucosa. There is a need of diagnostic scheme for early diagnosis (screening) and treatment of mineral bone density disturbances in children with celiac disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate age-dependent serum levels and occurrence of elevated celiac disease (CD)-related antibodies in young children, to define the optimal serological procedure when selecting for small intestinal biopsy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Included were 428 children with biopsy verified CD (median age 16 months; range 7.5 months-14 years) and 216 controls (median age 2.7 years; range 8.5 months-14.6 years). Immunoglobulin (Ig) A antibodies against gliadin (AGA-IgA), tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA), and endomysium (EMA-IgA) were analysed. RESULTS: Increased serum AGA-IgA levels were found in 411 of 428 CD cases, tTG-IgA in 385 of 428, and EMA-IgA in 383 of 428. In the control group, 11 of 216 had increased levels of AGA-IgA, 5 of 216 of tTG-IgA, and 8 of 216 of EMA-IgA. In CD children younger than 18 months, elevated AGA-IgA occurred in 97% and elevated tTG-IgA and EMA-IgA were found in 83% of the cases. Conversely, in CD children older than 18 months, elevated AGA-IgA occurred in 94%, and elevated tTG-IgA and EMA-IgA were found in 99% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: In children older than 18 months, both tTG-IgA and EMA-IgA are sufficiently accurate to be used as a single antibody marker, whereas a large proportion of younger children with CD lack these antibodies. Therefore, when selecting children for small intestinal biopsy, the detection of a combination of AGA-IgA and tTG-IgA is optimal for identifying untreated CD in children younger than 18 months.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial disease with involvement of both environmental and genetic susceptibility factors. The HLA-DQ loci account for <40% of CD heritability, but linkage studies have delineated other loci at the 5q31-33 (CELIAC2), and 19p13 regions (CELIAC4), similarly as in inflammatory bowel diseases. However, data in association studies are contradictory. To evaluate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging the MYO9B susceptibility haplotype and the IBD5 locus (5q31-33) are involved in CD predisposition, we performed case-control and family-based analyses. Additionally, any possible correlation with the HLA-DQ status was investigated. Finally, our data were pooled with the results of other studies by a meta-analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 337 unrelated patients with CD, 424 parents (212 sets), and 452 healthy individuals were genotyped for the IGR2198a_1, rs12521868, rs1050152, and rs2631367 SNPs (IBD5 locus) and the rs962917, rs2305764, and rs1545620 SNPs of the MYO9B gene by the restriction enzyme method and the TaqMan system ABI PRISM 7700, respectively. RESULTS: In comparison with healthy control individuals, the allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies of all investigated SNPs were not different in the CD patients, nor was any correlation observed with the HLA-DQ status or clinical presentation. The transmission disequilibrium test did not show a transmission distortion. Five other studies were available for meta-analysis on MYO9B variants; by pooling of data, no significant association was demonstrated by the random effect model. A significant heterogeneity (P < 0.002) among the studies was present, mainly explained by a single study in the Dutch population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results and those of the meta-analysis (>2000 CD patients and 4000 control individuals) question the role of MYO9B at the CELIAC4 locus as a disease-causing gene. Moreover, none of the investigated SNPs explain the linkage at the CELIAC2 locus.},

This study evaluates the economic burden of adhering to a gluten-free diet. METHODS: A market basket of products identified by name brand, weight or package size for both regular wheat-based products and gluten-free counterparts was developed. The differences in price between purchase venues, both type of store (general grocery store, an upscale grocery store and a health food store and four internet-based grocery sites) and region was also analysed. RESULTS: Availability of gluten-free products varied between the different venues, regular grocery stores carried 36%, while upscale markets carried 41%, and health food stores 94%, compared with 100% availability on the internet. Overall, every gluten-free product was more expensive than their wheat-based counterpart (P <or= 0.05). Bread and pasta was twice as expensive as their wheat-based counterparts. Cost was affected more by shopping venue than geographic location. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that gluten-free foods have poor availability and are more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts. The impact of these findings on dietary compliance and the quality of life needs to be addressed.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gliadin proteins play a key role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease; however, as a screen for celiac disease, anti-gliadin antibody testing has been replaced by the more sensitive and specific serological assays for transglutaminase autoantibodies (TGAA). A new generation of anti-gliadin antibody assays has been developed to detect synthetic, deamidated homologous gliadin peptides (DGP) with high sensitivity and specificity. METHODS: Sera were collected prospectively from children with an increased risk for celiac disease as part of an ongoing study at Denver, and studied for the development of celiac autoimmunity. We investigated the high-performance DGP antibody assay in 50 TGAA-positive children both before the development of celiac autoimmunity and following the institution of a gluten-free diet to determine the relationship of DGP antibodies to TGAA. TGAA were measured by an in-house radioassay. RESULTS: DGP antibodies and TGAA parallel each other over the period of years children were studied. DGP antibodies resolved sooner than TGAA in subjects on a gluten-free diet. DGP antibodies appeared earlier than TGAA in 9 children. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring DGP antibodies may be more useful than TGAA in monitoring children on a gluten-free diet. DGP antibodies can precede the appearance of TGAA in some at-risk children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with celiac disease, who remain undiagnosed or asymptomatic in childhood, may present in adulthood with either typical or atypical features. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, we reviewed the case records of 45 consecutive patients with celiac disease diagnosed in adulthood. The diagnosis of celiac disease was made on the basis of the modified European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition criteria. The modes of presentation, clinical manifestations, endoscopic features and histological features were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of these patients at diagnosis was 28.7 (11.2) years. The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 2.5 years (range: 6 months to 40 years). Chronic diarrhea was the presenting manifestation in 20 (44%) patients only. Twenty-two (49%) patients were referred to us by hematologists, endocrinologists or gynecologists for evaluation of refractory anemia in 10 (2.2%), short stature in 6 (13.3%), metabolic bone disease in 2 (4.4%) and secondary infertility or delayed menarche in 4 (8.8%). Intestinal mucosal folds were scalloped in 31 (69%), attenuated in 34 (76%) and normal looking in 11 (24%) of them. Mild, moderate and severe villous abnormalities on intestinal mucosal biopsies were present in 10 (22.2%), 15 (33.3%) and 19 (42.2%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of adult patients with celiac disease present with atypical manifestations. A high index of suspicion is required for diagnosing variant forms of celiac disease in adults.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated gluten-dependent enteropathy induced by ingestion of gluten-containing products, characterized by intestinal malabsorption and subtotal or total atrophy of intestinal villi, which improves after gluten-free diet (GFD). Untreated patients affected by the classic form of CD are at high risk of malnutrition, but an impairment of nutritional status is frequently reported also in patients with the subclinical form of the disease. Strict adherence to a GFD greatly improves nutritional status, inducing an increase in fat and bone compartments, but does not completely normalize body composition. A lack of improvement in nutritional status may identify incomplete adherence to GFD treatment. Evidence has shown lower body weights and lower fat mass and fat-free mass contents in CD patients. Untreated CD patients oxidize more carbohydrates as energy substrate compared to treated subjects. In addition, circulating ghrelin concentration was reduced after GFD treatment as a possible consequence of body composition improvement, while leptin did not correlate with the changes in body composition and substrate oxidation in patients with CD. A significant correlation was reported between ghrelin and the degree of severity of intestinal mucosal lesions. CD patients might show an alteration in lipid metabolism, i.e. low serum total and high- density lipoprotein-cholesterol as a consequence of lipid malabsorption and decreased intake. In conclusion, weight loss and nutritional deficiencies are relevant clinical features in CD. Thus, an early and accurate evaluation of nutritional status and energy metabolism represents a fundamental tool in the management of CD patients.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY: Accurate staging of esophageal cancer is critical to achieving optimal treatment outcomes. End-oscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has emerged as a valuable tool for locoregional staging. However, it is unclear how different physician specialties perceive the benefit of EUS-FNA for esophageal cancer staging, and thus utilize this modality in clinical practice. A survey regarding utilization of EUS-FNA in esophageal cancer was distributed to 211 thoracic surgeons and 251 EUS-capable gastroenterologists. Seventy-six thoracic surgeons (36%) and 78 gastroenterologists (31%) responded to the survey. Most surgeons (75%) use EUS to stage potentially resectable esophageal cancer 75% of the time. Surgeons using EUS less often are less likely to have access to high-quality EUS services than their peers. Fewer surgeons believe EUS is the most accurate test for T and N-staging (84% and 71%, respectively) as compared with gastroenterologists (97% and 96%, P < 0.01 for both). Most endosonographers (68%) decide whether to dilate a malignant esophageal stricture to complete the staging exam on a case-by-case basis. Surgeons disagree as to whether involvement of celiac lymph nodes should preclude esophagectomy in distal esophageal cancer. While most thoracic surgeons have embraced EUS-FNA as the most accurate locoregional staging modality in esophageal cancer, this attitude is not fully reflected in utilization patterns due to a lack of quality EUS services in some centers. Controversial areas that warrant further study include dilation of malignant strictures to facilitate EUS staging, and the implication of involved celiac lymph nodes on management.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is an uncommon disorder. Traditional treatment consists of open surgical (OS) revascularization. We report a case of CMI treated with percutaneous angioplasty and stenting. CASE REPORT: A 77-year-old-woman reported a history of postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, asthenia, and anorexia. On physical examination, the only relevant sign was systolic murmur. Oral panendoscopy showed chronic atrophic gastritis and patchy intestinal metaplasia with Helicobacter pylori colonization; rectal sigmoidoscopy showed colonic diverticula. Abdominal ultrasound color-flow imaging confirmed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis > 70%. Angiography confirmed proximal SMA subocclusion and celiac trunk stenosis of 50%. Percutaneous angioplasty and stenting were carried out. The patient made an immediate recovery and remains without postprandial pain. DISCUSSION: CMI due to atherosclerotic occlusive disease was first reported in 1936 and is a relatively uncommon disorder. This entity usually occurs in patients over 60 years of age with other atherosclerotic symptoms. CMI presents with postprandial abdominal pain, anorexia due to <<fear of food>>, and weight loss. Despite high perioperative morbidity and mortality rates, OS revascularization has traditionally been the treatment of choice. The most frequent indications include pain relief, improvement of nutritional status, and prevention of intestinal infarction. Endovascular therapy seems to be a valid alternative, mainly in high-risk patients, with good immediate and medium-term results.},

We report a 55 year-old female, with a 2 years history of post prandial abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and weight loss, with occlusion of both mesenteric arteries and critical stenosis of the celiac artery. The initial treatment consisted in angioplasty and celiac artery stent placement in two occasions, with a brief symptomatic relief. Finally, a visceral artery bypass was performed, with good post operative outcome and complete symptomatic resolution at one year follow up. In our opinion endovascular therapy is a good therapeutic option for chronic mesenteric ischemia in high surgical risk patients, specially when dealing with stenotic injuries. It may also be a complement for patients who need to recover their nutritional status prior to revascularization surgery. On the other hand, due to the long term patency and symptomatic relief, surgical treatment is a good option in low risk patients.},

DATA SOURCES: Review of literature using Pub Med and Access Medicine. The following search terms were used: celiac disease, malabsorption syndromes, diarrhea, and gluten-free diet (GFD). There was no limitation placed on publication year. Only articles written in English were included. CONCLUSIONS: CD is a chronic systemic autoimmune disorder triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by the ingestion of gluten proteins (wheat, barley, and rye). CD often presents atypically, and diagnosis delays are common. Currently, the only effective treatment for CD is strict adherence to a GFD. This is a difficult diet to comprehend and follow. Adherence to a GFD requires ongoing education and support from a multidisciplinary healthcare team, support groups, family, and friends. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Once considered a rare disease of childhood, CD is now recognized as a common disorder that can occur at any age. Clinicians need to be cognizant of risk factors, clinical manifestations, conditions, and complications associated with CD in order to make a timely diagnosis, ameliorate symptoms, and minimize disease complications.},

To address this question, a retrospective analysis of the clinical and biological status of adult coeliac patients diagnosed in childhood, who remained on a normal diet after gluten challenge and were clinically silent, was carried out. METHODS: Patients aged 18-65 years with CD diagnosed in childhood were included. Clinical status, gluten intake, biological parameters of malabsorption, bone mineral density, human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genotype, serological markers of CD, and histological and immunohistochemical parameters in duodenal biopsies were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients had resumed a normal diet and were asymptomatic. Forty-eight showed different degrees of villous atrophy (silent CD), while 13 had no detectable atrophy (latent CD) on duodenal biopsies. Latent CD patients had significantly less osteopenia/osteoporosis (1/9 (11%) vs 23/33 (70%), p<0.001)), and lower T cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta+ intraepithelial T cell counts (38+/-20 vs 55+/-15, p<0.01) than silent CD patients. The mean age at diagnosis and first GFD was lower in latent than in silent patients (14.4+/-5 vs 40.1+/-47 months, p<0.05). Latent patients did not differ significantly from the seven control patients on a long-term GFD, except for a higher frequency of CD-specific serum antibodies. However, two latent patients relapsed clinically and histologically during subsequent follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term latency developed in about 20% of CD patients who remained symptom free after gluten reintroduction. This latency can be transient and thus a regular follow-up is mandatory. In silent patients, the increased risk of osteoporosis substantiates the need for a GFD.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The epithelium makes numerous important contributions to intestinal function. It acts as a physical barrier to prevent pathogenic infection, but allows nutrient uptake and the bidirectional passage of ions and water to lubricate the intestinal lumen while restricting fluid loss. The epithelium mediates communication between the immune system and the commensal flora, and plays a major role in antigen sampling and development of tolerance. After mucosal injury, the epithelium must reestablish its barrier and transport functions for homeostasis to be restored. Here, we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the roles of the epithelium in intestinal homeostasis. RECENT FINDINGS: Mechanisms responsible for epithelial communication with enteric flora and pathogens include the regulation and function of Toll-like receptors and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-2, and maintenance and repair of epithelial barrier properties, including the role of growth factors and bacterial peptides in epithelial repair. SUMMARY: Recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms by which the gut epithelium modulates, and is modified by, enteric flora and the mucosal immune system illuminate the importance of the epithelium in gut physiology. The work discussed may also identify novel targets that can potentially be modulated therapeutically, either with existing medications or newer agents in development.},

   abstract = {Bone health, characterized by its mass, density, and micro-architectural qualities, is maintained by a balanced system of remodeling. The lack of these qualities, caused by an uncoupling of the remodeling process, leads to bone fragility and an increased risk for fracture. The prime regulator of bone remodeling is the RANK/RANKL/OPG system. The common origin of both bone and immune stem cells is the key to understanding this system and its relationship to the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB in bone loss and inflammation. Via this coupled osteo-immune relationship, a catabolic environment from heightened proinflammatory cytokine expression and/or a chronic antigen-induced activation of the immune system can initiate a switch-like diversion of osteoprogenitor-cell differentiation away from monocyte-macrophage and osteoblast cell formation and toward osteoclast and adipocyte formation. This disruption in bone homeostasis leads to increased fragility. Dietary and specific nutrient interventions can reduce inflammation and limit this diversion. Common laboratory biomarkers can be used to assess changes in body metabolism that affect bone health. This literature review offers practical information for applying effective strategic nutrition to fracture-risk individuals while monitoring metabolic change through serial testing of biomarkers. As examples, the clinician may recommend vitamin K and potassium to reduce hypercalciuria, _-lipoic acid and N-acetylcysteine to reduce the bone resorption marker N-telopeptide (N-Tx), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), whey, and milk basic protein (the basic protein fraction of whey) to increase insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and create a more anabolic profile.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease (CD) is an enteropathy characterized by an aberrant immune response to cereal-gluten proteins. Although gluten peptides and microorganisms activate similar pro-inflammatory pathways, the role the intestinal microbiota may play in this disorder is unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the faecal microbiota of coeliac patients could contribute to the pro-inflammatory milieu characteristic of CD and the possible benefits of bifidobacteria. METHODS: The effect of faeces of 26 CD patients with active disease (mean age 5.5 years, range 2.1-12.0 years), 18 symptom-free coeliac disease (SFCD) patients (mean age 5.5 years, range 1.0-12.3 years) on a gluten-free diet for 1-2 years; and 20 healthy children (mean age 5.3 years, range 1.8-10.8 years) on induction of cytokine production and surface antigen expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined. The possible regulatory roles of Bifidobacterium longum ES1 and B. bifidum ES2 co-incubated with faecal samples were also assessed in vitro. RESULTS: Faeces of both active CD and SFCD patients, representing an imbalanced microbiota, significantly increased TNF-alpha production and CD86 expression in PBMCs, while decreased IL-10 cytokine production and CD4 expression compared with control samples. Active CD-patient samples also induced significantly higher IFN-gamma production compared with controls. However, Bifidobacterium strains suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern induced by the large intestinal content of CD patients and increased IL-10 production. Cytokine effects induced by faecal microbiota seemed to be mediated by the NFkappaB pathway. CONCLUSION: The intestinal microbiota of CD patients could contribute to the Th1 pro-inflammatory milieu characteristic of the disease, while B. longum ES1 and B. bifidum ES2 could reverse these deleterious effects. These findings hold future perspectives of interest in CD therapy.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder of the small bowel that occurs in genetically predisposed people of all ages, from middle infancy, and is caused by a reaction to gliadin, a gluten protein. Some patients are diagnosed with symptoms related to the decreased absorption of nutrients or with various symptoms which, although statistically linked, have no clear relationship with the malfunctioning bowel. Classic symptoms of CD include diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue; bowel symptoms may be limited or even absent. In this article we describe the case of a young woman with CD who presents with myointimal proliferation. However multiple cases of vessel thrombosis have been reported in patients with CD. Despite the fact that no definitive relationship between these diseases could be explained, we think this association must be remembered especially in cases of young and tenuous women with these vascular abnormalities.},

   abstract = {Pain is a common symptom of pancreatic disease and is frequently difficult to manage. Pain relief provided by narcotics is often suboptimal and is associated with significant side effects. An alternative approach to pain management in pancreatic disease is the use of celiac plexus block (CPB) or neurolysis (CPN). Originally performed by anesthesiologists and radiologists via a posterior approach, recent advances in endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) have made this technique an attractive alternative. EUS guided celiac plexus block/neurolysis is simple to perform and avoids serious complications such as paraplegia or pneumothorax that are associated with the posterior approach. EUS guided CPN should be considered first line therapy in patients with pain due to pancreatic cancer. It provides superior pain control compared to traditional management with narcotics. A trend for improved survival in pancreatic cancer patients treated with CPN has been reported, but larger studies are needed to confirm this finding. At this time, the use of EUS guided CPB cannot be recommended as routine therapy for pain in chronic pancreatitis since only one-half of the patients experience pain reduction and the beneficial effect tends to be short lived. EUS guided CPB and CPN should be used as part of a multidisciplinary team approach for pain management.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: The aim of this work is to evaluate the alterations of the oral ecosystem in symptomatic children with celiac disease (CD), to establish a particular pattern of oral markers that can be used as presumptive diagnosis of CD. MATERIAL & METHODS: A sample of n=52 children with CD diagnosis according to the modified criteria of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN), 1990, was studied. A dental clinical evaluation of soft and hard tissues was performed. Saliva samples were obtained; in which buffer capacity, total proteins, calcium and phosphate were measured and SDS PAGE 12% electrophoretic profiles were performed. In addition, oral mucosa smears were collected by brushing. RESULTS: Low frequency of enamel structural alterations was found, particularly in the permanent teeth of children with CD. These alterations had characteristics of chronological coherence (31.7%), bilateralism (26.8%) and symmetry (29.23%). The celiac smears in the celiac group (20%) showed signifcant presence of polymorphic nuclei and free nuclei. The celiac group had significant differences in buffer capacity, IgA levels, minute volume, calcium and Ca/P ratio (p<0.05). The protein profiles of CD children showed the absence of bands of low, medium and high molecular weight. CONCLUSION: Our results enable us to develop an alteration pattern corresponding to the oral ecosystem of CD children. In the CD patients, the most relevant variables were tooth enamel alterations, oral mucosa morphology, and modifications of salivary parameters, which would enable the dentist to refer these patients to specialist physician.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In celiac disease patients, peptides derived from dietary gluten are recognized by HLA-DQ2-restricted CD4(+) T cells, which results in inflammation. Such immune-stimulatory peptides are found in both gliadins and glutenins. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against these peptides can be used to screen food for the presence of such peptides. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the specificity of 5 mAbs raised against T cell stimulatory peptides found in alpha- and gamma-gliadins and in low- and high-molecular-weight glutenins and to compare it with the specificity of patient-derived T cells. DESIGN: The reactivity of the mAbs with gluten peptides, enzymatic gluten digests, and intact gluten proteins was determined and compared with that of gluten-specific T cells by using a combination of immunologic and biochemical techniques. Furthermore, the reactivity of the mAbs with gluten homologues in barley, rye, and oat was determined. RESULTS: The specificity of the mAbs largely overlaps with that of gluten-specific T cells. Moreover, mAbs detect several homologous peptides present in gluten proteins. All except the LMW-specific mAbs also detect storage proteins present in barley and rye, whereas the gamma-gliadin-specific mAbs also recognize oat proteins. CONCLUSION: The mAbs raised against T cell stimulatory peptides in gliadins and glutenins allow a comprehensive screen for the presence of harmful gluten and gluten-like proteins and peptides in food products. They can thus be used to guarantee the safety of food for celiac disease patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy caused by the ingestion of gluten, a protein fraction found in certain cereals. Immunotoxic gluten peptides that are recalcitrant to degradation of digestive enzymes appear to trigger celiac syndromes. A 33-mer peptide from alpha-2 gliadin has been identified as a principal contributor to gluten immunotoxicity. A gluten-free diet is the usual first therapy for celiac disease patients; therefore, the characterization and quantification of the toxic portion of the gluten in foodstuffs is crucial to avoid celiac damage. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop immunologic assays as a novel food analysis tool for measuring cereal fractions that are immunotoxic to celiac disease patients. DESIGN: The design focused on the production of monoclonal antibodies against the gliadin 33-mer peptide and the development of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and Western blot analysis with the use of novel antibodies. RESULTS: A sandwich ELISA method showed a detection limit for wheat, barley, and rye of <1 ppm prolamine. However, the method required a sample that was > or =1 order of magnitude greater for the detection of low-toxic oats, and there was no signal with the safe cereals maize and rice. A competitive ELISA method was also developed for detection of the toxic peptide in hydrolyzed food, which had a detection limit of <0.5 ppm gliadin. CONCLUSIONS: Both ELISAs designed for use with the toxic gliadin 33-mer peptide suggested a high correlation between the presence of the peptide and the amount of cereal that was toxic to celiac disease patients. The sensitivity was significantly higher than that of equivalent methods recognizing other gluten epitopes.},

   abstract = {Because damage to sympathetic nerve terminals occurs in a variety of diseases, we tested the hypothesis that nerve terminal damage per se is sufficient to impair ganglionic neurotransmission in vivo. First, we measured the effect of nerve terminal damage produced by the sympathetic nerve terminal toxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) on ganglionic levels of several neurotrophins thought to promote neurotransmission. 6-OHDA-induced nerve terminal damage did not decrease the expression of neurotrophin-4 or brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in the celiac ganglia but did decrease the ganglionic content of both nerve growth factor protein (nadir = -63%) and the mRNA of the alpha-3 subunit of the nicotinic cholinergic receptor (nadir = -49%), a subunit required for neurotransmission. Next, we tested whether this degree of receptor deficiency was sufficient to impair activation of celiac ganglia neurons. Impaired fos mRNA responses to nicotine administration in the celiac ganglia of 6-OHDA-pretreated rats correlated temporally with suppressed expression of functional nicotinic receptors. We verified by Fos protein immunohistochemistry that this ganglionic impairment was specific to principal ganglionic neurons. Last, we tested whether centrally initiated ganglionic neurotransmission is also impaired following nerve terminal damage. The principal neurons in rat celiac ganglia were reflexively activated by 2-deoxy-glucose-induced glucopenia, and the Fos response in the celiac ganglia was markedly inhibited by pretreatment with 6-OHDA. We conclude that sympathetic nerve terminal damage per se is sufficient to impair ganglionic neurotransmission in vivo and that decreased nicotinic receptor production is a likely mediator.},

In the absence of information on dietetic provision in coeliac disease management in the UK and with surveys in other countries suggesting that patients with coeliac disease gain most information from coeliac support groups (Green et al., 2001), Coeliac UK set out to investigate dietetic services for coeliac patients in the UK. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to dietetic departments in the UK via the Regional Managers Group of the British Dietetic Association (BDA) by email. The questionnaires were in two parts, the first was completed by the dietetic manager and the second by the dietitian with the main responsibility for the management of coeliac patients within the department. RESULTS: Over one-quarter of departments reported allocating a maximum of 1 h of dietitians' time per month per 100,000 population to seeing coeliac patients. More hours were allocated to coeliac patients in departments where dietitians had attended coeliac disease training, where dietitians were professional members of Coeliac UK or where coeliac patient care was undertaken by a multi-disciplinary team. CONCLUSION: There is wide variation in dietetic provision for diagnosed coeliac patients in the UK. The Coeliac UK survey suggests that the current level of dietetic provision is in the region of one-third of what is required according to the BSG management guidelines (British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), 2002) to provide diagnosed coeliacs with only basic support and annual review.},

Anti-transglutaminase autoantibody (tTGAb) assay is useful to detect candidates undergoing intestinal biopsy. Our aim was to investigate whether the DQB1*02 allele could influence tTGAb titers and the clinicopathological expressivity of the disease. METHODS: A total of 124 patients with celiac disease, tested for RIA tTGAb at diagnosis, were typed for HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 genes and divided according to the number of DQB1*02 alleles: group 1, homozygous; group 2, heterozygous; group 3, negative. RESULTS: The mean of tTGAb indexes was significantly higher in group 1 patients than in group 2 (P < 0.02) and group 3 patients (P < 0.01). Patients with at least 1 DQB1*02 allele showed more often a typical CD and diffuse histological lesions than did patients in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that tTGAb titers are HLA-DQB1*02 dose dependent, with significantly higher levels in homozygous individuals. Moreover, individuals with at least 1 HLA-DQB1*02 allele tend to have a more expressed clinical and histological form of celiac disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is becoming an increasingly recognized autoimmune enteropathy caused by a permanent intolerance to gluten. Once thought to be a rare disease of childhood characterized by diarrhea, celiac disease is actually a multisystemic disorder that occurs as a result of an immune response to ingested gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Screening studies have revealed that celiac disease is most common in asymptomatic adults in the United States. Although considerable scientific progress has been made in understanding celiac disease and in preventing or curing its manifestations, a strict gluten-free diet is the only treatment for celiac disease to date. Early diagnosis and treatment, together with regular follow-up visits with a dietitian, are necessary to ensure nutritional adequacy and to prevent malnutrition while adhering to the gluten-free diet for life. The purpose of this review is to provide clinicians with current updated information about celiac disease, its diverse clinical presentation and increased prevalence, the complex pathophysiology and strong genetic predisposition to celiac disease, and its diagnosis. This review focuses in detail on the gluten-free diet and the importance of intense expert dietary counseling for all patients with celiac disease. Recent advances in the gluten-free diet include food allergen labeling as well as the US Food and Drug Administration's proposed definition of the food-labeling term gluten-free. The gluten-free diet is complex and patients need comprehensive nutrition education from a skilled dietitian.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To asses the prevalence of celiac disease and to evaluate the clinical effects of a gluten-free diet on metabolic control and growth in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 261 patients with DM1. Diagnosis of celiac disease was based on the presence of endomysium and tissue transglutaminase antibodies in serum and was confirmed by intestinal biopsy. The impact of a gluten-free diet on metabolic control (mean annual HbAlc values), growth (height and annual growth velocity) and nutritional status (body mass index) was evaluated. Patients diagnosed with DM1 and subsequently with celiac disease were compared with a control group of patients with DM1 only. RESULTS: Twenty-one (8%) of the 261 diabetic patients were diagnosed with celiac disease and 19% also had another associated autoimmune disease. No significant differences were found in growth or metabolic control after withdrawal of gluten from the diet. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of celiac disease in our type 1 diabetes population. A gluten-free diet had no effects on metabolic control of diabetes or on height or weight. Nevertheless, given the high prevalence of celiac disease and the possible development of long-term complications, such as lymphoma and osteoporosis, we recommend systematic screening in all diabetic patients, especially in the first 5 years after diagnosis of DM1.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of celiac disease among blood donor volunteers based on screening by IgA antitissue transglutaminase antibody, followed by a confirmatory small intestine biopsy. METHODS: The transversal study involved 3000 potential blood donors, residing in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The participants were gender divided into 1500 men and 1500 women, with an average age 34.4+/-10.8 years, and included blood donor volunteers who could be turned down owing to anemia. All participants answered a questionnaire concerning the presence of diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain during the 3 months before the study. Each participant with human recombinant IgA antitissue transglutaminase antibody level above 10 U/ml was invited to undergo a small intestine biopsy by means of an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The presence of villous atrophy and a positive antibody test were suggestive of possible celiac disease. RESULTS: Antitissue transglutaminase antibody was positive in 1.5% (45/3000) of the study population. Among the antibody-positive group, 21 (46.6%) agreed to have a biopsy performed, and within them the histological pattern of villous atrophy was confirmed in 66.7% (14/21). Consequently, the suggestive prevalence of celiac disease was at the minimum, one per 214 of the potential blood donor volunteers. A significant association was found between celiac disease and the symptoms of diarrhea, constipation and abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of celiac disease in Sao Paulo city is high and comparable to that observed in European countries. It is possible that in Brazil the prevalence of this disease had previously been underestimated.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Sweden experienced a unique epidemic of celiac disease in children <2 years of age. The epidemic was partly explained by changes in infant feeding over time and indicated a multifactorial pathogenesis. The main aim of this study was to analyze celiac disease risk in epidemic and postepidemic birth cohorts up to preschool age, to explore further the opportunity for primary prevention. METHODS: A population-based incidence register of celiac disease in children covering the entire nation from 1998 to 2003 and part of the country back to 1973 was analyzed. European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition diagnostic criteria for celiac disease were used. The annual incidence rate for each age group and the cumulative incidence according to age for each birth cohort were calculated. RESULTS: A considerable difference in cumulative incidences of celiac disease at comparable ages was demonstrated between birth cohorts from the epidemic and postepidemic periods. The difference persisted during the preschool years, although it decreased somewhat with age. During the last years of the follow-up period, there was again a successive increase in incidence rate among children <2 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in celiac disease risk between birth cohorts at comparable ages suggests an opportunity for primary prevention. This highlights the importance of further exploring the role of infant feeding and exogenous factors besides dietary gluten that might initiate or prevent disease development. Moreover, on the basis of postepidemic incidence trends, we speculate that the Swedish epidemic might not have been as unique as thought previously, although its magnitude was striking.},

However, knowledge is limited regarding their own perspectives and experiences of managing the disease and the prescription of a gluten-free diet. The aim of this study was to explore how adolescents with coeliac disease perceive and manage their everyday lives in relation to a gluten-free diet. METHODS: In total, 47 adolescents with coeliac disease, divided into 10 focus groups, were interviewed. In the qualitative analysis, themes emerged to illustrate and explain the adolescents' own perspectives on life with a gluten-free diet. RESULTS: The probability of compliance with the gluten-free diet was comprised by insufficient knowledge of significant others, problems with the availability and sensory acceptance of gluten-free food, insufficient social support and their perceived dietary deviance. Three different approaches to the gluten-free diet emerged: compliers, occasional noncompliers, and noncompliers. Each approach, as a coping strategy, was rational in the sense that it represented the adolescents' differing views of everyday life with coeliac disease and a prescription of a gluten-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: dolescents with coeliac disease experience various dilemmas related to the gluten-free diet. The study demonstrated unmet needs and implies empowerment strategies for optimum clinical outcomes.},

METHODS: Prospective nationwide Swedish incidence register of CD in children 0-15 years of age, with the present analysis covering the period from 1998 to 2003. ESPGHAN diagnostic criteria for CD were used. Regions were classified according to the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics. The incidence rate for each region, gender, age group and year of diagnosis was calculated. RESULTS: A regional variation in CD risk was demonstrated. The childhood populations in 'West Sweden' and 'Smaland and the islands', situated in the southern part of the country, had a significantly higher incidence rate compared to in 'North Middle Sweden' and 'Stockholm', situated in the central part. This regional variation was not explained by variations in risk by gender, age at diagnosis or year of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The Swedish regional variation in CD risk supports multifactorial disease aetiology. Continued efforts are warranted to define factors, besides gluten exposure, that modulate CD risk.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study that compared the response to HBV, tetanus, rubella, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines between children with CD and age- and sex-matched control subjects. RESULTS: The study population included 26 patients with CD and 18 age- and sex-matched controls. All had received the full complement of childhood vaccinations. A significantly higher proportion of subjects in the CD group (14 of 26) failed to respond to HBV vaccine compared with controls (2 of 18; 53.9% vs 11.1%; P < 0.05). Patients with CD were 8.33 times more likely to test negative for hepatitis B surface antigen than control subjects (95% CI, 1.5-46.5). By contrast, all of the subjects in both groups tested positive for rubella antibodies; only 1 subject in the CD group tested negative for tetanus antibody versus none in the control group (3.9% vs 0%; P = 1.0). The percentage of subjects who tested negative for Hib antibodies was similar in the 2 groups (CD, 33.3%; control, 44.4%; P = 0.53). CONCLUSIONS: More than 50% of children with CD do not show a response to standard vaccination regimens for HBV. Given the large number of children with CD throughout the world, this observation suggests that there is a large HBV-susceptible population despite widespread vaccination. Current immunization strategies may need to be reassessed to protect this population and achieve the goal of universal protection.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a permanent intolerance to gluten characterized by destructions of the small intestinal villi and malabsorption. The gluten-free diet (GFD) results in healing of the mucosa, resolution of the malabsorpitive states, and reversal of great part of CD effects. Among the extradigestive complications associated with CD, unexplained infertility has been reported since the 70's. The prevalence of CD among women with unexplained infertility is 2.5-3.5%, higher, although not always significantly, than control population. To date, it is widely accepted that untreated CD represents a risk for abortion, low birth weight babies and short-breast feeding period. These features can be corrected by GFD. Some discrepancies could stem from the heterogeneity of the studies. Regarding a potential pathogenic mechanism, since CD causes malabsorption of folic acid and other nutrients, this pathway has been proposed to explain the unfavourable outcomes of pregnancy. However, this remains a speculation. In conclusion, each woman with unexplained infertility should be screened for CD.},

An association of LG with Helicobacter pylori infection or celiac disease (CD) has been suggested. The aim of this study was to verify the relation of LG with CD, with and without H pylori infection, in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 164 children with CD diagnosed between June 2003 and October 2005, in whom gastric and duodenal biopsies were performed simultaneously, were enrolled prospectively. The control group was composed of 164 children without CD, matched for sex and age, who were undergoing upper digestive endoscopy. H pylori was searched for in gastric biopsy specimens sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and a modified Giemsa stain for H pylori was performed for confirmation. The Student t test was used to compare quantitative measurements between groups. RESULTS: LG was found in 69 (42.1%) patients with CD. Positive cases had a mean of 43.9 +/- 1.5 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 surface epithelial cells, compared with a mean of 13.4 +/- 0.4 in negative cases and 7.8 +/- 0.5 in non-CD control children (P<0.0001). Patients not showing LG did, however, show significantly increased gastric intraepithelial lymphocytes compared with the control children. Nine of 164 CD patients, and 4 of 69 patients with LG, had positive results for H pylori. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports a pathogenetic relation between CD and LG. CD without LG also showed increased gastric intraepithelial lymphocytes. H pylori infection may be another cause of LG in children.},

DESIGN: A pilot study during the period March-May 2005, filling out a questionnaire. SETTING: All nursery and primary schools in a Northern Italian region (Friuli Venezia Giulia). SUBJECTS: There were 479 eligible schools RESULTS: Global response rate was of 29.6%. In 77.5% (110/142) of the schools there were children with food-related pathologies. Programs about nutrition were carried out by 44.4% (63/142) of the schools in the previous two years; 9.5% (6/63) dealt with food-related pathologies and 57.1% (36/63) required the intervention of outside experts to have these projects realized. In the same period training courses about nutrition for teachers were conducted in 9.2% (13/142) of the schools. CONCLUSIONS: Data provide a first overview of the situation in Italy on food-related topics in children attending nursery and primary schools. Therefore many programs could not rely on funds to be developed, but had to use internal resources of the school.},

Based on the same principle, a whole blood self-tTG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), especially applicable to large-scale screening of celiac disease, has been produced. We assessed the value of this new test in celiac disease antibody detection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The new test uses endogenous tTG found in red blood cells of whole blood in IgA-class tTG-ab measurement by detecting tTG-tTG-ab complexes formed after hemolysis of the whole blood sample. Stored whole blood samples from 150 untreated celiac disease patients and 107 control individuals without celiac disease were evaluated, and the test results were compared with those of the whole blood rapid test, 2 conventional serum-based tTG-ab ELISA tests, and 2 EMA tests. RESULTS: A total of 15 whole blood samples were found to be clotted or dried after storage and were excluded from further evaluation. The whole blood ELISA test had a specificity (98%) comparable to that of the conventional serological tests, the sensitivity (91%) being slightly lower. The test was concordant with the whole blood rapid test in 92% of cases, with 2 serological ELISA tests in 91% and 94% of cases and with EMA tests in 94% and 93% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Whole blood self-tTG-based testing is accurate in celiac antibody detection, also when an ELISA method is applied. The testing requires no serum separation or external tTG.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The treatment of pain in patients with pancreatic cancer is a difficult topic for the patients and their physicians. There are different treatment modalities with variable results. Celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN) is a technique with good previous results using fluoroscopy, CT guidance and recently, guided by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). The aim of this study is to report the experience of EUS guided CPN (EUS CPN) for treatment of abdominal pain in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer diagnosed by CT, MRI and/or EUS were included. The measurement of pain was made with a visual analog pain scale applied before and after the procedure. Follow up was made at weeks 2 and 4 after the procedure. The use of morphine before and after EUS CPN was evaluated. Complications related to the procedure were recorded. RESULTS: Eleven patients (five men and six women) underwent to the procedure, the mean age was 59 years (range 43-82). In follow-up at four weeks after the procedure, pain scores were reduced by at least 5 points of visual analog pain scale in 9 (72.2%) patients. At least a fifty percent reduction in pain or more was documented in 7 (63.6%) patients. Five patients substantially reduced their pain medication. No complications were seen in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The EUS NPC is an efficient and safe method for pain treatment in those patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer.},

   abstract = {The treatment of celiac disease is a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet for life. In the past, oats were considered to be toxic to individuals with celiac disease and were not allowed in a gluten-free diet. However, recent evidence suggests that oats that are pure and uncontaminated with other gluten-containing grains, if taken in limited quantities, are safe for most individuals with celiac disease. For adults, up to 70 g (1/2 to 3/4 cup) of oats per day and for children, up to 25 g (1/4 cup) per day are safe to consume. These oats and oat products must fulfill the standards for a gluten-free diet set by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada. The Canadian Celiac Association, in consultation with Health Canada, Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, has established requirements for growing, processing, and purity testing and labelling of pure oats. These strategies have led to the production of pure, uncontaminated oats for the first time in Canada. Oats and oat products that are safe for consumption by individuals with celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are now commercially available in Canada.},

In celiac disease (CD), a permanent and marked increase of gammadelta+ IELs has been described. However, there is a lack of knowledge about this peculiar IELs population in other intestinal pathologies. AIM: To analyze the percentage of IELs, specifically gammadelta+ IELs subset, present in duodenal mucosa biopsies from patients with CD and compare it with those obtained from patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Twelve patients with untreated CD, 8 patients with SIBO, and 10 patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS were evaluated. All subjects underwent upper endoscopy for mucosal biopsy and jejunal aspirate. From 2 small bowel biopsies, intraepithelial cells were isolated and labeled with the following monoclonal antibodies CD103-PE (phycoerythrin), CD3-FITC (fluoresecein isothio-cynate), CD-7R-PE, CD45RO-APC (allophycocyanin), and TcR gammadelta-FITC. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a standard FACScan. Total and IELs subset counts were expressed as percentage. RESULTS: Mean total IELs percentage was 16.7+/-6% in IBS, 25.4+/-17% in SIBO, and 26+/-13% in CD patients (P=0.2). CD and SIBO patients, had significantly higher percentages of gammadelta+ IELs (15.7+/-13% and 14.6+/-8%) than IBS subjects (4.1+/-2.5%, P<0.05). There was no difference between CD and SIBO (P=0.6). CONCLUSIONS: An increased density of gammadelta+ IELs is typical, but not specific for CD. A similar increase was observed in subjects with SIBO. Our findings suggest that this unique T-cell population might have a key role against intestinal bacterial infections.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent studies have shown that celiac disease (CD) could affect 0.5% to 3% of the general population, including Mexican Mestizos, which represents a complex mixture of genetics, and constitutes the core of Mexican and Latin American populations. However, the association between CD and other conditions, specifically type-1 diabetes mellitus, in this population remains unknown. Thus, our aim was to determine the prevalence of both serologic and biopsy proven CD in Mexican Mestizo adults with type-1 diabetes. METHODS: Over a 6-month period, serum samples obtained from consecutive Mexican Mestizo adult patients (age >or=18 y) with type-1 diabetes were tested with a new generation human recombinant protein based IgA tissue transglutaminase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay commercial kit. All patients with positive serologic test results underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and small intestinal biopsies to confirm CD. RESULTS: Eighty-four type-1 diabetic patients were included (62 women, mean age 28.9+/-9 y). Overall, 9 patients (9/84) were positive for IgA tissue transglutaminase with a point prevalence of 10.7% (95% CI, 4%-17%). Seven patients agreed to undergo endoscopy. Five subjects had biopsy-proven CD (5.9%, 95% CI, 1.9%-13.3%). One patient had chronic diarrhea and other abdominal bloating; whereas the remaining 3 were asymptomatic. CD associated type-1 diabetic patients tended to have higher hemoglobin A1c levels (P=0.07), reflecting poor glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: As in other populations, we demonstrated a high prevalence of biopsy-proven CD (5.9%) among Mexican Mestizo patients with type-1 diabetes. Clinicians should be aware of this common association in this ethnic group.},

Oat (Avena sativa) is distinct among the cereals due to its multifunctional characteristics and nutritional profile. Recent advancement in food and nutrition has revealed the importance of its various components. It is a good source of dietary fiber especially beta-glucan, minerals and other nutrients. Oat and oat by products have been proven to be helpful in the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Oat bran in particular, is good source of B complex vitamins, protein, fat, minerals besides heart healthy soluble fiber beta-glucan. The beta-glucan has outstanding functional properties and is of immense importance in human nutrition. Different physiological effects of beta-glucan are related to its viscosity, attenuation of postprandial plasma glucose and insulin responses, high transport of bile acids towards lower parts of the intestinal tract and high excretion of bile acids thereby lowering of serum cholesterol levels. Moreover, it is helpful against coeliac disease. The incorporation of oat grains and oat bran in the food products improves not only the nutrition but also a therapy against various maladies.},

   abstract = {Enteropathy defines abnormalities of the small intestinal mucosa of various etiologies in which nutrition has a causal or a therapeutic role. Breast milk is the gold-standard feeding during infancy for optimal nutrition in health and the majority of diseases. Therapeutic formulae have decreased the need for enteral or parenteral support. Gastrointestinal infections are worldwide the most frequent cause of enteropathy by increasing mucosal permeability, local expression of costimulatory molecules allowing antigen penetration in the mucosa, and T-cell activation leading sometimes to disruption of oral tolerance. Concomitant malnutrition impairs not only the immunologic response but also the recovery of damaged mucosa with secondary intestinal and pancreatic enzymatic reductions. Optimal nutritional rehabilitation is the cornerstone of the management of persisting diarrhea. Celiac disease and cow's milk protein allergy are examples of chronic enteropathy. Multiple food allergies, even during breast-feeding, are increasingly reported due to an impaired development of oral tolerance. The dietary approach to allergic disease is currently evolving from passive allergen avoidance to active modulation of the immune system to (re)establish tolerance. The gastrointestinal flora provides maturational signals for the lymphoid tissue, improves balance of inflammatory cytokines, reduces bacterial invasiveness and dietary antigen load, and normalizes gut permeability. The clinical effects of nucleotides and zinc merit further clinical evaluation. Major attention has recently focused on the immune effects of dietary lipids in terms of possible prevention of allergic sensitization by downregulating inflammatory response and protecting the epithelial barrier and host-microbe interactions modifying the adherence of microbes to the mucosa.},

   abstract = {Enteropathy defines abnormalities of the small intestinal mucosa, visible with the light microscope, of various etiologies, that can be separated into acute versus chronic conditions. This review focuses on these areas in which recent progress has been made. Severe infections increase mucosal permeability and induce local expression of co-stimulatory molecules allowing antigen penetration in the mucosa, T cell activation and possible disruption of oral tolerance. Biotherapeutics are of importance in the prevention and treatment of (chronic) enteropathy of infectious origin. Celiac disease and cow's milk protein allergy are key examples of chronic enteropathy. The dietary approach to allergy has evolved to include active stimulation of the immature immune system in order to support the establishment of tolerance. Supplementation with probiotics may provide maturational signals for the lymphoid tissue and improve the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Enteral polymeric feeding is effective in Crohn's disease. Dietary nucleotides may improve growth and immunity, optimize maturation, recovery and function of rapidly dividing tissue. Adequate dietary lipids are important not just for caloric value but also for immune-modulatory effects. Lipids may prevent allergic sensitization by downregulating inflammatory response (n-3 but not n-6 fatty acids) whilst protecting the epithelial barrier, regulating immune function and modifying the adherence of microbes to the mucosa, thereby contributing to host-microbe interactions.},

   abstract = {Exfoliative erythema of malnutrition is a collective term for skin lesions caused by a combination of multiple deficiencies in vitamins, microelements, essential fatty acids and amino acids. We report a 3-year-old Iraqi girl with malnutrition due to coexisting coeliac and Hartnup's disease. On admission to hospital, she presented with kwashiorkor, anaemia, hepatitis and hypoalbuminia. She had severe skin changes with erythema, desquamation, erosions and diffuse hyperpigmentation involving the whole integument, particularly the perioral area, trunk and legs. She also had angular cheilitis, glossitis, conjunctivitis and diffuse alopecia. After treatment with a high-protein gluten-free diet and supplementation with vitamins and microelements there was a rapid improvement in the skin lesions. The severity of the skin lesions in this case can be explained by the coexistence of two metabolic diseases causing complex malnutrition.},

   abstract = {Since the 1990's, the widespread use of very sensitive and specific serological tests has completely changed the conditions of the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). The active form of the disease is now only the tip of the iceberg representing it. Currently, CD is evoked either in front of mild digestive symptoms at the usual age or in the course of screening in siblings of an index case or in patients at risk (insulin dependent diabetes for example) at a later age using IgA anti-endomysium or anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, the sensitivities and specificities of which exceed 90%. In some cases, HLA typing is helpful in allowing to exclude a patient who is neither DQ2 nor DQ8. The intestinal biopsy remains the "gold standard" of the diagnosis showing villous atrophy; the latter, however, is less and less often severe as the disease is milder and milder. The diagnosis of CD then rests on the confrontation of the clinical, biological and histological data. Once CD has been diagnosed, it can be classified either as active or silent (positive serology with isolated villous atrophy), or latent (positive serology with a normal mucosa) and the appropriate therapeutic decision can be taken.},

   abstract = {Hyper-transaminasemia (HT) is a well-known laboratory sign of celiac disease (CD); however, hyper-creatine phosphokinase (CK)-emia (HCK) is not so familiar. As there are reported cases of myopathy associated CD in the literature, we aimed to investigate serum CK levels of children with CD. Newly diagnosed 126 children were included. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and CK levels were determined. Mean age was 8.7+/-4.4 years (11 mo to 18 y). Of patients, 77 (61.1%) had classic form, 49 (38.9%) had atypical form. Elevated levels of AST, ALT, and CK, respectively, were found in 65 (51.6%), 45 (35.7%), and 50 (39.7%) patients. Isolated HCK was detected in 9 (7.1%) patients. AST, ALT, and CK were all elevated in 29 (23.0%) children. Mean serum AST, ALT, and CK levels were found as 56.1+/-53.7 U/L (11 to 403), 44.7+/-44.0 U/L (7 to 290), and 258.0+/-686.5 U/L (36 to 5956), respectively. In 95 (75.4%) children, AST/ALT value was greater than 1, and in 19 (15.1%) it was greater than 2. We found positive correlations with the level of CK and AST, and ALT (P=0.01). CK level was inversely correlated with hemoglobin and cholesterol levels (P=0.013 and 0.007). In conclusion, this is the first study, which determined elevated serum levels of CK in CD and demonstrated that HCK is as common as HT in children with CD. We emphasize that HT seen in CD is not necessarily a sign of liver injury, but may also be due to myopathy.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder occurring in genetically susceptible individuals, triggered by gluten and related prolamins. Well identified haplotypes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region (either DQ2 [DQA*0501-DQB*0201] or DQ8 [DQA*0301-DQB1*0302]) confer a large part of the genetic susceptibility to celiac disease.Celiac disease originates as a result of a combined action involving both adaptive and innate immunity. The adaptive immune response to gluten has been well described, with the identification of specific peptide sequences demonstrating HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 restrictive binding motifs across various gluten proteins. As for innate immunity, through specific natural killer receptors expressed on their surface, intra-epithelial lymphocytes recognize nonclassical major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I molecules such as MICA, which are induced on the surface of enterocytes by stress and inflammation, and this interaction leads to their activation to become lymphokine-activated killing cells. Four possible presentations of celiac disease are recognized: (i) typical, characterized mostly by gastrointestinal signs and symptoms; (ii) atypical or extraintestinal, where gastrointestinal signs/symptoms are minimal or absent and a number of other manifestations are present; (iii) silent, where the small intestinal mucosa is damaged and celiac disease autoimmunity can be detected by serology, but there are no symptoms; and, finally, (iv) latent, where individuals possess genetic compatibility with celiac disease and may also show positive autoimmune serology, that have a normal mucosa morphology and may or may not be symptomatic.The diagnosis of celiac disease still rests on the demonstration of changes in the histology of the small intestinal mucosa. The classic celiac lesion occurs in the proximal small intestine with histologic changes of villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Currently, serological screening tests are utilized primarily to identify those individuals in need of a diagnostic endoscopic biopsy. The serum levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)A anti-tissue transglutaminase (or TG2) are the first choice in screening for celiac disease, displaying the highest levels of sensitivity (up to 98%) and specificity (around 96%). Anti-endomysium antibodies-IgA (EMA), on the other hand, have close to 100% specificity and a sensitivity of greater than 90%. The interplay between gliadin peptides and TG2 is responsible for the generation of novel antigenic epitopes, the TG2-generated deamidated gliadin peptides. Such peptides represent much more celiac disease-specific epitopes than native peptides, and deamidated gliadin antibodies (DGP) have shown promising results as serological markers for celiac disease. Serology has also been employed in monitoring the response to a gluten-free diet.Despite the gluten-free diet being so effective, there is a growing demand for alternative treatment options. In the future, new forms of treatment may include the use of gluten-degrading enzymes to be ingested with meals, the development of alternative, gluten-free grains by genetic modification, the use of substrates regulating intestinal permeability to prevent gluten entry across the epithelium, and, finally, the availability of different forms of immunotherapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is overrepresented among patients with Down syndrome (DS), who frequently lack any typical symptoms. Therefore, screening for CD is recommended in this high-risk group. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of CD in Arab children with DS and evaluate the contribution of immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA), IgA and IgG tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies, and IgA anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) to screen for CD in children with DS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 52 Arab patients with DS and 52 healthy Arab control subjects were studied for CD using various serological markers. Data on age, sex, weight, height, gastrointestinal symptoms, and endocrine abnormalities were recorded. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) was studied in patients undergoing small intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: Five patients with DS were IgA TTG-positive and only 1 patient with DS was IgG TTG-positive. EMA was negative in all patients with DS. TTG (IgA and IgG) and EMA were negative in all control children. IgA AGA was positive in 12 patients with DS and 3 control subjects (P = 0.02), whereas IgG AGA was positive in 41 patients with DS and 26 control subjects (P = 0.004). Only children testing positive for TTG underwent upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsy. Two children with DS were diagnosed with CD. Both patients were IgA TTG-positive. One was HLA DQ2-positive and another was negative for HLA DQ2 and DQ8. CONCLUSIONS: CD is prevalent (3.8%) in Arab patients with DS. Based on our cohort, IgA TTG is useful in diagnosing patients with CD and DS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: A previous study that evaluated the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in a cohort of healthy blood donors, found that 3.8% of subjects had positive serology for CD. The aim of the present study was to examine how the screening results and the diagnosis of CD affected these patients' lifestyle and attitude toward CD. METHODS: All subjects with positive serology for CD (n = 59) found in the previous study of healthy blood donors (n = 1571) were contacted and interviewed. Data collected included current and previous symptoms compatible with CD, medical follow up since being informed of positive serology for CD and adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD). Information was obtained regarding attitude towards the screening for CD, the results of the screening, and the effect of screening on subjects' lifestyle. RESULTS: Of the 59 subjects, 51 were available for telephone interview, including all 10 subjects diagnosed with CD (positive serology and biopsy), 17/20 with positive serology and normal intestinal mucosa, and 24/29 with positive serology who refused to undergo intestinal biopsy. Of the 10 patients diagnosed with CD, four adhere to GFD. Only 1/17 subjects with normal intestinal mucosa repeated serology. Two of the 24 who initially refused a biopsy, underwent an intestinal biopsy, and one of them was currently diagnosed with CD. Only one patient diagnosed with CD had all his family members screened for CD. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that many of the patients identified in this screened population do not ultimately benefit from the purpose of the screening, which was early identification and treatment of a common disease with potential serious consequences.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The presence of oats in gluten-free diet is controversial. The aim of this work is to evaluate if different varieties of oats exert different toxicity in coeliac disease. METHODS: Three varieties of oats were tested by two in vitro assay based on the known ability of peptic-tryptic digests of coeliac-active proteins to agglutinate K562 cells and to disrupt lysosomes, respectively. RESULTS: Avenins from the Italian variety Astra and the Australian variety Mortlook were much more active than the Australian variety Lampton. Gliadin, digested in the same way, certainly displayed more activity than all three avenins, but rice (var. Roma) did not have measurable activity. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that some varieties of oats may be potentially harmful to individuals with coeliac disease and therefore should be excluded from the gluten-free diet required to maintain good health in coeliac disease. It is important to realize that constant, small amounts of active proteins in the diet, such as certain avenins, may prevent complete recovery of the intestinal mucosa in this disease.},

If oats is confirmed to be safe, it would be a valuable component and offer more variation in a gluten-free diet. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether avenins from different varieties of oats show different abilities in the activation of coeliac peripheral lymphocytes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In order to assess whether the immunogenic effect of oats varies according to the cultivar, peripheral lymphocytes from 10 coeliac children were exposed to avenins from four different oats varieties: Lampton, Astra, Ava and Nave. Lymphocyte proliferation and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release in the culture medium were measured as indexes of immune activation. RESULTS: All the varieties of oats tested were immunogenic, with Lampton and Ava avenins inducing lymphocyte activation similar to that activated by wheat gliadin, while Astra and Nave avenins showed less immunogenicity, but still with a measurable effect. CONCLUSIONS: There are still concerns about the suitability of including oats in a gluten-free diet. Coeliac patients consuming oats-containing food should be carefully monitored, until there is more evidence to show the safety of oats and varieties of low-toxicity oats.},

Molecules able to shift the immune response from a Th1- to a Th2-type response have been suggested as therapeutic agents for Th1 autoimmune diseases. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the possibility that a decapeptide from durum wheat (p10mer, QQPQDAVQPF), which was previously shown to prevent the activation of celiac peripheral lymphocytes, may promote a shift from a Th1- to a Th2-type immune response in gluten-specific intestinal T cells of CD patients. DESIGN: Intestinal T lymphocyte lines derived from 8 children with CD were incubated with gliadin peptides both alone and simultaneously with p10mer. Cell proliferation and the production of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 by these T cells were measured. RESULTS: The incubation of celiac intestinal T cells with deamidated gliadin peptides resulted in a significant (P < 0.008) increase in cell proliferation and interferon-gamma release, whereas the simultaneous exposure to p10mer totally abolished the cell proliferation and cytokine release. Moreover, incubation with p10mer maintained an elevated release of interleukin-10, whereas exposure of the cells to culture medium only did not. The replacement of the residues of aspartic acid in position 5 or those of alanine in position 6 in the sequence of p10mer resulted in peptides with no activity in the activation experiments. CONCLUSION: In vitro, p10mer showed the ability to shift the pathogenic immune response of a CD patient from a Th1- to a Th2-type response.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antagonist effect of 10mer, a decapeptide (sequence QQPQDAVQPF) from alcohol-soluble protein fraction of durum wheat, assessing its ability to prevent celiac peripheral blood lymphocytes from activation by gliadin peptides. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from DQ2-positive untreated coeliac children and from healthy controls and incubated with the peptic-tryptic digest of bread wheat gliadin (GLP) and peptide 62-75 from alpha-gliadin both alone and with 10mer simultaneously. PBMC proliferation, release of pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokines interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, release of immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10, and analysis of CD25 expression as indexes of lymphocytes activation were carried out. Enhanced lymphocytes activation was seen after exposure to GLP and p62-75, whereas the simultaneous incubation with 10mer inhibits the lymphocytes response. These data indicate that a peptide naturally occurring in durum wheat exerts in vitro an antagonist effect against gliadin toxicity and could have a protective effect in CD disease.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is a T helper 1-driven autoimmune permanent enteropathy, triggered in susceptible individuals by the ingestion of gluten, the alcohol-soluble protein fraction of some cereals, such as wheat, rye, and barley. The only available treatment for CD is the life-long withdrawal of gluten-containing foods from the diet. Complying with gluten-free diet is difficult and affects the quality of life. Therefore, alternative therapies are being investigated. In this paper, we review a new therapeutic strategy for CD, relying upon peptides that are analogs of gliadin T-cell epitopes that show the ability to down-modulate the immune response pathogenic of CD. These peptides have been obtained artificially by amino acids substitution of gliadin T-cell stimulatory sequences and an immunomodulatory sequence has been identified in the alcohol-soluble protein fraction of cultivars of durum wheat.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between coeliac disease (CD) and neoplasms has been long established, but few data are available about the risk factors. The aim of this paper is to estimate the risk of developing a neoplasm among non diagnosed coeliac patients and to evaluate if this risk correlates with the age of patients at diagnosis of coeliac disease. METHODS: The study population consists of patients (n = 1968) diagnosed with CD at 20 Italian gastroenterology referral Centers between 1st January 1982 and 31st March 2005. RESULTS: The SIR for all cancers resulted to be 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0-1.7 p < 0.001. The specific SIRs for non Hodgkin lymphoma was 4.7; 95% CI = 2.9-7.3 p < 0.001, for the small bowel carcinoma 25; 95% CI = 8.5-51.4 p < 0.001, for non Hodgkin lymphoma 10; 95% CI = 2.7-25 p = 0.01, finally for the stomach carcinoma 3; 95% CI = 1.3-4.9 p < 0.08. The mean age at diagnosis of CD of patients that developed sooner or later a neoplasm was 47,6 +/- 10.2 years versus 28.6 +/- 18.2 years of patients who did not. CONCLUSION: Coeliac patients have an increased risk of developing cancer in relation to the age of diagnosis of CD. This risk results higher for malignancies of the gastro-intestinal sites. An accurate screening for tumors should be performed in patients diagnosed with CD in adulthood and in advancing age.},

We followed 1,757 celiac patients for a total period of 31,801 person-years, collecting data about the frequency of gluten intake and the incidence of the enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Out of the nine celiac patients who developed an intestinal lymphoma [standard morbidity ratio of 6.42 (95% CI = 2.9-12.2; P < 0.001)], only two kept a strict gluten-free diet after the diagnosis of celiac disease and developed the malignancy after the peridiagnosis period of 3 years, dropping therefore the standard morbidity ratio to 0.22 (95%CI = 0.02-0.88; P < 0.001). The risk of developing an intestinal lymphoma for the celiac patients that used to have dietary gluten was significant (X(2 )= 4.8 P = 0.01). These results show that a strict gluten-free diet is protective towards the development of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Celiac disease can be treated by following a strict gluten-free diet for life. If properly followed, the diet resolves symptoms and nutritional deficiencies. It is generally recommended that individuals with celiac disease have careful long-term follow-up. However, it is not clear which elements of disease status evaluation, laboratory investigations and self-management support should be included in follow-up. OBJECTIVES: To examine the current practice guidelines and recommendations regarding follow-up of individuals with celiac disease. METHODS: Guidelines issued by gastroenterological societies and associations, and recommendations by experts were retrieved using Medline and other Internet search engines. RESULTS: Practice guidelines were available from the American Gastroenterological Association; the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition; the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference 2004; the World Gastroenterology Organization; the British Society for Gastroenterology and the United Kingdom-based Primary Care Society for Gastroenterology. Most guidelines recommended a scheduled annual review and regular measurements of body mass index. The British Society for Gastroenterology recommended dietary review only at times of stress, while others recommended dietary review with a nutritionist. All associations recommended serial tissue transglutaminase antibody testing. The American Gastroenterological Association and the Primary Care Society for Gastroenterology recommended annual hemoglobin, ferritin and folate checks. One guideline recommended annual hemoglobin, electrolyte, calcium, albumin, ferritin, folate, fat-soluble vitamin, liver function test, parathyroid hormone and bone density measurements (approximately $400 per patient). CONCLUSIONS: The current practice guidelines regarding the follow-up of patients with celiac disease varied greatly in their recommendations and many were not evidence-based. Prospective studies are required to develop rational, cost-effective and risk-stratified guidelines for long-term follow-up of these patients.},

   abstract = {Unexplained diarrhoea is a frequent indication for gastroenterologic referral, and after full investigation the most common final diagnosis is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Some patients with IBS describe an acute onset of symptoms following infective gastroenteritis. Postinfective IBS affects 7% to 31% of individuals infected, and appears to be a nonspecific response to injury which has been reported following Salmonella-, Campylobacter-, and Shigella-related IBS. The strongest risk factor for developing postinfective IBS is severity of the initial diarrhoea illness, but toxigenicity of the infected bacteria, age <60 years, and female sex also are important risk factors. Adverse life events, hypochondriasis, and depression are also important, as is increased enteroendocrine cell and lymphocyte numbers in rectal biopsies. Postinfective IBS and IBS with diarrhoea without an infectious onset both show increased postprandial release of serotonin, whilst constipated patients show a depressed release. Several studies suggest impairment of the serotonin transporter in IBS, which in animal studies has been shown to occur following a range of inflammatory insults. Clinical conditions with an inflammatory basis, such as coeliac and Crohn disease, also are characterised by excess postprandial serotonin release. Several studies report evidence of low-grade inflammation in IBS with diarrhoea. However, reliable markers of low-grade inflammation that may predict response to serotonin antagonists or other anti-inflammatory agents remain a goal for future research.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the causes of short stature in children with special emphasis on growth hormone deficiency. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Paediatrics, Military Hospital, Rawalpindi and Combined Military Hospital, Multan from September 2004 to January 2007. METHODOLOGY: Two hundred and fourteen children (140 boys and 74 girls), ranging from 02 to 15 years presenting with short stature were studied. Height and weight were plotted on appropriate growth charts and centiles determined. Relevant hematological and biochemical investigations including thyroid profile were done. Bone age was determined in all cases. Growth hormone axis was investigated after excluding other causes. Karyotyping was done in selected cases. Data was analyzed by SPSS 10.0 by descriptive statistics. Mean values were compared using t-test. RESULTS: In this study, the five most common etiological factors in order of frequency were Constitutional Growth Delay (CGD), Familial Short Stature (FSS), malnutrition, coeliac disease and Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD). In 37.4% of patients, the study revealed normal variants of growth - CGD, FSS or combination of both, 46.7% cases had nonendocrinological and 15.9% had endocrinological etiology. CGD (22.1%) in males and FSS (27%) in females were the most common etiology. GHD was found in 6.1% children and it comprised 38.2% of all endocrinological causes. Children with height falling below 0.4th centile were more likely to have a pathological short stature (79.2%) compared to 39.3% whose height was below 3rd centile but above 0.4th centile (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CGD and FSS are most common causes of short stature in boys and girls respectively, whereas, GHD is a relatively uncommon etiology.},

AIM: The aim was to explore dilemmas experienced by close relatives living with a person suffering from coeliac disease, and to describe the strategies they used to deal with these dilemmas. METHODS: Twenty-three informants were interviewed. A systematic inductive qualitative method, the critical incident technique was used. RESULTS: Disease-related worries included having bad conscience about not being affected by the disease, experiencing anxiety and witnessing the vulnerability of the affected relative in social situations. Dilemmas related to manage daily life were connected with increased domestic work, restricted freedom of action and the diseased person's preferential right of interpretation of health risks associated with the coeliac disease and deviations from the diet restrictions. Dilemmas related to disturbances in social life, concerned lack of information, knowledge and understanding. Different strategies were described to manage daily life. CONCLUSIONS: Close relatives experienced a variety of dilemmas that affected the situation of the whole family. The role of relatives in handling the coeliac disease with the diseased person in the everyday life might be underestimated, and to provide relatives with better knowledge regarding the disease might improve the situation also for patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The dysregulation of adaptive immunity is extensively investigated in celiac disease (CD). Recent data also suggest, however, the implication of innate immunity in CD. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a central role in the initiation or maintenance of innate immune responses. The aim of this study was to characterise the expression of TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 in duodenal biopsy samples taken from children with CD and from controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Duodenal biopsy specimens were collected from 16 children with untreated CD, 9 children with treated CD, and 10 controls. The mRNA expression of TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Protein levels of TLRs were determined by Western blot. RESULTS: We found higher TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression and protein levels in the duodenal mucosa of children with treated CD and untreated CD compared with controls. TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression and protein levels were even higher in the duodenal mucosa of children with treated CD than in untreated CD. TLR3 mRNA expression was increased in the duodenal mucosa of children with treated CD compared with untreated CD and controls. We were able to detect TLR3 protein only in the biopsy specimens of treated patients with CD. CONCLUSIONS: The alteration of TLR2 and TLR4 expression in the duodenal mucosa of patients with CD supports the potential implication of innate immune system in the pathomechanism of this disease.},

   abstract = {Gastric reflexes are mediated mainly by vago-vagal reflex circuits in the caudal medulla. Despite the fact that brainstem vago-vagal circuitry remains intact after spinal cord injury (SCI), patients with SCI at the cervical level most often present gastric stasis with an increased risk of reflux and aspiration of gastric contents. Using a miniature strain gauge sutured to the gastric surface; we tested gastric motility and reflexive gastric relaxation following oesophageal distension (oesophageal-gastric relaxation reflex) in animals 3 days after a severe spinal contusion at either the third or ninth thoracic spinal segment (acute T3- or T9 SCI, respectively). Both basal gastric motility and the oesophageal-gastric relaxation reflex were significantly diminished in animals with T3 SCI. Conversely, both basal gastric motility and the oesophageal-gastric relaxation reflex were not significantly reduced in T9 SCI animals compared to controls. The reduced gastric motility and oesophageal-gastric reflex in T3 SCI rats was not ameliorated by celiac sympathectomy. Our results show that gastric stasis following acute SCI is independent of altered spinal sympathetic input to the stomach caudal to the lesion. Our data suggest that SCI may alter the sensitivity of vagal reflex function, perhaps by interrupting ascending spinosolitary input to brainstem vagal nuclei.},

   abstract = {Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type II (APS-II) is the most common immunoendocrinopathy syndrome. APS-II is defined by the development of two or more of the following entities: primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), Graves' disease, type 1A diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyroiditis, primary hypogonadism, celiac disease, and myasthenia gravis. Other frequent clinical findings are vitiligo, alopecia, pernicious anemia and/or serositis. Primary adrenal insufficiency in these patients affects the adrenal cortex, which is destroyed by autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase. Unlike other causes of adrenal insufficiency (infectious diseases, infiltrative diseases, bleeding, tumors), the adrenal medulla is not involved. Pheochromocytomas are tumors arising from the chromaffin cells of the sympathetic nervous system in the adrenal medulla. The clinical symptoms of these tumors vary from isolated hypertension or hypertension accompanied by paroxysmal episodes -including the classical triad of headache, palpitations and diaphoresis-to potentially serious manifestations such as acute pulmonary edema, arrhythmias and sudden death. Nevertheless, up to 40% of affected patients are asymptomatic. We present the case of a patient diagnosed with APS-II who developed a pheochromocytoma. In this patient, the adrenal gland cortex was atrophied and the tumor was attached to the adrenal medulla. This coexistence of endocrinopathies, with no etiologic connection, is a surprising finding, which has not previously been described in the current literature.},

It is characterised by an increase in serum amylase due to circulating high molecular mass macrocomplexes, most often formed due the binding of the amylase to an immunoglobulin. With a normal renal function, a hyperamylasaemia without an increase in urine amylase suggests the diagnosis, and is confirmed by identifying the macromolecular components. It is an uncommon entity in paediatrics. It has been described as a casual finding associated to abdominal pain and to celiac disease. We report two paediatric cases of macroamylasaemia, and a review of the tests needed for its diagnosis. The better understanding of this biochemical anomaly allows us to differentiate it from other situations associated to hyperamylasaemia, in order to avoid additional invasive explorations and unnecessary treatments.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TG2) immunoglobulin A (IgA) autoantibodies are detectable in the serum of most patients with untreated celiac disease (CD). Their deposits in the intestine of patients with CD with severe enteropathy are considered specific for this condition. The histological spectrum of CD includes cases with normal villous architecture. The aim of this study was to look for anti-TG2 IgA deposits in the intestine of children with normal villous architecture and to relate them with other markers of gluten sensitivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 57 children with normal duodenal villous architecture and markers of gluten sensitivity were considered. Of those, 39 showed positive serum anti-endomysium antibodies and/or high levels of anti-TG2 antibodies (group 1), and 18 were seronegative with only a greater density of gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes (group 2). Thirty-four children with no markers of gluten sensitivity and a normal mucosa represented the control group (group 3). The duodenal sections of all patients were investigated for deposited anti-TG2 IgA by double immunofluorescence. Human lymphocyte antigen molecular typing was performed. RESULTS: In group 1 and in group 2, 33 of 39 children (85%) and 12 of 18 children (66%) showed subepithelial anti-TG2 IgA intestinal deposits, respectively. Only in 3 of 34 (8.8%) children with no markers of gluten sensitivity were anti-TG2 IgA deposits noted. CONCLUSIONS: A subgroup of children with no serum CD-associated autoantibodies, but greater density of gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes, shows a clear anti-TG2 IgA deposition in the duodenal mucosa. These children must be investigated further for possible gluten sensitivity.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the last few years, knowledge about coeliac disease has significantly improved, resulting in a better understanding of disease pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy. This review describes the latest progress in research concerning treatment with gluten-free diet in patients with coeliac disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Gluten-free diet is generally admitted as effective therapy in symptomatic patients, but a life-long dietary treatment in some challenging cases such as 'silent' and 'latent' patients is under discussion. Tolerance to gluten may be acquired later in life, but, as latency may be transient, a strict follow-up is necessary in these patients. The composition of gluten-free diet needs a better definition; latest evidence demonstrates that oats are tolerated by most patients with coeliac disease. Finally, the amount of gluten permitted in gluten-free products is still a matter of debate; significant progress has been made in the sensitivity of techniques for gluten detection, but the daily amount of gluten that can be safely consumed is not yet defined. SUMMARY: Gluten-free diet remains the cornerstone of therapy of coeliac disease. More studies addressing the need of gluten-free diet for cases of 'potential' coeliac disease are necessary, as well as studies linking the best available analytical detection of gluten to the clinical threshold of tolerance.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease is a disease of the small intestine caused by an immune response to ingested gluten. This response results in characteristic damage to the villi, resulting in malabsorption. It is far more prevalent and its presentation can be far more subtle than once recognized. The prevalence of celiac disease in children in the general U.S. population is estimated to be 1 in 100. Toddlers and young children classically present with failure to thrive, diarrhea, and abdominal distension sometime after the introduction of gluten in the diet, but more often they present with subtle gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation. Some children may be asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients and high-risk individuals should have serologic testing and testing of their total immunoglobulin A. Seropositive patients should undergo upper endoscopy and small-bowel biopsy of the distal duodenum. Treatment is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. Families must meet with a dietician and should be strongly encouraged to participate in celiac support groups. The gastroenterology nurse is in an unparalleled position to assist parents of children newly diagnosed with celiac disease to identify the necessary lifestyle changes to make their child's life gluten free.},

The magnitude of the beneficial effect of breastfeeding on blood pressure (-2 mmHg) and total cholesterol (-0.2 mmol/l) is likely to have public health implications. However, it is unknot known whether breastfeeding reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality. Breastfeeding may protect against the development of celiac disease. The protective role of breastfeeding against type 1 diabetes seems likely, but the mechanisms involved are still under discussion. There is no convincing evidence that breastfeeding reduces the risk of leukemia and cancer. Breastfeeding is associated with a better cognitive development (-3 points) that is present as early as at 6 months of age and sustained throughout childhood and adolescence. The benefits of breast milk may be related to its high content in docosahexaenoic acid which plays an important role in brain development. Increasing the duration of breastfeeding is correlated with an increase in cognitive development.},

The patient's neurologic symptoms preceded the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma by 11 months. These symptoms improved after surgical removal of the tumor and chemotherapy. The small cell carcinoma was relatively small and was not associated with gallstones. In spite of the small size of the tumor, it metastasized to a celiac lymph node and probably to the liver. Anti-Hu paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy should be added to the list of paraneoplastic syndromes associated with small cell carcinoma of the gallbladder.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The development of a disease-specific, health-related, quality-of-life questionnaire for children ages 8 to 18 with celiac disease (CD), together with a parent-as-proxy version. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a focus-group method (bottom-up approach) to investigate the impact of CD on children's everyday lives and selected 24 items to create a preliminary disease-specific questionnaire. This questionnaire, together with the complementary generic quality-of-life questionnaire DUX-25, was sent to 756 children with CD in the Netherlands and was returned by 530 of them. With the help of statistical analyses (Cronbach alpha, factor analysis, Pearson correlation, Student t test, paired samples t test, and item response theory), we tested the psychometric performance of the 24 items. RESULTS: We reduced the questionnaire to 12 items: the Celiac Disease DUX (CDDUX). The CDDUX has 3 subscales: "Communication" (3), "Diet" (6), and "Having CD" (3). This questionnaire proved to be reliable, valid, and feasible and able to discriminate between perception of severity in cases of CD as assessed by parents. CONCLUSIONS: Children with a better perception of their own health status have a higher score on the CDDUX questionnaire. The whole group seems to have a lower quality of life than the healthy reference group on all domains of the DUX-25. The new disease-specific questionnaire CDDUX provides information about how children with CD think and feel about their illness. The questionnaire may enable researchers and clinicians to determine the consequences of this illness and the effects of clinical interventions on several aspects of daily living.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: In the present paper, the toxicity of prolamines derived from three cereals with a different genome was investigated in human colon cancer Caco-2/TC7 and human myelogenous leukemia K562(S) cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate if species from ancient wheat could be considered as healthy food crops devoid or poor in cytotoxic prolamines for celiac disease. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was measured in terms of inhibition of cell growth, activation of apoptosis, release of nitric oxide (NO), detection of tissue transglutaminase (TG II) and alteration of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) on Caco-2/Tc7 and K562 (S) cell agglutination. Peptic-tryptic (PT) digest from bread wheat (T. aestivum S. Pastore) was used as a positive control. RESULTS: PT digests of prolamins from spelt wheat (T. aestivum ssp. spelta) were found to exert toxic effects on Caco-2/TC7 cells and to agglutinate K562(S) cells. Increased amounts of NO and TG II expression were observed in Caco-2/TC7 cells exposed to 1 mg/mL of spelt prolamins, suggesting that spelt wheat can induce cellular mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. By contrast, the PT digests from monoccum wheat (Triticum monococcum) and farro wheat (T. turgidum ssp. dicoccum) did not exhibit any negative effects on Caco-2/TC7 and K562(S) cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results have shown a constant and significant toxic effect of spelt wheat which is not shared by the two other ancient cereals. Future studies on celiac intestinal organ cultures are needed to increase the prospects of breeding programs aimed at developing wheat cultivars potentially tolerated by most celiac patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of gluten-free diet (GFD) compliance on the quality of life (QOL) of adolescents with coeliac disease (CD), and the impact of patient's age at time of diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: Participants included 365 subjects: 283 adolescents (10-20 years old) with biopsy-proven CD and 82 adolescents without a chronic condition matched for age, sex, education, and social status. Their subjective QOL-comprising physical, mental, and social dimensions as defined by the World Health Organization-was measured and has been analyzed according to compliance status and age at CD diagnosis. RESULTS: Adolescents noncompliant with GFD reported a lower general QOL, more physical problems, a higher burden of illness, more family problems, and more problems in leisure time than adolescents who are compliant with GFD. More frequent GFD transgressions were associated with poorer QOL. Higher problem anticipation and higher feelings of "ill-being" were found in the noncompliant group. No differences between compliant patients with CD and adolescents without any chronic condition were found in all QOL aspects. Adolescents with a late CD diagnosis showed more problems at school and in social contact with peers, as well as worse physical health and higher CD-associated burden. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with GFD is an essential factor to obtain optimal QOL. Psychosocial and educational support should be provided for patients having difficulties strictly adhering to GFD. Early CD onset and diagnosis is associated with better physical health, lower CD-associated burden and fewer social problems, indicating the importance of the earliest CD diagnosis possible.},

Intestinal malabsorption syndromes such as celiac and Crohn's disease are known to cause deficiencies of lipid-soluble nutrients. We hypothesized that subjects with nutrient malabsorption syndromes will demonstrate lower carotenoid levels in the macula and blood, and that these lower levels may correlate with early-onset maculopathy. Resonance Raman spectrographic (RRS) measurements of macular carotenoid levels were collected from subjects with and without a history of malabsorption syndromes. Carotenoids were extracted from serum and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Subjects with malabsorption (n = 22) had 37% lower levels of macular carotenoids on average versus controls (n = 25, P < 0.001). Malabsorption was not associated with decreased serum carotenoid levels. Convincing signs of early maculopathy were not observed. We conclude that intestinal malabsorption results in lower macular carotenoid levels.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Short stature is one of the presenting symptoms of celiac disease (CD), and growth acceleration can be achieved with gluten-free diet (GFD). However, the data regarding final adult height of CD patients are scarce and inconclusive. Our aim was to evaluate the adult height of CD patients in relation to the age at diagnosis: < or =18 yr or >18 yr. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to CD patients > or =18 yr of age, who were either members of the Israeli Celiac Association or patients followed by the pediatric gastroenterology unit, including questions about height, weight, gender, age at diagnosis, and GFD adherence. The height Z scores were calculated for each patient. RESULTS: In total, 290 patients (M/F = 83/207), age 38.9 +/- 15.5 yr (range 18-76), were included: 113 were diagnosed before and 177 after 18 yr of age (groups 1 and 2, respectively). The mean adult height was: 178.4 +/- 6.6 cm and 176.2 +/- 8.6 cm for men (P= 0.22), and 163.0 +/- 6.6 cm and 162.6 +/- 6.5 cm for women (P= 0.68) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The height Z scores were 0.230 +/- 0.931 and -0.07 +/- 1.19 for men (P= 0.22), and -0.05 +/- 1.02 and -0.101 +/- 0.990 for women (P= 0.68) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The final height inversely correlated with age at diagnosis in men (R =-0.275, P= 0.012) but not in women (R =-1.0, P= not significant [NS]). CONCLUSIONS: The final height of patients with CD is similar to the general population. The adult height of male patients with CD is inversely related to the age at diagnosis. Delayed diagnosis of CD may lead to a shorter adult height in men but not in women.},

   abstract = {This review of the current scenario of celiac disease (CD) in India covers both pediatric and adult CD. CD is primarily reported from northern India with isolated case reports from the rest of the country. CD cases among Indian children are associated with multiple DR3-DQ2 haplotypes. Delay in diagnosis is contributed by multiple factors including atypical presentations. Use of serological tests, IgA EMA and anti-tTG antibodies, along with modified ESPGHAN criteria provides a definitive diagnosis of CD. Dietary management is often difficult due to non-availability of labeled and marketed gluten-free foods. A majority of children with CD show normalization of nutrition, substantial improvement in growth parameters and attainment of healthy percentile curves on gluten-free diet. Small bowel histology remarkably improves but does not normalize even after 2-3 years on gluten-free diet. The true burden of the disease should be addressed by large epidemiological studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Follow-up studies on growth and histological recovery of children with celiac disease (CD) while on a gluten-free diet (GFD) are lacking from Asia. We therefore assessed the effects of this diet. METHODS: Forty-two children with CD were enrolled. Weight and height were expressed as weight for height (WfH) and height standard deviation scores (HSDS), respectively. Twenty-five children had repeated duodenal biopsies after 1-2 years and 14 had a third biopsy after 3-7 years of GFD. Compliance was checked by regular interview and IgA antiendomysial antibody estimation (EMA). RESULTS: At diagnosis (n = 25), mean HSDS was -3.3 +/- 1.6 with 76% having a HSDS of <-2; 60% were undernourished (WfH mean 81.6 +/- 5.7). Over a mean follow up of 3.7 years, HSDS improved to -1.3 +/- 1.7 and 84% cases achieved normal nutrition. Mean height velocity was 13.9 cm during first year and 5.6 cm in subsequent years. Small-bowel biopsies at diagnosis showed subtotal villous atrophy (Marsh IIIb) in 18 (72%) and partial villous atrophy (Marsh IIIa) in seven (28%) patients. Repeat biopsy at 1-2 years showed shift from subtotal to partial villous atrophy in 94% (n = 17/18) and normalization in one patient. In patients with Marsh IIIa improvement of partial villous atrophy was observed in all. Immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody was negative in 81%. Repeat biopsies at 5 years of GFD showed improvement to Marsh I-II, but none normalized. CONCLUSION: The majority of children with CD show normalization of nutrition and growth after GFD. Small-bowel histology improves markedly but does not normalize even after 5 years of GFD.},
