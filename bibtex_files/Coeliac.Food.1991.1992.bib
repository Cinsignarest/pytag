We found that the disease does not compromise educational achievement and working capacity of patients. A majority of our coeliacs are students (from primary school to university) and rather successful ones since 55% of them passed their previous year examinations. Some are already employed and work as clerks, artisans, masons or skilled workers. 89.6% of our patients reported to be on a strict gluten-free diet, 9% introduce small amounts of gluten and 1.4% are on a normal diet by their own decision. Coeliac patients originating from Northern Italy have more of their gluten-free foods home made and use more gliadin free cereals (rice, maize), whereas coeliacs originating from the Southern regions consume more ready made gluten-free foods. We have assessed the amount of gluten-free products consumed monthly by our patients and their food preferences. Females eat less than males and prefer bread and flour based dishes, whereas males east more pasta and biscuits.},

   abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) is caused by ingestion of gluten-containing foods by gluten-sensitive individuals. The gluten causes malabsorption by damaging their intestinal mucosa. Adherence to a gluten-free diet is not simple, because the composition of foods stocked on store shelves is often not known, Patients with CD, particularly when adolescent, often refuse to comply with the diet; and parents are occasionally unable, or unwilling, to prepare gluten-free food. Furthermore, school teachers are usually ignorant of the specific dietary requirements of these patients. We examined physical, scholastic, and social aspects of CD patients in comparison with their siblings in the same age groups (10-18 years) to determine whether CD and the need to keep a diet influence these parameters. 25 CD patients and 14 of their siblings were interviewed at home where they filled a questionnaire. The mean adherence to a gluten-free diet was 96.6%; the heights of the patients were comparable to those of their siblings. We did not find significant differences in scholastic achievement and social adjustment between patients and siblings. It appears that children and adolescents with CD can live with their disease and keep a gluten-free diet while performing satisfactorily in school. However, some complained of difficulties, such as feeling uneasy at social gatherings, wanting to discuss their disability with friends, and feeling unhappy. Some were angry at society for pitying them and considering them as having a disease, while the patients considered themselves as having a food sensitivity.},

In the untreated group, 95% of patients had enteric protein loss with values higher than the upper limit of normality (mean +/- 2 SD). In the treated group of patients, only 22% had abnormal levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance. Sixteen patients who had elevated clearance before treatment had decreased clearance after an average of 7.4 months on a gluten-free diet. There was a significant relation (p less than 0.05) between the alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and the degree of alteration of the jejunal histological structure. We conclude that enteric protein loss is a very frequent finding in celiac patients and the measurement of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance may be a reliable method to evaluate the activity of the disease and useful in following the efficacy of treatment.},

Nowadays there are no diagnostic tests with good reliability excluding the IgE-mediated clinical pictures. Recently the evaluation of antibodies (IgA and IgG classes) versus milk proteins has been proposed as reliable test. In order to establish the pattern of antibody response against milk proteins we studied 37 children (17 males and 20 females), aged from 3 months to 6 years, divided as follows: 23 with CMPI of which 16 suffering from gastrointestinal complaints (GI) and 7 from cutaneous ones (CT); 5 children with coeliac disease; 9 normal healthy children without any clinical manifestation. All children at the time of the assessment assuming a diet containing cow's milk proteins. IgA, IgG and IgM antibody classes against cow's milk proteins such as alpha-lactoalbumin (alpha LA), beta-lactoglobulin (beta LG), casein (CAS) and pooled proteins (PPL) were measured using an ELISA method. The results obtained in the various groups were as follows: CMPI-GI group: the percentage of positivity for alpha LA-IgA was 43.8% and alpha LA-IgG 68.7%, for beta LG-IgA was 50% and beta LG-IgG 75%, for CAS-IgA was 43.8% and CAS-IgG 68.7%, for PPL-IgA was 37.5% and PPL-IgG 62.5%. CMPI-CT group: the percentage of positivity for alpha LA-IgA was 42.8% and alpha LA-IgG 57.1%, for beta LG-IgA was 71.4% and beta LG-IgG 42.8%, for CAS-IgA and CAS-IgG was 85.7%, for PPL-IgA was 71.4% and PPL-IgG 57.1%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Large doses of non-EC enzymes are associated with increased serum urate (SU) and urinary uric acid (UUA) but data are unavailable for EC enzymes. This study compared the effectiveness and safety of a relatively large dose (patient's usual dose) versus a small dose (1/4 usual dose) of EC enzymes in nine nourished children with CF, regarding decreasing fecal fat and stool nitrogen losses and maintaining normal SU and UUA concentrations. A crossover study design randomly assigned large or small doses to two consecutive 7 day treatment periods within each child. Large doses of EC enzymes reduced steatorrhea and increased SU and UUA. SU was normal with both treatments and UUA was normal, i.e., 17 of 18 values were between the 10th and 95th percentiles for healthy children eating a normal diet. When fat excretion was greater than 10% with small doses of EC enzymes, large doses resulted in reduced fat excretion and normal UUA. These data suggest that large doses of EC enzymes reduce steatorrhea and are safe in patients who have malabsorbtion with small doses.},

This study compared the effectiveness of enteric coated (EC) pancreatic enzymes given before meals with those given during meals (15 minutes after beginning of meal) in reducing steatorrhea in well-nourished children with cystic fibrosis. Eight children (6 years 11 months old to 14 years 7 months old) were studied in the General Clinical Research Center at Indiana University Hospital, Indianapolis. A crossover study design randomly assigned enzymes before or during meals during two consecutive 7-day treatment periods for each child. No difference in fat excretion was documented for the total group when the children who took enzymes before meals were compared with those who took enzymes during meals. However, a stepwise multiple regression analysis of the difference (before minus during) in fat excretion on sex, age, enzyme number, and treatment order documented a positive correlation of age with fat excretion (r = .83). Mean fat excretion in younger children (less than 10 years old) decreased significantly when enzymes were given before meals (7.14 +/- 1.95%) rather than during meals (9.92 +/- 1.61%) (P = .004). The difference in fat excretion (mean = 2.78 +/- 0.55%, range = 1.4% to 4%) translates into a half to one full year's growth potential. Younger children with cystic fibrosis may benefit clinically from taking EC enzymes before meals.},

However, CCK doses used in behavioral experiments are generally much larger than those necessary to produce electrophysiological changes in vagal afferents. We made automated measurements of liquid food intake before, during, and after infusion of low doses of CCK octapeptide (CCK-8) through a chronic aortic catheter with its tip seated just above the celiac juncture. In parallel experiments, we made similar infusions while collecting blood from the hepatic portal and jugular veins for CCK assay. Injection of 10, 30, 50, and 70 pmol of CCK-8 suppressed feeding in a dose-dependent manner beginning 1 min postinfusion. The lowest dose to produce statistically significant suppression of preinfusion intake was 30 pmol. Infusion of the same CCK-8 doses into the jugular vein did not suppress feeding. Near-celiac injection of 30 pmol of CCK-8 produced systemic plasma CCK concentrations averaging 6.5 +/- 1 pM compared with less than 1 pM after saline injection. These findings show that exogenous CCK, by acting on tissues perfused by the celiac artery, can suppress feeding at doses that 1) are similar to those producing effects on the firing of vagal neurons and 2) do not increase plasma CCK concentrations above postprandial levels.},

Thirty-four departments representing a population of 7.18 million reported 1944 cases of coeliac disease among 804,935 children born between 1978 and 1987. The cumulative incidence of coeliac disease was 1.7 per 1000 live births in children born between 1978 and 1982 and doubled to 3.5 per 1000 live births in children born after 1982. The highest incidence was found in the southern and south-eastern regions of the country. The observed increase may have been influenced by changes in infant feeding practices such as the postponed age of introduction of gluten from four to six months of age and an increase in gluten content of proprietary baby foods.},

Infants in developed settings experience twice the hospitalization rate and more severe illness from lower respiratory tract infection, primarily respiratory syncytial virus. In developing countries the mortality risk is 4-fold. for otitis media, the relative risks were 3.3-4.3 for Finnish infants. Bacterial meningitis and/or bacteremia had a 4-fold risk for hospitalization in a Connecticut study, and a 3-fold relative risk in 2 developing country studies. Human milk was the best preventative for bacteremia and necrotizing enterocolitis in prematures in British neonatal units. A 20-fold reduction in neonatal deaths occurred in Philippine study of breastfeeding, especially in low birth weight babies. Diarrhea causes the most infant mortality in developing nations, where bottle-feeding raises rates 14-fold. In the U.S. estimated relative risks is 3.7 for diarrheal mortality. Sudden infant death is about 1/5 less common in U.S. breast fed babies than in bottle fed. There is evidence for better long-term health after breast feeding in disorders such as celiac disease, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, malignant lymphoma, chronic liver disease, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies. The design of good studies of protection conferred by breast feeding, and the possible modes of action of breast milk are discussed.

   abstract = {In 10 children with cystic fibrosis and persisting steatorrhoea, supplementation with taurine (30-40 mg/kg/day) was given for two months as an adjunct to the usual pancreatic enzyme treatment. A three day fat and energy balance was performed in patients with cystic fibrosis, before and after the supplementation, and in seven healthy controls who did not receive taurine. Faecal fat was measured by a gravimetric method and stool energy was determined using a bomb calorimeter. Patients with cystic fibrosis, before and after taurine, and healthy controls received the same fat and energy intake (calculated by a dietitian). In patients with cystic fibrosis taurine did not produce any improvement of steatorrhoea (mean (SD) faecal fat 8.7 (3.3) v 11.2 (7.0) g/day, respectively before and after the supplementation), of faecal energy loss (0.978 (0.468) v 1.133 (0.539) MJ/day), of faecal fat expressed as percent of fat intake (13.4 (5.6) v 15.1 (9.8)%), and of faecal energy expressed as percent of energy intake (9.9 (3.6) v 11.2 (5.7)%). Healthy controls had significant lower fat (3.5 (2.3) g/day) and energy 0.576 (0.355) MJ/day faecal losses. In conclusion, taurine failed to decrease significantly fat and energy losses. Our study does not support the use of taurine supplementation in the nutritional management of cystic fibrosis.},

This permeability of the intestinal mucosa, which depends mostly on the size of the molecule and the state of the mucosa, can be studied with the assistance of protein macromolecules in an allergy-immunological investigation, or with inert markers, so permitting evaluation of the state of integrity of the small intestine. The markers used are polyethylene glycols (PEG) of various molecular weights, Cr EDTA, the monosaccharide sugars mannitol or rhamnose and the disaccharide sugars lactulose or cellobiose. Study of the intestinal permeability to inert markers allows detection of coeliac or Crohn's disease. It can be repeated, especially at the time of food provocation tests needed in the diagnosis of food intolerances in pediatrics in the enteropathology to cows milk proteins, atopic dermatitis and irritable colon in children.},

   abstract = {A dodecapeptide of A-gliadin, which shares amino acid homologies with the E1b protein of adenovirus 12, was used to produce murine monoclonal antibodies. Five monoclonal antibodies were produced and were screened by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay, immunodot assay, and immunoblotting. The antibodies were tested against whole wheat gliadin and its alpha, beta, gamma, and omega subfractions, and the prolamins of rye, barley, oats, maize, millet, rice, and sorghum. Four of the five antibodies cross reacted with one or more of the coeliac non-toxic cereals--maize, millet, sorghum, and rice. The monoclonal antibody that did not cross react with these non-toxic cereals, did not recognize Frazer's fraction III, a peptic-tryptic digest of wheat gluten which is known to be toxic. The results suggest that the A-gliadin dodecapeptide shares a region of homology with cereals that do not exacerbate coeliac disease. This study does not support the hypothesis that prior infection with adenovirus 12 is a precipitating factor in coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Intrinsic factor is produced by the gastric parietal cell. Its secretion is stimulated via all pathways known to stimulate gastric acid secretion: histamine, gastrin, and acetylcholine. There is, however, a different mode of secretion for both substances: atropine, vagotomy, and H2 receptor antagonists inhibit both intrinsic factor and acid secretion, but secretin and the hydrogen-potassium ATPase antagonist omeprazole have no effect on intrinsic factor while substantially reducing acid secretion. Cobalamin in food is bound to animal protein. Cobalamin deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake is rarely seen in extreme vegetarians (vegans). In the stomach cobalamin is liberated from its protein binding by peptic digestion and bound to R-proteins. Hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria, whether medically induced or not, may impair cobalamin uptake. The cobalamin-R-protein complex is split by pancreatic enzymes in the duodenum, where cobalamin is bound to intrinsic factor. Pancreatic insufficiency may lead to cobalamin deficiency. Lack of intrinsic factor is the commonest cause of cobalamin deficiency; very rarely, aberrant forms of intrinsic factor are produced, but the clinical syndrome is similar. Gram-negative anaerobe bacteria bind the cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex, and bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine diminishes cobalamin resorption. Parasitic infections with fish tape-worm and Giardia lamblia are also associated with cobalamin malabsorption. The cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex binds to the ileal receptors in the terminal ileum. Cobalamin absorption may be impaired after resection or by diseases affecting more than 50 cm of the terminal ileum, such as Crohn's disease, coeliac disease, tuberculosis, lymphoma or radiation. There is clearly a wide diversity in the aetiology of cobalamin deficiency, which requires a versatile diagnostic approach.},

   abstract = {Vascular reconstruction for chronic intestinal ischemia can be accomplished by endarterectomy or aortomesenteric bypass. In our practice, antegrade bypasses from the supraceliac aorta to the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery are currently the most frequently used techniques. Such reconstructions often use multiple or bifurcated large diameter vascular prostheses and have demonstrated excellent long-term patency. Despite these salutory results, we have noted an unusual perioperative response in three of these patients, which is the subject of this report. All three patients underwent uncomplicated elective mesenteric revascularization with grafts (diameter greater than or equal to 6 mm) originating in the supraceliac aorta. Indications for operation included (1) history of postprandial pain, (2) documentation of weight loss, and (3) angiographic evidence of advanced atherosclerotic disease with appropriate collateral development. Episodes of abdominal pain occurred 5 to 20 days after operation when normal food intake was reinstituted. In two patients immediate angiograms revealed patent grafts with diffuse mesenteric vasospasm. Treatment with intravenous hyperalimentation and nifedipine for 10 days resulted in complete resolution of symptoms. In the third patient, symptoms were totally relieved by temporary reduction in oral intake and administration of nifedipine. A later angiogram revealed a patent graft. All patients have remained asymptomatic and regained normal weight. This pattern of postrevascularization pain has not been seen in our patients undergoing revascularization with small (i.e., venous) conduits originating in the infrarenal aorta. The cause appears to be a heightened myogenic response of a "protected" vascular bed when suddenly exposed to the high perfusion pressure and blood flow of large caliber antegrade conduits. Prophylaxis with calcium channel blockers and use of smaller diameter grafts (5 mm) may avoid this disturbing syndrome.},

Milk cells from normal and coeliac subjects were analysed by manual immunofluorescence and milk and blood cells from normal subjects were analysed by flow cytometry. Milk cells from two coeliac subjects were tested for proliferation to gluten antigen. The CD4:CD8 ratio of milk lymphocytes from both normal and coeliac subjects was similar (0.78-1.1), but lower than that present in blood (1.5-2.1). The IL-2R expression of milk lymphocytes from both coeliac and normal subjects was increased by 3-6 times compared with peripheral blood cells. For example, IL-2R was present on 27.3% of milk CD3+ lymphocytes and on 8.0% of blood CD3+ lymphocytes from normal subjects. gamma delta- and HML-1+ T cells were increased 4.2-fold and 12-fold respectively compared with blood lymphocytes. Milk cells from coeliac subjects showed specific proliferation to gluten but not to soya bean antigen. We conclude that milk cells have a 'mucosal' phenotype, with increased gamma delta-TcR, CD8+ and HML-1+ T cells, and have an increased proportion of activated cells. Milk cells from coeliac subjects have no 'toxic' phenotype, but show functional reactivity by specific proliferation to gluten antigen.},

Doppler indices of flow velocity from the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries were measured immediately before, and at postprandial time intervals up to 60 minutes after, a first feed of 1 ml of milk given through a nasogastric tube. There were no significant differences between the preprandial and postprandial values of blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions, and pH. The median peak systolic velocity (PSV) (55.9 cm/sec) and time average mean velocity (TAV) (10.6 cm/sec) before the feed at the superior mesenteric artery rose progressively and significantly to postprandial peaks of 88.5 cm/sec and 20.5 cm/sec at 45 minutes, respectively. Significant postprandial rises in the median PSV and TAV values at the coeliac artery were also observed, with a peak at 45 minutes. There were no significant correlations between blood flow velocity indices (preprandial or postprandial) and gestational age, postnatal age, conceptional age, or birth weight. We conclude that the first exposure of preterm babies to a small volume of milk feed is associated with postprandial changes in blood flow velocity consistent with an increase in blood flow in the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries, although the mechanism of this response is uncertain.},

Anti-gliadin antibody concentrations were lower in affected dogs than controls, and correlated with immune complex formation as assessed by C1q binding.

On the other hand, when weaning was postponed after 6 months of age, growth faltering in some breastfed infants and iron-deficiency anemia in infants fed non-fortified formulas or cow's milk were observed. Two broad categories--"baby foods" and "cereal-based weaning foods"--are on the market in Austria. "Baby foods" include complete meals sold in jars, soups, desserts and puddings, fruit juices, nectars, and vegetable juices. "Cereal-based weaning foods" are composed of one or more cereals either alone, or with the addition of vegetables, fruits, milk and milk products, egg, or other ingredients.

   abstract = {Coeliac disease in children is frequently associated with a slow growth rate. This observation may be linked to the malabsorption that occurs in these patients; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. To better understand this phenomenon, we have studied the growth patterns of 153 patients with coeliac disease for 2-9 years. Gastro-intestinal biopsies were performed before and after gluten exclusion. In a second group of 79 children, somatostatin levels and binding properties in the plasma and jejunal mucosa were measured. In a third group of 40 patients we measured insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGF-BP3) levels. We found that in children diagnosed before 2 years of age weight was the most affected growth parameter. In children diagnosed after this age, height was more affected. Suppression of gluten intake induced an acceleration of growth velocity. Although plasma levels of somatostatin were not significantly altered, somatostatin concentrations in the jejunal mucosa of patients in the active phase of the disease were significantly elevated (p < 0.05). Children with coeliac disease exhibited significantly lower levels of IGF-BP3 when compared to patients with normal stature and growth velocities. In contrast, these patients showed an increase in IGF-BP3 levels after gluten exclusion from the diet.},

   abstract = {Levels of serum IgA, IgG, and IgG subclass antibodies to a variety of dietary antigens were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays in 14 adults with untreated coeliac disease and in 10 disease controls selected because of raised total IgG activities. The untreated coeliacs showed somewhat higher total IgG activity (p approximately 0.05) and significantly raised IgA and IgG1 + IgG3 activities to gliadin but reduced IgG4 activity (p less than 0.02) compared with the controls. High IgA and IgG1 + IgG3 activities were positively correlated (r = 0.67, p less than 0.01), and so were IgG and IgG4 activities (r = 0.64, p less than 0.02). Conversely, a high IgG2 response to gliadin appeared related to a low IgA response (r = 0.55, p less than 0.05). The IgG2 response was most prominent to oat flour antigens, followed by IgG1; and the main response to soy antigens resided in IgG1, followed by IgG2 in both disease groups. There was no difference in antibody activities to oat and soy between the two groups, and raised activity to bovine serum albumin was seldom encountered. The IgA activity to alpha-lactalbumin and ovalbumin tended to be increased in the coeliacs compared with the controls. The IgG4 subclass dominated the IgG response to beta-lactoglobulin and ovalbumin and was often raised to alpha-lactalbumin, especially in the disease controls. The IgG subclass pattern to casein parallelled that to gliadin with dominance of the IgG1- and IgG3-subclass activities, especially in the coeliacs. The phlogistic potential of a response in these two subclasses might be relevant to the pathogenesis of coeliac disease and could contribute to a raised IgA gliadin response by increasing mucosal permeability. IgA activity seemed to be highest against antigens usually involved in IgE mediated food allergy.},

Thirty-seven children (mean age 2.6 +/- 2.1 years) with total atrophy of the intestinal villi and 79 controls (mean age 3.5 +/- 2.8 years) were studied. All subjects underwent a small-bowel biopsy, a D-xylose absorption test, a rapid triglyceride absorption test, and a steatocrit determination first on an uncontrolled diet and then again after a standard fatty meal. The steatocrit test after a fatty meal did not detect any false-positive or false-negative results, while the D-xylose test showed two false-negative and four false-positive results, and the rapid triglyceride absorption test found two false-negative and 23 false-positive results. We conclude that the determination of steatocrit after a standard fatty meal is a useful, simple, and noninvasive test to identify patients with total intestinal villous atrophy.},

Recently it has turned out that we should discriminate the role of the efferent vagus from that of the afferent vagus in the pancreatic hormone secretion. The hepatic branch is the main pathway of afferent fibers in the vagus, while the celiac (pancreatic) branch is the main pathway of efferent fibers. We investigated the role of the afferent and efferent vagus on the development of VMH obesity using the sectioning of the hepatic and celiac branch. Celiac vagotomy decreased insulin secretion and food intake, while hepatic vagotomy did not change them. The results suggested that the efferent vagus plays the main role in the development of VMH obesity, while the role of afferent vagus seems less apparent.},

By use of a chronic arterial catheterization technique, the effects of 1, 2, and 4 micrograms/kg BN on liquid food intake of nondeprived male rats were assessed. Comparisons were made between the effects of these doses infused into the celiac or superior mesenteric arteries or injected intraperitoneally. The satiating potency of exogenous BN was significantly enhanced by direct administration into the celiac artery, which directly perfuses the stomach, pancreas, liver, spleen, and proximal duodenum. By this route, 4 micrograms/kg BN produced greater than 60% suppression of 15-min food intake. By contrast, BN infused into the superior mesenteric artery was no more effective than intraperitoneal injection. Celiac infusion of 1 micrograms/kg BN produced a suppression (30%) of intake that was equivalent to, or exceeded, that obtained after intraperitoneal injection or superior mesenteric infusion of 4 micrograms/kg. These results strongly support an upper abdominal, and possibly gastric, site for the satiety action of peripherally administered BN.},

Eighteen patients were studied 2 years or more postoperatively. Assessment of food intake concerning protein, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals showed deficiency in seven cases, but without significant difference between the two operation types. Postoperative weight loss did not differ significantly between the two study groups, but the faecal excretion of fat was significantly larger (p less than 0.05) after gastrojejunostomy than after gastroduodenostomy. Since both the oro-caecal transit time and the breath excretion of hydrogen after a standardized test meal showed no intergroup difference, the results suggest that duodenal exclusion may be of particular pathophysiologic importance for the observed malabsorption of fat after gastric resection.},

   abstract = {Pain management, nutritional support, and psychosocial support are fundamental services that enhance patients' ability to cope with their cancer and its therapy. The common goal of symptom prevention mandates that each of these supportive services be provided to all patients throughout their cancer experience. Comprehensive cancer pain management begins with identifying the origin of all of the patient's pains and treating each one specifically. Pain prevention can be achieved through around-the-clock opioid administration with as-needed supplements for breakthrough pain and dose titration. Common narcotic side effects such as constipation and nausea also must be prevented. Successful opioid analgesia requires that patient and family concerns regarding addiction and tolerance be dispelled at the outset. Cancer pain prevention can be further optimized with the use of appropriate coanalgesics in response to the pathophysiology of the patient's pains. Cognitive and behavioral therapies may also be useful adjuncts to reduce both pain and suffering. Procedure-oriented pain control should be considered when systemic pharmacologic therapy does not provide adequate pain relief or is associated with intolerable side effects. The only absolute contraindications for pain-relieving procedures are untreatable coagulopathy and a decrease in mental status not related to medical pain management. Useful neurodestructive techniques include radiofrequency lesioning, cryoanalgesia, and chemical neurolysis with agents such as phenol, alcohol, and hypertonic saline. The most beneficial pain-relieving procedures and percutaneous cordotomy, spinal narcotics, celiac and hypogastric plexus ablation, spinal neurolysis, and epidural injection of steroids and hypertonic saline. Procedure selection depends on the cause of the pain and the patient's prognosis. Common indications for pain-relieving procedures include unilateral pain below the shoulder, upper abdominal visceral pains, pelvic visceral pain, perineal pain, vertebral body metastasis, discogenic pain, and spinal stenosis. As results of well-conducted scientific trials begin to appear in the literature, the indications for these procedures will be better understood, resulting in their more appropriate use. Principles of nutritional support in patients with cancer include an awareness of the problem of malnutrition and its impact on performance status, quality of life, prognosis, and treatment; identification of those patients at risk; prophylactic versus therapeutic intervention; and analysis and management of the specific impediment(s) to adequate nutrient intake and absorption. The primary goals for nutritional support in cancer patients are prevention of weight loss and maintenance of adequate protein status. Appreciation of practical issues of nutritional support will enable the practicing physician to achieve these goals using primarily oral nutrition options.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Compared with control values Doppler waveform analysis suggested seven abnormal vessels. Two patients had abnormal fasting superior mesenteric artery waveforms manifested by very high peak systolic velocities together with spectral broadening (one also had evidence of coeliac artery stenosis), and one patient had normal velocities but an abnormal signal and evidence of proximal superior mesenteric stenosis was supported by colour Doppler imaging and confirmed by angiography. Postprandially, two patients showed very high peak systolic and end diastolic velocities in the superior mesenteric artery (one had had a normal fasting waveform signal) and one in the coeliac artery, suggestive of vascular stenosis, while one patient showed a fall in peak systolic velocity. The diagnosis of mesenteric ischaemia in two of these patients was supported by digital subtraction angiography and abdominal computed tomography. Doppler ultrasound may be a useful non-invasive investigation for patients with postprandial abdominal pain that helps to select patients for angiography. Patients with tight vascular stenosis may have abnormal fasting Doppler waveform patterns but in symptomatic patients further information may be obtained after the haemodynamic stress of feeding. Additional information to enhance the diagnostic sensitivity of the test may be obtained by colour Doppler imaging.},

The third patient had been tried on various formulae and underwent many investigations for failure to thrive, oedema, abdominal distension and recurrent chest infections.

   abstract = {Fifty malnourished rural African patients were randomly assigned to whole milk (50 g lactose/L), acidified milk (24 g lactose/L), or a commercial lactose-free diet (LFD) as a constant nasogastric infusion for 3 d, starting at 2 L/d and increasing to 3 L/d if tolerated. During the first 2 d mild symptoms of intolerance developed in 63% of patients on whole milk, 37% on acidified milk, and 54% on LFD whereas severe intolerance, necessitating withdrawal, was encountered in 22% receiving whole milk and none receiving LFD. Stool weights and fat excretion on day 3 were greater (P less than 0.02) in the remaining milk-fed patients whereas nitrogen balance remained strongly positive in all three groups. Eighty-seven percent of patients were methane producers, and high excretion rates were associated with better milk tolerance. The results suggest that although undiluted cow milk will not form a suitable tube feed for malnourished African patients, products such as acidified milk may prove cost effective.},

The aims were to define features of the secretory immune response (IgA and IgM concentrations and antibody values to gliadin and other food proteins measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) in active disease and remission, and to establish whether secretions obtained by relatively non-invasive techniques (saliva and gut lavage fluid) can be used for indirect measurements of events in the jejunum. Serum, saliva, and jejunal aspirate from 26 adults with untreated coeliac disease, 22 treated patients, and 28 immunologically normal control subjects were studied, together with intestinal secretions obtained by gut lavage from 15 untreated and 19 treated patients with coeliac disease and 25 control subjects. Jejunal aspirate IgA and IgM and gut lavage fluid IgM concentrations were significantly raised in patients with untreated coeliac disease; the lavage fluid IgM concentration remained higher in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls. Serum and salivary immunoglobulin concentrations were similar in the three groups. Patients with untreated coeliac disease had higher values of antibodies to gliadin compared with treated patients and control subjects in all body fluids tested; these were predominantly of IgA and IgG classes in serum, and of IgA and IgM classes in jejunal aspirate and gut lavage fluid. Values of salivary IgA antibodies to gliadin were significantly higher in untreated coeliacs, though antibody values were generally low, with a large overlap between coeliac disease patients and control subjects. In treated patients, with proved histological recovery on gluten free diet, serum IgA antigliadin antibody values fell to control values, though serum IgG antigliadin antibody values remained moderately raised. In contrast, there was persistence of secretory antigliadin antibodies in treated patients (particularly IgM antibody) in both jejunal aspirate and gut lavage fluid. Antibody responses to betalactoglobulin and ovalbumin were similar to those for gliadin, including persistence of high intestinal antibody values in patients with treated coeliac disease. There was a positive correlation between antibody values in jejunal aspirate and gut lavage fluid, but not between saliva and jejunal aspirate; thus salivary antibodies do not reflect intestinal humoral immunity.},

Three of the reported cases occurred in children. Apart from a marked predominance of males, the combination has no specific features. Firm evidence of a causal relationship between the two diseases is lacking but treatment with a gluten-free diet alone apparently had beneficial effects on the lung disease in two patients. Three pathogenic hypotheses are discussed herein: deposition of circulating immune complexes involving food allergens on the basement membrane of alveolar capillaries; reaction between antireticulin antibodies and an alveolar basement membrane antigen; or effect of adenovirus 12, a potential causative factor for celiac disease. Patients with idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis should routinely have tests for gluten intolerance, for instance a lactulose-mannitol intestinal permeability test. Lastly, other concomitant food allergies are reported.},

Enriched samples of IgA and IgG AGA were obtained by means of protein A chromatography after immunoaffinity purification of pooled sera from untreated celiac patients. No cross-reactivity with other food antigens (beta-lactalbumin, soya proteins, ovalbumin) was detected. The quantitative evaluation of protein content in IgA and IgG AGA samples obtained by immunoaffinity chromatography, was performed by means of ELISA sandwich method using a reference curve obtained with pure standard human immunoglobulins. Scalar concentrations of purified IgA and IgG were then used to obtain a reference standard curve by means of an ELISA method. Such standard curve was utilized for titrating AGA in 214 sample sera. The minimal detectable concentration of IgA and IgG AGA was 0.02 micrograms/ml. The reproducibility of within- and between-assay resulted very good for IgA-AGA and acceptable for IgG-AGA. The method here described seems to be satisfactory not only for quantitative diagnostic purposes in routine screenings but also in epidemiological studies. Moreover, it can constitute a suitable way to solve practical problems of quality control of AGA ELISA assay.},

There was evidence that some patients suffering from Crohn's Disease, together with some having coeliac disease and ulcerative colitis, did have varying amounts of aflatoxins in their serum and urine. The presence of aflatoxins may have been due to exposure to food containing these toxins or inability of the patient to excrete aflatoxins on account of some gastro-intestinal derangement.

The children with CMPI were divided into three groups according to clinical features: delayed-onset CMPI with gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 8); immediate-onset CMPI with gastrointestinal and skin symptoms (n = 8); and immediate-onset CMPI with skin symptoms only (n = 8). The CMPI groups were compared with children with untreated (n = 9) or treated (n = 8) coeliac disease and a control group (n = 22). Sera from the children were examined for cytotoxic effects using lymphocytes from healthy adults as effector cells and radiolabelled beta-lactoglobulin-coated erythrocytes from the same donor as target cells. In addition, IgG and IgA serum antibodies against beta-lactoglobulin were determined with ELISA. Sera from children with CMPI and gastrointestinal symptomatology showed a significantly increased capacity to induce ADCC reactivity as compared with controls. This increased capacity was seen in sera from those with immediate as well as delayed onset of the gastrointestinal symptoms. In contrast, sera from children who had an immediate-onset CMPI with only skin symptoms mediated no such increase in ADCC reactivity. Moreover, children with coeliac disease with a few exceptions, demonstrated low ADCC reactivity, despite the fact that they had high levels of antibodies against beta-lactoglobulin. ADCC may be an immunopathogenic mechanism in certain cases of CMPI with gastrointestinal symptoms.},

Two groups of fibers were identified. Discharge rates of group I fibers (n = 16) were significantly increased by gastric loading, adapted slowly to maintained gastric volume, and were inhibited by load withdrawal. CCK elicited a significant increase in the discharge rate of these group I fibers. Prior exposure to CCK nearly doubled the response of these fibers to a subsequent gastric load. In contrast, group II fibers (n = 4) increased firing rate only during infusion of a gastric load and showed rapid adaptation and no response to CCK. CCK failed to alter subsequent responses to gastric loads in these fibers. These results 1) demonstrate an integration of signals elicited by exogenous CCK and gastric loads at the level of vagal afferent fibers and 2) imply that aspects of CCK's inhibition of food intake may derive from CCK's ability to mimic and amplify vagal afferent activity provoked by meal-related gastric events.},

Most recent studies on gluten toxicity have used in vitro analyses of cellular immune activation by gluten fractions and peptides. Our work indicates that gliadin is the most active of the different protein families found within the wheat grain and that a specific peptide sequence located in the amino terminus domain of alpha-gliadin and containing the sequence proline-serine-glutamine-glutamine was most active. Improvement in the dietary management of coeliac disease is possible by use of test kits for the detection of gluten in foods. Both laboratory kits and home test kits (suitable for use by individual coeliacs) are available and reliably detect gluten from wheat, rye and barley even after cooking or baking.},

Both adult and child coeliacs had elevated levels of serum antibody to proteins from the coeliac-toxic cereals, namely bread wheat, durum wheat, rye and barley and low levels of proteins from other cereals. Using protein blotting techniques, antibody binding was greatest to gliadins/low mol mass glutenin subunits and homologous prolamins from rye and barley, consistent with the ELISA findings. Competition ELISA and preabsorption tests indicated that antibody reaction to maize storage proteins did not simply result from cross-reaction of antigliadin antibodies. In LMIF assays, only the wheat extracts had activity in coeliac patients. This is most likely partly due to loss of some of T-cell epitopes from the extraction technique required for these proteins, as well as the relatively small effects seen for even very active fractions in the LMIF assay.},

The food is extracted with dilute hydrochloric acid and 1 drop of the extract transferred to an antibody-coated tube; enzyme-labelled gluten detection antibody is added and after 3 min the tube is washed and colour developer is added. The reaction is stopped after 2 min, stabilising the blue colour. The home kit was compared with a quantitative laboratory kit, and the qualitative agreement was very good. The kit could distinguish foods with trace gluten contents (acceptable for a "gluten-free" diet) from those with a slightly higher but unacceptable gluten content. In a trial of the prototype kit by 47 coeliac disease patients of diverse ages and educational backgrounds, 93% of tests correctly identified foods as acceptable or unacceptable.},

A monoclonal IgG1 antibody (GD3) was prepared against gliadin. After adoptive transfer into mice, this antibody was capable of mediating a type III hypersensitivity response in vivo to footpad challenge with gliadin. The titres of circulating GD3, as estimated in vitro by ELISA, correlated well with the degree of inflammation at sites of type III responses in vivo. Following footpad challenge with gliadin, titres of circulating GD3 antibody were reduced. GD3 antibody was tested for its ability to mediate inflammatory responses in vivo in the intestinal mucosa of mice fed with gliadin. Circulating GD3 antibody was removed selectively and specifically by dietary gliadin, compared to feeding with bovine serum albumin or maintenance on a gliadin-free diet only. However, we were unable to demonstrate any pathological changes in the intestine as a result of possible local antigen-antibody complex formation or deposition. Using radio-iodinated gliadin as a trace marker, no significant retention of gliadin in the intestinal mucosa was found in mice pre-injected with GD3 antibody. These data suggest that circulating IgG antibody has little effect on dietary antigen uptake in the gut, and alone is insufficient to mediate an enteropathy.},

   abstract = {Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) or canker sores occur in 20-60% of all persons. The lesion occurs because of increased viscosity of oral submucosal extracellular matrix (ECM). The lesions begin in the second decade and peak in the third decade. Sex hormones are an important influence on fibroblasts, especially in the early phase of exposure. Sex hormones are known to concentrate, to a degree, in the bucal mucosa in animals. Lesions of RAS localize clinically and experimentally at sites of trauma. In the skin, edema is known to trigger early cellular inflammation. Increased viscosity of ECM heightens the response. The histopathology of the ulcerated lesions is similar to that which occurs under sites of acute inflammation in the skin. Systemic corticosteroids completely supress the lesions. Caustics, such as silver nitrate and phenol, stop the growth and pain of lesions. Irritants are known to break ECM viscosity. The oral mucosa exerts some control on underlying ECM. Substances such as lectins influencing the mucosa could influence ECM. Soluble substances in food or organisms could also penetrate to influence ECM. A number of different foods have been incriminated as trigger agents in individual cases. This includes gluten in patients with gluten sensitive enteropathy. Gluten is known to alter the mucosa of the small intestine in persons with celiac disease.},

Esophageal cancer is a relatively uncommon neoplasm in Western countries with a very poor prognosis. In industrialized countries alcohol and tobacco are the major risk factors. Nutritional factors play also an important role in the aetiology of esophageal cancer, particularly a diet rich in cereal but poor in fresh fruit and vegetables, accounts for some of the geographic differences. Several predisposing disorders for esophageal cancer are known and include Barrett's esophagus, achalasia, chronic strictures due to corrosive substances, tylosis, coeliac disease, and the Plummer-Vinson syndrome. The clinical manifestations are also discussed.},

   abstract = {The role of the physiologic barrier function of the small bowel and its possible role in health and disease has attracted much attention over the past decade. The intestinal mucosal barrier for luminal macromolecules and microorganism is the result of non-immunologic and immunologic defense mechanisms. The non-immunologic mechanisms consist of intraluminal factors such as gastric acid, proteolytic activity, and motility and of mucosal surface factors like mucin and the microvillous membrane. The immunologic mechanisms include secretary IgA and cell-mediated immunity. Both types of mechanism are not completely mature at birth. Maturation of this barrier is not finished before the 2nd year of life. One of the aspects of the mucosal barrier function can be estimated by the intestinal permeability (IP) for macromolecules. We use the differential sugar absorption test (SAT), in which the ratio of urinary excretion of a relatively large molecule, lactulose, is compared with that of a relatively small molecule, mannitol, after oral ingestion. Although the small intestine is permeable to certain macromolecules in normal developmental conditions, an increased IP could be involved in the pathophysiology of several diseases, including infectious diarrhea, food allergy, celiac disease, and Crohn's disease. It can be concluded that IP, as measured with the SAT, reflects the state of the mucosal barrier and is altered in several gastrointestinal diseases. The SAT is a non-invasive IP test that can be of diagnostic help to demonstrate alterations in the small-mucosal barrier function and may be useful to evaluate therapeutic interventions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

There was no difference in Cu, Fe, Ca, Cl values between the examined groups. The Zn contents of the hair are significantly low in the group with acute celiac disease after a short-term diet and also in the group with cystic fibrosis, the data approach the normal range only after a year's diet. The significant rise of hair potassium contents is well indicated in patients with acute celiac disease and this rise may be due to the destruction of cell cuticles. In case of cystic fibrosis there is no significant rise of hair potassium value.},

This incidence rate by birth is the lowest described in an epidemiological study in contrast with rates of 0.33 to 8 per 1000 live births found in other western countries. This difference may be explained by the different diagnostic criteria used for coeliac disease. Another contributing factor may be a late and gradual introduction of gluten-containing cereals into the diet of Danish infants.},

We first demonstrated in vitro that it had a wide pH optimum of 2.5-5.5 and was resistant to pepsin and trypsin. We gave the enzyme or matching placebo in random order by mouth with a fatty meal to 10 adult patients with pancreatic steatorrhoea due to cystic fibrosis (CF) and sampled gastric contents for the following 2 h. Mean acid-resistant lipase activity was 330 nmol/ml/min free fatty acid released on placebo, compared with 896 nmol/ml/min on fungal lipase (p = 0.006 for area under the curve). We compared this lipase's clinical efficacy with that of two conventional pancreatin microsphere formulations in an open randomised crossover fat-balance study in 10 similar patients. Each preparation was given for 2 weeks, and a fat-balance study, using a faecal recovery marker, was performed on the final 3 days; a period without treatment was also included. The fungal lipase had no effect on faecal wet weight or on the coefficient of fat absorption (59.0% vs. 52.3%; NS) in comparison with placebo. The established enteric-coated microsphere preparation (Creon) produced a significant reduction in faecal wet weight and improvement in coefficient of fat absorption (81.4% vs. 52.3%; p less than 0.01) in comparison with placebo. The newer microsphere preparation (Pancrex M) was also effective, but perhaps less so than Creon; there were no significant differences between the two preparations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},
