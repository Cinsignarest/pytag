Research has demonstrated no causal relationship between psychosocial factors and the development of IBS. IBS cannot be diagnosed through radiologic, endoscopic or laboratory studies because the symptoms are not explained by structural or chemical abnormalities. One of the most important components of treatment is the development of an effective provider patient relationship. Behavioral treatments may be helpful in select patients. Dietary management can also reduce symptoms if the patient can identify foods that trigger them.},

   abstract = {Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells resemble mucosal mast cells (MMC) and develop few secretory granules under normal culture conditions. RBL cells have been used for the study of secretion and for the possible involvement of MMC in food allergies and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The flavonoid quercetin is one of very few molecules that inhibit RBL cell proliferation and constitutive histamine release; it also induces synthesis of rat mast cell protease (RMCP) II and accumulation of secretory granules. Even though quercetin is available as a food supplement over the counter, some early studies had indicated it may be carcinogenic. We, therefore, compared the effect of quercetin to that of other flavonoids with similar structure. Flavone, kaempferol, myricetin and morin were investigated for their action on RBL cell secretion of beta-hexosaminidase stimulated by anti-DNP serum and DNP-BSA, as well as on secretory granule development. Quercetin, myricetin and kaempferol inhibited RBL cell secretion significantly only at 10(-4) M. Flavone inhibited secretion at 10(-4), 10(-5) and 10(-6) M; it also maximally induced secretory granule accumulation as evidenced by light and electron microscopy. In contrast, morin which differs structurally only by one extra hydroxyl group had minimal effect. These results indicate that flavone is capable of inhibiting stimulated secretion and inducing secretory granule development at reasonable concentrations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously shown electro-mechanical recto-anal alterations in irritable bowel syndrome patients (Awad R. Neurogastroenterol Motil 1993; 5; 265-271). To assess whether the alpha 2-agonist lidamidine HCL is able to modify these physiological alterations and alleviate clinical symptoms, 50 patients with irritable bowel syndrome were studied in a random, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Lidamidine HCL (4 mg) or placebo was taken orally t.i.d. with food. Fasting and post-prandial electrical and mechanical activities of rectum and internal anal sphincter were recorded before and at the end of treatment. Recto-anal sensitivity was also tested. RESULTS: After treatment, post-prandial duration of spontaneous recto-anal inhibitory reflex diminished in the lidamidine group (18.9 +/- 1 vs. 15.1 +/- 1.3 sec; p < 0.05). Amplitude of induced rectoanal inhibitory reflex decreased after lidamidine (24.6 +/- 2.9 vs 17.3 +/- 3 mmHg; p = 0.02). Rectal electrical activity showed no changes during basal and post-prandial periods in any group. Rectal painful sensation decreased after treatment with lidamidine (54.8 +/- 5.4 vs 43.6 +/- 3.5 ml; p < 0.05) as well as with placebo (p < 0.05). Abdominal distension and frequency, severity and duration of pain diminished in both groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Lidamidine decreased the augmented mechanical response to food, reduced rectal sensitivity, and relieved symptoms. These facts suggest that in spite of the strong placebo response obtained, lidamidine HCL can become a useful alternative for treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {There have frequently been doubts as to the relevance of food allergy, in particular as far as the involvement of the intestinal tract is concerned. Several studies, however, have confirmed the existence of allergic reactions in the gut, with an estimated prevalence of about 1-2% in adults. Clinical symptoms are unspecific and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping and diarrhea. Intestinal mast cells, as well as intestinal eosinophils, have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of food-allergy-related enteropathy. In addition to classical IgE-dependent degranulation, further agonists have been demonstrated for mast cell activation, for example IL-4. The methods used to confirm the diagnosis of intestinal allergy are still insufficient. Until now, blinded oral challenge procedures with food antigens have been accepted as the 'gold standard' in diagnosing food allergy, although these tests have practical problems. Therefore, new test systems have been developed, such as endoscopic provocation tests, that may improve diagnostic procedures. Elimination diet still presents the main basis of therapy. Aspects to be focused on in the future are the role fo IgE-independent allergic mechanisms in intestinal allergy, the impact of cross-reactivity with other allergens and the relationship to other inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome.},

   abstract = {We have recently developed a simple method to investigate the colonic response to food (CRF). This study describes the modifications of CRF induced by treatment with oral pinaverium bromide in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Thirty healthy subjects and 43 patients suffering from IBS were studied. Colonic transit time (CTT) was measured in fasting conditions and after eating a standard test meal. Colonic response to food was quantified by calculating the variation in number of markers in each zone of interest of the large bowel between the X-ray films of the abdomen taken before and after eating. CRF is characterized by caudal propulsion of colonic contents in the two groups. In controls, there is emptying of the caecum-ascending colon region and filling of the rectosigmoid. In IBS patients, only the left transverse colon and the splenic flexure empty. Pinaverium bromide exerts no effect in controls but reverses the CRF of the right colon in IBS patients by inhibiting right colon emptying. These results suggest that the inhibitory action of pinaverium bromide on CRF may support the clinical efficacy of this calcium channel blocker in the treatment of IBS.},

In general, smooth muscle relaxants are best used sparingly, on an as-needed basis, because their overall efficacy is unclear.

Psychological treatments including hypnotherapy are less widely available but may play an important role in the relief of pain. In summary, current therapies targeted on the predominant symptoms in IBS are moderately successful. As the bowel sensorimotor and limbic system disturbances of IBS are more clearly understood, we should anticipate other pharmacologic approaches in the near future, including alpha-adrenergic agonists and 5-HT4 agonists. New therapies directed at treatment of the syndrome, rather than relief of symptoms, are needed.},

METHODS: The patients were interviewed and a questionnaire completed on entry into the trial. They then took 10 mL arrowroot powder three times a day for one month and discontinued the treatment for the subsequent month. Questionnaires were completed after one month on treatment and at the end of the trial after one month off treatment. RESULTS: Arrowroot reduced diarrhoea and had a long-term effect on constipation. It also eased abdominal pain. CONCLUSION: Arrowroot is an effective treatment for diarrhoea. Its action could be explained by several theories which relate to an increase in faecal bulk and thus a more efficient bowel action. The number of patients was small, and further studies are needed to substantiate preliminary results.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder with clinical signs typical of "intestinal" food allergies or intolerance. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical features of IBS patients suspected of suffering from adverse reactions to food. METHODS: The study involved 128 consecutive IBS patients divided into four groups according to their main symptom on presentation at our outpatient clinic. A detailed medical history was recorded, paying particular attention to any allergies and reported intolerance to food. Each patient was screened for allergies; intestinal permeability tests was performed in randomly selected patients from different groups. Findings were analyzed using the chi2 test. RESULTS: Adverse reactions to one or more foods were reported by 80 patients (62.5%); skin prick tests (SPT) were positive in 67 patients (52.3%) with no significant differences between patients complaining of different symptoms. Patients who reported a food intolerance had more positive SPTs than those who did not (47 of 80 [58.7%] vs 20 of 48 [41.7%]); this difference was not statistically significant, although it suggests a trend (p < 0.0610). There was little consistency between the specific foods reported to cause intolerance and those resulting from the tests (11 of 80 patients, 13.7%). The intestinal permeability test was normal in 29 of 33 patients (87.9%). CONCLUSIONS: More than 50% of IBS patients were found sensitized to some food or inhalant without any typical clinical signs. Patients were unable to identify potentially offending foods. The lack of a correlation between SPT results and reported food allergies needs further investigation to clarify the pathophysiology and improve the diagnosis of intestinal food allergies.},

   abstract = {Slow release oral mesalazine (Pentasa) contains microgranules covered by a semipermeable ethylcellulose membrane. The microgranules continuously release their content from duodenum to ileum in a pH- and time-dependent way. About 75% of the microgranules pass into the colon, where further release is slower. This release pattern does not appear to be affected by food, diarrhoea or the simultaneous use of H2 antagonists. Rectal forms of mesalazine deliver active drug directly to the rectum and left colon. Plasma concentrations of mesalazine and its metabolite acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid after oral or local administration are the result of systemic absorption and hepatic metabolism by N-acetyltransferase. Most studies report maximal plasma concentrations of less than 1 mg/L after oral administration of slow release mesalazine, much lower than those observed after uncoated mesalazine but generally higher than after azo-bound drugs such as sulfasalazine. Urinary recovery is an indicator of absorption and metabolism, and is lower after rectal administration (10 to 30%) than after oral administration (30 to 40%). Faecal recovery after oral administration of slow or delayed release mesalazine is lower than with azo-bound drugs. Mesalazine acts locally after absorption by colonic and ileal mucosa. Mean steady-state concentrations of 25.7+/-2.2 microg/kg wet weight are found in ileocolonic biopsy specimens from patients with irritable bowel syndrome treated for 1 week with slow release mesalazine 1.5 g/day. Intramucosal concentrations after slow release mesalazine differ little between healthy individuals and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Although significant differences are found between the various aminosalicylates in release patterns and the resulting pharmacokinetic parameters, no differences in therapeutic effects have been found in comparative studies. High doses of oral mesalazine (2 to 4 g/day) are more effective than lower doses in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis. High doses (4 g/day) are also effective in the treatment of Crohn's disease, predominantly in patients with ileitis. In contrast, no dose ranging effects were demonstrated with local treatment forms: mesalazine 1g enema seems sufficient for patients with distal colitis. Higher serum concentrations and urinary recoveries after the administration of slow or delayed release mesalazine compared with azo-bound drugs suggest a higher risk for renal adverse effects, although the reported occurrence is extremely low. Although preliminary data support an association between mucosal concentrations of mesalazine and its clinical activity, further studies are needed to correlate the effects of this drug with its pharmacokinetic parameters.},

   abstract = {Weight loss is a major component of the clinical syndrome in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The impact of malnutrition on the outcome of the disease has been unappreciated in many investigations. The authors evaluated the effects of oral nutritional supplementation on the morphology and immunology of the intestinal mucosa of patients with AIDS. Twelve patients with AIDS without diarrhea or opportunistic infections, with at least 10% of body weight loss over 1 year, were submitted to anthropometric measures, peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts, and peroral jejunal biopsy before and after oral nutritional supplementation. An industrialized peptide-based formula containing omega-3 fatty acids was given for 6 weeks. Jejunal samples were analyzed by histomorphometry, including villous-to-crypt ratio, lamina propria, and intraepithelial lymphocyte count. Immunologic assessment of the intestinal mucosa was made by indirect immunoperoxidase using monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD4, and CD8. Seven patients with irritable bowel syndrome and two healthy volunteers were selected as a control group for histologic and immunohistochemical comparisons. After 6 weeks the patient group maintained their body weight and increased their tricipital fold. The number of peripheral blood T cells, albumin, transferrin, and the number of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells in jejunal mucosa as well as the intestinal morphometry remained stable. Oral supplementation contributed to maintaining body weight and may constitute a reasonable adjuvant therapeutic tool against AIDS progression.},

   abstract = {The lining of the gastrointestinal tract is the largest vulnerable surface that faces the external environment. Just as the other large external surface, the skin, is regarded as a sensory organ, so should the intestinal mucosa. In fact, the mucosa has three types of detectors: neurons, endocrine cells, and immune cells. The mucosa is in immediate contact with the intestinal contents so that nutrients can be efficiently absorbed, and, at the same time, it protects against the intrusion of harmful entities, such as toxins and bacteria, that may enter the digestive system with food. Signals are sent locally to control motility, secretion, tissue defense, and vascular perfusion; to other digestive organs, for example, to the stomach, gallbladder, and pancreas; and to the central nervous system, for example to influence feeding behavior. The three detecting systems in the intestine are more extensive than those of any other organ: the enteric nervous system contains on the order of 10(8) neurons, the gastroenteropancreatic endocrine system uses more than 20 identified hormones, and the gut immune system has 70- 80% of the body's immune cells. The gastrointestinal tract has an integrated response to changes in its luminal contents. When this response is maladjusted or is overwhelmed, the consequences can be severe, as in cholera intoxication, or debilitating, as in irritable bowel syndrome. Thus it is essential to obtain a full understanding of the sensory functions of the intestine, of how the body reacts to the information, and of how neural, hormonal, and immune signals interact.},

This strain had previously been shown to possess properties required of a probiotic microorganism including the ability to relieve irritable bowel syndrome. The strain was found to survive to high numbers in Cheddar cheese during ripening at 8 degrees C for 15 mo (4 x 10(8) cfu/g) and in yogurt during storage at 4 degrees C for 21 d (4 x 10(7) cfu/g). In an in vitro model system, Cheddar cheese was found to have a greater protective effect than yogurt upon exposure of the probiotic culture to porcine gastric juice at pH 2. Subsequently, a feeding trial involving 8 pigs per group was performed in which a rifampicin-resistant variant of the probiotic strain was fed for 21 d at a mean daily intake of 1.3 x 10(10) cfu/d from Cheddar cheese or 3.7 x 10(9) cfu/d from yogurt. During the feeding period, Cheddar cheese yielded a significantly higher mean fecal probiotic count (2 x 10(6) cfu/g of feces) than did yogurt (5.2 x 10(5) cfu/g of feces). These data indicate that mature Cheddar cheese compares very favorably with fresh yogurt as a delivery system for viable probiotic microorganisms to the gastrointestinal tract.},

The particular strain, E. faecium PR88, has proven efficacy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, and in this study it was evaluated for suitability as a starter adjunct for Cheddar cheese manufacture. When added to cheesemilk at an inoculum of 2 x 10(7) cfu/mL, the enterococcal adjunct maintained viability in Cheddar cheese at levels of up to 3 x 10(8) cfu/g during 9 months of ripening. Increased proteolysis and higher levels of some odor-active volatile compounds were observed in Cheddar cheeses containing the PR88 adjunct compared with the control throughout the ripening period. In addition, the enterococcal adjunct strain did not affect cheese composition. Although sensory evaluation showed no significant difference in flavor/aroma and body/texture scores between control and experimental cheeses, repeated comments by the commercial grader consistently described the cheeses containing PR88 as 'more advanced than the control' and as having 'better flavor'. These findings indicate that the presence of the PR88 adjunct strain in Cheddar cheese at levels of >/=10(8) cfu/g may positively influence Cheddar flavor.},

METHODS: Children who had abdominal pain associated with defecation or change in bowel habit, disordered defecation, and distension were diagnosed with IBS, and lactose maldigestion was defined by lactose breath hydrogen testing. Children with IBS were managed with increased fiber intake, while those with lactose maldigestion restricted dietary lactose. A telephone survey was conducted to determine the response to treatment. RESULTS: The mean age of the 59 boys and 87 girls was 9.5 +/- 3.0 years. Children with IBS and lactose maldigestion had more frequent abdominal pain than children without these conditions, but they required less medication for relief of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS. Lactose maldigestion may be a contributory factor in children with IBS, and lactose avoidance in these patients may reduce medication use to relieve symptoms.},

METHODS: References were searched on recent review articles, personal files, and Medline. RESULTS: Irritable bowel syndrome in children or chronic nonspecific diarrhea is a very frequent reason for pediatric gastroenterology visits. It is a benign disease and disappears with age, but may cause extreme worry to parents. The pathophysiology is still unclear, and there is not laboratory corroboration. Thus, it is frequently diagnosed incorrectly, although it has proper clinical manifestation (if there is no diet or medicine manipulation). Dietary advice is usually efficient, and is based on pathophysiologic data. The use of drug is still discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Irritable bowel syndrome must be always considered in oligosymptomatic children without signs of malnutrition, with diarrhea, between 6 months and 5 years of age. Drugs are not necessary, and their action is still unclear. Food manipulation based on pathophysiology is enough.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are reported by 10% of the general population; however, evaluation of traditional risk factors has not provided any insight into the pathogenesis of this condition. The objective of this study was to identify additional risk factors for irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: A valid self-report questionnaire that records the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms required for a diagnosis of IBS, self-reported measures of potential risk factors, and a psychosomatic symptom checklist was mailed to an age-and gender-stratified random sample of Olmsted County, Minnesota residents aged 30-64 yr. A logistic regression model that adjusted for age, gender, and psychosomatic symptom score was used to identify factors significantly associated with IBS. RESULTS: A total of 643 (72%) of 892 eligible subjects returned the survey. IBS symptoms were reported by 12% of the respondents. IBS was significantly associated with use of analgesics (acetaminophen, aspirin, or nonaspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) for reasons other than IBS, reporting a food allergy or sensitivity, and ratings of somatic symptoms. No association was detected for age, gender, body mass index, smoking history, alcohol use, educational level, exposure to pets in the household, or water supply. Among subjects reporting the use of just one type of analgesic, IBS was associated with acetaminophen but not aspirin or nonaspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs used alone. The odds of having IBS were higher among subjects reporting more reasons for taking analgesics and intolerance to a higher number of foods. CONCLUSIONS: IBS is significantly associated with analgesic use. However, this is confounded by other somatic pain complaints. IBS symptoms are associated with the reporting of many food allergies or sensitivities. The role of food-induced symptoms in IBS requires further investigation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The value of specific gastrointestinal symptoms in discriminating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) from organic disease has been documented. In contrast, there have been few attempts to identify symptoms that discriminate irritable bowel syndrome from food allergy, despite similarities in their respective symptom complexes. We aimed to investigate the value of symptoms in discriminating irritable bowel syndrome from organic disease and food allergy. METHODS: Subjects (n = 288) were recruited from consecutive patients presenting to the Internal Medicine, Gastroenterology and Allergy Units in Chieti. Patients completed the validated Bowel Disease Questionnaire (BDQ) prior to an independent diagnostic evaluation, which included endoscopy when appropriate. Food allergy was diagnosed using a 2-week elimination diet, followed by a placebo-controlled food challenge test, a skin prick test and serum RAST for specific IgE for suspected foods or additives. The results of the BDQ were not considered in formulating a diagnosis. In total, 99 patients were diagnosed with the IBS, 79 patients were diagnosed with organic disease and 22 patients were diagnosed with food allergy. A further 88 patients with extraintestinal allergies were included as a control group. RESULTS: Based on logistic regression analysis, six symptom items discriminated IBS from organic disease, while five symptoms discriminated patients with IBS from control subjects. A diagnosis of IBS compared to organic disease was positively associated with straining on defaecation (P=0.0001), diarrhoea (P=0.001) and abdominal bloating (P=0.01), but was negatively associated with pain in the upper abdomen (P=0.0004), reflux (P=0.0001) and appetite loss (P=0.004). A diagnosis of IBS compared to extraintestinal allergy was positively associated with pain relieved by bowel movement (P=0.0001), pain in the lower abdomen (P=0.0006), pain in both the upper and lower abdomen (P=0.003), frequent pain (P=0.001) and abdominal bloating (P=0.0009). In comparison between IBS and food allergy patients, a diagnosis of IBS was positively associated with pain in the lower abdomen (P=0.001), pain relieved by bowel movements (P=0.001), frequent pain (P=0.02) and abdominal bloating (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Symptoms appear to be useful for discriminating IBS from organic gastrointestinal disease and food allergy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The influence of the gastrointestinal (GI) microflora in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has not been clearly elucidated. This study was undertaken to see if patients with IBS have an imbalance in their normal colonic flora, as some bacterial taxa are more prone to gas production than others. We also wanted to study whether the flora could be altered by exogenous supplementation. In a previous study we have characterized the mucosa-associated lactobacilli in healthy individuals and found some strains with good colonizing ability. Upon colonization, they seemed to reduce gas formation. METHODS: The study comprised 60 patients with IBS and a normal colonoscopy or barium enema. Patients fulfilling the Rome criteria, without a history of malabsorption, and with normal blood tests underwent a sigmoidoscopy with biopsy. They were randomized into two groups, one receiving 400 ml per day of a rose-hip drink containing 5 x 10(7) cfu/ml of Lactobacillus plantarum (DSM 9843) and 0.009 g/ml oat flour, and the other group receiving a plain rose-hip drink, comparable in color, texture, and taste. The administration lasted for 4 wk. The patients recorded their own GI function, starting 2 wk before the study and continuing throughout the study period. Twelve months after the end of the study all patients were asked to complete the same questionnaire regarding their symptomatology as at the start of the study. RESULTS: All patients tolerated the products well. The patients receiving Lb. plantarum had these bacteria on rectal biopsies. There were no major changes of Enterobacteriaceae in either group, before or after the study, but the Enterococci increased in the placebo group and remained unchanged in the test group. Flatulence was rapidly and significantly reduced in the test group compared with the placebo group (number of days with abundant gas production, test group 6.5 before, 3.1 after vs 7.4 before and 5.6 after for the placebo group). Abdominal pain was reduced in both groups. At the 12-month follow-up, patients in the test group maintained a better overall GI function than control patients. There was no difference between the groups regarding bloating. Fifty-nine percent of the test group patients had a continuous intake of fermented products, whereas the corresponding figure for the control patients was 73%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate that the administration of Lb. plantarum with known probiotic properties decreased pain and flatulence in patients with IBS. The fiber content of the test solution was minimal and it is unlikely that the fiber content could have had any effect. This type of probiotic therapy warrants further studies in IBS patients.},

Fructooligosaccharides are mainly indigestible and large amounts in the colon may provoke gastrointestinal symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be provoked by large quantities of carbohydrates in the colon. The objective of this study was to determine whether regular consumption of fructooligosaccharides worsens gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS. DESIGN: A multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group comparison was conducted at 24 sites. The study consisted of a 2-wk, single-blind run-in phase and a 12-wk, double-blind comparative phase. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 20 g fructooligosaccharides powder/d (n = 52) or a placebo (n = 46). Efficacy was based on the patients' overall response to treatment at completion of the study and on the severity and duration of individual symptoms (abdominal distension, abdominal rumbling, abnormal flatulence, and abdominal pain). RESULTS: Data from 96 patients (16 men and 80 women) were analyzed. After 4-6 wk of treatment, IBS symptoms improved more in the placebo group than in the fructooligosaccharide group. After completion of the study, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups: symptoms improved in 58% of the fructooligosaccharide group and in 65% of the placebo group and symptoms worsened in 8% of the fructooligosaccharide group and in 13% of the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Although symptoms worsened in patients with IBS at the onset of treatment with 20 g fructooligosaccharides/d, continuous treatment for 12 wk resulted in no worsening of symptoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Symptoms of at least a subgroup of patients with irritable bowel syndrome may be associated with an alteration in gut flora. Studies on bacterial based therapy have yielded mixed results. AIMS: To determine if oral administration of the probiotic Lactobacillus casei strain GG under randomized placebo controlled conditions improves symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome patients with bloating related symptoms. PATIENTS: A total of 25 patients with clinically confirmed irritable bowel syndrome (Rome criteria) were enrolled in the study. METHODS: This was a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Lactobacillus GG was administered as enterocoated tablets constituting a daily dosage of 10(10) colony forming units. Symptoms were assessed by daily symptom diaries and periodic questionnaires. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were randomised; 19 (80%) female, mean age 40 years (range 24-60), mean duration of symptoms 4.9 years (range 0.5-18). Nineteen (80%) patients completed the study. No significant differences were found between Lactobacillus casei strain GG and placebo mean symptom scores for pain, urgency or bloating. A trend was noted, however, for a reduction in the number of unformed bowel motions on Lactobacillus casei strain GG treatment for patients with diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus casei strain GG alone did not significantly improve symptoms in this irritable bowel syndrome subgroup. A "diarrhoea predominant" subgroup may warrant further investigation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and its risk factors in Beijing. METHODS: Phase I: a screening program for IBS was carried out in Beijing area according to symptoms using both Manning (modified including constipation) and Rome criteria. Random clustered sampling involving 2 486 subjects of the inhabitants was carried out under stratification of city, suburban and rural areas. Sample size of each studied area was in proportion to the population of the area. The range of age was 18 - 70. All subjects studied were requested to fill in a questionnaire assisted by trained doctors or medical students during the visit to their families. Phase II: a small number of patients who fulfilled the Manning criteria were further selected to undergo detail clinical examination in the hospital including laboratory examination, abdominal ultrasonography, colonoscopy or/and barium enema to exclude organic disease of the colon. Prevalence of IBS of the population was then adjusted by the rate of correct diagnosis during phase II study. Minnesota Multi - Personality Indices was used in some cases. Potential risk factors were explored by comparing frequencies among IBS group and non - IBS group using chi(2) and logistic analysis of multifactors. RESULTS: The adjusted point prevalence of IBS in Beijing according to Manning criteria was 7.26%, in contrast to Rome criteria - 0.82%. Higher prevalence rate of IBS in the city (10.50%) than in rural areas (6.14%) (P < 0.001) was noticed. Male to female ratio was 1:1.15 with majority of IBS fell in age 18 - 40 (51.6%), and among intellectuals. Our study indicated that history of dysentery (OR = 3.00), exposure to coldness (OR = 1.55), ingestion of cold food and raw materials (OR = 1.24) might serve as the most important risk factors (P < 0.001). Patients with IBS seemed to have a higher tendency of abnormal personalities. CONCLUSION: IBS is a common disorder in Beijing which deserves greater care.},

   abstract = {The use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. Probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. There is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. However, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. Currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp. However, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., Bacteroides sp., Bacillus sp., Propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. Some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. Probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including Clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea caused by rotavirus, Shigella, Salmonella, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, Helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. Probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. There are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. Probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.},

   abstract = {AIM: Visceral hypersensitivity characterizes the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We evaluated the effect of a cold pressor test (CPT)--hand immersion in ice water for 1 minute, which evokes a sympathetic response--on rectosigmoid motility in patients with IBS and normal volunteers. Since many Indian patients with IBS complain of worsening of symptoms following a spicy meal, we also evaluated whether a high-chilli diet affects symptoms or changes rectosigmoid motility. METHODS: Fifteen men with IBS and 13 normal volunteers (all men) were studied. Baseline rectosigmoid manometry was done for 2 h, i.e., 1 h pre- and 1 h post-CPT. The subjects were then kept in hospital on a regular diet (approximately 5 g chilli daily) for 3 days, following which symptoms were reassessed and manometry repeated for 1 h. This was followed by a high-chilli diet (approximately 15 g/day) for 3 days, after which symptoms were reassessed and manometry repeated for 1 h. RESULTS: There was no difference in the baseline study in the pre-CPT period between patients and control subjects. CPT did not change rectosigmoid motility in either group. IBS patients had varied effect on symptoms but no change in rectosigmoid motility after the high-chilli diet. In the normal volunteers, there was increased activity in the low rectum after the high-chilli diet. CONCLUSIONS: Cold pressor test does not affect rectosigmoid motility in patients with IBS or normal subjects. A high-chilli diet has varied effect on symptoms in patients with IBS and does not affect rectosigmoid motility.},

   abstract = {Lactose malabsorption and lactase deficiency are chronic organic pathologic conditions characterized by abdominal pain and distention, flatulence, and the passage of loose, watery stools. Though malabsorption of the sugar lactose is determinable by breath hydrogen test or jejunal biopsy, intolerance can only be confirmed by challenge with lactose-containing food, the response to which may not be immediate. The difficulty of making a positive diagnosis of these conditions has led to a proportion of lactose-intolerant patients being misdiagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which has a remarkably similar symptom complex and for which there is no current pathophysiologic marker. The incidence of the two disorders is approximately equal, but the actual proportion of patients with IBS incorrectly diagnosed in this way varies as a function of the methodology used. Once correct diagnosis is established, introduction of a lactose-free dietary regime relieves symptoms in most patients. Symptom similarity and the resultant incorrect diagnosis of IBS may explain the refractory nature of some patients labeled as IBS who remain largely unaware of the relationship between food intake and symptoms.},

   abstract = {One of the most topical areas of human nutrition is the role of the gut in health and disease. Specifically, this involves interactions between the resident microbiota and dietary ingredients that support their activities. Currently, it is accepted that the gut microflora contains pathogenic, benign and beneficial components. Some microbially induced disease states such as acute gastroenteritis and pseudomembranous colitis have a defined aetiological agent(s). Speculation on the role of microbiota components in disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, bowel cancer, neonatal necrotising enterocolitis and ulcerative colitis are less well defined, but many studies are convincing. It is evident that the gut microflora composition can be altered through diet. Because of their perceived health-promoting status, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are the commonest targets. Probiotics involve the use of live micro-organisms in food; prebiotics are carbohydrates selectively metabolized by desirable moieties of the indigenous flora; synbiotics combine the two approaches. Dietary intervention of the human gut microbiota is feasible and has been proven as efficacious in volunteer trials. The health bonuses of such approaches offer the potential to manage many gut disorders prophylactically. However, it is imperative that the best methodologies available are applied to this area of nutritional sciences. This will undoubtedly involve a genomic application to the research and is already under way through molecular tracking of microbiota changes to diet in controlled human trials.},

Ingestion of pancreatic supplements was associated with a significant (P = 0.049) reduction in bloating over the entire recording period, and with significant reductions in bloating, gas, and fullness during the dinner to bedtime period. Pancreatic supplements had no significant effect on breath H2 or CH4 concentration.

METHODS: In October 1993, we observed an outbreak of Salmonella braenderup gastroenteritis that occurred in the Lausanne area, Canton de Vaud, Switzerland. Cultures of suspected food products, of samples at the incriminated food factory and from workers, as well as a case-control study, were used to determine the source of the epidemics. Ribotyping of representative Salmonella braenderup strains was performed to define the molecular epidemiology. The clinical characteristics of this infection were determined by using a standardized interview performed during and 6 months after the outbreak in 156 of 215 identified patients. RESULTS: The outbreak resulted from the ingestion of pies, heavily contaminated (> 106 CFU/g) with a strain of Salmonella braenderup. The contamination was due to mishandling and recycling of jelly poured on top of the products. According to its ribotype and plasmid characteristics, this strain had not been isolated previously in Switzerland. Ten of the 24 workers of the incriminated food factory were shedding the epidemic strain in their stools, and one of them reported gastroenteritis 3 weeks before the beginning of the outbreak. The estimated attack rate in the exposed population was 7.5%. The median incubation time was 18 h. Among 127 adult patients studied, 98% had diarrhea, 95% abdominal pain, 74% fever > or = 38.5 degrees C, 69% nausea and 35% vomiting. One patient developed prosthetic valve endocarditis, and one reactive arthritis. Long-term complications were not identified, although 12 patients complained of irritable bowel syndrome and 24 of unusual asthenia lasting for more than 6 weeks after infection. Children had more severe signs and symptoms compared to adults, and six of 29 needed hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that ingestion of food highly contaminated with Salmonella braenderup resulted in severe but typical gastroenteritis and indicated mishandling of food during manufacture as the cause of this outbreak.},

Initially, I establish the diagnosis, exclude organic causes, educate patients about the disease, establish realistic expectations and consistent limits, and involve patients in disease management. I find it critical to determine why the patient is seeking assistance (eg, cancer phobia, disability, interpersonal distress, or exacerbation of symptoms). Most patients can be treated by their primary care physician. However, specialty consultations may be needed to reinforce management strategies, perform additional diagnostic tests, or institute specialized treatment. Psychological co-morbidities do not cause symptoms but do affect how patients respond to them and influence health care-seeking behavior. I find that these issues are best explored over a series of visits when the physician-patient relationship has been established. It can be helpful to have patients fill out a self-administered test to identify psychological co-morbidities. I often use these tests as a basis for extended inquiries into this area, resulting in the initiation of appropriate therapies. I encourage patients to keep a 2-week diary of food intake and gastrointestinal symptoms. In this way, patients become actively involved in management of their disease, and I may be able to obtain information from the diary that will be valuable in making treatment decisions. I do not believe that diagnostic studies for food intolerances are cost-effective or particularly helpful; however, exclusion diets may be beneficial. I introduce fiber supplements gradually and monitor them for tolerance and palatability. Synthetic fiber is often better-tolerated than natural fiber, but must be individualized. In my experience, excessive fiber supplementation often is counterproductive, as abdominal cramps and bloating may worsen. Antidiarrheal agents are very effective when used correctly, preferably in divided doses. I use them in patients in anticipation of diarrhea and especially in those who fear symptoms when engaged in activities outside the home. I encourage patients to make decisions as to when and how much to use. However, almost always, a morning dose before breakfast is used (loperamide, 2 to 6 mg) and, perhaps again later in the day when symptoms of diarrhea are prominent. I prefer antispasmodics to be used intermittently in response to periods of increased abdominal pain, cramps, and urgency. For patients with daily symptoms, especially after meals, agents such as dicyclomine before meals are useful. For patients with infrequent but severe episodes of unpredictable pain, sublingual hyoscyamine often produces rapid relief and instills confidence. In general, I recommend that oral antispasmodics be used for a limited period of time rather than indefinitely, and generally for periods of time when symptoms are prominent. For chronic visceral pain syndromes, I recommend small doses of tricyclic antidepressants. These agents are especially effective in diarrhea-predominant patients with disturbed sleep patterns but may be unacceptable to patients with constipation. I educate patients that side effects occur early and benefits may not be apparent for 3 to 4 weeks. I consider using SSRIs in low doses in patients with constipation-predominant IBS; cisapride, 10 to 20 mg three times per day, also may be beneficial. When taken with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450, cisapride has been associated with serious cardiac arrhythmias caused by QT prolongation, including ventricular arrhythmias and torsades de pointes. These drugs include the azole fungicides; erythromycin, clarithromycin, and troleandomycin; some antidepressants; HIV protease inhibitors; and others. In patients with IBS with mild to moderate co-morbid depression, I have found that the use of SSRIs such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, or sertraline may be beneficial. It is important to tell patients that anxiety and disturbed sleep may occur during the first 10 days and benefits may not occur for 3 to 4 weeks. I prescribe a small amount of a short-acting benzodiazepine such as alprazolam, 0.5 mg two times per day, to control these symptoms. For generalized anxiety without depression, buspirone or clonazepam may be useful. I have found that patients who also have associated panic disorder may benefit from a benzodiazepine, tricyclic antidepressant, or an SSRI. However, these patients are best managed in conjunction with a psychiatrist or psychologist. I consider the use of alternative therapies in patients who fail to respond to conventional measures and who are receptive to alternative strategies. These include general relaxation techniques such as biofeedback and hypnosis therapies.},

   abstract = {Dietary lifestyle is relevant for prevention and treatment of various colorectal conditions. Colorectal disorders have significant morbidity and mortality in a western-style community, particularly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colorectal cancer, haemorrhoids, constipation and diverticular disease. This review addresses how bowel health can be maintained, what foods and dietary lifestyles are associated with risk for disease and what foods are of real value in management. Bowel health is that state where the individual is satisfied with defaecation, the diet does not create undue risk for disease and lumenal contents maintain an intact and functional mucosa. Bowel health depends on a healthy dietary lifestyle, but in particular on an adequate intake of non-digestable dietary polysaccharide. Diet influences biology in part by altering the lumenal environment. Effects such as high butyrate levels, lowered pH, a predominance of 'healthy'over 'unhealthy' bacteria, rapid intestinal transit, high faecal bulk, a non-leaky epithelial barrier, adsorption of dietary carcinogens by fibre, low bile salt concentrations, reduced generation of toxic bile salts or protein derivatives and provision of certain bioactive substances are seen as beneficial. Diet influences future risk for colorectal cancer (vegetables, animal fats, polysaccharides amongst others) and for diverticular disease (fibre). Adequate fibre and resistant starch can improve constipation and anorectal conditions such as fissure and haemorrhoids. The role of diet in managing patients with IBS is complex. Fibre may worsen symptoms in severe cases of IBS, diverticular disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Certain carbohydrates of limited digestibility/absorbability, such as lactose, fructose and sorbitol, can precipitate IBS symptoms. Low fat, high fibre diets may reduce recurrence of colorectal adenomas. Diet has a significant role to play in colorectal disorders.},
