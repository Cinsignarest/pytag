   abstract = {In 1995, by reverse pharmacology approach, used here for the first time in the history of pharmacology, nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) has been discovered as the endogenous ligand of a preidentified receptor named opioid receptor like 1. Subsequent studies showed that N/OFQ and its receptor (N/OFQergic system) are widely distributed in central and peripheral nervous systems as well as in peripheral organs of human and animals, and represent a system that is involved in a very large range of biological functions such as pain perception, intestinal motility and secretion, immune modulation, stress. From the time of its discovery to now, a high number of NOP agonists and antagonists have been synthesized and tested in various pathologies. Nevertheless, none of the molecules targeting N/OFQergic system have currently succeeded in going through clinical trials concerning gut pathologies, indicating that further studies are required. The work from Dr. Fichna et al., published in the present issue of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, adds another brick in the wall of understanding the role of N/OFQergic system in IBS-D pathology by the pharmacological evaluation of a new NOP receptor agonist, SCH 221510, in animal models of intestinal alterations (diarrhea and visceral hyperalgesia). Interestingly, authors report clinical data confirming the involvement of N/OFQergic system in IBS-D patients and, consequently, suggest this system as a valuable therapeutic target for IBS-D pathology. This minireview aims to give a brief summary of experimental and clinical studies focusing on the N/OFQergic system as pharmacological target for the therapeutic treatment of intestinal pathologies such as IBS and IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Excess body weight, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption and certain dietary factors are individually related to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk; however, little is known about their joint effects. The aim of this study was to develop a healthy lifestyle index (HLI) composed of five potentially modifiable lifestyle factors--healthy weight, physical activity, non-smoking, limited alcohol consumption and a healthy diet, and to explore the association of this index with CRC incidence using data collected within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. METHODS: In the EPIC cohort, a total of 347,237 men and women, 25- to 70-years old, provided dietary and lifestyle information at study baseline (1992 to 2000). Over a median follow-up time of 12 years, 3,759 incident CRC cases were identified. The association between a HLI and CRC risk was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models and population attributable risks (PARs) have been calculated. RESULTS: After accounting for study centre, age, sex and education, compared with 0 or 1 healthy lifestyle factors, the hazard ratio (HR) for CRC was 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44 to 0.77) for two factors, 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70 to 0.89) for three factors, 0.66 (95% CI: 0.58 to 0.75) for four factors and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.54 to 0.74) for five factors; P-trend<0.0001. The associations were present for both colon and rectal cancers, HRs, 0.61 (95% CI: 0.50 to 0.74; P for trend<0.0001) for colon cancer and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.88; P-trend<0.0001) for rectal cancer, respectively (P-difference by cancer sub-site=0.10). Overall, 16% of the new CRC cases (22% in men and 11% in women) were attributable to not adhering to a combination of all five healthy lifestyle behaviours included in the index. CONCLUSIONS: Combined lifestyle factors are associated with a lower incidence of CRC in European populations characterized by western lifestyles. Prevention strategies considering complex targeting of multiple lifestyle factors may provide practical means for improved CRC prevention.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Luminal serine-proteases lead to increased colonic paracellular permeability and visceral hypersensitivity in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Other proteases, namely cysteine-proteases (CPs), increase airway permeability by digesting epithelial tight junction proteins. In this study, we focused on constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) and we aimed to (i) evaluate CP levels in two cohorts of IBS patients, (ii) test if IBS-C fecal supernatant (FSN) affects permeability, and visceral sensitivity after repeated administrations in mice, and (iii) evaluate occludin expression in IBS-C colonic biopsies. METHODS: Fecal CP activity was determined using selective substrate and inhibitor (E64). The effect of papain, as positive control, and IBS-C FSN administrations were evaluated on colonic paracellular permeability and mucosal occludin levels in mice and T84 monolayers. Occludin protein levels were evaluated in IBS-C colonic biopsies. Sensitivity to colorectal distension (CRD) was measured after repeated administrations of IBS-C FSN. RESULTS: We found in a subset of IBS-C patients an enhanced fecal CP activity, in comparison with healthy controls and IBS-D patients. CP activity levels positively correlated with disease severity and abdominal pain scoring. This association was confirmed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. In mice, repeated application of IBS-C FSN into colon triggered increased permeability, linked to the enzymatic degradation of occludin, and was associated with enhanced visceral sensitivity to CRD. Finally, occludin levels were found decreased in colonic biopsies from IBS-C patients, and IBS-C FSNs were able to degrade recombinant human occludin in vitro. All these effects were abolished by preincubation of IBS-C FSN with a CP inhibitor, E64. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that luminal CPs may represent a new factor contributing to the genesis of symptoms in IBS.},

   abstract = {The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between serum concentrations of several persistent organic pollutants and insulin resistance markers in a cohort of women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus. summation operatorPOPs was computed as the sum of individual serum POP concentrations. No statistically significant associations were found between levels of any POP and fasting glucose. However, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners 138 and 180 were positively associated with 2-h glucose levels and PCB 180 also with fasting immunoreactive insulin (IRI). We also found a positive association of p,p'- dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'- DDE), PCBs (138, 153, and 180), hexachlorobenzene, and summation operatorPOPs with 2-h IRI. Serum concentrations of PCBs (138, 153, and 180), hexachlorobenzene, and summation operatorPOPs were also positively associated with homeostasis model assessment (HOMA2-IR) levels. Moreover, p,p'- DDE, PCBs (138, 153 and 180), hexachlorobenzene, and summation operatorPOPs were negatively associated with Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI-gly) levels. No significant association was found between glycated hemoglobin and the concentrations of any POP. The removal of women under blood glucose lowering treatment from the models strengthened most of the associations previously found for the whole population. Our findings suggest that exposure to certain POPs is a modifiable risk factor contributing to insulin resistance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Bile acids may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS. We investigated the potential effects of bile acids entering the colon and its role in the symptom pattern in IBS. DESIGN: We measured 75Se-labelled homocholic acid-taurine (75SeHCAT) retention, and serum levels of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 in patients with IBS (n=141) and control subjects (75SeHCAT n=29; C4 and FGF19 n=435). In patients with IBS stool frequency and form, as well as GI symptom severity were registered, and in a proportion of patients colonic transit time and rectal sensitivity were measured (n=66). An 8-week open-label treatment with colestipol was offered to patients with 75SeHCAT <20%, and the effect of treatment was evaluated with IBS severity scoring system and adequate relief of IBS symptoms. RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with IBS had lower 75SeHCAT values (p=0.005), higher C4c levels (C4 corrected for cholesterol) (p<0.001), but similar FGF19 levels. Abnormal 75SeHCAT retention (<10%) was seen in 18% of patients, whereas 23% had elevated C4c levels. Patients with IBS with 75SeHCAT retention <10% had more frequent stools, accelerated colonic transit time, rectal hyposensitivity, a higher body mass index, higher C4c and lower FGF19 levels. Colestipol treatment improved IBS symptoms (IBS severity scoring system 220+/-109 vs. 277+/-106; p<0.01), and 15/27 patients fulfilled criteria for treatment response (adequate relief >/=50% of weeks 5-8). CONCLUSIONS: Increased colonic bile acid exposure influences bowel habit and colonic transit time in patients with IBS. A high response rate to open label treatment with colestipol supports this, but placebo-controlled studies are warranted.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Low-grade intestinal inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of IBS. In this trial, we aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of mesalazine in patients with IBS. DESIGN: We conducted a phase 3, multicentre, tertiary setting, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with Rome III confirmed IBS. Patients were randomly assigned to either mesalazine, 800 mg, or placebo, three times daily for 12 weeks, and were followed for additional 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was satisfactory relief of abdominal pain/discomfort for at least half of the weeks of the treatment period. The key secondary endpoint was satisfactory relief of overall IBS symptoms. Supportive analyses were also performed classifying as responders patients with a percentage of affirmative answers of at least 75% or >75% of time. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients with IBS were enrolled from 21 centres. For the primary endpoint, the responder patients were 68.6% in the mesalazine group versus 67.4% in the placebo group (p=0.870; 95% CI -12.8 to 15.1). In explorative analyses, with the 75% rule or >75% rule, the percentage of responders was greater in the mesalazine group with a difference over placebo of 11.6% (p=0.115; 95% CI -2.7% to 26.0%) and 5.9% (p=0.404; 95% CI -7.8% to 19.4%), respectively, although these differences were not significant. For the key secondary endpoint, overall symptoms improved in the mesalazine group and reached a significant difference of 15.1% versus placebo (p=0.032; 95% CI 1.5% to 28.7%) with the >75% rule. CONCLUSIONS: Mesalazine treatment was not superior than placebo on the study primary endpoint. However, a subgroup of patients with IBS showed a sustained therapy response and benefits from a mesalazine therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClincialTrials.gov number, NCT00626288.},

   abstract = {The Monash University low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet is now accepted as an effective strategy for managing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in Australia, with interest expanding across the world. These poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates have been shown to induce IBS symptoms of diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, and flatus due to their poor absorption, osmotic activity, and rapid fermentation. Four clinical trials have been published to date, all with significant symptomatic response to the low FODMAP diet. Up to 86% of patients with IBS have achieved relief of overall gastrointestinal symptoms and, more specifically, bloating, flatus, abdominal pain, and altered bowel habit from the approach. This review provides an overview of the low FODMAP diet and summarizes the research to date, emerging concepts, and limitations. FODMAPs are known to be beneficial to bowel health; the importance of this and how this should be considered in the clinical management of IBS is also discussed. A clinical management flowchart is provided to assist nutrition professionals in the use of this approach.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In Australia, faecal incontinence, the involuntary loss of liquid or solid stool with or without a person's awareness, has been reported in 8% of the South Australian and 11% of the urban New South Wales community-dwelling populations. Studies conducted in 2004 and 2005 reported faecal incontinence in more than 20% of colorectal and urogynaecological clinic patients at Townsville Hospital (a referral centre serving rural North Queensland). This prompted concern regarding the level of faecal incontinence in the community. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of faecal incontinence in the North and Far North Queensland urban and rural communities. METHODS: The sample size was based on the New South Wales postal surveys (11% prevalence). Higher rates were expected in North/Far North Queensland, so prevalence there was estimated at 12.1% (confidence interval +/- 2%, ie the true level to be between 10.1% and 14.1%). The sample for each of the Townsville, Cairns (in Far North Queensland) and rural/remote settings was calculated at 1022. The database for the present study was compiled using a systematic randomised process selecting two private names from each column on each page of the Cairns and Townsville White Pages(R) (Cairns: 1112 urban, 481 rural, 226 remote; Townsville: 1049 urban, 432 rural, 320 remote). The questionnaire covered personal demographics, health/risk factors, bowel habits, nutrition (fibre and fluid intake) and physical activity. Faecal incontinence was defined as accidental leakage of solid or liquid stool in the past 12 months that was not caused by a virus, medication or contaminated food. To improve the response rate a participation incentive of a chance to win a $250 voucher or one of ten $50 vouchers was offered in the initial mail-out. The initial survey was mailed out in July 2007; two follow-up surveys were mailed out to non-responders in September 2007 and January 2008. One hundred randomly selected non-responders were telephoned in February 2008. RESULTS: A total of 1523 responses provided a 48.1% response rate. Faecal incontinence prevalence was 12.7% (174/1366) with no gender or locality differences. Prevalence increased significantly with age in men (p=0.034), but not in women. Only 10 respondents with faecal incontinence consulted their doctor in the previous year for this reason. Incontinent respondents had significantly more medical conditions including urinary incontinence, coeliac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, injury to the anus, bowel cancer, spinal cord disease, neurological disease and psychiatric problems (all, p< 0.05). Stool-related accidental bowel leakage including faecal incontinence (defined), soiling with flatus or urgency, was 18.2%. An additional 3% were possibly incontinent, having disclosed leakage of mucus, bothersome or passive staining. Of the remaining respondents, 16.2% reported incontinent episodes due to an acute illness, 22.9% could not always differentiate between flatus and stool, and only 35.2% reported neither concerns with nor accidental bowel leakage. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high level of untreated faecal incontinence in North/Far North Queensland communities. Demand for treatment will increase because of the ageing population and the expectations of younger, more assertive cohorts.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: SCN5A encodes the alpha-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.5. Many patients with cardiac arrhythmias caused by mutations in SCN5A also have symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We investigated whether patients with IBS have SCN5A variants that affect the function of NaV1.5. METHODS: We performed genotype analysis of SCN5A in 584 persons with IBS and 1380 without IBS (controls). Mutant forms of SCN5A were expressed in human embryonic kidney-293 cells, and functions were assessed by voltage clamp analysis. A genome-wide association study was analyzed for an association signal for the SCN5A gene, and replicated in 1745 patients in 4 independent cohorts of IBS patients and controls. RESULTS: Missense mutations were found in SCN5A in 13 of 584 patients (2.2%, probands). Diarrhea-predominant IBS was the most prevalent form of IBS in the overall study population (25%). However, a greater percentage of individuals with SCN5A mutations had constipation-predominant IBS (31%) than diarrhea-predominant IBS (10%; P < .05). Electrophysiologic analysis showed that 10 of 13 detected mutations disrupted NaV1.5 function (9 loss-of-function and 1 gain-of-function function). The p. A997T-NaV1.5 had the greatest effect in reducing NaV1.5 function. Incubation of cells that expressed this variant with mexiletine restored their sodium current and administration of mexiletine to 1 carrier of this mutation (who had constipation-predominant IBS) normalized their bowel habits. In the genome-wide association study and 4 replicated studies, the SCN5A locus was strongly associated with IBS. CONCLUSIONS: About 2% of patients with IBS carry mutations in SCN5A. Most of these are loss-of-function mutations that disrupt NaV1.5 channel function. These findings provide a new pathogenic mechanism for IBS and possible treatment options.},

   abstract = {Background: Nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), occurring in patients without celiac disease yet whose gastrointestinal symptoms improve on a gluten-free diet (GFD), is largely a self-reported diagnosis and would appear to be very common. The aims of this study were to characterize patients who believe they have NCGS. Materials and Methods: Advertising was directed toward adults who believed they had NCGS and were willing to participate in a clinical trial. Respondents were asked to complete a questionnaire about symptoms, diet, and celiac investigation. Results: Of 248 respondents, 147 completed the survey. Mean age was 43.5 years, and 130 were women. Seventy-two percent did not meet the description of NCGS due to inadequate exclusion of celiac disease (62%), uncontrolled symptoms despite gluten restriction (24%), and not following a GFD (27%), alone or in combination. The GFD was self-initiated in 44% of respondents; in other respondents it was prescribed by alternative health professionals (21%), dietitians (19%), and general practitioners (16%). No celiac investigations had been performed in 15% of respondents. Of 75 respondents who had duodenal biopsies, 29% had no or inadequate gluten intake at the time of endoscopy. Inadequate celiac investigation was common if the GFD was initiated by self (69%), alternative health professionals (70%), general practitioners (46%), or dietitians (43%). In 40 respondents who fulfilled the criteria for NCGS, their knowledge of and adherence to the GFD were excellent, and 65% identified other food intolerances. Conclusions: Just over 1 in 4 respondents self-reporting as NCGS fulfill criteria for its diagnosis. Initiation of a GFD without adequate exclusion of celiac disease is common. In 1 of 4 respondents, symptoms are poorly controlled despite gluten avoidance.},

   abstract = {Data are accumulating that emphasize the important role of the intestinal barrier and intestinal permeability for health and disease. However, these terms are poorly defined, their assessment is a matter of debate, and their clinical significance is not clearly established. In the present review, current knowledge on mucosal barrier and its role in disease prevention and therapy is summarized. First, the relevant terms 'intestinal barrier' and 'intestinal permeability' are defined. Secondly, the key element of the intestinal barrier affecting permeability are described. This barrier represents a huge mucosal surface, where billions of bacteria face the largest immune system of our body. On the one hand, an intact intestinal barrier protects the human organism against invasion of microorganisms and toxins, on the other hand, this barrier must be open to absorb essential fluids and nutrients. Such opposing goals are achieved by a complex anatomical and functional structure the intestinal barrier consists of, the functional status of which is described by 'intestinal permeability'. Third, the regulation of intestinal permeability by diet and bacteria is depicted. In particular, potential barrier disruptors such as hypoperfusion of the gut, infections and toxins, but also selected over-dosed nutrients, drugs, and other lifestyle factors have to be considered. In the fourth part, the means to assess intestinal permeability are presented and critically discussed. The means vary enormously and probably assess different functional components of the barrier. The barrier assessments are further hindered by the natural variability of this functional entity depending on species and genes as well as on diet and other environmental factors. In the final part, we discuss selected diseases associated with increased intestinal permeability such as critically illness, inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease, food allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, and--more recently recognized--obesity and metabolic diseases. All these diseases are characterized by inflammation that might be triggered by the translocation of luminal components into the host. In summary, intestinal permeability, which is a feature of intestinal barrier function, is increasingly recognized as being of relevance for health and disease, and therefore, this topic warrants more attention.},

   abstract = {AIM: The aim of the study was to explore the impact of irritable bowel syndrome on daily life from a gender perspective. BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common functional disorder, characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhoea and/or constipation. Sufferers experience negative emotions due to unpredictable symptoms and sometimes feel trivialized by healthcare professionals. The sufferers' experience of living with this disorder has never been explored from a gender perspective. DESIGN: A qualitative, interpretative method was used. METHODS: A qualitative, hermeneutic method was applied. Interviews were conducted with 19 patients in 2011 and analysed in a constructionist gender framework. Constructionist gender theory views gender and identity as cultural constructs that develop through interplay between the individual and his/her social context and cultural norms. FINDINGS: The main theme to emerge from the interviews was as follows: 'A normative framework of femaleness and maleness leads to suffering for persons with irritable bowel syndrome'. This consists of three interwoven themes: 'Being forced to abandon gender illusions'; 'Being forced to transcend taboos' and 'Reinforced suffering in healthcare encounters'. Men demonstrated masculinity by stressing the importance of being solid family providers while women spoke of nurturing and relational responsibilities in line with traditional notions of femininity. CONCLUSION: The experience of living with irritable bowel syndrome differs between men and women due to differing societal expectations, life situation and the everyday construction of gender identities. Gender stereotyping by healthcare professionals perpetuates rather than alleviates the suffering experienced by men and women with irritable bowel syndrome. In healthcare encounters, women risk being trivialized and men risk being overlooked due to the 'female health concern' label attached to irritable bowel syndrome.},

The current accepted criteria for the diagnosis of SIBO is the presence of coliform bacteria isolated from the proximal jejunum with >10(5) colony-forming units/mL. A major concern with luminal aspiration is that it is only one random sampling of the small intestine and may not always be representative of the underlying microbiota. A new approach to examine the underlying microbiota uses rapid molecular sequencing, but its clinical utilization is still under active investigation. Clinical manifestations of SIBO are variable and include bloating, flatulence, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Severe cases may present with nutrition deficiencies due to malabsorption of micro- and macronutrients. The current management strategies for SIBO center on identifying and correcting underlying causes, addressing nutrition deficiencies, and judicious utilization of antibiotics to treat symptomatic SIBO.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food and diet are central issues that concern patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Few studies have thoroughly analyzed dietary intake in IBS. Our aims were to determine the nutrient intake in IBS patients in comparison to the general population, assess nutritional differences between IBS subgroups based on the predominant bowel habit or symptom severity, as well as to evaluate if their nutrient intake meet nutrition recommendations. METHODS: We included 187 IBS patients (mean 40.2 years; 139 women). They completed a 4-days food registration record, which was compared with an age-, and gender-matched control group (n = 374; 278 women) from a nation-wide dietary survey and with Nordic Nutrient Recommendations. KEY RESULTS: Daily nutrient intake in IBS patients was similar to the general population and met national nutrients recommendations. Irritable bowel syndrome patients had similar energy distribution from macronutrients compared to the control group, but the protein percentage tended to be higher. Irritable bowel syndrome patients also had significantly higher daily intake of vitamin E, folate, iron, vitamin C, and dietary fibers, as well as lower intake of vitamin A, riboflavin, calcium, and potassium. There was no association between nutrient intake and IBS subtypes or symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Although many IBS patients state that they avoid food items, this does not seem to influence their intake of nutrients to any large extent. The observed minor differences in nutrient intake indicate a tendency toward higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of meat and dairy products in IBS patients.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is innervated by several distinct populations of neurons, whose cell bodies either reside within (intrinsic) or outside (extrinsic) the gastrointestinal wall. Normally, most individuals are unaware of the continuous, complicated functions of these neurons. However, for patients with gastrointestinal disorders, such as IBD and IBS, altered gastrointestinal motility, discomfort and pain are common, debilitating symptoms. Although bouts of intestinal inflammation underlie the symptoms associated with IBD, increasing preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that infection and inflammation are also key risk factors for the development of other gastrointestinal disorders. Notably, a strong correlation exists between prior exposure to gut infection and symptom occurrence in IBS. This Review discusses the evidence for neuroplasticity (structural, synaptic or intrinsic changes that alter neuronal function) affecting gastrointestinal function. Such changes are evident during inflammation and, in many cases, long after healing of the damaged tissues, when the nervous system fails to reset back to normal. Neuroplasticity within distinct populations of neurons has a fundamental role in the aberrant motility, secretion and sensation associated with common clinical gastrointestinal disorders. To find appropriate therapeutic treatments for these disorders, the extent and time course of neuroplasticity must be fully appreciated.},

The microflora in children is plastic, susceptible to changes in response to diet modifications, antibiotic treatment and other events, providing the opportunity to study its functional role. Increasing evidence highlights the role of nutrition in the age-related development of microflora. Eubiosis, that is, a normal microflora structure, provides protection against infections, educates the immune system, ensures tolerance to foods, and contributes to nutrient digestion and energy harvest. Changes in microflora, consisting in the overpresence of harmful species or underpresence of commensal species, or dysbiosis produce dysfunctions, such as intestinal inflammation or dysmotility. Moreover abnormal pattern of microflora have been consistently detected in specific diseases. SUMMARY: A relationship exists between eubiosis and functions and conversely between dysbiosis and dysfunctions or even diseases. Abnormalities in microflora composition may trigger or contribute to specific diseases. This raises the hypothesis to target microflora in order to restore eubiosis through the use of antibiotics, probiotics or nutrients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Diets high in saturated and trans fat and low in unsaturated fat may increase type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk, but studies on foods high in fat per unit weight are sparse. We assessed whether the intake of vegetable oil, butter, margarine, nuts and seeds and cakes and cookies is related to incident T2D. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A case-cohort study was conducted, nested within eight countries of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC), with 12,403 incident T2D cases and a subcohort of 16,835 people, identified from a cohort of 340,234 people. Diet was assessed at baseline (1991-1999) by country-specific questionnaires. Country-specific hazard ratios (HRs) across four categories of fatty foods (nonconsumers and tertiles among consumers) were combined with random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: After adjustment not including body mass index (BMI), nonconsumers of butter, nuts and seeds and cakes and cookies were at higher T2D risk compared with the middle tertile of consumption. Among consumers, cakes and cookies were inversely related to T2D (HRs across increasing tertiles 1.14, 1.00 and 0.92, respectively; P-trend <0.0001). All these associations attenuated upon adjustment for BMI, except the higher risk of nonconsumers of cakes and cookies (HR 1.57). Higher consumption of margarine became positively associated after BMI adjustment (HRs across increasing consumption tertiles: 0.93, 1.00 and 1.12; P-trend 0.03). Within consumers, vegetable oil, butter and nuts and seeds were unrelated to T2D. CONCLUSIONS: Fatty foods were generally not associated with T2D, apart from weak positive association for margarine. The higher risk among nonconsumers of cakes and cookies needs further explanation.},

These human digestive-tract associated microbes are referred to as the gut microbiome. The human gut microbiome and its role in both health and disease has been the subject of extensive research, establishing its involvement in human metabolism, nutrition, physiology, and immune function. Imbalance of the normal gut microbiota have been linked with gastrointestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and wider systemic manifestations of disease such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atopy. In the first part of this review, we evaluate our evolving knowledge of the development, complexity, and functionality of the healthy gut microbiota, and the ways in which the microbial community is perturbed in dysbiotic disease states; the second part of this review covers the role of interventions that have been shown to modulate and stabilize the gut microbiota and also to restore it to its healthy composition from the dysbiotic states seen in IBS, IBD, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atopy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome and abdominal bloating exhibit abnormal responses of the abdominal wall to colonic gas loads. We hypothesised that in patients with postprandial bloating, ingestion of a meal triggers comparable abdominal wall dyssynergia. Our aim was to characterise abdominal accommodation to a meal in patients with postprandial bloating. DESIGN: A test meal (0.8 kcal/ml nutrients plus 27 g/litre polyethylenglycol 4000) was administered at 50 ml/min as long as tolerated in 10 patients with postprandial bloating (fulfilling Rome III criteria for postprandial distress syndrome) and 12 healthy subjects, while electromyographic (EMG) responses of the anterior wall (upper and lower rectus, external and internal oblique via bipolar surface electrodes) and the diaphragm (via six ring electrodes over an oesophageal tube in the hiatus) were measured. Means +/- SD were calculated. RESULTS: Healthy subjects tolerated a meal volume of 913+/-308 ml; normal abdominal wall accommodation to the meal consisted of diaphragmatic relaxation (EMG activity decreased by 15+/-6%) and a compensatory contraction (25+/-9% increase) of the upper abdominal wall muscles (upper rectus and external oblique), with no changes in the lower anterior muscles (lower rectus and internal oblique). Patients tolerated lower volume loads (604+/-310 ml; p=0.030 vs healthy subjects) and developed a paradoxical response, that is, diaphragmatic contraction (14+/-3% EMG increment; p<0.01 vs healthy subjects) and upper anterior wall relaxation (9+/-4% inhibition; p<0.01 vs healthy subjects). CONCLUSIONS: In functional dyspepsia, postprandial abdominal distension is produced by an abnormal viscerosomatic response to meal ingestion that alters normal abdominal accommodation.},

   abstract = {The human gut is a huge complex ecosystem where microbiota, nutrients, and host cells interact extensively, a process crucial for the gut homeostasis and host development with a real partnership. The various bacterial communities that make up the gut microbiota have many functions including metabolic, barrier effect, and trophic functions. Hence, any dysbiosis could have negative consequences in terms of health and many diseases have been associated to impairment of the gut microbiota. These close relationships between gut microbiota, health, and disease, have led to great interest in using probiotics (i.e. live micro-organisms), or prebiotics (i.e. non-digestible substrates) to positively modulate the gut microbiota to prevent or treat some diseases. This review focuses on probiotics, their mechanisms of action, safety, and major health benefits. Health benefits remain to be proven in some indications, and further studies on the best strain(s), dose, and algorithm of administration to be used are needed. Nevertheless, probiotic administration seems to have a great potential in terms of health that justifies more research.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is a vast neuroendocrine organ with extensive extrinsic and intrinsic neural circuits that interact to control its function. Circulating and paracrine hormones (amine and peptide) provide further control of secretory, absorptive, barrier, motor and sensory mechanisms that are essential to the digestion and assimilation of nutrients, and the transport and excretion of waste products. Specialized elements of the mucosa (including enteroendocrine cells, enterocytes and immune cells) and the microbiome interact with other intraluminal contents derived from the diet, and with endogenous chemicals that alter the gut's functions. The totality of these control mechanisms is often summarized as the brain-gut axis. In irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is the most common gastrointestinal disorder, there may be disturbances at one or more of these diverse control mechanisms. Patients present with abdominal pain in association with altered bowel function. This review documents advances in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms in the brain-gut axis in patients with IBS. It is anticipated that identification of one or more disordered functions in clinical practice will usher in a renaissance in the management of IBS, leading to effective therapy tailored to the needs of the individual patient.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have examined leukocyte telomere length (LTL) as a possible predictor for cancer at various organ sites. The hypothesis originally motivating many of these studies was that shorter telomeres would be associated with an increase in cancer risk; the results of epidemiologic studies have been inconsistent, however, and suggested positive, negative, or null associations. Two studies have addressed the association of LTL in relation to pancreatic cancer risk and the results are contrasting. METHODS: We measured LTL in a prospective study of 331 pancreatic cancer cases and 331 controls in the context of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). RESULTS: We observed that the mean LTL was higher in cases (0.59 +/- 0.20) than in controls (0.57 +/- 0.17), although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.07), and a basic logistic regression model showed no association of LTL with pancreas cancer risk. When adjusting for levels of HbA1c and C-peptide, however, there was a weakly positive association between longer LTL and pancreatic cancer risk [OR, 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.27]. Additional analyses by cubic spline regression suggested a possible nonlinear relationship between LTL and pancreatic cancer risk (P = 0.022), with a statistically nonsignificant increase in risk at very low LTL, as well as a significant increase at high LTL. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results from our study do not support LTL as a uniform and strong predictor of pancreatic cancer. IMPACT: The results of this article can provide insights into telomere dynamics and highlight the complex relationship between LTL and pancreatic cancer risk.},

   abstract = {It is unknown whether children with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders identify specific foods that exacerbate their GI symptoms. The objectives of this study were to determine the perceived role of food on GI symptoms and to determine the impact of food-induced symptoms on quality of life (QOL) in children with functional GI disorders. Between August and November 2010, 25 children ages 11 to 17 years old with functional GI disorders and a parent completed a food symptom association questionnaire and validated questionnaires assessing FGID symptoms and QOL. In addition, children completed a 24-hour food recall, participated in focus groups to identify problematic foods and any coping strategies, and discussed how their QOL was affected. Statistical analyses were conducted using chi2, t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank, and Spearman's rho. Children identified a median of 11 (range=2 to 25) foods as exacerbating a GI symptom, with the most commonly identified foods being spicy foods, cow's milk, and pizza. Several coping strategies were identified, including consuming smaller portions, modifying foods, and avoiding a median of 8 (range=1 to 20) foods. Children reported that food-induced symptoms interfered with school performance, sports, and social activities. Although the parent's assessment of their child's QOL negatively correlated with the number of perceived symptom-inducing foods in their child, this relationship was not found in the children. Findings suggest that specific foods are perceived to exacerbate GI symptoms in children with functional GI disorders. In addition, despite use of several coping strategies, food-induced symptoms can adversely impact children's QOL in several important areas.},

   abstract = {Non Celiac Gluten sensitivity (NCGS) was originally described in the 1980s and recently a "re-discovered" disorder characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, in subjects that are not affected with either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). Although NCGS frequency is still unclear, epidemiological data have been generated that can help establishing the magnitude of the problem. Clinical studies further defined the identity of NCGS and its implications in human disease. An overlap between the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and NCGS has been detected, requiring even more stringent diagnostic criteria. Several studies suggested a relationship between NCGS and neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly autism and schizophrenia. The first case reports of NCGS in children have been described. Lack of biomarkers is still a major limitation of clinical studies, making it difficult to differentiate NCGS from other gluten related disorders. Recent studies raised the possibility that, beside gluten, wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors and low-fermentable, poorly-absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates can contribute to symptoms (at least those related to IBS) experienced by NCGS patients. In this paper we report the major advances and current trends on NCGS.},

   abstract = {Various disease states are associated with an imbalance of protective and pathogenic bacteria in the gut, termed dysbiosis. Current evidence reveals that dietary factors affect the microbial ecosystem in the gut. Changes to community structure of the intestinal microbiota are not without consequence considering the wide effects that the microbes have on both local and systemic immunity. The goal of this review is to give insight into the importance of gut microbiota in disease development and the possible therapeutic interventions in clinical settings. We introduce the complex tripartite relationship between diet, microbes and the gut epithelium. This is followed by a summary of clinical evidence of diet-induced dysbiosis as a contributing factor in the development of gastrointestinal diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome and colorectal cancer, as well as systemic diseases like obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Finally, the current dietary and microbial interventions to promote a healthy microbial profile will be reviewed.},

   abstract = {Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are characterized by the presence of chronic or recurrent symptoms that are felt to originate from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which cannot be attributed to an identifiable structural or biochemical cause. Food is associated with symptom onset or exacerbation in a significant proportion of FGID patients. Despite this, the role of food in the pathogenesis of the FGIDs has remained poorly understood. For this reason, diet has largely played an adjunctive rather than a primary role in the management of FGID patients. In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion in our understanding of the role of food in GI function and sensation and how food relates to GI symptoms in FGID patients. In a series of evidence-based manuscripts produced by the Rome Foundation Working Group on the role of food in FGIDs, comprehensive reviews of the physiological changes associated with nutrient intake, and the respective roles of carbohydrates, fiber, protein, and fats are provided. The series concludes with a manuscript that provides guidance on proper clinical trial design when considering the role of food in FGIDs.},

METHODS: Secondary analysis of data obtained from a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial, evaluating low dose amitriptyline in children with a diagnosis of functional abdominal pain, functional dyspepsia, and irritable bowel syndrome according to the Rome II criteria. Children 8-17 years of age were recruited from the pediatric gastroenterology clinics of 6 tertiary care centers in the United States. The electrocardiograms (EKGs) done prior to initiation of amitrityline and 1 mo after initiation of amitriptyline were examined. The changes in cardiac conduction were evaluated in patients and controls. RESULTS: Thirty children were included in the study. There were 12 patients, ages 9-17 years of both genders, in the amitriptyline treatment group and 18 patients, ages 9-17 years of both genders, in the placebo treatment group. None of the patients had any baseline EKG abnormality. Amitriptyline use was associated with an increase in heart rate (P = 0.024) and QTc interval (P = 0.0107) as compared to pre-EKGs. Children in the placebo group were also noted to present a statistically significant increase in QTc interval (P = 0.0498). None of the patients developed borderline QTc prolongation or long-QT syndrome after they were started on amitriptyline. CONCLUSION: The study findings suggest that once patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders have been screened for prolonged QTc interval on baseline EKG, they probably do not need a second EKG for reevaluation of cardiac conduction after starting low dose amitriptyline.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Melatonin (MEL) exerts beneficial effects on the gut partly by myorelaxative properties upon the smooth muscle. Its secretion decreases with age, particularly in postmenopausal women. This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of MEL on the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in this group of patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The investigations were carried out in 80 postmenopausal women, aged 48-65 years, divided into two equal groups, diagnosed according to Rome Criteria III: i.e. patients with IBS with constipation predominant (IBS-C), and patients with IBS with diarrhoea predominant (IBS-D). The control group (C) included healthy women aged 46-65 years. In all subjects, 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6-HMS) concentration urine was measured using ELISA assay. Patients in both groups over the course of six months were given melatonin (at a dose of 3 mg fasting and 5 mg at bedtime) or a placebo (double blind trial). Disease activity was evaluated after two, four and six months, using a ten-point scale to assess the main somatic symptoms: visceral pain, abdominal bloating, etc. RESULTS: The amounts of 6-HMS urine excretion (mug/24 h) were: C 11.4 +/- 3.0, IBS-C 10.2 +/- 3.2, IBS-D 14.0 +/- 6.3 (p < 0.05). Correlation between values of symptoms score and contrary excretion of 6-HMS: IBS-C r = -0.714, IBS-D r = 0.409. After six months in the IBS-C group, the intensity of visceral pain and abdominal bloating had decreased in 70% of patients (p < 0.01) and constipation in 50% of patients (p < 0.05). Beneficial changes in the IBS-D group were noted in 45% of patients, but this was not better compared to the placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin can be used as part of the treatment of IBS, particularly in patients with constipation-predominant IBS.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) exert beneficial effect on gastrointestinal tract (GIT), but its mechanism has not been recognized. One of the hypothesis assumes, that fluoxetine increases indirectly melatonin production. For this reason it can be hypothesized, that administration of drugs of opposite effect, for example tianepine (selective serotonin reuptake enhancer (SSRE), can reduce melatonin production resulting in harmful effects as regards GIT. The aim of the study was to confirm or reject this hypothesis. The study included 100 patients, aged 21-58 years, with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Basing on the Rome III Criteria patients with constipation-predominant (IBS-C, n=50) and with diarrhoea-predominant (IBS-D, n=50) and 25 health volunteers (control group C) were distinguished. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) were used to determine the severity of somatic and psychic symptoms. The concentration of 6-sultatoxymelatonin (6-HMS) in the urine was measured by ELISA method. In both groups the patients were administrated tianeptine 12.5 mg three times daily or placebo for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of tianeptine therapy no significant changes were found in urinary 6-HMS excretion both in IBS-C group (9.9+/-3.2 versus 11.5+/-3.5 mug/24 h) and in IBS-D group (11.8+/-3.3 versus 12.2+/-3.5 mug/24 h). Eight-week tianeptine therapy resulted in significant decrease of somatic and psychic symptoms in both investigated groups. The improvement in the quality of life indices was obtained in 76.5% of IBS-C and in 63.3% of IBS-D patients. CONCLUSIONS: tianeptine does not impair melatonin homeostasis in patients with IB, diminishes IBS symptoms and improves the patients' quality of life.},

   abstract = {We sought to determine whether a low fermentable substrate diet (LFSD) decreases abdominal pain frequency in children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to identify potential microbial factors related to diet efficacy. Pain symptoms, stooling characteristics, breath hydrogen and methane, whole intestinal transit time, stool microbiome, and metabolite composition were collected and/or documented in eight children with IBS at baseline and during one week of an LFSD intervention. Pain frequency (P<0.05), pain severity (P<0.05), and pain-related interference with activities (P<0.05) decreased in the subjects while on the LFSD. Responders vs. non-responders: four children (50%) were identified as responders (> 50% decrease in abdominal pain frequency while on the LFSD). There were no differences between responders and non-responders with respect to hydrogen production, methane production, stooling characteristics, or gut transit time. Responders were characterized by increased pre-LFSD abundance of bacterial taxa belonging to the genera Sporobacter (P<0.05) and Subdoligranulum (P<0.02) and decreased abundance of taxa belonging to Bacteroides (P<0.05) relative to non-responders. In parallel, stool metabolites differed between responders and non-responders and were associated with differences in microbiome composition. These pilot study results suggest that an LFSD may be effective in decreasing GI symptoms in children with IBS. Microbial factors such as gut microbiome composition and stool metabolites while on the diet may relate to LFSD efficacy.},

Furthermore, the "microbiota" greatly impacts the bi-directional brain-gut axis communication. This article describes IBS in relation to similar diseases, presents the background to osteopathy, and proposes osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) to manage IBS. In IBS, OMT focuses on the nervous and circulatory systems, spine, viscera, and thoracic and pelvic diaphragms in order to restore homeostatic balance, normalize autonomic activity in the intestine, promote lymphatic flow, and address somatic dysfunction. Lymphatic and venous congestion are treated by the lymphatic pump techniques and stimulation of Chapmans reflex points. A simple treatment plan designed to lessen chronic pain and inflammation in IBS is presented based on current evidence-based literature. Since food itself, food allergies, and intolerance could contribute to symptom onset or even cause IBS, this article also provides dietary modifications to consider for patients.},

There is evidence that interactions within the brain and gut axis (BGA), that involves both the afferent-ascending and the efferent-descending pathways, as well as the somatosensory cortex, insula, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus, are deranged in IBS showing both the activation and inactivation. Clinical manifestations of IBS such as pain, altered gut motility, and psychological dysfunction may each be explained, in part, through the changes in the BGA, but there is conflicting information, and its precise role is not fully understood. A better understanding of the BGA may shed more knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of IBS that in turn may lead to the discovery of novel therapies for this common disorder.},

   abstract = {A variety of foods have been implicated in symptoms of patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) but wheat products are most frequently cited by patients as a trigger. Our aim was to investigate the effects of breads, which were fermented for different lengths of time, on the colonic microbiota using in vitro batch culture experiments. A set of in vitro anaerobic culture systems were run over a period of 24 h using faeces from 3 different IBS donors (Rome Criteria-mainly constipated) and 3 healthy donors. Changes in gut microbiota during a time course were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), whilst the small-molecular weight metabolomic profile was determined by NMR analysis. Gas production was separately investigated in non pH-controlled, 36 h batch culture experiments. Numbers of bifidobacteria were higher in healthy subjects compared to IBS donors. In addition, the healthy donors showed a significant increase in bifidobacteria (P<0.005) after 8 h of fermentation of a bread produced using a sourdough process (type C) compared to breads produced with commercial yeasted dough (type B) and no time fermentation (Chorleywood Breadmaking process) (type A). A significant decrease of delta-Proteobacteria and most Gemmatimonadetes species was observed after 24 h fermentation of type C bread in both IBS and healthy donors. In general, IBS donors showed higher rates of gas production compared to healthy donors. Rates of gas production for type A and conventional long fermentation (type B) breads were almost identical in IBS and healthy donors. Sourdough bread produced significantly lower cumulative gas after 15 h fermentation as compared to type A and B breads in IBS donors but not in the healthy controls. In conclusion, breads fermented by the traditional long fermentation and sourdough are less likely to lead to IBS symptoms compared to bread made using the Chorleywood Breadmaking Process.},

   abstract = {Despite well-known intestinal epithelial barrier impairment and visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and IBS-like models, structural and physical changes in the mucus layer remain poorly understood. Using a water avoidance stress (WAS) model, we aimed at evaluating whether 1) WAS modified gut permeability, visceral sensitivity, mucin expression, biochemical structure of O-glycans, and related mucus physical properties, and 2) whether Lactobacillus farciminis treatment prevented these alterations. Wistar rats received orally L. farciminis or vehicle for 14 days; at day 10, they were submitted to either sham or 4-day WAS. Intestinal paracellular permeability and visceral sensitivity were measured in vivo. The number of goblet cells and Muc2 expression were evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Mucosal adhesion of L. farciminis was determined ex situ. The mucin O-glycosylation profile was obtained by mass spectrometry. Surface imaging of intestinal mucus was performed at nanoscale by atomic force microscopy. WAS induced gut hyperpermeability and visceral hypersensitivity but did not modify either the number of intestinal goblet cells or Muc2 expression. In contrast, O-glycosylation of mucins was strongly affected, with the appearance of elongated polylactosaminic chain containing O-glycan structures, associated with flattening and loss of the mucus layer cohesive properties. L. farciminis bound to intestinal Muc2 and prevented WAS-induced functional alterations and changes in mucin O-glycosylation and mucus physical properties. WAS-induced functional changes were associated with mucus alterations resulting from a shift in O-glycosylation rather than from changes in mucin expression. L. farciminis treatment prevented these alterations, conferring epithelial and mucus barrier strengthening.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common gastrointestinal problems. It is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, and is associated with changes in stool frequency and/or consistency. The etiopathogenesis of IBS may be multifactorial, as is the pathophysiology, which is attributed to alterations in gastrointestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal microbiota, gut epithelium and immune function, dysfunction of the brain-gut axis or certain psychosocial factors. Current therapeutic strategies are often unsatisfactory. There is now increasing evidence linking alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota and IBS. Probiotics are living organisms which, when ingested in certain numbers, exert health benefits beyond inherent basic nutrition. Probiotics have numerous positive effects in the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, many studies have suggested that probiotics are effective in the treatment of IBS. The mechanisms of probiotics in IBS are very complex. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence and mechanisms for the use of probiotics in the treatment of IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), and in particular irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), pose a considerable burden on health care and society, and negatively impact quality of life. These are common conditions of unknown etiology, and symptom-based criteria are currently the sole nosological tools for their clinical classification. Major insight into FGID pathophysiology is therefore needed and, in recent years, increasing hope has been put on genetic research for the identification of causative pathways. This is more advanced in IBS compared with other FGID, but it has still provided often indecipherable results and no unequivocal evidence of a pathogenetic role for any particular gene. Although thousands of genetic variants have been undoubtedly linked to human disease in hundreds of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), no similar effort has yet even been attempted in FGID. If meaningful, robust, and reproducible results are to be obtained for IBS and other FGID, we must shift gear and adopt these powerful hypothesis-free approaches through concerted actions and allocation of adequate resources. Provided these are in place, the major challenge will be, inevitably, the choice of the target phenotype(s) beyond a descriptive symptom-based classification. PURPOSE: In view of these much awaited developments, salient results and difficulties inherent to IBS gene discovery are briefly summarized here.},

   abstract = {The intestinal mucosa is constantly facing a high load of antigens including bacterial antigens derived from the microbiota and food. Despite this, the immune cells present in the gastrointestinal tract do not initiate a pro-inflammatory immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors expressed by various cells in the gastrointestinal tract, including intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and resident immune cells in the lamina propria. Many diseases, including chronic intestinal inflammation (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), allergic gastroenteritis (e.g., eosinophilic gastroenteritis and allergic IBS), and infections are nowadays associated with a deregulated microbiota. The microbiota may directly interact with TLR. In addition, differences in intestinal TLR expression in health and disease may suggest that TLRs play an essential role in disease pathogenesis and may be novel targets for therapy. TLR signaling in the gut is involved in either maintaining intestinal homeostasis or the induction of an inflammatory response. This mini review provides an overview of the current knowledge regarding the contribution of intestinal epithelial TLR signaling in both tolerance induction or promoting intestinal inflammation, with a focus on food allergy. We will also highlight a potential role of the microbiota in regulating gut immune responses, especially through TLR activation.},

   abstract = {Sugar malabsorption in the bowel can lead to bloating, cramps, diarrhea and other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome as well as affecting absorption of other nutrients. The hydrogen breath test is now a well established noninvasive test for assessing malabsorption of sugars in the small intestine. However, there are patients who can suffer from the same spectrum of malabsorption issues but who produce little or no hydrogen, instead producing relatively large amounts of methane. These patients will avoid detection with the traditional breath test for malabsorption based on hydrogen detection. Likewise the hydrogen breath test is an established method for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) diagnoses. Therefore, a number of false negatives would be expected for patients who solely produce methane. Usually patients produce either hydrogen or methane, and only rarely there are significant co-producers, as typically the methane is produced at the expense of hydrogen by microbial conversion of carbon dioxide. Various studies show that methanogens occur in about a third of all adult humans; therefore, there is significant potential for malabsorbers to remain undiagnosed if a simple hydrogen breath test is used. As an example, the hydrogen-based lactose malabsorption test is considered to result in about 5-15% false negatives mainly due to methane production. Until recently methane measurements were more in the domain of research laboratories, unlike hydrogen analyses which can now be undertaken at a relatively low cost mainly due to the invention of reliable electrochemical hydrogen sensors. More recently, simpler lower cost instrumentation has become commercially available which can directly measure both hydrogen and methane simultaneously on human breath. This makes more widespread clinical testing a realistic possibility. The production of small amounts of hydrogen and/or methane does not normally produce symptoms, whereas the production of higher levels can lead to a wide range of symptoms ranging from functional disorders of the bowel to low level depression. It is possible that excess methane levels may have more health consequences than excess hydrogen levels. This review describes the health consequences of methane production in humans and animals including a summary of the state of the art in detection methods. In conclusion, the combined measurement of hydrogen and methane should offer considerable improvement in the diagnosis of malabsorption syndromes and SIBO when compared with a single hydrogen breath test.},

   abstract = {Metabolomics has increasingly been applied in addition to other "omic" approaches in the study of the pathophysiology of different gastrointestinal diseases. Metabolites represent molecular readouts of the cell status reflecting a physiological phenotype. In addition, changes in metabolite concentrations induced by exogenous factors such as environmental and dietary factors which do not affect the genome, are taken into account. Metabolic reactions initiated by the host or gut microbiota can lead to "marker" metabolites present in different biological fluids that allow differentiation between health and disease. Several lines of evidence implicated the involvement of intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Also in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a role of an abnormal microbiota composition, so-called dysbiosis, is supported by experimental data. These compositional alterations could play a role in the aetiology of both diseases by altering the metabolic activities of the gut bacteria. Several studies have applied a metabolomic approach to identify these metabolite signatures. However, before translating a potential metabolite biomarker into clinical use, additional validation studies are required. This review summarizes contributions that metabolomics has made in IBD and IBS and presents potential future directions within the field.},

   abstract = {Human biology can only be fully assessed by combining an analysis of both the host and its surrounding environment. As a part of the environment, the human gastrointestinal tract hosts more than 100 trillion bacteria making up the gut microbiota. The human host provides a nutrient-rich environment while the microbiota provides indispensable functions that humans cannot exert themselves. Shifts in the bacterial makeup of the human gut microbiota have been associated with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome and obesity. However, since most bacteria inhabiting our gut are not cultivable to date, until recently little was known about their individual functions. Metagenomics, i.e. the analysis of the collective genomes present in a defined ecosystem, gives insight into these specific functions. The first extensive catalogue of the intestinal metagenome outnumbers the size of the human genome by a factor of 150. Recently, 3 distinct 'types' of gut composition within the human population have been highlighted. These so-called 'enterotypes' are characterized by the dominant genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella and Ruminococcus) and their co-occurring phylogenetic groups. In accordance with the previously described impact of nutritional behavior (diet, probiotics and prebiotics) on specific bacterial populations, an association has been observed between long-term dietary habits and enterotypes. This recent discovery, i.e. that belonging to one or the other enterotype might be modulated by the diet opens up new perspectives in the fields of IBD, nutrition and therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {Recent progress in unravelling the nutrient-sensing mechanisms in the taste buds of the tongue has triggered studies on the existence and role of chemosensory cells in the gut. Indeed, the gastrointestinal tract is the key interface between food and the human body and can sense basic tastes in much the same way as the tongue, through the use of similar G-protein-coupled taste receptors. These receptors 'taste' the luminal content and transmit signals that regulate nutrient transporter expression and nutrient uptake, and also the release of gut hormones and neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis. Hence, they play a prominent role in the communication between the lumen, epithelium, smooth muscle cells, afferent nerve fibres and the brain to trigger adaptive responses that affect gastrointestinal function, food intake and glucose metabolism. This review summarises how sensing of nutrients by taste receptors along the gut plays a key role in the process of digestion, and how disturbances or adaptations of these chemosensory signalling pathways may contribute to the induction or resolution of a number of pathological conditions related to diabetes, obesity, or diet-induced symptom generation in irritable bowel syndrome. Targeting these receptors may represent a promising novel route for the treatment of a number of these diseases.},

Furthermore, differences of gastric motility have not been studied in children with different IBS subtypes. METHODS: Seventy-six children (33 [43%] boys, age 4-14 years, mean 7.9 years, SD 3.0 years) fulfilling Rome III criteria for IBS and 20 healthy controls (8 [40%] boys, age 4-14 years, mean 8.4 years, SD 3.0 years) were recruited (diarrhea-predominant IBS=21, IBS-C=31, mixed IBS=19, and unsubtyped IBS=5). Liquid gastric emptying rate (GER) and antral motility were assessed using an ultrasound method. RESULTS: Average GER (43.8% vs 66.2% in controls), amplitude of antral contractions (56.4% vs 89%), and antral motility index (5.1 vs 8.3) were lower and fasting antral area (1.6 vs 0.6) was higher in patients with IBS (P<0.0001). Frequency of antral contractions F (8.9 vs 9.3) did not show a significant difference. Patients exposed to stressful events had a significantly lower GER, compared to those not exposed to such events (P=0.03). Gastric motility parameters had no correlation with severity of symptoms. GER (42.6%, 46.3%, 39.6%), fasting antral area (1.4 cm(2), 1.8 cm(2), 1.8 cm(2)), amplitude of antral contractions (53%, 58.9%, 51.8%), frequency of antral contractions (8.7, 8.9, 9.2), and antral motility index (4.7, 5.3, 4.8) were not different among diarrhea-predominant IBS, IBS-C, and mixed IBS (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: GER and antral motility parameters were significantly impaired in children with IBS compared with controls. GER and antral motility parameters were not different between IBS subtypes.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Saccharomyces boulardii is a well-known probiotic worldwide, and there are numerous studies including experimental and clinical trials in children and adults by the use of S. boulardii. AREAS COVERED: The objective of the present report is to provide an update on the evidence for the efficacy of S. boulardii CNCM I-745 in different clinical conditions. Saccharomyces boulardii is one of the best-studied probiotics in acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and is shown to be safe and to reduce the duration of diarrhea and hospitalization by about 1 day. Saccharomyces boulardii is one of the recommended probiotics for AGE in children by European Society of Paediatric Infectious Diseases and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). Saccharomyces boulardii is also a recommended probiotic for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and a recent study showed promising results for the treatment of AAD in children. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the long-term use of S. boulardii in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Although some clinical studies showed positive effects of S. boulardii on inflammation, there is no clinical evidence that S. boulardii is useful in inflammatory bowel disease. Saccharomyces boulardii could be used in patients needing Helicobacter pylori eradication because the S. boulardii improves compliance, decreases the side effects and moderately increases the eradication rate. There are new promising results (improving feeding tolerance, shorten the course of hyperbilirubinemia), but we do still not recommend the routine use of S. boulardii in newborns. EXPERT OPINION: Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 is a good example for the statement that each probiotic needs to be taxonomically characterized and its efficacy and safety should be documented individually in different clinical settings.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: IBS shows genetic predisposition, but adequately powered gene-hunting efforts have been scarce so far. We sought to identify true IBS genetic risk factors by means of genome-wide association (GWA) and independent replication studies. DESIGN: We conducted a GWA study (GWAS) of IBS in a general population sample of 11,326 Swedish twins. IBS cases (N=534) and asymptomatic controls (N=4932) were identified based on questionnaire data. Suggestive association signals were followed-up in 3511 individuals from six case-control cohorts. We sought genotype-gene expression correlations through single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-expression quantitative trait loci interactions testing, and performed in silico prediction of gene function. We compared candidate gene expression by real-time qPCR in rectal mucosal biopsies of patients with IBS and controls. RESULTS: One locus at 7p22.1, which includes the genes KDELR2 (KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 2) and GRID2IP (glutamate receptor, ionotropic, delta 2 (Grid2) interacting protein), showed consistent IBS risk effects in the index GWAS and all replication cohorts and reached p=9.31x10(-6) in a meta-analysis of all datasets. Several SNPs in this region are associated with cis effects on KDELR2 expression, and a trend for increased mucosal KDLER2 mRNA expression was observed in IBS cases compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that general population-based studies combined with analyses of patient cohorts provide good opportunities for gene discovery in IBS. The 7p22.1 and other risk signals detected in this study constitute a good starting platform for hypothesis testing in future functional investigations.},

   abstract = {Several endocrine cell abnormalities have been reported in different segments of the gastrointestinal tract of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These cells have specialized microvilli that project into the lumen; they function as sensors for the gut contents and respond to luminal stimuli (mostly ingested nutrients) by releasing hormones into the lamina propria, where they exert their effects via a paracrine/endocrine mode of action. Certain food items trigger the symptoms experienced by IBS patients, including those rich in fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). In this review, we present the argument that the effects of both FODMAPs and the proportional intake of proteins, fats and carbohydrates on IBS symptoms may be caused by an interaction with the gut endocrine cells. Since the gut hormones control and regulate gastrointestinal motility and sensation, this interaction may be responsible for abnormal gastrointestinal motility and the visceral hypersensitivity observed in these patients. There is no consistent evidence that IBS patients suffer from food allergy. The role of gluten intolerance in the development of IBS symptoms in these patients remains a matter of controversy. Individual guidance on food management, which includes restrictions in the intake of FODMAP-rich foods and testing diets with different proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates has been found to reduce the symptoms, improve the quality of life, and make the habitual diet of IBS patients more healthy.},

   abstract = {Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the pathologic role of food in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Nevertheless, healthcare providers often avoid addressing diet with their patients because of a lack of training, guideline consensus, and high-quality data. Recent literature supports the existence of a subgroup of IBS patients with undiagnosed nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), a term that is used to describe individuals who experience gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms as a result of immunologic, morphologic, or symptomatic abnormalities that are precipitated by the ingestion of gluten. NCGS represents an important subgroup of patients with IBS who are highly treatable via dietary modification. Gluten may influence gastrointestinal symptoms through immune activation or alteration of intestinal permeability, but the true role of food in functional gastrointestinal symptomatology remains unclear. For example, gluten is just 1 component of the complex milieu of nutrients found in wheat and related grains, and NCGS likely represents only the tip of the iceberg as it pertains to the role of food in IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, disabling condition that greatly compromises patient functioning. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a 6-week twice per week Iyengar yoga (IY) program on IBS symptoms in adolescents and young adults (YA) with IBS compared with a usual-care waitlist control group. METHODS: Assessments of symptoms, global improvement, pain, health-related quality of life, psychological distress, functional disability, fatigue, and sleep were collected pre- and posttreatment. Weekly ratings of pain, IBS symptoms, and global improvement were also recorded until 2-month follow-up. A total of 51 participants completed the intervention (yoga = 29; usual-care waitlist = 22). RESULTS: Baseline attrition was 24%. On average, the yoga group attended 75% of classes. Analyses were divided by age group. Relative to controls, adolescents (14-17 years) assigned to yoga reported significantly improved physical functioning, whereas YA (18-26 years) assigned to yoga reported significantly improved IBS symptoms, global improvement, disability, psychological distress, sleep quality, and fatigue. Although abdominal pain intensity was statistically unchanged, 44% of adolescents and 46% of YA reported a minimally clinically significant reduction in pain following yoga, and one-third of YA reported clinically significant levels of global symptom improvement. Analysis of the uncontrolled effects and maintenance of treatment effects for adolescents revealed global improvement immediately post-yoga that was not maintained at follow-up. For YA, global improvement, worst pain, constipation, and nausea were significantly improved postyoga, but only global improvement, worst pain, and nausea maintained at the 2-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a brief IY intervention is a feasible and safe adjunctive treatment for young people with IBS, leading to benefits in a number of IBS-specific and general functioning domains for YA. The age-specific results suggest that yoga interventions may be most fruitful when developmentally tailored.},

   abstract = {The response of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) to ingestion of food is a complex and closely controlled process, which allows optimization of propulsion, digestion, absorption of nutrients, and removal of indigestible remnants. This review summarizes current knowledge on the mechanisms that control the response of the GIT to food intake. During the cephalic phase, triggered by cortical food-related influences, the GIT prepares for receiving nutrients. The gastric phase is dominated by the mechanical effect of the meal volume. Accumulation of food in the stomach activates tension-sensitive mechanoreceptors, which in turn stimulate gastric accommodation and gastric acid secretion through the intrinsic and vago-vagal reflex pathways. After meal ingestion, the tightly controlled process of gastric emptying starts, with arrival of nutrients in the duodenum triggering negative feedback on emptying and stimulating secretion of digestive enzymes through the neural (mainly vago-vagal reflex, but also intrinsic) and endocrine (release of peptides from entero-endocrine cells) pathways. Several types of specialized receptors detect the presence of all main categories of nutrients. In addition, the gastrointestinal mucosa expresses receptors of the T1R and T2R families (taste receptors) and several members of the transient receptor potential channel family, all of which are putatively involved in the detection of specific tastants in the lumen. Activation of nutrient and taste sensors also activates the extrinsic and intrinsic neural, as well as entero-endocrine, pathways. During passage through the small bowel, nutrients are progressively extracted, and electrolyte-rich liquid intestinal content with non-digestible residue is delivered to the colon. The colon provides absorption of the water and electrolytes, storage of non-digestible remnants of food, aboral propulsion of contents, and finally evacuation through defecation.},

Over the last decade, they have come to the forefront because of new knowledge on the mechanisms and treatment of these conditions. Patients with these problems often present with unexplained bloating, belching, distension, gas, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Here, we have examined the most up-to-date research on these food-related intolerances, discussed controversies, and have provided some guidelines for the dietary management of these conditions. Breath testing for carbohydrate intolerance appears to be standardized and essential for the diagnosis and management of these conditions, especially in the Western population. While current research shows that the FODMAP diet may be effective in treating some patients with irritable bowel syndrome, additional research is needed to identify more foods items that are high in FODMAPs, and to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of dietary interventions.},

Furthermore, perturbation of the microbiota-host symbiosis (dysbiosis) is considered a common pathogenic mechanism connecting gastrointestinal, ocular and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Consequently, maintaining or restoring microbiota-host symbiosis represents a new approach to treat these symptoms or to prevent their relapses. Current treatment approach assigned a primary role to live probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics to enhance colonization of beneficial bacteria and to strengthen the symbiosis. However, several papers showed major benefits of heat-killed probiotics as compared to their live counterparts on both intestinal and systemic symptoms. Recently, in addition to killing probiotics, in a proof of concept study lysates (fragments) of probiotics in combination with vitamins A, B, D and omega 3 fatty acids were successfully tested. These findings suggested a conceptual change in the approach addressed to both the microbiota and host as targets for intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conflicting evidence exists regarding the association between saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and type 2 diabetes. In this longitudinal case-cohort study, we aimed to investigate the prospective associations between objectively measured individual plasma phospholipid SFAs and incident type 2 diabetes in EPIC-InterAct participants. METHODS: The EPIC-InterAct case-cohort study includes 12,403 people with incident type 2 diabetes and a representative subcohort of 16,154 individuals who were selected from a cohort of 340.234 European participants with 3.99 million person-years of follow-up (the EPIC study). Incident type 2 diabetes was ascertained until Dec 31, 2007, by a review of several sources of evidence. Gas chromatography was used to measure the distribution of fatty acids in plasma phospholipids (mol%); samples from people with type 2 diabetes and subcohort participants were processed in a random order by centre, and laboratory staff were masked to participant characteristics. We estimated country-specific hazard ratios (HRs) for associations per SD of each SFA with incident type 2 diabetes using Prentice-weighted Cox regression, which is weighted for case-cohort sampling, and pooled our findings using random-effects meta-analysis. FINDINGS: SFAs accounted for 46% of total plasma phospholipid fatty acids. In adjusted analyses, different individual SFAs were associated with incident type 2 diabetes in opposing directions. Even-chain SFAs that were measured (14:0 [myristic acid], 16:0 [palmitic acid], and 18:0 [stearic acid]) were positively associated with incident type 2 diabetes (HR [95% CI] per SD difference: myristic acid 1.15 [95% CI 1.09-1.22], palmitic acid 1.26 [1.15-1.37], and stearic acid 1.06 [1.00-1.13]). By contrast, measured odd-chain SFAs (15:0 [pentadecanoic acid] and 17:0 [heptadecanoic acid]) were inversely associated with incident type 2 diabetes (HR [95% CI] per 1 SD difference: 0.79 [0.73-0.85] for pentadecanoic acid and 0.67 [0.63-0.71] for heptadecanoic acid), as were measured longer-chain SFAs (20:0 [arachidic acid], 22:0 [behenic acid], 23:0 [tricosanoic acid], and 24:0 [lignoceric acid]), with HRs ranging from 0.72 to 0.81 (95% CIs ranging between 0.61 and 0.92). Our findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. INTERPRETATION: Different individual plasma phospholipid SFAs were associated with incident type 2 diabetes in opposite directions, which suggests that SFAs are not homogeneous in their effects. Our findings emphasise the importance of the recognition of subtypes of these fatty acids. An improved understanding of differences in sources of individual SFAs from dietary intake versus endogenous metabolism is needed.

The study objectives were to determine the incidence of DMD/BMD in Andalusia (Spain) and to establish the percentage of affected males in whom a de novo gene mutation was responsible. METHODS: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technology was applied to determine the incidence of DMD/BMD in 84 males with suspicion of the disease and 106 female relatives. RESULTS: Dystrophin gene exon deletion (89.5%) or duplication (10.5%) was detected in 38 of the 84 males by MLPA technology; de novo mutations account for 4 (16.7%) of the 24 mother-son pairs studied. CONCLUSIONS: MLPA technology is adequate for the molecular diagnosis of DMD/BMD and establishes whether the mother carries the molecular alteration responsible for the disease, a highly relevant issue for genetic counseling.},

The aims of the study were to validate the Rome III criteria as to their capacity to differentiate between organic and functional abdominal pain and to assess the role of alarm symptoms in this differentiation. METHODS: During 2 years all of the patients (ages 4-16 years) presenting with recurrent abdominal pain (Apley criteria) and referred to secondary care were included. Clinical diagnoses were based on protocolized evaluation and intervention with 6-month follow-up. Alarm symptoms were registered. Rome III criteria for functional pain syndromes were assigned independently. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: In 200 patients (87 boys, mean age 8.8 years), organic (17%), functional (40%), combined organic and functional (9%), spontaneous recovery (27%), and other (8%) clinical diagnoses were established. Alarm symptoms were found in 57.5% (organic causes 56%, functional causes 61%). The evaluation for Rome symptom clusters revealed symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in 27%, functional dyspepsia in 15%, functional abdominal pain in 28%, functional abdominal pain syndrome in 14.5%, and no pain syndrome in 15.5%. Rome diagnoses, based on symptoms and absence of alarm symptoms, predicted functional clinical diagnosis with sensitivity 0.35 (95% confidence interval 0.27-0.43), specificity 0.60 (0.46-0.73), positive predictive value 0.71 (0.61-0.82), and negative predictive value of 0.24 (0.17-0.32). CONCLUSIONS: The Rome III criteria for abdominal pain are not specific enough to rule out organic causes. Alarm symptoms do not differentiate between organic and functional abdominal pain.},

   abstract = {Treatment options for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are notoriously either inadequate (IBS) or loaded with potentially serious side effects and risks (IBD). In recent years, a growing interest in effective and safer alternatives has focused on the potential role of probiotics and their metabolic substrates, prebiotics. It is in fact conceivable that the microbiome might be targeted by providing the metabolic fuel needed for the growth and expansion of beneficial microorganisms (prebiotics) or by administering to the host such microorganisms (probiotics). This review presents a concise update on currently available data, with a special emphasis on children. Data for prebiotics in IBS are scarce. Low doses have shown a beneficial effect, while high doses are counterproductive. On the contrary, several controlled trials of probiotics have yielded encouraging results. A meta-analysis including nine randomized clinical trials in children showed an improvement in abdominal pain for Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938, and the probiotic mixture VSL#3. The patients most benefiting from probiotics were those with predominant diarrhea or with a post-infectious IBS. In IBD, the use of prebiotics has been tested only rarely and in small scale clinical trials, with mixed results. As for probiotics, data in humans from about three dozens clinical trials offer mixed outcomes. So far, none of the tested probiotics has proven successful in Crohn's disease, while in ulcerative colitis a recent meta-analysis on 12 clinical trials (1 of them in children) showed efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in contributing to induce and to maintain remission. It is evident that this is a rapidly evolving and promising field; more data are very likely to yield a better understanding on what strains should be used in different specific clinical settings and in what doses.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome is a common gastrointestinal disorder that may affect dietary pattern, food digestion, and nutrient absorption. The nutrition-related factors are closely related to metabolic syndrome, implying that irritable bowel syndrome may be a potential risk factor for metabolic syndrome. However, few epidemiological studies are available which are related to this potential link. The purpose of this study is to determine whether irritable bowel syndrome is related to metabolic syndrome among middle-aged people. We designed a cross-sectional study of 1,096 subjects to evaluate the relationship between irritable bowel syndrome and metabolic syndrome and its components. Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome was based on the Japanese version of the Rome III Questionnaire. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the criteria of the American Heart Association scientific statements of 2009. Dietary consumption was assessed via a validated food frequency questionnaire. Principal-components analysis was used to derive 3 major dietary patterns: "Japanese", "sweets-fruits", and "Izakaya (Japanese Pub) "from 39 food groups. The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome and metabolic syndrome were 19.4% and 14.6%, respectively. No significant relationship was found between the dietary pattern factor score tertiles and irritable bowel syndrome. After adjustment for potential confounders (including dietary pattern), the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of having metabolic syndrome and elevated triglycerides for subjects with irritable bowel syndrome as compared with non-irritable bowel syndrome are 2.01(1.13-3.55) and 1.50(1.03-2.18), respectively. Irritable bowel syndrome is significantly related to metabolic syndrome and it components. This study is the first to show that irritable bowel syndrome was significantly related to a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome and elevated triglycerides among an adult population. The findings suggest that the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome may be a potentially beneficial factor for the prevention of metabolic syndrome. Further study is needed to clarify this association.},

   abstract = {Extensive research over the past half century has shown that curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of the golden spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), can modulate multiple cell signaling pathways. Extensive clinical trials over the past quarter century have addressed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of this nutraceutical against numerous diseases in humans. Some promising effects have been observed in patients with various pro-inflammatory diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, uveitis, ulcerative proctitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease, tropical pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor, oral lichen planus, gastric inflammation, vitiligo, psoriasis, acute coronary syndrome, atherosclerosis, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, renal conditions, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, beta-thalassemia, biliary dyskinesia, Dejerine-Sottas disease, cholecystitis, and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Curcumin has also shown protection against hepatic conditions, chronic arsenic exposure, and alcohol intoxication. Dose-escalating studies have indicated the safety of curcumin at doses as high as 12 g/day over 3 months. Curcumin's pleiotropic activities emanate from its ability to modulate numerous signaling molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic proteins, NF-kappaB, cyclooxygenase-2, 5-LOX, STAT3, C-reactive protein, prostaglandin E(2), prostate-specific antigen, adhesion molecules, phosphorylase kinase, transforming growth factor-beta, triglyceride, ET-1, creatinine, HO-1, AST, and ALT in human participants. In clinical trials, curcumin has been used either alone or in combination with other agents. Various formulations of curcumin, including nanoparticles, liposomal encapsulation, emulsions, capsules, tablets, and powder, have been examined. In this review, we discuss in detail the various human diseases in which the effect of curcumin has been investigated.},

   abstract = {Although much has been published about curcumin, which is obtained from turmeric, comparatively little is known about turmeric itself. Turmeric, a golden spice obtained from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa, has been used to give color and taste to food preparations since ancient times. Traditionally, this spice has been used in Ayurveda and folk medicine for the treatment of such ailments as gynecological problems, gastric problems, hepatic disorders, infectious diseases, and blood disorders. Modern science has provided the scientific basis for the use of turmeric against such disorders. Various chemical constituents have been isolated from this spice, including polyphenols, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenoids, sterols, and alkaloids. Curcumin, which constitutes 2-5% of turmeric, is perhaps the most-studied component. Although some of the activities of turmeric can be mimicked by curcumin, other activities are curcumin-independent. Cell-based studies have demonstrated the potential of turmeric as an antimicrobial, insecticidal, larvicidal, antimutagenic, radioprotector, and anticancer agent. Numerous animal studies have shown the potential of this spice against proinflammatory diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, depression, diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis. At the molecular level, this spice has been shown to modulate numerous cell-signaling pathways. In clinical trials, turmeric has shown efficacy against numerous human ailments including lupus nephritis, cancer, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, acne, and fibrosis. Thus, a spice originally common in the kitchen is now exhibiting activities in the clinic. In this review, we discuss the chemical constituents of turmeric, its biological activities, its molecular targets, and its potential in the clinic.},

   abstract = {Giardiasis is the most common waterborne parasitic infection of the human intestine worldwide. The etiological agent, Giardia duodenalis (syn. G. intestinalis, G. lamblia), is a flagellated, binucleated protozoan parasite which infects a wide array of mammalian hosts. Human giardiasis is a true cosmopolitan pathogen, with highest prevalence in developing countries. Giardiasis can present with a broad range of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic, to acute or chronic diarrheal disease associated with abdominal pain and nausea. Most infections are self-limiting, although re-infection and chronic infection can occur. Recent evidence indicating that Giardia may cause chronic post-infectious gastrointestinal complications have made it a topic of intense research. The causes of the post-infectious clinical manifestations due to Giardia, even after complete elimination of the parasite, remain obscure. This review offers a state-of-the-art discussion on the long-term consequences of Giardia infections, from extra-intestinal manifestations, growth and cognitive deficiencies, to post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome. The discussion also sheds light on some of the novel mechanisms recently implicated in the production of these post-infectious manifestations.},

   abstract = {Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea are common complications of enteral nutrition (EN); however, the cause is unclear. Mode of EN delivery that alters digestion and possibly absorption is suggested to contribute to the high incidence of diarrhea; however, enteral formula is frequently blamed. Most research has focused on fiber-supplemented EN, with a meta-analysis showing that fiber reduces the incidence of diarrhea in non-intensive care unit studies. Other hypotheses include formula osmolality and FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) content. FODMAPs are poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates that exert an osmotic effect. Dietary FODMAPs have been shown to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, in those with irritable bowel syndrome and, given a high-enough dose, will induce a laxative effect in most people. As FODMAPs are commonly added to enteral formula and EN is frequently used as the main source of nutrition, it is reasonable to hypothesize that EN provides more FODMAPs than usual dietary intake and increases risk for developing diarrhea. This hypothesis was assessed through a retrospective study showing that the standard-use enteral formula Isosource 1.5 had a protective effect of developing diarrhea. The only characteristic unique to Isosource 1.5 was the lower FODMAP content as determined through methodologies previously validated for food analysis. Methodologies for application to enteral formulas are currently undergoing formal validation. Once confirmed for application in enteral formula, future directions include FODMAP analysis of specific ingredients to increase understanding of potential problems associated with enteral formula and a randomized, controlled trial investigating the role of formula FODMAP content.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food is one of the most commonly reported triggers of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. However, the role of diet in the aetiology and management of IBS has not been clearly established. The present study aimed to examine the dietary practices of Irish patients with IBS and to determine whether these practices increased their vulnerability to nutritional inadequacies. METHODS: A questionnaire was completed by 135 IBS patients on their perceptions of the role of diet in their symptoms and whether they restrict their diet according to the symptoms experienced. A similar questionnaire was used to investigate the perceptions of 111 healthy subjects to the gastrointestinal symptoms experienced on the consumption of food. RESULTS: Food was considered to cause or worsen their gastrointestinal symptoms in 89.6% of IBS patients compared to 55% of healthy subjects (P < 0.001). Cereal-based foods, predominantly bread or its components, were the most frequently cited (53.3%), and spicy foods (39.3%), vegetables and fatty foods (35.6% for both) also featured prominently. A significantly greater number of patients with IBS reported changing their diet to minimise symptoms compared to healthy controls (91.9% versus 45.5%, P < 0.001). In relation to whole food groups, milk products (9.6%), fruit (7.4%) and vegetables (5.2%) were those most commonly restricted, with only a small number of IBS patients seeking professional healthcare advice. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of IBS patients consider their symptoms to be related to food, and change their diet by limiting the foods that they perceive as problematic, with some restricting whole food groups. Few patients sought professional healthcare advice when implementing dietary change, possibly exposing a considerable number to an increased risk of nutritional deficiency.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) occurs frequently among children and is one of the cardinal symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). The mechanisms of visceral pain and RAP are not fully understood. A heritable component has been demonstrated and a few candidate genes proposed. NPSR1 encodes the receptor for neuropeptide S (NPS) and NPS-NPSR1 signaling is involved in anxiety, inflammation, and nociception. NPSR1 polymorphisms are associated with asthma and chronic inflammatory diseases, but also with IBS-related intermediate phenotypes such as colonic transit time and rectal sensory ratings. Here, we sought to determine whether genetic variability in the NPSR1 gene influences the presence of RAP in children. METHODS: Twenty-eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NPSR1 gene region were successfully genotyped in 1744 children from the Swedish birth cohort BAMSE. Questionnaire information was used to define RAP as episodes of abdominal pain occurring at least once a month in 12-year-olds. KEY RESULTS: The prevalence of RAP was 9% in BAMSE. Association with RAP was observed for seven NPSR1 SNPs, five of which withstood false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing (best p = 0.00054, OR: 1.55 for SNP rs2530566). The associated SNPs all map in a putative regulatory region upstream NPSR1, where they may exert their genetic effects through the modulation of gene expression. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Genetic variation at the NPSR1 locus impacts children's predisposition to RAP episodes in a Swedish population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pediatric functional abdominal pain has been linked to functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in adulthood, but little is known about patient characteristics in childhood that increase the risk for FGID in young adulthood. We investigated the contribution of gastrointestinal symptoms, extraintestinal somatic symptoms, and depressive symptoms in pediatric patients with functional abdominal pain and whether these predicted FGIDs later in life. METHODS: In a longitudinal study, consecutive new pediatric patients, diagnosed with functional abdominal pain in a subspecialty clinic, completed a comprehensive baseline evaluation of the severity of their physical and emotional symptoms. They were contacted 5 to 15 years later and evaluated, based on Rome III symptom criteria, for abdominal pain-related FGIDs, including irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, functional abdominal pain syndrome, and abdominal migraine. Controlling for age, sex, baseline severity of abdominal pain, and time to follow-up evaluation, multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of baseline gastrointestinal, extraintestinal somatic, and depressive symptoms in childhood with FGID in adolescence and young adulthood. RESULTS: Of 392 patients interviewed an average of 9.2 years after their initial evaluation, 41% (n = 162) met symptom criteria for FGID; most met the criteria for irritable bowel syndrome. Extraintestinal somatic and depressive symptoms at the initial pediatric evaluation were significant predictors of FGID later in life, after controlling for initial levels of GI symptoms. Age, sex, and abdominal pain severity at initial presentation were not significant predictors of FGID later in life. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with functional abdominal pain, assessment of extraintestinal and depressive symptoms may be useful in identifying those at risk for FGID in adolescence and young adulthood.},

   abstract = {At best, currently available therapies provide symptomatic relief from functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGD). No existing therapy, however, can influence the natural course of any of these disorders, prompting interest in new and safe treatment options. This paper summarizes the clinical evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and their meta-analyses of the effectiveness of probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary fiber in the treatment of FGD in the pediatric population. While it is too soon to recommend the routine use of any probiotics for treating FGD, some of these therapeutic options can provide a health benefit to patients, and therefore can be discussed with patients and/or caregivers. Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 has consistently improved symptoms of infantile colic. The use of Lactobacillus GG moderately increased treatment success in children with abdominal pain-related FGD, particularly among children with irritable bowel syndrome. Also, data from one trial suggest that VSL#3 seems to be effective in ameliorating symptoms and improving the quality of life of children affected by irritable bowel syndrome. L. reuteri DSM 17938 may help infants with constipation. Limited evidence suggests that administration of a fiber supplement is more effective than placebo for the treatment of childhood constipation.},

These changes are likely controlled by clock genes expressed in the intestine that are probably synchronized by neuronal and humoral signals from the suprachiasmatic nuclei, which constitute a master clock entrained by light signals from the eyes and from the environment, e.g., food availability. Acute changes in circadian rhythms--e.g., due to nonsynchronous work schedules or a transcontinental flight--may trigger intestinal discomfort. Chronic disruptions in circadian control mechanisms may predispose the individual to irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and peptic ulcer disease. A more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying temporal changes in intestinal activity might allow us to identify novel targets for developing therapeutic approaches to these disorders.},

   abstract = {Gut microbiota is the community of live microorganisms residing in the digestive tract. There are many groups of researchers worldwide that are working at deciphering the collective genome of the human microbiota. Modern techniques for studying the microbiota have made us aware of an important number of nonculturable bacteria and of the relation between the microorganisms that live inside us and our homeostasis. The microbiota is essential for correct body growth, the development of immunity, and nutrition. Certain epidemics affecting humanity such as asthma and obesity may possibly be explained, at least partially, by alterations in the microbiota. Dysbiosis has been associated with a series of gastrointestinal disorders that include non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, celiac disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. The present article deals with the nomenclature, modern study techniques, and functions of gut microbiota, and its relation to health and disease.},

   abstract = {Proteases play a diverse role in health and disease. An excessive concentration of proteases has been found in the feces of patients with inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome and been implicated in the pathogenesis of such disorders. This study examined the effect of the serine protease, trypsin, on intestinal epithelial anion secretion when added to the luminal side. A mucosal-submucosal sheet of the mouse cecum was mounted in Ussing chambers, and the short-circuit current (I sc) was measured. Trypsin added to the mucosal (luminal) side increased I sc with an ED50 value of approximately 10 muM. This I sc increase was suppressed by removing Cl(-) from the bathing solution. The I sc increase induced by 10-100 muM trypsin was substantially suppressed by tetrodotoxin, and partially inhibited by a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, but not by a muscarinic or nicotinic ACh-receptor antagonist. The trypsin-induced I sc increase was also significantly inhibited by a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor (5-HT3) antagonist and substantially suppressed by the simultaneous addition of both 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptor antagonists. We conclude that luminal trypsin activates the enteric reflex to induce anion secretion, 5-HT and substance P playing important mediating roles in this secreto-motor reflex. Luminal proteases may contribute to the cause of diarrhea occurring with some intestinal disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, disabling and functional gastrointestinal disorder. Effective treatments are lacking. Self-care and coping with symptoms are considered important but little is known about what patients with IBS actually do to manage their illness. The aim of this study was to explore how patients with long-term experience of living with IBS perceive their situation and manage illness in daily life. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study adopted a qualitative approach - an interpretative phenomenological analysis. Twenty patients with IBS (16 women) with a mean age of 46 (27-74) years were interviewed. The mean IBS duration was 24 (7-65) years. RESULTS: Two themes emerged from the analysis: Healed but not cured and Take control of daily life. Healed but not cured is about mastering IBS. Even though the patients feel there has been an improvement, their abdomen is constantly present. The patients live with intermittent interaction between well-being and illness and construct explanations for the cause of the IBS symptoms. Taking control of daily life is about the activities the patients perform to master IBS symptoms: self-centredness, disciplined self-care, control over daily routines and finding social support. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the negative impact of IBS on daily life can be reduced. Over time, the patients had found effective strategies for symptom improvement, although this is a long-term learning process. The healthcare system could be more effective in supporting patients to find solutions to problems caused by IBS that are consistent with person-centred care and could be adopted as part of different supportive/educational interventions.},

The aims of this study were to compare women with IBS (n = 20) to healthy control (HC, n = 20) women on pain sensitivity, conditioned pain modulation (CPM) efficiency, and salivary cortisol levels before and after the CPM test and to examine the relationship of CPM efficiency with gastrointestinal pain, somatic pain, psychological distress symptoms, and salivary cortisol levels in each group. Women, aged 20-42 years, gave consent, completed questionnaires, and kept a symptom diary for 2 weeks. CPM efficiency was tested with a heat test stimulus and cold water condition stimulus in a laboratory between 8 and 10 a.m. on a follicular phase day. Salivary cortisol samples were collected just before and after the experimental testing. Compared to the HC group, women with IBS reported more days with gastrointestinal and somatic pain/discomfort, psychological distress, fatigue, and feeling stressed. During the CPM baseline testing, women with IBS reported greater pain sensitivity compared to the HC group. There was no significant group difference in salivary cortisol levels nor in CPM efficiency, though a post-hoc analysis showed a higher prevalence of impaired CPM efficiency among IBS subjects with more severe lower-GI symptoms. In the IBS group, reduced CPM efficiency was associated with daily abdominal pain/discomfort and psychological distress. Overall, women with IBS exhibited an increased sensitivity to thermal stimuli. Impaired CPM was present in a subset of women with IBS.},

   abstract = {Microglia are important macrophages to defend against pathogens in the central nervous system (CNS); however, persistent or acute inflammation of microglia lead to CNS disorders via neuronal cell death. Therefore, we theorized that a good strategy for the treatment of CNS disorders would be to target inflammatory mediators from microglia in disease. Consequently, we investigated whether isobutyrylshikonin (IBS) attenuates the production of proinflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. Treatment with IBS inhibited the secretion of NO and prostaglandin E2 (as well as the expression of their key regulatory genes), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Isobutyrylshikonin also suppressed LPS-induced DNA-binding activity of nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 in addition to blocking the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha. Pretreatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor, showed the down-regulation of LPS-induced iNOS and COX-2 messenger RNA by suppressing NF-kappaB activity. This indirectly suggests that IBS-mediated NF-kappaB inhibition is the main signaling pathway involved in the inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 expression. In addition, IBS attenuated LPS-induced phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt, which are upstream molecules of NF-kappaB, in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. The functional aspects of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway were analyzed with LY294002, which is a specific PI3K/Akt inhibitor that attenuated LPS-induced iNOS and COX-2 expression by suppressing NF-kappaB activity. These data suggest that an IBS-mediated anti-inflammatory effect may be involved in suppressing the PI3K/Akt-mediated NF-kappaB signaling pathway.},

   abstract = {It is well established that diet influences the health of an individual and that a diet rich in plant-based foods has many advantages in relation to the health and well-being of an individual. What has been unclear until recently is the large contribution of the gut microbiota to this effect. As well as providing basic nutritional requirements, the long-term diet of an animal modifies its gut microbiota. In adults, diets that have a high proportion of fruit and vegetables and a low consumption of meat are associated with a highly diverse microbiota and are defined by a greater abundance of Prevotella compared to Bacteroides, while the reverse is associated with a diet that contains a low proportion of plant-based foods. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that the effect of the microbial ecology of the gut goes beyond the local gut immune system and is implicated in immune-related disorders, such as IBS, diabetes and inflamm-ageing. In this review, we investigate the evidence that a balanced diet leads to a balanced, diverse microbiota with significant consequences for healthy ageing by focusing on conditions of interest.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms compatible with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. It has been suggested that these symptoms are a reflection of occult inflammation rather than coexisting IBS. The aim of this study was to characterize IBS-like symptoms in patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) in clinical remission by assessing inflammatory markers, psychological symptoms, and quality of life. METHODS: Ninety-four patients with new onset of UC were followed prospectively during 3 years with yearly follow-up visits. The patients completed self-administrated questionnaires. Fecal calprotectin was used as an inflammatory biomarker. Remission was defined as a total Mayo-score </=2 and an endoscopic subscore </=1, with no relapse during the 3-month period prior to visit. KEY RESULTS: The prevalence of patients that fulfilled Rome II criteria for IBS among UC patients in remission was 11% at visit 1, 23% at visit 2, and 17% at visit 3. When comparing UC patients in remission with and without IBS-like symptom, patients with IBS-like symptoms had more severe gastrointestinal symptoms, tendencies toward more severe psychological symptoms and reduced levels of quality of life, but the calprotectin levels did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: IBS-like symptoms are common in patients with UC in clinical remission and these fluctuate over time. The symptoms are associated with poor psychological well-being and reduced quality of life, and do not seem to be a reflection of low-grade inflammatory activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a chronic disease that often progresses slowly from a precursor stage, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), and that can remain undiagnosed for a long time. METHODS: Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer cohort, we measured prediagnostic plasma sCD23 for 179 individuals who eventually were diagnosed with CLL and an equal number of matched control subjects who remained free of cancer. RESULTS: In a very large proportion of CLL patients' plasma sCD23 was clearly elevated 7 or more years before diagnosis. Considering sCD23 as a disease predictor, the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.90-1.00] for CLL diagnosed within 0.1 to 2.7 years after blood measurement, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86-0.95) for diagnosis within 2.8 to 7.3 years, and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.65-0.86) for CLL diagnosed between 7.4 and 12.5 years. Even at a 7.4-year and longer time interval, elevated plasma sCD23 could predict a later clinical diagnosis of CLL with 100% specificity at >45% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide unique documentation for the very long latency times during which measurable B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder exists before the clinical manifestation of CLL. IMPACT: Our findings have relevance for the interpretation of prospective epidemiologic studies on the causes of CLL in terms of reverse causation bias. The lag times indicate a time frame within which an early detection of CLL would be theoretically possible. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 24(3); 538-45. (c)2014 AACR.},

   abstract = {Perinatal nutrition is thought to affect the long-term risk of the adult to develop metabolic syndrome. We hypothesized that maternal supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid during pregnancy and lactation would protect offspring fed a high-fat diet from developing metabolic disturbances. Thus, two groups of female hamsters were fed a low-fat control diet, either alone (LC) or enriched with n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) (LO), through the gestational and lactation periods. After weaning, male pups were randomized to separate groups that received either a control low-fat diet (LC) or a high-fat diet (HC) for 16 weeks. Four groups of pups were defined (LC-LC, LC-HC, LO-LC and LO-HC), based on the combinations of maternal and weaned diets. Maternal n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation was associated with reduced levels of basal plasma glucose, hepatic triglycerides secretion and postprandial lipemia in the LO-HC group compared to the LC-HC group. Respiratory parameters were not affected by maternal supplementation. In contrast, n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation significantly enhanced the activities of citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase compared to the offspring of unsupplemented mothers. Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha expression levels were not affected by n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation. These results provide evidence for a beneficial effect of n-3 LC-PUFA maternal supplementation in hamsters on the subsequent risk of metabolic syndrome. Underlying mechanisms may include improved lipid metabolism and activation of the mitochondrial oxidative pathway.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, which is involved in visceral pain signalling, has been shown to be up-regulated in IBS. Activation of TRPV1 leads to the release of neuropeptides, such as somatostatin and substance P (SP). We hypothesized that increased pain perception in IBS could be explained by increased transcription in TRPV1 and/or altered levels of neuropeptides. We therefore assessed the transcription of TRPV1 and the mucosal concentration of somatostatin and SP in IBS in comparison to healthy volunteers and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission as disease controls, and to ascertain their relationship to pain symptoms. METHOD: Sigmoid colonic mucosal samples were collected from 12 patients with IBS, 34 patients with UC in remission and 9 healthy volunteers, in which groups TRPV1 mRNA levels were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and neuropeptide concentrations by radioimmunoassay. Pain symptom intensity was determined by questionnaires. RESULTS: Transcription of TRPV1 as well as the concentration of neuropeptides were significantly higher in IBS, but only the former correlated with pain symptom severity. CONCLUSION: Increased transcription of TRPV1 may provide a possible explanation for pain generation in IBS. While the neuropeptides SP and somatostatin were both found to be increased in IBS, these changes are not sufficient to explain pain generation. Pain generation in IBS is probably explained by a complex redundancy in the regulation of local nociceptive mechanisms, which remains a subject of intensive investigation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been associated with psychiatric comorbidity and alterations in serotonergic metabolism. Tryptophan is the precursor of serotonin (5-HT), but it is mainly catabolized through the kynurenine pathway. This pathway may also be involved in the pathogenesis of IBS by virtue of deviating tryptophan from the 5-HT pathway resulting in 5-HT deficiency. We therefore aimed to ascertain the mucosal and systemic concentrations of 5-HT and kynurenic acid (KYNA), a principal kynurenine metabolite. METHODS: Duodenal mucosal biopsy specimens and platelet poor plasma samples were obtained from 15 healthy volunteers and 15 IBS patients. Psychological state was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Symptom Checklist-90. RESULTS: IBS patients showed significantly lower mucosal and higher systemic concentrations of both 5-HT and KYNA compared to healthy controls. Also, significant correlation between mucosal but not plasma concentrations of KYNA and 5-HT and psychological state in IBS was observed. CONCLUSION: The observation that mucosal KYNA and 5-HT are both decreased in IBS does not support the hypothesis that increased activation along the kynurenic pathway results in relative 5-HT deficiency. However, an increased release of these substances from the intestine to the systemic compartment may lead to a decrease in intestinal KYNA and 5-HT levels, resulting in disturbance of intestinal homeostasis. Thus, changes in psychological states observed in IBS patients may be secondary to alterations in gastrointestinal function, and in particular kynurenine and/or 5-HT metabolism.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations in serotonergic (5-HT) metabolism and/or intestinal integrity have been associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). AIMS: To assess the effects of the precursor of 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), on mucosal 5-HT availability and intestinal integrity, and to assess potential differences between healthy controls and IBS patients. METHODS: Fifteen IBS patients and 15 healthy volunteers participated in this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study. Intestinal integrity was assessed by dual-sugar test and by determining the mucosal expression of tight junction proteins after ingestion of an oral bolus of 100 mg 5-HTP or placebo. Mucosal serotonergic metabolism was assessed in duodenal biopsy samples. RESULTS: 5-HTP administration significantly increased mucosal levels of 5-HIAA, the main metabolite of 5-HT, in both healthy controls (7.1 +/- 1.7 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.7 pmol/mg, 5-HTP vs. placebo, P = 0.02) and IBS patients (20.0 +/- 4.8 vs. 8.1 +/- 1.3 pmol/mg, 5-HTP vs. placebo, P = 0.02), with the latter group showing a significantly larger increase. Lactulose/L-rhamnose ratios were significantly lower after administration of 5-HTP (P < 0.05) in healthy controls and were accompanied by redistribution of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), pointing to reinforcement of the barrier. In IBS, expression of the tight junction proteins was significantly lower compared to healthy controls, and 5-HTP resulted in a further decrease in occludin expression. CONCLUSIONS: Oral 5-HTP induced alterations in mucosal 5-HT metabolism. In healthy controls, a reinforcement of the intestinal barrier was seen whereas such reaction was absent in IBS patients. This could indicate the presence of a serotonin-mediated mechanism aimed to reinforce intestinal barrier function, which seems to dysfunction in IBS patients.},

   abstract = {Leaf senescence is a finely tuned and genetically programmed degeneration process, which is critical to maximize plant fitness by remobilizing nutrients from senescing leaves to newly developing organs. Leaf senescence is a complex process that is driven by extensive reprogramming of global gene expression in a highly coordinated manner. Understanding how gene regulatory networks involved in controlling leaf senescence are organized and operated is essential to decipher the mechanisms of leaf senescence. It was previously reported that the trifurcate feed-forward pathway involving EIN2, ORE1, and miR164 in Arabidopsis regulates age-dependent leaf senescence and cell death. Here, new components of this pathway have been identified, which enhances knowledge of the gene regulatory networks governing leaf senescence. Comparative gene expression analysis revealed six senescence-associated NAC transcription factors (TFs) (ANAC019, AtNAP, ANAC047, ANAC055, ORS1, and ORE1) as candidate downstream components of ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2). EIN3, a downstream signalling molecule of EIN2, directly bound the ORE1 and AtNAP promoters and induced their transcription. This suggests that EIN3 positively regulates leaf senescence by activating ORE1 and AtNAP, previously reported as key regulators of leaf senescence. Genetic and gene expression analyses in the ore1 atnap double mutant revealed that ORE1 and AtNAP act in distinct and overlapping signalling pathways. Transient transactivation assays further demonstrated that ORE1 and AtNAP could activate common as well as differential NAC TF targets. Collectively, the data provide insight into an EIN2-mediated senescence signalling pathway that coordinates global gene expression during leaf senescence via a gene regulatory network involving EIN3 and senescence-associated NAC TFs.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of nausea in pediatric patients with pain-associated functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), examine the effect on social and school functioning, and examine the applicability of pediatric Rome III criteria. METHODS: A total of 221 pediatric patients (6-18 years of age) with chronic abdominal pain prospectively completed a demographic, history, and gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire adapted from the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms (QPGS). The 6-item, revised Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Score tool was used to assess the effect of symptoms on school, home, and social disability. Rome III criteria were applied to all subjects. RESULTS: A total of 183 patients with pain and nausea for a minimum of 2 months were identified. Ninety-six patients were studied after excluding those with vomiting and/or organic disease. Among these, 53% had nausea at least 2 times per week and 28% experienced daily nausea. Frequency of nausea was significantly correlated with poor school and social functioning, and uniquely predicted social disability beyond pain. Although 87% met adult Rome criteria for functional dyspepsia, only 29% met corresponding pediatric Rome criteria. Additionally, 22% met the criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-diarrhea, 13% for IBS-constipation, 13% for abdominal migraine, and 31% were classified as having functional abdominal pain. Pediatric IBS-diarrhea and IBS-constipation overlapped in 5% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Nausea is a prevalent symptom in patients with pain-associated FGIDs and correlates with poor school and social functioning. There is substantial overlap among FGIDs in children with nausea.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the usefulness of a test meal containing lactulose in the non-invasive assessment of visceral sensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and to identify subsets of IBS patients based on gastrointestinal (GI) symptom generation. METHODS: We included 43 patients with IBS (Rome III) and 29 healthy controls. The fasted subjects were served three test meals consisting of a 400-ml liquid breakfast alone or containing lactulose (15 or 25 g) in a double-blind crossover design. Seven GI symptoms, overall digestive comfort, and exhaled H2/CH4 were assessed at baseline and every 15 min during 4 h after meal intake. Anxiety and depression were assessed only at baseline. A mapping of the seven GI symptoms was done using a Principal Component Analysis (4 h mean area under the curve, AUC). Independently, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on the same parameters to identify GI symptom-based IBS clusters. RESULTS: All three tests were well tolerated. The 25 g lactulose challenge enabled discrimination of IBS from healthy controls according to the symptom response. This challenge also enabled clustering of IBS subjects in two subgroups based mainly on bloating, distension, and discomfort symptoms (2,457 (2,043-2,872), 2,450 (1,910-2,990), 2,602 (2,126-3,079) vs. 537 (383-691), 619 (458-780), 643 (432-854); 4 h mean AUC; P<0.0001), overall digestive comfort (1807 (1318-2295) vs. 3350 (2942-3758); 4 h mean AUC; P<0.0001), and anxiety at baseline (9.2 (7.0-11.5) vs. 5.5 (4.2-6.9); Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale anxiety mean scores; P=0.003). This clustering was independent of the Rome III subtype and the amount of exhaled H2/CH4. CONCLUSIONS: The lactulose challenge test seems to be a promising tool to assess visceral sensitivity in IBS, and to subgroup IBS patients based on their symptom pattern.},

   abstract = {Background. Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients often suffer from gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. However, the full extent and prevalence of such symptoms are not clearly established. Thus, we sought to define the prevalence of GI symptoms and syndromes in those with MS. Methods. 218 MS patients completed self-reported demographic and clinical data questionnaires as well as several standardized surveys probing MS severity and GI health. Results. Nearly two thirds (65.6%) of patients endorsed at least one persistent GI symptom. Constipation (36.6%), dysphagia (21.1%), and fecal incontinence (15.1%) were common. Surprisingly, nearly 30% (28.4%) of the patients reported dyspeptic symptoms. Using validated diagnostic algorithms, patients met criteria for functional dysphagia (14.7%), functional dyspepsia (16.5%), functional constipation (31.7%), and IBS (19.3%), among others. Functional dysphagia, functional dyspepsia, and IBS were significantly more common in those with self-identified mood disorders. Conclusions. Constipation, fecal incontinence, and dysphagia are indeed frequent symptoms seen in MS patients. We also noted a ~30% prevalence of dyspepsia in this population. The mechanisms driving this association are not clear and require further study. However, due to this high prevalence, dyspeptic symptoms should be incorporated into the routine assessment of MS patients and, if found, may warrant collaborative referral with a GI specialist.},

   abstract = {The human gastrointestinal tract inhabits a complex microbial ecosystem that plays a vital role in host health through its contributions to nutrient synthesis and digestion, protection from pathogens, and promoting maturation of host innate and adapt immune systems. The development of gut microbiota primarily occurs during infancy and is influenced by multiple factors, including prenatal exposure; gestational age; mode of delivery; feeding type; pre-, pro-, and antibiotic use; and host genetics. In genetically susceptible individuals, changes in the gut microbiota induced by environmental factors may contribute to the development of immune-related disorders in childhood, including atopic diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Pre- and probiotics may be useful in the prevention and treatment of some immune-related diseases by modulating gut microbiota and regulating host mucosal immune function. The review will discuss recent findings on the environmental factors that influence development of gut microbiota during infancy and its potential impact on some immune-related diseases in childhood. The use of pre- and probiotics for prevention and intervention of several important diseases in early life will also be reviewed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, three national gastroenterology societies established guidelines for the diagnosis and therapy of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI). In addition, the Cochrane Collaboration issued a review. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the recommendations and concordance between the four recent published guidelines and stimulate further discussion. METHODS: A review of the Australian, German and Italian guidelines and the Cochrane review was conducted, and a synthesis was made of common statements. RESULTS: There is a high degree of agreement on almost all items within these guidelines, both in the diagnosis of PEI and in terms of therapy and approach to management of PEI. In addition, novel emerging developments are highlighted, such as the fecal elastase-1 test, which is widely used but is not suitable for measuring mild-to-moderate PEI despite its ability to positively establish the diagnosis of severe PEI. One of the few novel tests proving to be useful is the (13)C mixed-chain triglycerides (MCT) breath test. This test, albeit an excellent quantitative test, is not widely used and is rarely available. The use of this test is making it apparent that there is a difference between treating the symptoms of PEI and treating malnutrition, the broader underlying defect. This may have direct consequences for the dosing of pancreatic enzymes (pancreatin), in that the consensus starting dose of all guidelines may be too low for some patients. Although chronic pancreatitis in adults and cystic fibrosis in children account for the main evidence base used for PEI, other indications are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: There is good concordance between recommendations provided by international groups. More prospective studies are required in many areas, including the use of pancreatic enzymes in other gastrointestinal disorders, such as celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We also need to assess the feasibility of the (13)C MCT breath test. At the same time, it needs to be confirmed that higher doses of pancreatic enzymes are really necessary to not only relieve the symptoms of PEI but also treat malnutrition appropriately.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common reason for gastroenterology consultations. The diverse in symptomatology of the disease comes from its rich etiopathogenesis. Recently studies talk about infectious etiology of IBS and because of that it is necessary to expand its diagnostics by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) test. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in patients with constipation (IBS-C) and diarrhea (IBS-D) irritable bowel syndrome with regard to nutrition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 46 subjects (33 women and 13 men) in average age of 44 years, which were divided into two groups: diarrhea and constipation IBS. All patients underwent hydrogen breath test studying bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. In addition, each person had fulfilled a feeding questionnaire. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Student's t-test, Pearson test. RESULTS: It has been shown that there is no statistical significances between the prevalence of SIBO in form of diarrheal IBS and constipation IBS and gender. Average value of increments of hydrogen in breath during the test was higher in IBS-C in comparison with IBS-D, which was the highest in the intestine bacterial overgrowth in patients with IBS-C. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS showed that there is no relationship between the type and frequency of consumption of milk, meat, fruit and vegetables, sweets and coffee and the prevalence of SIBO in form of diarrhea and constipation IBS. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of constipation or diarrhea irritable bowel syndrome is not related to gender. SIBO is more common in patients with IBS-C than in IBS-D group. There is no relationship between the type of food consumed and the amount of SIBO in people with IBS. Type of food intake do not affect the status of the intestinal flora of people with IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) diagnosis requires comprehensive examination of the patient. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Escherichia coli have been reported as representatives of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) dysbiosis. The aim was to determine whether or not quantification of these species can be used as a complementary tool either for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. METHODS: Mucosa-associated F. prausnitzii and E. coli abundance was determined in 28 controls (H), 45 CD, 28 UC patients and 10 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subjects by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the F. prausnitzii-E. coli index (F-E index) was calculated. Species abundances were normalized to total bacteria and human cells. Data was analyzed taking into account patients' phenotype and most relevant clinical characteristics. RESULTS: IBD patients had lower F. prausnitzii abundance than H and IBS (P<0.001). CD patients showed higher E. coli counts than H and UC patients (P<0.001). The F-E index discriminated between H, CD and UC patients, and even between disease phenotypes that are usually difficult to distinguish as ileal-CD (I-CD) from ileocolonic-CD and colonic-CD from extensive colitis. E. coli increased in active CD patients, and remission in I-CD patients was compromised by high abundance of this species. Treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha diminished E. coli abundance in I-CD whereas none of the treatments counterbalanced F. prausnitzii depletion. CONCLUSION: F. prausnitzii and E. coli are useful indicators to assist in IBD phenotype classification. The abundance of these species could also be used as a supporting prognostic tool in I-CD patients. Our data indicates that current medication does not restore the levels of these two species to those found in a healthy gut.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogenous disorder with visceral hypersensitivity as important hallmark. It is not known whether IBS patients with visceral hypersensitivity have different epidemiological and clinical characteristics compared with IBS patients without visceral hypersensitivity. Aim of our study was to compare in detail a large group of hyper- vs normosensitive IBS patients with respect to epidemiological and clinical characteristics. METHODS: IBS patients (Rome III criteria) have been recruited for a large-scale cohort study. All patients from this cohort who underwent a rectal barostat procedure were included and allocated based on those with and without visceral hypersensitivity. Patient demographics, and symptoms were collected using questionnaires (GSRS, HADS, SF-36) and a 14-day symptom diary for IBS-related symptoms. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify risk markers for having visceral hypersensitivity. KEY RESULTS: Ninety-five normosensitive and 93 hypersensitive IBS patients participated in this study. Hypersensitive patients had significantly higher scores for GSRS abdominal pain (p < 0.05), indigestion, reflux and constipation syndrome (all p < 0.01), and IBS symptom intensity, discomfort (both p < 0.05) and mean symptom composite score (p < 0.01). Age, female sex, and the use of SSRI medication were significantly different between the normo- and the hypersensitive IBS patients. However, after adjustment for other risk markers, only increasing age was found to be significantly associated with lower odds for having hypersensitivity (OR 0.97 [95% CI: 0.94; 0.99]). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Apart from more severe symptomatology, hypersensitive IBS patients are characterized by significantly younger age compared with normosensitive IBS patients. The study has been registered in the US National Library of Medicine (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00702026).},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating. Interestingly, there is now evidence of the presence of a low-grade inflammatory status in many IBS patients, including histopathological and mucosal cytokine levels in the colon, as well as the presence of IBS-like symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The use of a genetically engineered food-grade bacterium, such as Lactococcus lactis, secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has been proven by many pre-clinical studies to be a successful therapy to treat colon inflammation. In this study, we first reproduced the recovery-recurrence periods observed in IBS-patients in a new chronic model characterized by 2 episodes of DiNitro-BenzeneSulfonic-acid (DNBS)-challenge and we tested the effects of a recombinant strain of L. lactis secreting IL-10 under a Stress-Inducible Controlled Expression (SICE) system. In vivo gut permeability, colonic serotonin levels, cytokine profiles, and spleen cell populations were then measured as readouts of a low-grade inflammation. In addition, since there is increasing evidence that gut microbiota tightly regulates gut barrier function, tight junction proteins were also measured by qRT-PCR after administration of recombinant L. lactis in DNBS-treated mice. Strikingly, oral administration of L. lactis secreting active IL-10 in mice resulted in significant protective effects in terms of permeability, immune activation, and gut-function parameters. Although genetically engineered bacteria are, for now, used only as a "proof-of-concept," our study validates the interest in the use of the novel SICE system in L. lactis to express therapeutic molecules, such as IL-10, locally at mucosal surfaces.},

Some of these actions are related to the maintenance, reinforcement or repairment of the intestinal barrier function (IBF) whose role is to selectively allow the absorption of water, nutrients and ions while preventing the influx of microorganisms from the intestinal lumen. Alterations in the IBF have been related to many disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease or metabolic syndrome. Components of IBF are the intestinal epithelium, the mucus layer, secretory immunoglobulin A and cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Here we review the effects of food derived bioactive peptides on these IBF components. In vitro and in vivo effects, both in healthy and disease states, have been reviewed. Although limited, the available information indicates a potential for food-derived peptides to modify IBF and to contribute to disease treatment, but further research is needed to better isolate responsible peptides, and to help define their mode of action.},

Our aim was to study the anti-inflammatory effect of AHCC in the CD4+ CD62L(+) T cell transfer model of colitis, considered one of the closest to the human disease. Colitis was induced by transfer of CD4(+) CD62L(+) T cells to recombination activating gene 1(-/-) mice. AHCC (75 mg/d) was administered by gavage as a post-treatment. Three groups were established: noncolitic, colitic (CD4(+) CD62L(+) transferred mice treated with vehicle), and AHCC (colitic treated with AHCC). AHCC improved colitis, as evidenced by a 24% lower colonic myeloperoxidase and a 21% lower alkaline phosphatase activity. In addition, a decreased secretion of proinflammatory genes assessed by RT-qPCR was observed, particularly TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. Ex vivo mesenteric lymph node cells obtained from AHCC treated mice exhibited a fully normalized production of IL-6, IL-17, and IL-10 (p < 0.05). Also, AHCC treated mice exhibited decreased STAT4 and IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation in splenic CD4(+) cells. Our data provide validation of AHCC colonic anti-inflammatory activity in a chronic, T cell driven model of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Alterations in the bidirectional interactions between the intestine and the nervous system have important roles in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A body of largely preclinical evidence suggests that the gut microbiota can modulate these interactions. A small and poorly defined role for dysbiosis in the development of IBS symptoms has been established through characterization of altered intestinal microbiota in IBS patients and reported improvement of subjective symptoms after its manipulation with prebiotics, probiotics, or antibiotics. It remains to be determined whether IBS symptoms are caused by alterations in brain signaling from the intestine to the microbiota or primary disruption of the microbiota, and whether they are involved in altered interactions between the brain and intestine during development. We review the potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IBS in different groups of patients. Studies are needed to better characterize alterations to the intestinal microbiome in large cohorts of well-phenotyped patients, and to correlate intestinal metabolites with specific abnormalities in gut-brain interactions.},

   abstract = {The gut endocrine cells control and regulate several functions of the gastrointestinal tract. They have been reported to be abnormal in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), with alterations occurring in several functions regulated by these cells. Furthermore, it has been established that gut endocrine cells interact with the gut lumen contents, particularly the nutrients. The present study was undertaken to establish whether the positive outcome of dietary guidance observed in patients suffering from IBS is associated with a change in gastric endocrine cells. A total of 46 patients with IBS participated in the present study, of which 14 completed all aspects. These patients included nine females and five males with a mean age of 34 years (range, 2045 years). In the healthy control group, nine females and five males, with a mean age of 54 years (range 2670 years) were selected. The patients and controls underwent gastroscopy with biopsy samples taken from the corpus and antrum of the stomach. Each patient attended three sessions that lasted ~45 min each, and received individual guidance on their dietary management. The patients followed the diet prescribed for a minimum of three months, then further samples were taken using a method similar to that used for the initial biopsies. The biopsy samples were immunostained using the avidinbiotin complex method for chromogranin A (CgA) and quantified by computerized image analysis. The patients with IBS presented a low density of CgA compared with the controls. The density of CgA increased in these patients following dietary guidance and changes in food intake. The present observations emphasized the interaction between food intake and gut endocrine cells. The current study also suggests that the positive effects of dietary guidance may be attributed to changes in gut endocrine cell density.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The gastric endocrine cells in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) tend to normalize following dietary guidance. The aim of the present study was to identify the gastric endocrine cell types that are changed following such dietary guidance. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fourteen IBS patients and 14 healthy subjects were included in the study. Patients received three sessions of individual dietary management guidance. Gastroscopy was performed on both the controls and the patients at baseline and then again for the patients at 3-9 months after dietary guidance. Biopsy samples from the corpus and antrum were immunostained for all gastric endocrine cell types. Endocrine cells were quantified by computerized image analysis. RESULTS: The densities of the ghrelin cells for the controls and IBS patients before and after dietary guidance were 149.6 +/- 36.2 (mean +/- s.e.m.; 95% confidence interval (CI) 71.3-227.8), 114.5 +/- 32.7 and 161.8 +/- 37.8 cells/mm(2), respectively. The densities of the gastrin cells in these groups were 155.8 +/- 21.0 (95% CI 110.3-201.2), 159.4 +/- 24.3 and 211.6 +/- 28.0 cells/mm(2), respectively; the corresponding densities of serotonin cells in the corpus were 18.2 +/- 3.9 (95% CI 9.8-26.6), 10.6 +/- 3.4 and 14 +/- 2.0 cells/mm(2) and in the antrum were 44.6 +/- 12.2 (95% CI 18.1-71.1), 1.7 +/- 0.5 and 14.7 +/- 6.3 cells/mm(2). The densities of the somatostatin cells in the corpus were 40.0 +/- 7.7 (95% CI 23.5-56.5), 23.0 +/- 3.0 and 37.3 +/- 4.2 cells/mm(2), respectively, and in the antrum were 138.9 +/- 22.0 (95% CI 91.4-186.3), 95.6 +/- 15.9 and 86.0 +/- 16.9 cells/mm(2), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The densities of all of the gastric endocrine cell types changed towards the healthy control values in the IBS patients following a change in food intake.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Fructose can trigger or worsen symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of symptomatic fructose malabsorption in IBS patients and to test whether the patient's characteristics can help to detect a fructose malabsorption. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety Rome III IBS patients (predominant diarrhoea (IBS-D): 31%, predominant constipation (IBS-C): 18%, mixed type (IBS-M): 51%) were included prospectively. After exclusion of a small intestinal bacterial overgrowth by a glucose breath test, fructose malabsorption was assessed by a five-hour breath test, with symptom monitoring, after a 25 g load of fructose. An increase of more than 20 ppm of hydrogen (H2) or methane (CH4) levels in the exhaled air led to the diagnosis of malabsorption. RESULTS: Fructose test was abnormal in 20/90 patients among whom only 35% were intolerant, with a simultaneous rise of H2/CH4 levels and the onset of abdominal discomfort or diarrhoea. IBS characteristics were not predictive even if young (p = 0.031) and male IBS patients (p = 0.029) were at higher risk of malabsorption. At variance, 18 additional patients experienced intestinal symptoms during the test despite normal fructose absorption. DISCUSSION: After a 25 g fructose load, symptomatic fructose malabsorption and intolerance without malabsorption were detected in 22% and 28% of IBS patients respectively.},

   abstract = {According to epidemiological studies, twice as many women as men are affected by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in western countries, suggesting a role for sex hormones in IBS pathophysiology. Despite growing evidence about the implications of sex hormones in IBS symptom modulation, data on mechanisms by which they influence disease development are sparse. This review aims to determine the state of knowledge about the role of sex hormones in sensorimotor dysfunctions and to address the possible interplay of sex hormones with common risk factors associated with IBS. The scientific bibliography was searched using the following keywords: irritable bowel syndrome, sex, gender, ovarian hormone, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, symptoms, pain, sensitivity, motility, permeability, stress, immune system, brain activity, spinal, supraspinal, imaging. Ovarian hormones variations along the menstrual cycle affect sensorimotor gastrointestinal function in both healthy and IBS populations. They can modulate pain processing by interacting with neuromodulator systems and the emotional system responsible for visceral pain perception. These hormones can also modulate the susceptibility to stress, which is a pivotal factor in IBS occurrence and symptom severity. For instance, estrogen-dependent hyper-responsiveness to stress can promote immune activation or impairments of gut barrier function. In conclusion, whereas it is important to keep in mind that ovarian hormones cannot be considered as a causal factor of IBS, they arguably modulate IBS onset and symptomatology. However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains limited and studies assessing the link between IBS symptoms and ovarian hormone levels are needed to improve our knowledge of the disease evolution with regard to gender. Further studies assessing the role of male hormones are also needed to understand fully the role of sex hormones in IBS. Finally, investigation of brain-gut interactions is critical to decipher how stress, ovarian hormones, and female brain processing of pain can translate into gut dysfunctions.},

   abstract = {There are inconsistent and limited data available to assess the relationship between fat intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We examined the consumption of total fat, fat sources and fat subtypes in relation to risk of EOC and its major histologic subtypes in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition which includes incident invasive (n=1095) and borderline (n=96) EOC. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In multivariate models, we observed no association with consumption of total fat, animal or plant fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, monounsaturated fat, or fatty fish and risk of invasive EOC. There was, however, an increased risk of invasive EOC in the highest category of intake (Quartile 4 vs. Quartile 1) of polyunsaturated fat (HR=1.22, 95% CI=1.02-1.48, P(trend)=0.02). We did not observe heterogeneity in the risk associations in comparisons of serous and endometrioid histologic subtypes. This study does not support an etiological role for total fat intake in relation to EOC risk; however, based on observations of a positive association between intake of polyunsaturated fat and invasive EOC risk in the current and previous studies, this fat subtype warrants further investigation to determine its potential role in EOC development.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome is a multisymptom construct, with abdominal pain (AP) acting as the driving symptom of patient-reported severity. The Food and Drug Administration considers a >30% decrease in AP as satisfactory improvement, but this has not been validated in children. We investigated the correspondence of 2 measures for AP assessment, >/=30% improvement in AP and global assessment of improvement. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from 72 children who completed a randomized clinical trial for abdominal pain-associated functional gastrointestinal disorders. Children completed daily assessment of AP intensity, functional disability inventory (FDI), question regarding pain's interference with activities, and 2 global assessment questions. We measured the extent to which >/=30% improvement of AP and global assessment questions correlated with each other and with disability. RESULTS: The global questions correlated with each other (r=0.74; P<0.0001) and with a >/=30% improvement in AP (P<0.01). Global outcomes were satisfaction with treatment was inversely related to the child's report of interference with activities (P<0.01) and symptom relief was positively associated with >/=30% improvement in FDI scores (P<0.009). A 30% change in FDI scores was associated with global questions of symptom relief (P=0.009) but not with satisfaction with treatment (P=0.07). The association of AP improvement with interference with activities (P=0.14) or change in FDI scores (P=0.27) did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: Currently used global assessments are significantly associated with decreased pain intensity, decreased interference with daily activities, and a >/=30% change in FDI scores, whereas recommended 30% improvement in pain intensity is not as comprehensive.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often associated with psychological distress, is characterized by increased gut permeability and visceral sensitivity. In animals, stress increases intestinal paracellular permeability (IPP), visceral sensitivity and colonic proteolytic activity. Estradiol reduces IPP and affects visceral sensitivity in non-stressed ovariectomized rats, but whether estrogens affect stress-induced hyperpermeability and hypersensitivity in cyclic females remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate (i) the effects of a phytoestrogen-rich soy germ fermented ingredient (SG) on visceral hypersensitivity, hyperpermeability and other symptoms in stressed intact female rats, (ii) the mechanisms of action involved on the basis of both estrogenic and protease inhibitor activities of SG. METHODS: Female rats received orally for 15-d either SG, 17beta-estradiol benzoate (EB), or vehicles, with or without the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI182.780 before stress. Visceral sensitivity, IPP, faecal proteolytic activity, plasma corticosterone, rat mast cell protease II immunostaining, and occludin expression were assessed. RESULTS: Stress increased IPP (concomitantly to a drop in occludin expression), visceral sensitivity, faecal proteolytic activity and plasma corticosterone. Similarly to EB, SG prevented the stress-induced hyperpermeability, and hypersensitivity, without changes in plasma corticosterone. SG inhibited the increase in faecal proteolytic activity, enhanced occludin expression, and reduced the colonic mast cell density. All SG effects, except decrease on faecal proteolytic activity, were blocked by ICI182.780. CONCLUSION: A 2-wk oral treatment with SG prevented the stress-induced hyperpermeability and visceral hypersensitivity in cyclic rats through ER activation, and blocked the increase in colonic proteolytic activity, suggesting that SG can be promising in IBS management.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intestinal permeability has been studied in small groups of IBS patients with contrasting findings. AIMS: To assess intestinal permeability at different sites of the GI tract in different subtypes of well-characterised IBS patients and healthy controls (HC), and to assess potential confounding factors. METHODS: IBS patients and HC underwent a multi-sugar test to assess site-specific intestinal permeability. Sucrose excretion and lactulose/rhamnose ratio in 0-5 h urine indicated gastroduodenal and small intestinal permeability, respectively. Sucralose/erythritol ratio in 0-24 h and 5-24 h urine indicated whole gut and colonic permeability, respectively. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the association between IBS groups and intestinal permeability and to adjust for age, sex, BMI, anxiety or depression, smoking, alcohol intake and use of medication. RESULTS: Ninety-one IBS patients, i.e. 37% IBS-D, 23% IBS-C, 33% IBS-M and 7% IBS-U and 94 HC were enrolled. Urinary sucrose excretion was significantly increased in the total IBS group [mumol, median (Q1;Q3): 5.26 (1.82;11.03) vs. 2.44 (0.91;5.85), P < 0.05], as well as in IBS-C and IBS-D vs. HC. However, differences attenuated when adjusting for confounders. The lactulose/rhamnose ratio was increased in IBS-D vs. HC [0.023 (0.013;0.038) vs. 0.014 (0.008;0.025), P < 0.05], which remained significant after adjustment for confounders. No difference was found in 0-24 and 5-24 h sucralose/erythritol ratio between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Small intestinal permeability is increased in patients with IBS-D compared to healthy controls, irrespective of confounding factors. Adjustment for confounders is necessary when studying intestinal permeability, especially in a heterogeneous disorder such as IBS.},

The importance of diet in the management of irritable bowel syndrome has taken center stage in recent times as the literature validates the relationship of certain foods with the provocation of symptoms. Likewise, a number of elimination dietary programs have been successful in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Knowledge of the dietary management strategies for irritable bowel syndrome will help guide nutritionists and healthcare practitioners to deliver optimal outcomes.

   abstract = {Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterraenea (L.) verdc) (BGN) is a legume; its origin have been traced back to Africa, and it is the third important legume; however, it is one of the neglected crops. It is highly nutritious, and has been termed a complete food. Its seed consist of 49%-63.5% carbohydrate, 15%-25% protein, 4.5%-7.4% fat, 5.2%-6.4% fiber, 3.2%-4.4% ash and 2% mineral compared to whole fresh cow milk 88% moisture, 4.8% carbohydrate, 3.2% proteins, 3.4% fat, 0.7% ash, and 0.01% cholesterol. Its chemical composition is comparable to that of soy bean. Furthermore, BGN has been reported to be a potential crop, owing to its nutritional composition, functional properties, antioxidant potential, and a drought resistant crop. Bambara groundnut milk (BGNM) had been rated higher in acceptability than milk from other legumes like soybean and cowpea. Probiotics have been defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amount confer a health benefit on the host. These benefits have been reported to be therapeutic, suppressing the growth and activity in conditions like infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. The nutritional profile of BGNM is high enough to sustain the growth of probiotics. BGNs are normally boiled and salted, eaten as a relish or roasted, and eaten as a snack. Hence, BGNM can also be fermented with lactic acid bacteria to make a probiotic beverage that not only increase the economic value of the nutritious legume but also help in addressing malnutrition.},

The objective of this study was to determine if intestinal permeability is increased in children/adolescents with functional dyspepsia (FD) and whether intestinal permeability is correlated with mucosal inflammation and/or symptoms of anxiety or depression in this population. METHODS: A sugar absorption test was performed in 19 patients with FD and 19 controls. Anxiety and depression were assessed in both groups utilizing a standard questionnaire. In FD patients, duodenal mean and peak mast cell and eosinophil densities were determined. RESULTS: Intestinal permeability as measured by the sugar absorption test did not differ between children with FD and controls. In children with FD, there was no correlation between permeability and mast cell density, eosinophil density, anxiety scores, or depression scores, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric FD does not appear to be associated with increased small bowel intestinal permeability, however, there are some limitations to the current study.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disturbances in one carbon metabolism may contribute to carcinogenesis by affecting methylation and synthesis of DNA. Choline and its oxidation product betaine are involved in this metabolism and can serve as alternative methyl group donors when folate status is low. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), to investigate plasma concentrations of the methyl donors methionine, choline, betaine (trimethylglycine), and dimethylglycine (DMG) in relation to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Our study included 1367 incident CRC cases (965 colon and 402 rectum) and 2323 controls matched by gender, age group, and study center. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for CRC risk were estimated by conditional logistic regression, comparing the fifth to the first quintile of plasma concentrations. RESULTS: Overall, methionine (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.63-0.99, P-trend = 0.05), choline (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60-0.99, P-trend = 0.07), and betaine (OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.66-1.09, P-trend = 0.06) concentrations were inversely associated with CRC risk of borderline significance. In participants with folate concentration below the median of 11.3 nmol/l, high betaine concentration was associated with reduced CRC risk (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.50-1.00, P-trend = 0.02), which was not observed for those having a higher folate status. Among women, but not men, high choline concentration was associated with decreased CRC risk (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.43-0.88, P-trend = 0.01). Plasma DMG was not associated with CRC risk. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with high plasma concentrations of methionine, choline, and betaine may be at reduced risk of CRC.},

   abstract = {Blastocystis is a protistan parasite living in the digestive tract of many animals, including humans. This highly prevalent intestinal parasite is suspected to be linked to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a chronic functional bowel disorder. Here, we first compared the prevalence of Blastocystis among 56 IBS patients (40 IBS with constipation (IBS-C), 9 IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), 4 mixed IBS (IBS-M) and 3 unsubtyped IBS (IBS-U) according to the Rome III criteria) and 56 control (i.e. without any diagnosed chronic or acute gastrointestinal disorder) subjects. The highest prevalence of Blastocystis spp. was observed in the IBS group, but was only statistically significant in men (36.8% in the IBS group versus 4.8% in the control group). We then conducted a meta-analysis including epidemiological studies attempting to determine whether Blastocystis carriage could be linked to IBS, and highlighted that IBS patients had a relative risk of 2.34 to be infected by Blastocystis when compared to non-IBS subjects. We also looked for Dientamoeba fragilis, which is often associated with IBS, and identified this parasite only in some IBS patients (n = 6/56). Several studies provided evidence for a major role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of IBS. Thus, we investigated the possible impact of Blastocystis carriage on the enteric bacterial community through quantification of 8 major bacterial groups from the enteric flora. Our data indicated that men with IBS-C had a significant decrease in Bifidobacterium sp. when infected by Blastocystis. Interestingly, in control subjects (i.e. without any gastrointestinal disorder) positive for Blastocystis, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which is known for its anti-inflammatory properties, was significantly decreased in men. Our results support the hypothesis that Blastocystis might be linked to the pathophysiology of IBS-C and intestinal flora imbalance.},

   abstract = {Acrylamide, classified in 1994 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as "probably carcinogenic" to humans, was discovered in 2002 in some heat-treated, carbohydrate-rich foods. The association between dietary acrylamide intake and epithelial ovarian cancer risk (EOC) has been previously studied in one case-control and three prospective cohort studies which obtained inconsistent results and could not further examine histologic subtypes other than serous EOC. The present study was carried out in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) subcohort of women (n = 325,006). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between questionnaire-based acrylamide intake and EOC risk. Acrylamide was energy-adjusted using the residual method and was evaluated both as a continuous variable (per 10 mug/d) and in quintiles; when subgroups by histologic EOC subtypes were analyzed, acrylamide intake was evaluated in quartiles. During a mean follow-up of 11 years, 1,191 incident EOC cases were diagnosed. At baseline, the median acrylamide intake in EPIC was 21.3 mug/d. No associations and no evidence for a dose-response were observed between energy-adjusted acrylamide intake and EOC risk (HR10mug/d,1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.09; HRQ5vsQ1, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.76-1.23). No differences were seen when invasive EOC subtypes (582 serous, 118 endometrioid, and 79 mucinous tumors) were analyzed separately. This study did not provide evidence that acrylamide intake, based on food intake questionnaires, was associated with risk for EOC in EPIC. Additional studies with more reliable estimates of exposure based on biomarkers may be needed.},

   abstract = {An essential role of the intestinal epithelium is to separate luminal contents from the interstitium, a function primarily determined by the integrity of the epithelium and the tight junction that seals the paracellular space. Intestinal tight junctions are selectively permeable, and intestinal permeability can be increased physiologically in response to luminal nutrients or pathologically by mucosal immune cells and cytokines, the enteric nervous system, and pathogens. Compromised intestinal barrier function is associated with an array of clinical conditions, both intestinal and systemic. Although most available data are correlative, some studies support a model where cycles of increased intestinal permeability, intestinal immune activation, and subsequent immune-mediated barrier loss contribute to disease progression. This model is applicable to intestinal and systemic diseases. However, it has not been proven, and both mechanistic and therapeutic studies are ongoing. Nevertheless, the correlation between increased intestinal permeability and disease has caught the attention of the public, leading to a rise in popularity of the diagnosis of "leaky gut syndrome," which encompasses a range of systemic disorders. Proponents claim that barrier restoration will cure underlying disease, but this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials. Moreover, human and mouse studies show that intestinal barrier loss alone is insufficient to initiate disease. It is therefore uncertain whether increased permeability in these patients is a cause or effect of the underlying disorder. Although drug targets that may mediate barrier restoration have been proposed, none have been proven effective. As such, current treatments for barrier dysfunction should target the underlying disease.},

   abstract = {Gut microbiota alterations are increasingly being recognized as an important factor in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The onset of IBS symptoms after a bout of gastroenteritis comprises one of the strongest indications for the importance of gut microbiota for IBS. Moreover, recent studies have identified several susceptibility genes for IBS involved in the innate immunity and recognition of bacteria but also maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier. During recent years, it has also been demonstrated that IBS patients, or subgroups thereof, may have an altered microbiota composition relative to healthy individuals, mainly based on the analysis of fecal microbiota. Moreover, a positive effect of treatment with non-absorbable antibiotics and probiotics in IBS provides further indirect support for the relevance of gut microbiota alterations in IBS.},

   abstract = {The aetiology and pathology of IBS, a functional bowel disorder thought to lack an organic cause, is largely unknown. However, studies suggest that various features, such as altered composition of the gut microbiota, together with increased intestinal permeability, a changed balance in the enteroendocrine system and a dysregulated immune system in the gut, most likely have an important role in IBS. Exactly how these entities act together and give rise to symptoms is still unknown, but an altered gut microbiota composition could lead to dysregulation of the intestinal barrier as well as the enteroendocrine and the immune systems, which (through interactions with the nervous system) might generate symptoms. This Review highlights the crosstalk between the gut microbiota, the enteroendocrine system, the immune system and the role of intestinal permeability in patients with IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder. The pathogenesis of IBS is multifactorial. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of IBS using the Rome III criteria in young Japanese women and to assess the effects of mental, physical, dietary and nutritional factors on IBS. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data obtained from self-administered questionnaires, including age, height, weight, lifestyle, food habits, anxiety and depressive states and IBS-related symptoms, were analyzed in 245 participants. An established semiquantitative questionnaire available for clinical investigation (FFQg) was used to obtain a detailed assessment of food intake and the physical activity levels. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS was 12.0%. Of the IBS participants, constipation-predominant IBS (25.0%) was more prevalent than the diarrhea-predominant subtype (17.9%). The IBS participants had lower body mass indices, consumed less eggs and milk and were more physically active than the non-IBS participants. In addition, an anxiety state was more common in the IBS participants. Those who hesitated with evacuation of stool and who thought that there is an association between abdominal symptoms, such as constipation and diarrhea, and menstruation were more predominant among the IBS participants. The percentage of individuals who reported often rushing to the toilet within the past year and experiencing borborygmus (rumbling stomach) was greater among the IBS participants. A logistic regression analysis revealed that milk intake was an independent predictor of IBS. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IBS observed in this study was similar to that reported in previous studies conducted in Japan and other countries. Mental, physical, dietary and nutritional factors have an impact on IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are commonly associated with chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Direct consequences are obstipation or diarrhea as opposite aspects of the irritable bowel syndrome, and more indirectly, alteration of appetite, feeling of fullness, flatulence, bloatedness, and eventually leading to altered absorption of nutrients. Moreover, GI retention and passage times have been recognized as important factors in determining the release site and hence the bioavailability of orally administered drugs. To facilitate the understanding of physiological and pathological processes involved, it is necessary to monitor the gut motility in animal models. Here, we describe a method for studying the GI transit time using technetium-labeled activated charcoal diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-Ch-DTPA) detected by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). METHODS: Tc-DTPA was adsorbed onto activated charcoal and administered orally to trypan blue-tainted (n = 4) 129SvEv mice (50 to 80 MBq/animal, n = 11). The exact distribution and movement of radioactivity in the gastrointestinal tract was measured at intervals of 1, 3, 6, 12, and 22 h by SPECT-CT. In addition, in order to validate the imaging of GI transient time, loperamide (0.25 mg/animal, n = 3) was used to delay the GI transit. RESULTS: The transit time measured as the peak radioactivity occurring in the rectum was 6 to 7 h after gavaging of 99mTc-Ch-DTPA. After 1 h, the bolus had passed into the small intestine and entered the cecum and the colon. At 6 and 8 h, the cecum, the ascending, transverse, and descending colon, and the rectum showed significant labeling. Several pellets were stored in the rectum for defecation. After 22 h, little activity remained in the stomach and none was detected in the transverse colon or other GI locations. In contrast, 6 h after administration of loperamide, only the cecum and part of the transverse colon were labeled. After 22 h, both structures retained significant amount of label. This delay has been verified by non-radiolabeled dye trypan blue GI measurements (n = 4). CONCLUSION: Here, we present the first non-invasive study of mouse GI transit time, allowing clear differentiation between vehicle- and loperamide-treated animals. This technique is useful for the investigation of GI motility in mice.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Menthol reduces intestinal motility in animal studies, an effect that is probably mediated by transient receptor potential channels. Peppermint oil (PO), with menthol as a major constituent, is widely used as a spasmolytic agent in irritable bowel syndrome. In the current study, we investigated the effect of acute PO administration on intragastric pressure (IGP) profiles and gastric sensorimotor functions in health. METHODS: Healthy volunteers underwent IGP measurement before and during continuous intragastric infusion of a nutrient drink (n = 13), and gastric barostat studies (n = 13). A single capsule of PO (182 mg) or placebo was administered during the studies in a randomized controlled crossover design. Throughout the studies, healthy volunteers scored 11 epigastric symptoms on a visual analogue scale (VAS); satiation was scored on a 6-point Likert scale during intragastric infusion. KEY RESULTS: During fasting, IGP and motility index (MI) of the proximal stomach decreased significantly after PO administration compared with placebo (P < 0.0001 and <0.05, respectively). In contrast, during intragastric infusion of the nutrient drink, no significant differences were detected between PO and placebo in IGP profiles, MI, satiation scores, and epigastric symptoms. The maximum infused volume, gastric compliance or sensitivity to balloon distention did not differ between both treatment arms. However, reduced appetite scores were seen during fasting after PO treatment, as compared with placebo (P = 0.01). Postprandial VAS scores were similar between PO and placebo. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Peppermint oil reduces IGP, proximal phasic contractility, and appetite, with negligible effects on gastric sensitivity, tone, accommodation, and nutrient tolerance in health.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is responsible for a multitude of digestive and immune functions which depend upon the balanced interaction of the intestinal microbiota, diet, gut barrier function, and mucosal immune response. Disruptions in one or more of these factors can lead to intestinal disorders or enteropathies which are characterized by intestinal inflammation, increased gut permeability, and reduced capacity to absorb nutrients. Enteropathy is frequently associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune enteropathy, radiation enteritis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), where pathologic changes in the intestinal tract lead to abdominal discomfort, bloating, abnormal bowel function (e.g., diarrhea, urgency, constipation and malabsorption). Unfortunately, effective therapies for the management of enteropathy and restoring intestinal health are still not available. An accumulating body of preclinical studies has demonstrated that oral administration of plasma- or serum-derived protein concentrates containing high levels of immunoglobulins can improve weight, normalize gut barrier function, and reduce the severity of enteropathy in animal models. Recent studies in humans, using serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate, demonstrate that such protein preparations are safe and improve symptoms, nutritional status, and various biomarkers associated with enteropathy. Benefits have been shown in patients with HIV infection or diarrhea-predominant IBS. This review summarizes preclinical and clinical studies with plasma/serum protein concentrates and describes the effects on host nutrition, intestinal function, and markers of intestinal inflammation. It supports the concept that immunoglobulin-containing protein preparations may offer a new strategy for restoring functional homeostasis in the intestinal tract of patients with enteropathy.},

Such disruptions in the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can lead to symptoms of abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating, abnormal bowel function, and malabsorption of nutrients. While significant advances have been made in understanding the factors that influence the complex and fragile balance between the gut microbiota, intestinal epithelial cell integrity, and the underlying immune system, effective therapies for restoring intestinal balance during enteropathy are still not available.

This review summarizes studies showing the impact of enteropathy on nutritional status and how specially formulated bovine immunoglobulins may help restore intestinal homeostasis and nutritional status in patients with specific enteropathies. Such protein preparations may provide distinct nutritional support required for the dietary management of patients who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, have limited or impaired capacity to digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or other special medically determined nutrient requirements that cannot be satisfied by changes to the normal diet alone.},

   abstract = {Obesity and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are prevalent in the United States and cause significant morbidity in those affected. However, it is unclear whether obesity is more prevalent in those affected by IBS or if IBS is more prevalent in obese persons. To evaluate the association between obesity and IBS, a comprehensive review was performed by searching MEDLINE and Embase from 1980 through July 2012. Studies were included if 1 of the outcomes examined the relationship between excess body weight or obesity and IBS. A total of 11 studies (2 pediatric and 9 adult) investigated the relationship between obesity and IBS. The prevalence of obesity in children with IBS ranged from 24.8% to 42%. In adults, the prevalence of IBS in obese subjects varied from 11.6% to 24%, depending on the study population. Two studies did not show increased odds of IBS in obese patients; however, 2 studies showed that symptoms were more severe in obese patients affected by IBS, while 1 of these studies demonstrated that IBS symptom severity improved after bariatric surgery. The findings of this comprehensive review of the literature suggest that the frequency of IBS in obese children and adults is variable and depends on the study population. Due to the heterogeneity in study populations, outcome assessment, and methodology in the existing literature, further studies are needed to determine whether obesity is associated with IBS.},

Meal challenge tests have previously been used to study symptoms and pathophysiology in functional dyspepsia. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to evaluate differences in gastrointestinal (GI) symptom response to a standardized meal test in IBS compared to healthy controls. METHODS: We included 67 patients with IBS and 16 healthy controls. After an overnight fast the subjects were served breakfast (540 kcal; 36% fat, 15% proteins, 49% carbohydrates; 8.9 g fiber). They completed visual analog scales assessing severity of six GI symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, discomfort, nausea, gas, fullness) before breakfast and every 30 minutes up to 240 minutes after breakfast. The patients also completed a questionnaire (IBS-SSS) to assess IBS symptom severity during the preceding week. The course of symptom scores over time was analyzed using mixed models. RESULTS: The meal was well tolerated and all subjects completed the test period. In patients, significant effects of time (initial increase to a maximum, followed by a return to baseline) were found for fullness, bloating, nausea and discomfort (all p values < 0.01 for linear, quadratic and third-order effect of time). In IBS patients, an independent significant association between IBS-SSS scores and all postprandial symptoms, except for nausea, was found (all p < 0.01). In controls, a significant linear, quadratic and third-order effect of time (all p < 0.0001) was found for fullness only. The difference in time course for bloating and discomfort between IBS patients and controls was confirmed when comparing the groups directly (significant time-by-group interaction effects, all p < 0.05), but not for nausea. On average, IBS patients scored significantly higher than controls on all symptoms, except for nausea (significant main effects of group, all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A standardized meal test seems to be a promising tool to study the symptom pattern in IBS and potentially to follow the effect of interventions.},

   abstract = {The human intestine is colonised by 10(1)(3) to 10(1)(4) micro-organisms, the vast majority of which belong to the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Although highly stable over time, the composition and activities of the microbiota may be influenced by a number of factors including age, diet and antibiotic treatment. Although perturbations in the composition or functions of the microbiota are linked to inflammatory and metabolic disorders (e.g. inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome and obesity), it is unclear at this point whether these changes are a symptom of the disease or a contributing factor. A better knowledge of the mechanisms through which changes in microbiota composition (dysbiosis) promote disease states is needed to improve our understanding of the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and disease. While evidence of the preventive and therapeutic effects of probiotic strains on diarrhoeal illness and other intestinal conditions is promising, the exact mechanisms of the beneficial effects are not fully understood. Recent studies have raised the question of whether non-viable probiotic strains can confer health benefits on the host by influencing the immune system. As the potential health effect of these non-viable bacteria depends on whether the mechanism of this effect is dependent on viability, future research needs to consider each probiotic strain on a case-by-case basis. The present review provides a comprehensive, updated overview of the human gut microbiota, the factors influencing its composition and the role of probiotics as a therapeutic modality in the treatment and prevention of diseases and/or restoration of human health.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Fructose malabsorption is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. This review examines new findings on the physiology, assessment and therapy of fructose malabsorption in functional gastrointestinal disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Additional GLUT transport mechanisms that regulate fructose absorption might be involved in symptom adaptation to high-fructose diets. Although glucose is known to facilitate fructose absorption, erythritol promotes malabsorption. The methodologies of fructose breath testing and its clinical utility have been questioned by findings of unrealistic testing dose and poor reproducibility. Although fructose restriction appears to benefit children with functional abdominal pain, fructose restriction itself may not be the key player. In irritable bowel syndrome, fructose restriction within a diet low in other fermentable carbohydrates fermentable, oligosaccharide, disaccharide monosaccharide and polyols produced good symptom control compared with habitual diet, but such therapy resulted in significantly reduced bifidobacteria. Fructose absorption and subsequently, abdominal pain and nausea are improved by a novel enzyme therapy that converts fructose to glucose for absorption. SUMMARY: New insights into factors affecting fructose absorption may have therapeutic applications. Doubts surrounding clinical utility of fructose breath testing are emerging. Although restriction of fructose and other fermentable, oligosaccharide, disaccharide monosaccharide and polyols have efficacy for functional gastrointestinal symptoms, potentially negative effects on microbiota deserve attention.},

   abstract = {AIM: Functional and metabolic effects of dietary fiber are recognized by the scientific, clinical and nutritional experts. Dietary fiber plays a very significant role in modifying the intestinal microbiota, exerting prebiotic effects such as stimulating the growth and/or function of beneficial intestinal microorganisms. Changes in the gut microbiota composition are classically considered as one of the many factors involved in the pathogenesis of either inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. The use of particular food products with a prebiotic effect has thus been tested in clinical trials with the objective to improve the clinical activity and well-being of patients with such disorders. Partially Hydrolyzed Guar Gum (PHGG) is a natural dietary fiber (Benefibra, Novartis CH Italy): it is a white powder, water-soluble, colorless and transparent in water solution and almost tasteless. PHGG is stable and soluble at various pH levels commonly found in foods as well as resistant to heat, acid, salt, high pressure and digestive enzymes. Low viscosity of PHGG provides a distinct advantage for the use of fiber in enteral feeding products to be administered through feeding tubes. It has been studied in adults, both healthy volunteers and patients, in different disorders such as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), enteral nutrition, small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and, very recently, in children suffering from functional abdominal pain according to the Rome III Criteria definition for functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). This review takes stock of the situation concerning what is known to date on PHGG as dietary fiber, in order to give the health care professionals, such as gastroenterologists, dieticians and general practitioners, a complete overview on its intrinsic characteristics, preclinical and clinical evaluations, uses in different situations as supportive therapy in the management of the main intestinal functional disorders both in adults and in children. METHODS: All the papers on PHGG, published from the early 1990s of the Last Century to the Year 2013, have been considered. All types of publications have been included. PubMed, Medline, Ovid were the main sources adopted for data retrieving. RESULTS: PHGG has been studied in both animals and humans; its safety is well known and several clinical uses are well established. Concerning the modulation of metabolism in human, very little has been done to date and the studies have been focused, for the most part, on the functional diseases: PHGG has been proved to be useful in treating both IBS -C and D symptoms, not only in adults but also in children; data on constipation are relatively scarce and what can be deduced from the Literature is that the high concentration of fiber gives the PHGG the possibility of being used effectively in acceptable dosages (up to 22 g/day) even in situations such as chronic constipation. The use in clinical nutrition has revealed the flexibility of the compound which, owing to its peculiar characteristics, does not gel and remains liquid, PHGG can be used successfully in patients in enteral nutrition lowering the incidence of diarrhea. New open horizons can be glimpsed for SIBO treatment, lowering or maximizing the antibiotics use. CONCLUSION: Not all the fibers are the same: this is a fact. Promoting the specific knowledge of their characteristics is very important if healthcare professionals want to give their patients the best options for functional gastrointestinal disorders or nutritional needs. PHGG (Benefiber Novartis CH) has been proved to be safe and effective in promoting gut health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to determine whether psychological well-being and weight-teasing history of young adults with bowel conditions (i.e. coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome) differed from those without bowel conditions. METHODS: Young adults (aged 18-26 years) completed an online survey that collected demographic information and assessed psychological well-being (mentally and physically unhealthy days, self-esteem, and depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder severity) and weight-teasing history (Perception of Teasing Scale). Each bowel condition participant (cases = 135) was matched to four healthy participants (controls = 504) based on sex and body mass index (BMI) (+/-0.50 BMI units). Conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted and odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were presented for all measures and demographics. RESULTS: Cases were significantly more likely to have poorer overall psychological well-being. Specifically, cases were significantly (P </= 0.05) more likely to have more mentally and physical unhealthy days, depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms than controls. Cases were also significantly more likely to recall being weight teased as a child (P = 0.02, OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.04-1.53) and being more upset from the weight-teasing insults (P = 0.006, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05-1.35) than controls. Cases were also more than 1.5 times more likely to be made fun of (P = 0.03, OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.09-2.43) or laughed at (P = 0.01, OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.15-2.73) because of their weight than controls. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that healthcare providers should monitor the psychological well-being of young adults with bowel conditions and incorporate opportunities for them to develop skills and strategies for coping.},

Although it remains unclear whether the prevalence of eating disorders is higher in those with DRCHCs compared with the general population, overall findings suggest that young people with DRCHCs may be at risk of endorsing disordered eating behaviors that may lead to diagnosis of an eating disorder and other health problems over the course of their treatment. Thus, health care providers should be aware that young people with DRCHCs may be at risk of eating disorders and carefully monitor psychological changes and the use of unhealthy weight control methods. It is also important to develop and evaluate theory-based interventions and disease-specific eating disorder risk screening tools that are effective in halting the progression of eating disorders and negative health outcomes in young people with chronic health conditions.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To critically review recent literature on small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). RECENT FINDINGS: When originally described, SIBO was added to the list of causes of the malabsorption syndrome and the pathophysiology of its consequences for the digestion and absorption of various nutrients was gradually revealed. More recently, SIBO was incriminated as a cause of diarrhea, especially in the elderly. However, the suggestion that SIBO may be a causative factor in irritable bowel syndrome and of its constituent symptoms has sparked debate and controversy on the very definition of SIBO. This debate revolves around the tests employed and the diagnostic cut-off values (for bacterial numbers) used to diagnose SIBO in clinical practice. SUMMARY: A fundamental problem with SIBO, and one that allows controversy to simmer, is the lack of a universally accepted and applied gold standard for the diagnosis of SIBO. Hopefully, the application of molecular microbiological methods to the characterization of the small intestinal microbiome will tell us, once and for all, what is normal and when 'abnormality' is truly responsible for symptoms and disease. Meanwhile, therapy remains, for the most part, empirical and is based on the correction, wherever possible, of any underlying cause, attention to nutritional deficiencies, and the use of antibiotics.},

As estimated by R5-ELISA, the degree of degradation of immune reactive gluten was ca. 28%. Two-dimensional electrophoresis and RP-FPLC analyses showed marked variations of the protein fractions compared to the untreated flour. The comparison was also extended to in vitro effect of the peptic/tryptic-digests towards K562 and T84 cells. The flour with the intermediate content of gluten (ICG) was used for bread making, and compared to whole gluten (WG) bread. The chemical, structural and sensory features of the ICG bread approached those of the bread made with WG flour. The protein digestibility of the ICG bread was higher than that from WG flour. Also the nutritional quality, as estimated by different indexes, was the highest for ICG bread.},

   abstract = {In humans, 2 functionally different types of adipose tissue coexist: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). WAT is involved in energy storage, whereas BAT is involved in energy expenditure. Increased amounts of WAT may contribute to the development of metabolic disorders, such as obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, the thermogenic function of BAT allows high consumption of fatty acids because of the activity of uncoupling protein 1 in the internal mitochondrial membrane. Interestingly, obesity reduction and insulin sensitization have been achieved by BAT activation-regeneration in animal models. This review describes the origin, function, and differentiation mechanisms of BAT to identify new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metabolic disorders related to obesity. On the basis of the animal studies, novel approaches for BAT regeneration combining stem cells from the adipose tissue with active components, such as melatonin, may have potential for the treatment of metabolic disorders in humans.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To hypothesize that hernia repair would not change the incidence of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) due to the benign and limited nature of the procedure. STUDY DESIGN: This cohort study assessed a randomized selection of children aged 4-18 years who underwent hernia repair more than 4 years prior at Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. Controls were siblings who had not undergone surgery previously. Parents completed the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III Version by telephone for subjects and controls. The primary outcome was the presence of FGIDs. RESULTS: Fifty children with hernia repair and 43 sibling controls were identified. At the time of survey, subjects with hernia repair were average age 12.9 years (range 5-18 years, 60% male) and controls were average age 12.2 years (range 4-18 years, 49% male). Average age at surgical repair was 5.2 years (median 5.2 years, range 0.2-10.4 years) and average time since surgical repair was 7.8 years (range 4.8-13.7 years). FGIDs were diagnosed in 10/50 (20%) cases of hernia repair and 2/43 (5%) controls (P = .033, Fisher 2-tailed test). CONCLUSIONS: Umbilical hernia repair increases the likelihood of FGIDs in childhood. Additional studies are needed to identify aspects of surgery that may be associated with development of FGIDs.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: It has been suggested that different subcategories of childhood abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (AP-FGIDs) are not separate clinical entities, but represent variable expressions of the same FGID. The aim of the present study was to compare clinical and psychological characteristics of children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional abdominal pain (FAP), and functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS). METHODS: A total of 259 children, ages 8 to 18 years, fulfilling Rome III criteria for IBS or FAPS were included in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of hypnotherapy. At inclusion, questionnaires assessed demographics, clinical features, abdominal pain frequency and intensity, depression and anxiety, somatization, health-related quality of life, pain beliefs, and coping strategies. RESULTS: No differences were found between children with IBS and those with FAPS with respect to the main outcomes: frequency and intensity of abdominal pain, symptoms of depression and anxiety, somatization, health-related quality of life, pain beliefs, and coping strategies. A significantly higher percentage of patients with IBS had a positive family history for AP-FGIDs (56.8% vs 37.8%; P = 0.00). Characteristics of patients with IBS subtypes did not differ. Patients with FAP or FAPS differed only with respect to problem-focused coping strategy (2.21 +/- 0.61 vs 2.52 +/- 0.49; P = 0.00). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with IBS and those with FAPS have similar psychosocial profiles. These results may explain why treatment response of psychological therapies in these AP-FGIDs is similar. These results may indicate that pediatric IBS and FAPS are different expressions of 1 underlying functional disorder, but similarities in psychosocial characteristics do not exclude the possibility that these disorders are different entities, because these similarities can exist between disorders of various causes. Therefore, future research is required on the role of other (physiological) factors in pediatric IBS and FAPS.},

We performed a systematic review to assess efficacy of HT in paediatric FAP/IBS patients. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials (RCT) in children with FAP or IBS, investigating efficacy of HT on the following outcomes: abdominal pain scores, quality of life, costs and school absenteeism. RESULTS: Three RCT comparing HT to a control treatment were included with sample sizes ranging from 22 to 52 children. We refrained from statistical pooling because of low number of studies and many differences in design and outcomes. Two studies examined HT performed by a therapist, one examined HT through self-exercises on audio CD. All trials showed statistically significantly greater improvement in abdominal pain scores among children receiving HT. One trial reported beneficial effects sustained after 1 year of follow-up. One trial reported statistically significant improvement in quality of life in the HT group. Two trials reported significant reductions in school absenteeism after HT. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic effects of HT seem superior to standard medical care in children with FAP or IBS. It remains difficult to quantify exact benefits. The need for more high quality research is evident.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gluten is a glycoprotein present in some cereals. The incidence of disorders related to gluten, including the EC, is increasing, even pathologies far from an etiology or treatment with GF D. AIMS: Review the scientific literature related to the ingestion of gluten and pathogenesis of different diseases. METHODS: A literature search in major scientific database. RESULTS: We obtained from the following diseases, gluten ataxia, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depressive disorders, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, dermatitis herpetiformis and epilepsy, studies in which either a determination of gliadin was refered or a treatment, with/without gluten, was applied and evaluated. CONCLUSION: The ingestion of gluten seems to be related to disease, when there is no EC, SGNC or wheat allergy. Suspicions about the benefit of GF D as a complementary treatment is borne in semi-clinical trials and cohorts, either as a causal factor in the pathogenesis, or improvement of symptoms.},

   abstract = {Intestinal mucosal barrier function is the capacity of the intestine to provide adequate containment of luminal microorganisms and molecules while preserving the ability to absorb nutrients. The central element is the epithelial layer, which physically separates the lumen and the internal milieu and is in charge of vectorial transport of ions, nutrients, and other substances. The secretion of mucus-forming mucins, sIgA, and antimicrobial peptides reinforces the mucosal barrier on the extraepithelial side, while a variety of immune cells contributes to mucosal defense in the inner side. Thus, the mucosal barrier is of physical, biochemical, and immune nature. In addition, the microbiota may be viewed as part of this system because of the mutual influence occurring between the host and the luminal microorganisms. Alteration of the mucosal barrier function with accompanying increased permeability and/or bacterial translocation has been linked with a variety of conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease. Genetic and environmental factors may converge to evoke a defective function of the barrier, which in turn may lead to overt inflammation of the intestine as a result of an exacerbated immune reaction toward the microbiota. According to this hypothesis, inflammatory bowel disease may be both precipitated and treated by either stimulation or downregulation of the different elements of the mucosal barrier, with the outcome depending on timing, the cell type affected, and other factors. In this review, we cover briefly the elements of the barrier and their involvement in functional defects and the resulting phenotype.},

   abstract = {The aim of this review is to highlight the impact of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in those patients who consult the medical profession and examine the therapeutic potential of probiotics in this condition, where there is a strong need for new treatment options. Traditionally, IBS is frequently regarded as a trivial condition which is certainly not life threatening and mainly psychological in origin. However, these preconceptions are misplaced, as in some patients the condition can be devastating with the pain being as severe as that of childbirth coupled with incapacitating bowel dysfunction. In addition, patients suffer from a variety of non-colonic symptoms such as low backache, constant lethargy, nausea and genito-urinary problems, all of which lead to these patients having extremely poor quality of life. Unfortunately, the treatment of IBS is very unsatisfactory with only one new medication being developed for this condition in the last 25 years. It is now recognised that IBS is a multifactorial condition with symptoms being triggered by a variety of factors, some of which appear to be influenced by probiotics, resulting in speculation that they may have therapeutic potential in this condition. There have been over thirty controlled clinical trials of probiotics in IBS with approximately two-thirds of these studies showing evidence of an improvement in symptoms. However, not all probiotics appear to be effective with different symptoms being improved by different strains and some improving symptoms more than others. Consequently, the ideal probiotic for the treatment of IBS has yet to be defined, but the evidence is good enough to encourage further research with the aim of identifying an optimal strain or strains.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) prevalence, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), altered microbiota, low-grade inflammation, and antibiotic therapy in IBS are all controversial issues. AIMS: To conduct an evidence-based review of these factors. METHODS: A review of the literature was carried out up to July 2012, with the inclusion of additional articles as far as August 2013, all of which were analyzed through the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) system. RESULTS: 1.There is greater SIBO probability in IBS when breath tests are performed, but prevalence varies widely (2-84%). 2.The gut microbiota in individuals with IBS is different from that in healthy subjects, but a common characteristic present in all the patients has not been established. 3.The incidence and prevalence of PI-IBS varies from 9-10% and 3-17%, respectively, and the latter decreases over time. Bacterial etiology is the most frequent but post-viral and parasitic cases have been reported. 4.A sub-group of patients has increased enterochromaffin cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and mast cells in the intestinal mucosa, but no differences between PI-IBS and non-PI-IBS have been determined. 5.Methanogenic microbiota has been associated with IBS with constipation. 6.Rifaximin at doses of 400mg TID/10days or 550mg TID/14days is effective treatment for the majority of overall symptoms and abdominal bloating in IBS. Retreatment effectiveness appears to be similar to that of the first cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are required to determine the nature of the gut microbiota in IBS and the differences in low-grade inflammation between PI-IBS and non-PI-IBS. Rifaximin has shown itself to be effective treatment for IBS, regardless of prior factors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pharmacologic treatments for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and medical management of symptoms are increasingly based on IBS subtype, so it is important to accurately differentiate patients. Few studies have classified subtypes of pediatric IBS, and conclusions have been challenged by methodologic limitations. We performed a prospective study to investigate the distribution of IBS subtypes among children and adolescents based on stool diary information, and compared subtypes according to demographic and pain characteristics. METHODS: We studied 129 subjects, ages 7 to 18 years (mean age, 11.4 +/- 2.8 y; 60.5% female; 69.0% white) who met Pediatric Rome III IBS criteria and were part of larger studies of children with functional gastrointestinal disorders, recruited from primary and tertiary care centers. Children completed daily pain and stool diaries for 2 weeks. Participants were assigned IBS subtypes based on their reported stool information per adult Rome III criteria. IBS subtypes were compared for demographic variables and pain characteristics. RESULTS: IBS with constipation was the most common subtype of the disorder (58.1% of subjects), whereas mixed IBS was the least common (2.3% of subjects); 34.1% of subjects were unsubtyped IBS and 5.4% had IBS with diarrhea. The groups of different IBS subtypes did not differ significantly by sex, age, ethnicity, or pain characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to adults, in children, IBS with constipation and unsubtyped IBS are the most common subtypes, whereas IBS with diarrhea and mixed IBS are less common. Demographic and pain characteristics cannot distinguish subtypes.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a condition affecting approximately 10-15% of Western populations. The Rome III criteria are applied to many studies to validate the diagnosis of IBS. The low fermentable oligo, di, monosaccharides and polyol (FODMAP) diet has been the subject of many robust clinical trials and is now used as the primary dietary therapy internationally. This review examines the current evidence for the role of the low FODMAP diet in IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: Detailed commentary on original research involving FODMAPs and IBS symptoms from 2013 to 2014 is provided. SUMMARY: The low FODMAP diet has been shown to be an efficacious therapy for reduction of functional gastrointestinal symptoms seen in IBS. Recent publications provide randomized controlled trial and prospective observational evidence in support of the diet for symptom management. The low FODMAP diet appears to be superior to a gluten-free diet in people with self-reported nonceliac gluten sensitivity. Although the low FODMAP diet has not been shown to reduce the prebiotic effect in the colon, total colonic bacterial load was reduced. Further research investigating the potential health implications of both this and the nutritional adequacy of the liberalized low FODMAP diet is required.},

   abstract = {Carbohydrates occur across a range of foods regularly consumed including grains such as wheat and rye, vegetables, fruits, and legumes. Short-chain carbohydrates with chains of up to 10 sugars vary in their digestibility and subsequent absorption. Those that are poorly absorbed exert osmotic effects in the intestinal lumen increasing its water volume, and are rapidly fermented by bacteria with consequent gas production. These two effects alone may underlie most of the induction of gastrointestinal symptoms after they are ingested in moderate amounts via luminal distension in patients with visceral hypersensitivity. This has been the basis of the use of lactose-free diets in those with lactose malabsorption and of fructose-reduced diets for fructose malabsorption. However, application of such dietary approaches in patients with functional bowel disorders has been restricted to observational studies with uncertain efficacy. As all dietary poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates have similar and additive effects in the intestine, a concept has been developed to regard them collectively as FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) and to evaluate a dietary approach that restricts them all. In patients with irritable bowel syndrome, there is now an accumulating body of evidence, based on observational and comparative studies, and on randomized-controlled trials that supports the notion that FODMAPs trigger gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with functional bowel disorders, and that a diet low in FODMAPs offers considerable symptom relief in the majority of patients who use it.},

   abstract = {Full-length cDNA encoding two leptin sequences (tLepA and tLepB) and one leptin receptor sequence (tLepR) were identified in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The full-length cDNA of tLepR was 3423bp, encoding a protein of 1140 amino acid (aa) which contained all functionally important domains conserved among vertebrate leptin receptors. The cDNAs of tLepA and tLepB were 486bp and 459bp in length, encoding proteins of 161 aa and 152 aa, respectively. Modeling the three-dimensional structures of tLepA and tLepB predicted strong conservation of tertiary structure with that of human leptin, comprised of four helixes. Using synteny, the tLeps were found near common genes, such as IMPDH1 and LLRC4. The cDNA for tLepA and tLepB was cloned and synthetic cDNA optimized for expression in Escherichia coli was prepared according to the cloned sequence. The tLepA- and tLepB-expressing plasmids were transformed into E. coli and expressed as recombinant proteins upon induction with nalidixic acid, found almost entirely in insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs). The proteins were solubilized, refolded and purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography. In the case of tLepA, the fraction eluted contained a mixture of monomers and dimers. The purified tLepA and tLepB monomers and tLepA dimer showed a single band of approximately 15kDa on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel in the presence of reducing agent, whereas the tLepA dimer showed one band of approximately 30kDa in the absence of reducing agent, indicating its formation by S-S bonds. The three tLeps were biologically active in promoting proliferation of BAF/3 cells stably transfected with the long form of human leptin receptor (hLepR), but their activity was four orders of magnitude lower than that of mammalian leptin. Furthermore, the three tLeps were biologically active in promoting STAT-LUC activation in COS7 cells transfected with the identified tLepR but not in cells transfected with hLepR. tLepA was more active than tLepB. Low or no activity likely resulted from low identity (9-22%) to mammalian leptins. In an in vivo experiment in which tilapia were fed ad libitum or fasted, there was no significant difference in the expressions of tLepA, tLepB or tLepR in the brain between the two groups examined both by real-time PCR and RNA next generation sequencing. In conclusion, in the present report we show novel, previously unknown sequences of tilapia leptin receptor and two leptins and prepare two biologically active recombinant leptin proteins.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations in gastrointestinal (GI) permeability and immune measures are present in some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but the relationship to symptoms is poorly defined. In adults with IBS, we compared permeability, unstimulated peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC) interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, IBS life interference, and GI and psychological distress symptoms. METHODS: In 88 women and 18 men with IBS, GI permeability was quantitated as percent recovery of urinary sucrose and the lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio. IL-10 was measured in supernatants from 72-h incubated, unstimulated PBMCs. Participants completed a 4-week daily diary recording IBS life interference on daily activities and work, IBS symptoms, and psychological distress symptoms. They also completed the Brief Symptom Inventory. RESULTS: The L/M ratio but not percent sucrose recovery was significantly correlated with IBS interference with activities and work and retrospectively measured anxiety and depression. Unstimulated PBMC production of IL-10 correlated significantly with IBS interference with daily work, IBS symptom score, and abdominal pain. We identified a subgroup of IBS subjects with higher IL-10 and/or higher L/M ratio who had substantially higher IBS interference and IBS symptom scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a distinct subgroup of IBS patients with alterations in gut barrier function. This subgroup is characterized by increased GI permeability and/or increased PBMC production of IL-10. These physiologic alterations reflect more severe IBS as measured by interference of IBS with daily activities and daily IBS symptoms.},

   abstract = {The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a replacement diet with organic, semi-whole-grain products derived from Triticum turgidum subsp. turanicum (ancient) wheat on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and inflammatory/biochemical parameters. A double-blinded randomised cross-over trial was performed using twenty participants (thirteen females and seven males, aged 18-59 years) classified as having moderate IBS. Participants received products (bread, pasta, biscuits and crackers) made either from ancient or modern wheat for 6 weeks in a random order. Symptoms due to IBS were evaluated using two questionnaires, which were compiled both at baseline and on a weekly basis during the intervention period. Blood analyses were carried out at the beginning and end of each respective intervention period. During the intervention period with ancient wheat products, patients experienced a significant decrease in the severity of IBS symptoms, such as abdominal pain (P< 0.0001), bloating (P= 0.004), satisfaction with stool consistency (P< 0.001) and tiredness (P< 0.0001). No significant difference was observed after the intervention period with modern wheat products. Similarly, patients reported significant amelioration in the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms only after the ancient wheat intervention period, as measured by the intensity of pain (P= 0.001), the frequency of pain (P< 0.0001), bloating (P< 0.0001), abdominal distension (P< 0.001) and the quality of life (P< 0.0001). Interestingly, the inflammatory profile showed a significant reduction in the circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-17, interferon-gamma, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor after the intervention period with ancient wheat products, but not after the control period. In conclusion, significant improvements in both IBS symptoms and the inflammatory profile were reported after the ingestion of ancient wheat products.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis is a heterogeneous disease characterized by mast cell accumulation in 1 or more organs. Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic mastocytosis have been previously studied in small cohorts of patients, and no specific histologic description is available. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the clinical and pathologic features of gastrointestinal manifestations in patients with mastocytosis. METHODS: Medical history and gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with mastocytosis (n = 83) were compared with those of matched healthy subjects (n = 83) by means of patient questionnaire. Data were analyzed for epidemiologic, clinical, biological, and genetic factors associated with gastrointestinal symptoms for patients with mastocytosis. A comparative analysis of gastrointestinal histology from patients with mastocytosis (n = 23), control subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (n = 17), and healthy subjects (n = 19) was performed. RESULTS: The following gastrointestinal symptoms occurred more frequently and were more severe in patients with mastocytosis than in healthy subjects: bloating (33% vs 7.2%, P < .0001), abdominal pain (27.3% vs 4.8%, P < .0001), nausea (23% vs 8.4%, P = .02), and diarrhea (33.85% vs 1.2%, P < .0001). Patients with mastocytosis had a significantly higher incidence of personal history of duodenal ulcer (P = .02). Wild-type (WT) c-Kit was associated with diarrhea (P = .03). Specific histologic lesions were present in patients with mastocytosis but were not correlated with clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal manifestations in patients with mastocytosis are highly prevalent and often severe. Clinical symptoms do not correspond to histologic findings, are nonspecific, and can simulate irritable bowel syndrome.},

METHODS: The Canterbury Health Ageing and Life Course (CHALICE) study is a study of 50-year-old Cantabrians. A 4-day estimated food and beverage diary (FBD) was completed by 227 participants, 75.7% of those recruited. The Birmingham IBS symptom questionnaire was administered and individual participant scores were calculated for constipation, diarrhoea, pain score, and total symptom score. Associations between symptoms and the intake of fructose and lactose were examined using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Greater mean daily intakes of fructose (P=0.05) and lactose (P=0.04) were associated with a lower prevalence of IBS pain symptoms after adjusting for demographics and social economic status. However there was no evidence of an association with constipation, diarrhoea or total IBS score. CONCLUSIONS: Although our data show inverse relationships between fructose and lactose intakes and IBS pain symptoms, the use of cross-sectional data do not allow us to determine causality in these relationships. However it is possible that participants may have reduced their intake of fructose and lactose in response to IBS related pain. Follow up of this cohort would allow us to determine if this is the case. Future research could also investigate whether people with IBS could benefit from guidance from a dietitian around consumption of high lactose or fructose-containing foods.},

   abstract = {IBS is a debilitating condition that markedly affects quality of life. The chronic nature, high prevalence and associated comorbidities contribute to the considerable economic burden of IBS. The pathophysiology of IBS is not completely understood and evidence to guide management is variable. Interest in dietary intervention continues to grow rapidly. Ileostomy and MRI studies have demonstrated that some fermentable carbohydrates increase ileal luminal water content and breath hydrogen testing studies have demonstrated that some carbohydrates also increase colonic hydrogen production. The effects of fermentable carbohydrates on gastrointestinal symptoms have also been well described in blinded, controlled trials. Dietary restriction of fermentable carbohydrates (popularly termed the 'low FODMAP diet') has received considerable attention. An emerging body of research now demonstrates the efficacy of fermentable carbohydrate restriction in IBS; however, limitations still exist with this approach owing to a limited number of randomized trials, in part due to the fundamental difficulty of placebo control in dietary trials. Evidence also indicates that the diet can influence the gut microbiota and nutrient intake. Fermentable carbohydrate restriction in people with IBS is promising, but the effects on gastrointestinal health require further investigation.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Guanylate cyclase C (GC-C) is a transmembrane receptor that is expressed primarily on intestinal epithelial cells. Activation of this receptor by its endogenous peptide ligands initiates cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent (cGMP) salt and water movement in the intestine. GC-C is targeted by the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin STa, which deregulates this pathway and causes secretory diarrhea. This review discusses current work on the physiological function of GC-C in the intestine. RECENT FINDINGS: Familial GC-C mutations demonstrate that epithelial cGMP signaling is critical to electrolyte and fluid balance in the neonatal intestine. Chronic deregulation of GC-C activity in early life increases susceptibility to a number of disorders, including obstruction and inflammatory bowel disease. Murine models indicate that GC-C regulates the composition of intestinal commensal microflora and that it suppresses bacterial infection and modulates colonic injury and inflammation. Therapeutic GC-C ligands are used to successfully treat constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and recent studies show that extracellular cGMP is an important mechanism of reducing abdominal pain associated with this disorder. SUMMARY: Originally identified as a target of E. coli enterotoxin STa, GC-C is an important regulator of physiological salt and water homeostasis and may directly impact a wide range of intestinal disorders.},

Trials suggest probiotics may be beneficial. The aim of this study was to assess the symptomatic efficacy of Lactobacillus plantarum 299 v (L. plantarum 299 v) for the relief of abdominal pain in patients with IBS fulfilling Rome II criteria. METHODS: This study was conducted in a referral hospital. Trial participants were randomized to receive either two capsules of L. plantarum 299 v at a dosage of 5 x 10(9) cfu per capsule or placebo daily for 8 wk. Severity of abdominal pain was assessed using a visual analog scale at each visit and a quality-of-life IBS (QoL-IBS) questionnaire was also completed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in abdominal pain relief between the study and placebo groups (P = 0.800). There was also no difference in QoL- IBS scores between the groups (P = 0.687). Both groups had a significant improvement in abdominal pain scores over the study period, from an average of 251.55 to 197.90 (P < 0.0001) indicating a large placebo effect. CONCLUSION: An 8-wk treatment with L. plantarum 299 v did not provide symptomatic relief, particularly of abdominal pain and bloating, in patients fulfilling the Rome II criteria.},

They can be ingested through foods or supplements and their inclusion in these products is regulated in Canada by the Health Canada Health Products and Food Branch. The aim of this article is to summarize current evidence from randomized controlled trials and guidelines from Health Canada, the World Health Organization, and internationally recognized expert committees in the hope that it will help practitioners and professionals recommending probiotics to healthy and diseased patients, with a focus on the Canadian setting. From a general perspective, probiotics can be recommended for prevention of diseases that are associated to altered intestinal ecology. Specifically, they can be recommended for prevention of upper respiratory tract infections and pouchitis, for prevention and management of necrotizing enterocolitis, bacterial vaginosis and antibiotic associated diarrhea, including Clostridium difficile infection, and for treatment of atopic eczema in cow's milk allergy and of infectious diarrhea. Additional substantiated probiotic benefits include prevention of hypercholesterolemia, management of constipation, reduction of recurrent urinary tract infections, improvement of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, and reduction of antibiotics side effects in Helicobacter pylori eradication. Because probiotics are generally recognized as safe and can be removed with antimicrobial agents, their use should be considered in patients of all ages.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an intestinal functional disorder with the highest prevalence in the industrialized world. The intestinal microbiota (IM) plays a role in the pathogenesis of IBS and is not merely a consequence of this disorder. Previous research efforts have not revealed unequivocal microbiological signatures of IBS, and the experimental results are contradictory. The experimental methodologies adopted to investigate the complex intestinal ecosystem drastically impact the quality and significance of the results. Therefore, to consider the methodological aspects of the research on IM in IBS, we reviewed 29 relevant original research articles identified through a PubMed search using three combinations of keywords: "irritable bowel syndrome + microflora", "irritable bowel syndrome + microbiota" and "irritable bowel syndrome + microbiome". For each study, we reviewed the quality and significance of the scientific evidence obtained with respect to the experimental method adopted. The data obtained from each study were compared with all considered publications to identify potential inconsistencies and explain contradictory results. The analytical revision of the studies referenced in the present review has contributed to the identification of microbial groups whose relative abundance significantly alters IBS, suggesting that these microbial groups could be IM signatures for this syndrome. The identification of microbial biomarkers in the IM can be advantageous for the development of new diagnostic tools and novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of different subtypes of IBS.},

   abstract = {Despite high prevalence, the precise irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) pathophysiology remains poorly understood likely due to the heterogeneity of IBS populations and the multifactorial etiology of this disorder. Among risk factors, genetic predisposition and early life trauma have been reported. In this context, the debate on genetic or environmental influences in the IBS pathogenesis is still open. The study by van der Wijngaard et al., reporting for the first time that susceptibility to stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity in maternally separated rats can be transferred to the next generation without any further exposure of F2 individuals to maternal separation, supports the importance of environmental influence in the IBS phenotype. Epigenetic mechanisms such as hypermethylation in the promoter region of the glucocorticoid receptor gene mediating the long-term and transgenerational behavioral effects of maternal care on the development have been shown in some but not in all studies. Van der Wijngaard et al. incriminated maternal care in the transmitted susceptibility to stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity, but not changes in glucocorticoid receptor protein expression in the brain. This finding opens a broad field of future directions aimed at evaluating the mechanisms involved in the transmission across generations of the digestive features of IBS, including, for example, on the role of gut microbiota changes in vertical transmission or epigenetic modifications of intestinal mast cells and the junctional region of intestinal epithelial cells in vertical transfer.},

The problems in the acute phase concern food security and nutrition, while those in the subacute phase concern constipation and diarrhea. According to each disease site, the clinically important problems in the chronic phase are peptic ulcer and functional dyspepsia affecting the upper gastrointestinal tract, and inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome affecting the lower gastrointestinal tract. In addition, chronic hepatitis B and alcoholic liver diseases/pancreatitis are major hepatobiliary pancreatic diseases.},

   abstract = {Approximately half of the children with ulcerative colitis (UC) have refractory, relapsing or steroid-dependent disease. UC in children is more extensive than in adults, presents more often with severe attacks and carries a more aggressive disease course. Therefore, although a step-up approach is usually recommended in UC, aggressive therapy will often be indicated in children since steroid dependency should never be tolerated. It is vital to ensure that in every resistant case, the symptoms are truly related to the inflammatory disease activity and not to other conditions such as poor adherence to treatment, infections, adverse reactions to drugs, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, celiac disease and bacterial overgrowth. The clinician should be ready to escalate therapy in a timely manner but only after ensuring optimization of current treatments. Optimization may include, among others, appropriate dosage, utilization of assays that determine thiopurine, calcineurin inhibitors and anti-tumor necrosis factor levels, introduction of combination therapy when indicated (enemas and immunomodulators) and a long enough time for treatment to become effective. Colectomy is always a valid option and should be discussed before major treatment escalations. Experimental therapies can be considered when all else fails and the family prefers to avoid colectomy. The management of refractory and relapsing disease is particularly challenging in children, and this review summarizes the available evidence to guide treatment decisions in this setup.},

The pathophysiology of IBS is poorly understood, but the presence of psychosocial basis is now known. There is an increasing number of publications supporting the role of genetics in IBS. Most of the variations are found in genes associated with the brain-gut axis, revealing the strong correlation of brain-gut axis and IBS. miRNAs, which play critical roles in physiological processes, are not well studied in IBS. However, so far there is found an involvement of alterations in miRNA expression or sequence, in IBS symptoms. IBS phenotype is affected by epigenetic alteration and environment. Changes in DNA and histone methylation are observed in patients who suffered childhood trauma or abuse, resulting in altered gene expression, such as the glucocorticoid receptor gene. Finally, diet is another factor associated with IBS, which may contribute to symptom onset. Certain foods may affect on bacterial metabolism and epigenetic modifications, predisposing to IBS.},

Here, an overview of the associations between migraine and GI disorders is presented, as well as possible mechanistic links and clinical implications. People who regularly experience GI symptoms have a higher prevalence of headaches, with a stronger association with increasing headache frequency. Children with a mother with a history of migraine are more likely to have infantile colic. Children with migraine are more likely to have experienced infantile colic compared to controls. Several studies demonstrated significant associations between migraine and celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and IBS. Possible underlying mechanisms of migraine and GI diseases could be increased gut permeability and inflammation. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to investigate these mechanisms further in migraine patients. These mechanisms also give a rationale to investigate the effects of the use of pre- and probiotics in migraine patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal disturbances as a result of changes in eating patterns have been described in eating disorders. Many patients who experience irritable bowel syndrome report changes in eating patterns as a way to cope with their symptoms. Little is known about the consequences of these practices. The aim of this study was to explore whether repeated eating restriction (defined as not eating >/= 4 hours while hungry) is associated with motility disturbances. METHODS: Of 17 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, subjects were divided into those who habitually restrict their eating (n = 8) and those without eating restriction (n = 9) (age range 15-21, mean 19.2; 64.7% girls). Whole-gut transit time was measured by radiopaque markers, gastric sensitivity was measured by water load test (drinking max of 800 mL of water in 5 minutes or until full), and gastric dysrhythmias by an electrogastrogram. RESULTS: Restrictors drank less water (mean 464.4 mL) than nonrestrictors (mean 613 mL; P = 0.02). No difference was found in gastric dysrhythmias (62.5% vs 77.8%; P = 0.5). Whole-gut transit tended to be slower in the restrictors (mean 51.0 hours) than in nonrestrictors (mean 37.5 hours), but this was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Eating restriction appears to be associated with increased gastric sensation. More data are needed from larger studies to determine whether eating behaviors are associated with other motility disturbances.},

METHODS: The 74-item PedsQL GI Module and 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 584 patients and 682 parents. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (such as chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease). RESULTS: Fourteen unidimensional scales were derived measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood, diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. The PedsQL GI Module Scales evidenced excellent feasibility, excellent reliability for the Total Scale Scores (patient self-report alpha = 0.97, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.97), and good-to-excellent reliability for the 14 individual scales (patient self-report alpha = 0.67-0.94, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.77-0.95). Intercorrelations with the Generic Core Scales supported construct validity. Individual Symptoms Scales known-groups validity across 7 GI disorders was generally supported. Factor analysis supported the unidimensionality of the individual scales. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL GI Module Scales demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent measurement properties and may be used as common metrics to compare GI-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice both within and across patient groups for FGIDs and organic GI diseases.},

STUDY DESIGN: The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 689 families. Patients had 1 of 7 physician-diagnosed GI disorders: chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The healthy control sample included 1114 families. School days missed, days in bed and needing care, parent missed workdays, work impact, and healthcare utilization were compared as well. RESULTS: Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrated lower HRQOL than the healthy controls across all dimensions (physical, emotional, social, and school; P < .001 for all), with larger effect sizes for patients with an FGID. Patients with an FGID manifested lower HRQOL than those with an organic GI disease. Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease missed more school, spent more days in bed and needing care, had greater healthcare utilization, and had parents who missed more workdays with greater work impact (P < .001 for most), with larger effect sizes for the patients with an FGID. CONCLUSION: Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrate impaired HRQOL compared with healthy children. HRQOL can be used as a common metric to compare patient outcomes in clinical research and practice both within and across groups of patients with FGIDs and organic GI diseases.},

The GM changes parallel improvement of IBS state, suggesting a role of the fermented milk bacteria in gut homeostasis. Our data challenge the view that microbes ingested with food have little impact on the human GM functioning and rather provide support for beneficial health effects.},

Microbe:microbe and microbe:human interactions are important considerations as we select probiotics for pediatric patients in the future. Although our knowledge about the composition of the microbiome is progressing rapidly, many gaps exist about the functional capacity and metabolic machinery of the human microbiome. Based on a limited amount of data, probiotics appear capable of altering the composition and function of the microbiome. Probiotics may be part of dietary strategies that combine ways to enhance microbiome function with nutrients that may be converted to active compounds promoting human health. Probiotics have yielded beneficial effects in numerous studies in the context of different diseases in pediatric gastroenterology. These disease states include necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis, acute gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome. In the skin and airways, it is unclear if probiotics can affect the function of the microbiome to reduce the impact of diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. An enhanced understanding of the effects of probiotics on the microbiome should facilitate selection of optimal probiotic strains for specific diseases in the future.},

   abstract = {This study examined the incidence and correlates of functional gastrointestinal symptoms in children with anxiety disorders. Participants were 6-13 year old children diagnosed with one or more anxiety disorders (n = 54) and non-clinical control children (n = 51). Telephone diagnostic interviews were performed with parents to determine the presence and absence of anxiety disorders in children. Parents completed a questionnaire that elicited information about their child's gastrointestinal symptoms associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders in children, as specified by the paediatric Rome criteria (Caplan et al., Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition, 41, 296-304, 2005a). Parents and children also completed a symptom severity measure of anxiety. As expected, children with anxiety disorders were significantly more likely to have symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), compared to children without anxiety disorders. That is, 40.7 % of anxious children had symptoms of a FGID compared to 5.9 % of non-anxious control children. Children with anxiety disorders were significantly more likely to have symptoms of functional constipation, and showed a trend for a higher incidence of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms compared to non-anxious control children. Furthermore, higher anxiety symptom severity was characteristic of anxious children with symptoms of FGID, compared to anxious children without FGID symptoms and non-anxious control children. Also, children with anxiety disorders, regardless of FGID symptoms, were more likely to have a biological family member, particularly a parent or grandparent, with a gastrointestinal problem, compared to non-anxious control children. The high incidence of FGID symptoms in children with anxiety disorders warrants further research on whether gastrointestinal symptoms reduce following psychological treatments for childhood anxiety disorders, such as cognitive behavioural therapy.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem with each human individual hosting at least 160 different bacterial strains. Our understanding of its role is rapidly expanding as a result of the molecular microbiological techniques that can accurately characterise its composition and 'omics' technologies that measure its metabolic activity. Since 1995, extensive research has investigated the prebiotic concept, which describes how supplementation of some non-digestible oligosaccharides can stimulate the growth and/or activity of specific genera including bifidobacteria. However, the vast majority of studies are in healthy human subjects, with few undertaken in patients with disorders relevant to clinical nutrition. Marked alterations of the luminal microbiota have been demonstrated in patients with digestive disorders, highlighting mechanisms through which they might be involved in their pathogenesis, including higher clostridia in patients who develop diarrhoea during enteral nutrition and the influence of bifidobacteria on intestinal dendritic cell phenotype in Crohn's disease. The impact of prebiotics on the intestinal microbiota of healthy people has not been consistently replicated in patients with digestive disorders. For example, a number of studies show that inulin/oligofructose do not increase bifidobacteria in enteral nutrition and Crohn's disease. Indeed, in Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome there is evidence that some prebiotics in high doses worsen functional symptoms. Unlike healthy human subjects, patients experience a number of issues that may alter their gastrointestinal microbiota (disease, antibiotics and inflammation) and the use of microbiota modifying therapies, such as prebiotics, do not always elicit the same effects in patients as they do in healthy people.},

   abstract = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic idiopathic constipation are prevalent and burdensome gastrointestinal disorders. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence for probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in IBS and chronic idiopathic constipation has recently been performed. By far, the most convincing evidence was for the use of probiotics in IBS, which reported that overall probiotics reduced the risk of symptom persistence by 21%. However, only a minority of the trials were at a low risk of bias, and some used small sample sizes. Meta-analysis is a powerful tool to combine individual small trials to improve the power to detect the direction, size, and consistency of an effect, but it can do little to overcome the poor design of individual trials. Many debate the use of meta-analysis to combine data from different probiotic species, strains, or combinations. It is recommended that all future meta-analyses of probiotics, in any clinical setting, perform subgroup analysis on specific species/strains and specific combinations. It is hoped that the current meta-analysis will empower clinicians in making evidence-based decisions regarding whether probiotics should be recommended for IBS, which species/strain(s) to use, and for which symptoms.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is direct evidence that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves the gastrointestinal microbiota and some evidence that the microbiota might also play a similar role in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable. There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The complex genetic aetiology underlying irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) needs to be assessed in large-scale genetic studies. Two independent IBS cohorts were genotyped to assess whether genetic variability in immune, neuronal and barrier integrity genes is associated with IBS. DESIGN: 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering 270 genes were genotyped in an exploratory cohort (935 IBS patients, 639 controls). 33 SNPs with Puncorrected<0.05 were validated in an independent set of 497 patients and 887 controls. Genotype distributions of single SNPs were assessed using an additive genetic model in IBS and clinical subtypes, IBS-C and IBS-D, both in individual and combined cohorts. Trait anxiety (N=614 patients, 533 controls), lifetime depression (N=654 patients, 533 controls) and mRNA expression in rectal biopsies (N=22 patients, 29 controls) were correlated with SNP genotypes. RESULTS: Two SNPs associated independently in the exploratory and validation cohort: rs17837965-CDC42 with IBS-C (ORexploratory=1.59 (1.05 to 1.76); ORvalidation=1.76 (1.03 to 3.01)) and rs2349775-NXPH1 with IBS-D (ORexploratory=1.28 (1.06 to 1.56); ORvalidation=1.42 (1.08 to 1.88)). When combining both cohorts, the association of rs2349775 withstood post hoc correction for multiple testing in the IBS-D subgroup. Additionally, three SNPs in immune-related genes (rs1464510-LPP, rs1881457-IL13, rs2104286-IL2RA), one SNP in a neuronal gene (rs2349775-NXPH1) and two SNPs in epithelial genes (rs245051-SLC26A2, rs17837965-CDC42) were weakly associated with total-IBS (Puncorrected<0.05). At the functional level, rs1881457 increased IL13 mRNA levels, whereas anxiety and depression scores did not correlate with rs2349775-NXPH1. CONCLUSIONS: Rs2349775 (NXPH1) and rs17837965 (CDC42) were associated with IBS-D and IBS-C, respectively, in two independent cohorts. Further studies are warranted to validate our findings and to determine the mechanisms underlying IBS pathophysiology.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intraoperative blood salvage (IBS) procedures include washing with normal saline (NS), which may deplete red blood cell (RBC) nutrients. The mannitol-adenine-phosphate (MAP) solution, commonly used for RBC preservation, provides glycolytic substrates; therefore, MAP should be a better solution than NS in IBS. In this study, we determined whether using MAP could reduce washing-associated RBC damage and destruction. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Adenine nucleotide contents, RBC morphology, and plasma free hemoglobin (PF-Hb) level of RBCs treated with NS or MAP solution were compared under three conditions: (1) 4-hour preservation of fresh blood from healthy volunteers, (2) collection from the shed blood of patients, and 3) incubation of the collected shed blood with plasma. RESULTS: Adenine nucleotide level and RBC elongation index were greater and PF-Hb level was lower in MAP groups than NS groups (p < 0.05) after preservation and incubation. In NS, RBCs lost their deformability and became stomatocytes, and even RBC "ghosts" 48 hours after incubation, while they remained normal in MAP solution. CONCLUSION: The MAP solution helps preserve RBC morphology and function, and reduces hemolysis, possibly due to improved energy production. Therefore, MAP should replace NS during IBS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sorbitol and mannitol are naturally-occurring polyol isomers. Although poor absorption and induction of gastrointestinal symptoms by sorbitol are known, the properties of mannitol are poorly described. We aimed to expand data on food composition of these polyols, and to compare their absorptive capacities and symptom induction in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and healthy individuals. METHODS: Food samples were analysed for sorbitol and mannitol content. The degree of absorption measured by breath hydrogen production and gastrointestinal symptoms (visual analogue scales) was evaluated in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 21 healthy and 20 IBS subjects after challenges with 10 g of sorbitol, mannitol or glucose. RESULTS: Certain fruits and sugar-free gum contained sorbitol, whereas mannitol content was higher in certain vegetables. Similar proportions of patients with IBS (40%) and healthy subjects (33%) completely absorbed sorbitol, although more so with IBS absorbed mannitol (80% versus 43%; P = 0.02). Breath hydrogen production was similar in both groups after lactulose but was reduced in patients with IBS after both polyols. No difference in mean (SEM) hydrogen production was found in healthy controls after sorbitol [area-under-the-curve: 2766 (591) ppm 4 h(-1) ] or mannitol [2062 (468) ppm 4 h(-1) ] but, in patients with IBS, this was greater after sorbitol [1136 (204) ppm 4 h(-1) ] than mannitol [404 (154) ppm 4 h(-1) ; P = 0.002]. Overall gastrointestinal symptoms increased significantly after both polyols in patients with IBS only, although they were independent of malabsorption of either of the polyols. CONCLUSIONS: Increased and discordant absorption of mannitol and sorbitol occurs in patients with IBS compared to that in healthy controls. Polyols induced gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS independently of their absorptive patterns, suggesting that the dietary restriction of polyols may be efficacious.},

Gastrointestinal manifestations in EDS have been described but their frequency, nature and impact are poorly known. We aimed to assess digestive features in a national cohort of EDS patients. METHODS: A questionnaire has been sent to 212 EDS patients through the French patient support group, all of which had been formally diagnosed according to the Villefranche criteria. The questionnaire included questions about digestive functional symptoms, the GIQLI (Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index), KESS scoring system and the Rome III criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 135 patients (64% response rate) completed the questionnaire and 134 were analyzable (123 women; 91%). Mean age and Body Mass Index were respectively 35+/-14.7 years and 24.3+/-6.1 kg/m(2). The most common EDS subtype was hypermobility form (n=108; 80.6%). GIQLI and KESS median values were respectively 63.5 (27-117) and 19 [13.5-22]. Eighty four percent of patients had functional bowel disorders (FBD) according to the Rome III criteria. An irritable bowel syndrome according to the same criteria was observed in 64 patients (48%) and 48 patients (36%) reported functional constipation. A gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) was reported in 90 patients (68.7%), significantly associated with a poorer GIQLI (60.5+/-16.8 versus 75.9+/-20.3; p<0.0001). GIQLI was also negatively impacted by the presence of an irritable bowel syndrome or functional constipation (p=0.007). There was a significant correlation between FBD and GERD. CONCLUSIONS: Natural frequency of gastrointestinal manifestations in EDS seems higher than previously assessed. FBD and GERD are very common in our study population, the largest ever published until now. Their impact is herein shown to be important. A systematic clinical assessment of digestive features should be recommended in EDS.},
