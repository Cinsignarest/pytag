   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Corticoid administration is the usual treatment of Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) attacks. However, information available on response rates and their predictive factors is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To establish response to steroidal treatment in an homogeneous group of patients with CD or UC during their first admission to hospital. METHODS: Restrospective analysis of 86 patients who received systemic steroidal treatment for a severe flare-up during their first hospital admission between 1995 and 2000. Patients were treated per protocol with fluid therapy, absolute diet, IV 6-methyl-prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day, and enoxaparin at prophylactic doses. Clinical response at 30 days was considered good in case of complete remission, and poor in case of partial or absent remission. Univariate and multivariate analyses according to non-parametric statistics were performed for sociodemographic and biologic variables. RESULTS: 45 patients with CD and 41 with UC were included. Good response rates were 64.4% for CD and 60.9% for UC. The univariate analysis showed that patients with good response have shorter evolution times and fewer previous flare-ups (p < 0.05) regarding CD. However, the multivariate analysis showed that none of the analyzed variables had predictive value. CONCLUSION: The response rate of severe inflammatory bowel disease attacks to corticoids is around 60% in CD and UC. Data resulting from the current study cannot predict which patients will ultimately respond to therapy.},

   abstract = {The abundance of the oligopeptide transporter (Pept-1) in the brush-border membrane of the intestinal epithelium is the central mechanism for regulation of transport of products of protein digestion (dipeptides and tripeptides) and peptidomimetic drugs (for example, beta-lactam antibiotics). Within the past few years, there has been substantial progress in identifying the factors controlling this regulation and the mechanisms of their actions. The purpose of this report is to review this progress. The studies of individual substrates and hormones in a human intestinal cell line (Caco-2) have shown that dipeptides, certain amino acids, insulin, and leptin increase and epidermal growth factor and triiodothyronine decrease the membrane population of Pept-1. In the case of dipeptides, epidermal growth factor, and thyroid hormone, there are parallel changes in the gene expression brought about by alteration of transcription and/or stability of Pept-1 mRNA. In contrast, the treatment with insulin and leptin does not induce any alteration in the Pept-1 gene expression, and the mechanism of increased protein expression appears to be increased trafficking from a preformed cytoplasmic pool to the apical membrane. In vivo studies in rats have shown modulation of protein and gene expressions of the intestinal oligopeptide transporter during the day and during development and in nutritional and metabolic alterations, such as high-protein diet, fasting, and diabetes. Patients with intestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and short-bowel syndrome, may have induction of the Pept-1 expression in their colon. Finally, pharmacological studies have shown that the expression of Pept-1 can be upregulated by agents such as 5 fluorouracil and downregulated by agents such as cyclosporine. In conclusion, the above studies have produced a wealth of new information on regulation of a key transporter in the intestine. This information may have useful applications in nutritional and pharmacological treatments, for example, in diabetic patients needing enteral nutrition or in ulcerative colitis patients needing the suppression of the intestinal inflammation.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic debilitating disorder affecting a child's physical and emotional well-being. Recent emphasis on 'quality of life' (QOL) has led to re-evaluation of available medical treatments. AIM: To assess prospectively change in QOL, clinical disease activity and intestinal mucosal inflammation in active paediatric Crohn's disease after treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition. In addition, we evaluated whether change in QOL could predict changes in paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) and mucosal inflammation (endoscopic and histologic). METHODS: The IMPACT II questionnaire was used prospectively and longitudinally in 26 consecutively recruited children [16 males (67%), median 14 years, s.d. = 1.7 years] with active Crohn's disease (PCDAI > 20). They were treated with a new polymeric enteral feed (ACD004, Nestle) for a period of 8 weeks. All had PCDAI, QOL and endoscopic assessment at the time of diagnosis and after 8 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 26 children achieved a clinical remission at 8 weeks, with improvement in the QOL scores (P < 0.05). The change in QOL score after treatment was predictive of achieving a clinical remission, but not of histological improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Although children may find dietary restrictions difficult, this study confirms a clear improvement in QOL after treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition. However, improvement in QOL scores is not reflected by improvement in mucosal inflammation. Whilst improving QOL remains a core principal in patient management, the long-term consequences of ongoing mucosal inflammation must be better understood before relying only on short-term QOL measures to dictate treatment choices.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of unknown etiology. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that dietary fatty acids, linoleic acid (LA) and oleic acid (OA), could be involved in the inflammatory response through stimulation of the neutrophil chemokine, IL-8. METHODS: Human intestinal smooth muscle (HISM) cells were isolated from normal patients and patients with Crohn's disease and cultured for 24h with LA or OA in the presence or absence of oxidative stress. The concentrations of IL-8 were measured in the media and cellular oxidative stress was quantitated by measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs). RESULTS: Spontaneous production of IL-8 was significantly higher in HISM cells isolated from Crohn's bowel compared to control bowel. LA caused a marked, nine-fold, increase in IL-8 secretion by Crohn's cells, an effect that could be simulated in normal HISM cells by co-incubation of LA with an oxidizing solution (Ox) composed of hypoxanthine+xanthine oxidase+FeSO(4) (OxLA). These effects were inhibited by vitamins C and E. Treatment of Crohn's cells with OxLA did not further increase IL-8 over that of LA alone. The effect of LA alone was not associated with an increase in cellular oxidative stress as quantitated by TBARSs. In contrast to the results with LA, treatment with OA or OxOA did not increase IL-8 in either normal or Crohn's cells. In addition, OA protected Crohn's cells from the increase in TBARSs induced by Ox. In contrast to IL-8, spontaneous production of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) was significantly lower in Crohn's HISM cells as compared to normal cells and exposure to OxLA did not increase its production. CONCLUSIONS: LA, but not OA, increased the production of IL-8 by HISM cells. These results suggest that replacement of LA by OA in the diet of Crohn's patients and increased intake of a diet rich in antioxidants could be beneficial in decreasing inflammatory activity in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {Previously we reported that linoleic acid (LA), but not oleic acid, caused a marked increase in the secretion of IL-8 by Crohn's human intestinal smooth muscle (HISM) cells. Antioxidants inhibited this response, implicating a role for oxidative stress and NF-kappaB, a transcription factor for IL-8 that is activated by oxidative stress. In this study, we examined two mechanisms whereby LA, the dietary precursor for arachidonic acid (AA), could increase the production of IL-8 via activation of AA pathways: 1) by generation of reactive oxygen species by the AA-pathway enzymes to activate NF-kappaB or 2) by AA metabolites. Normal and Crohn's HISM cells were exposed to LA, oxidizing solution (Ox), or oxidizing solution enriched with LA (OxLA). Exposure of cells to Ox or OxLA induced oxidative stress as determined by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. In normal cells, Ox but not LA activated NF-kappaB as determined by transfection experiments and Western blot. In Crohn's cells, NF-kappaB was spontaneously activated and was not further activated by Ox or LA. In contrast, TNF-alpha markedly increased activation of NF-kappaB in both normal and Crohn's cells. These results indicated that LA did not increase IL-8 by activating NF-kappaB, so we evaluated the second mechanism of an effect of AA metabolites. In normal cells, OxLA, but not LA, markedly stimulated IL-8, whereas in Crohn's cells, both OxLA and LA stimulated IL-8. OxLA, also stimulated production of AA metabolites leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), PGE(2), and thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) by normal and Crohn's cells. To determine whether AA metabolites mediated the IL-8 response, cells were treated with OxLA plus indomethacin (Indo), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor. Both Indo and NDGA blocked the IL-8 response to OxLA. To determine more specifically a role for AA metabolites, AA was used. Similar to OxLA, OxAA stimulated production of IL-8 and AA metabolites. Pinane thromboxane, a selective thromboxane synthase inhibitor and receptor blocker, inhibited OxAA stimulation of TXB(2) and IL-8 in a dose-response manner. MK886, a selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, inhibited OxAA stimulation of LTB(4) and IL-8 also in a dose-response manner. Analysis of specific gene products by RT-PCR demonstrated that HISM cells expressed receptors for both thromboxane and LTB(4). We conclude that AA metabolites mediated the IL-8 response to LA in HISM cells. Both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways were involved. LA did not increase IL-8 by activating NF-kappaB, but NF-kappaB appeared to be involved, because LA increased IL-8 only in situations where NF-kappaB was activated, either spontaneously in Crohn's cells or by Ox in normal cells. We speculate that AA metabolites increased IL-8 production by enhancing NF-kappaB-dependent transcription of IL-8.},

In the present study, we investigated the effects of the free radical scavenger edaravone, which is used clinically as an anti-stroke agent, in the development of experimental dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats. The rats were fed 4% (w/w of diet) DSS in standard powder chow for 8 days. The edaravone and vehicle saline were injected subcutaneously twice a day. After the experimental period, the wet colonic weight, macroscopic mucosal damaged area, histological damage score, mucosal myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, mucosal tissue lipid peroxidate and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured. In the DSS-induced colitis model, edaravone treatment (1-20 mg/kg day) significantly reduced the wet colonic weight, macroscopic damaged area, and the histological damage score. Edaravone treatment also reduced mucosal MPO activity, mucosal tissue lipid peroxidate level and serum IL-6 level. In particular, edaravone at a dose of 20 mg/kg day significantly reduced mucosal MPO activity and serum IL-6 level. These results strongly support the involvement of ROS in the pathogenesis of DSS-induced colitis. A clinical effect for edaravone against IBD patients is strongly expected.},

This study tested the hypothesis that dysregulated intestinal mucosal immunity with enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production is present in these ASD children. Comparison was made with developmentally normal children with, and without, mucosal inflammation. Duodenal and colonic biopsies were obtained from 21 ASD children, and 65 developmentally normal paediatric controls, of which 38 had signs of histological inflammation. Detection of CD3+ lymphocyte staining for spontaneous intracellular TNFalpha, IL-2, IL-4, IFNgamma, and IL-10, was performed by multicolor flow cytometry. Duodenal and colonic mucosal CD3+ lymphocyte counts were elevated in ASD children compared with noninflamed controls (p<0.03). In the duodenum, the proportion of lamina propria (LP) and epithelial CD3(+)TNFalpha+ cells in ASD children was significantly greater compared with noninflamed controls (p<0.002) but not coeliac disease controls. In addition, LP and epithelial CD3(+)IL-2+ and CD3(+)IFNgamma+, and epithelial CD3(+)IL-4+ cells were more numerous in ASD children than in noninflamed controls (p<0.04). In contrast, CD3(+)IL-10+ cells were fewer in ASD children than in noninflamed controls (p<0.05). In the colon, LP CD3(+)TNFalpha+ and CD3(+)IFNgamma+ were more frequent in ASD children than in noninflamed controls (p<0.01). In contrast with Crohn's disease and non-Crohn's colitis, LP and epithelial CD3(+)IL-10+ cells were fewer in ASD children than in nondisease controls (p<0.01). There was a significantly greater proportion of CD3(+)TNFalpha+ cells in colonic mucosa in those ASD children who had no dietary exclusion compared with those on a gluten and/or casein free diet (p<0.05). There is a consistent profile of CD3+ lymphocyte cytokines in the small and large intestinal mucosa of these ASD children, involving increased pro-inflammatory and decreased regulatory activities. The data provide further evidence of a diffuse mucosal immunopathology in some ASD children and the potential for benefit of dietary and immunomodulatory therapies.},

We have designed the first randomized, controlled trial for elemental diets containing different fat percentages in patients with active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Each patient was randomized to receive one of three dose levels of fat in an elemental diet (Elental) for 4 weeks: 10 patients received low fat (3.06 g/day), 10 patients received medium fat (16.56 g/day) and eight patients received high fat (30.06 g/day). The additional fat was composed of long-chain fatty acids. All patients were evaluated using the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease rating, plus C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which were measured at weekly intervals. RESULTS: Although the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease rating, C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the low-fat group decreased, the values in the medium- and high-fat groups fluctuated during the study. The remission rate after 4 weeks in each group was 80%, 40% and 25% for patients in the low-, medium- and high-fat groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When the fat consisted of long-chain triglycerides, a high amount of this fat in the elemental diet formula decreased its therapeutic effect against active Crohn's disease.},

METHODS: From 1998 to 2001, 24 consecutive patients with isolated Crohn's terminal ileitis treated by laparoscopic ileocecal resection (laparoscopy group) were compared with 32 patients matched for age, gender, duration of disease, preoperative steroid treatment, fistulizing disease, and associated surgical procedure, and treated by open resection (open group). RESULTS: In the laparoscopy group, four procedures (17%) were converted. There were no deaths. The morbidity rate was 20% in the laparoscopy group and 10% in the open group (NS). There was no significant difference between the two groups in operating time, size of bowel resection and resection margin, postoperative morphine requirement, resumption of intestinal function, tolerance of solid diet, or length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic ileocecal resection in CD is safe and effective, even for fistulizing disease. There are no significant differences between laparoscopic and open ileocecal resection, especially in terms of the mortality and mortality rates. Consequently, because laparoscopic surgery seems to offer cosmetic advantages, it should be considered the procedure of choice for patients with ileocecal CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rheumatic joint pain is a common extra-intestinal complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because the high ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids (FAs) of the Western diet might promote rheumatic disorders, we sought to compare the effects of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil and n-6-rich soy oil on IBD-related joint pain. METHODS: Nineteen patients with IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 9 had Crohn disease and 10 had ulcerative colitis. Ten millilitres seal oil (n = 10) or soy oil (n = 9) was self-administered through a nasoduodenal feeding tube 3 times daily for 10 days. RESULTS: Compared with soy oil treatment, seal oil significantly reduced the duration of morning stiffness (P = 0.024), number of tender joints (P = 0.035), intensity of pain (P = 0.025) and the doctor's scoring of rheumatic disease activity (P = 0.025) at the end of the 10-day treatment period. Analysis of the effects as area under the curve (area between the curve and baseline, zero) for the entire period from start of treatment until 6 months' post-treatment suggested a long-lasting beneficial effect of seal oil administration on joint pain, whereas soy oil tended (not significantly) to aggravate the condition. Consistently, the serum ratios of n-6 to n-3 FAs (P < 0.01) and arachidonic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid (P < 0.01) were reduced after treatment with seal oil. CONCLUSION: The results suggest distinctive, differential prolonged effects on IBD-related joint pain of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil (significant improvement) and n-6-rich soy oil (tendency to exacerbation).},

A detailed literature review (from 1950 through February 2004) of English-language articles was undertaken to find articles showing a relationship between probiotic use and medical conditions. Medical conditions that have been reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive, hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary tract infections, and others. The use of probiotics should be further investigated for possible benefits and side-effects in patients affected by these medical conditions.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article describes the clinical papers published in 2002 and early 2003 on nutritional and metabolic derangement in inflammatory bowel disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Insulin-like growth factor 1 and Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 are decreased in inflammatory bowel disease, and disease therapy hardly reverses this situation. There are promising data on recombinant human growth hormone therapy in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Several papers have added some fuel to the debate on the prevalence and pathogenesis of metabolic bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease. Articles have been published investigating the role of dietary fat in the therapeutic action of enteral feeding in Crohn's disease. Low-fat diets are particularly useful, and adding medium-chain triglycerides does not impair the effectiveness of these diets. Balanced amounts of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat should probably be used. Relevant contributions on the usefulness of probiotic preparations (VSL#3) in the treatment and prevention of pouchitis have been published. Other papers deal with the effects of medical and surgical therapy on body composition and metabolism in the inflammatory bowel disease, the treatment of oxidative stress of these patients, and the possible role of some vitamin deficiencies on thrombotic risk in the condition. SUMMARY: Inflammatory bowel disease therapy hardly reverses growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor 1 disturbances of patients. The role of inflammation and steroid therapy of metabolic bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease is still controversial. Low-fat diets, with added amounts of medium-chain triglycerides, are useful in decreasing gut inflammation in the condition. The search for the optimal dietary fatty acid composition deserves further investigations. The use of probiotics and prebiotics opens new therapeutic perspectives for the disease.},

   abstract = {In the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that affect dogs and cats there appears to be dysregulation of normal mucosal immunity, characterised by polyclonal lymphocytic infiltrates which are presumably specific for luminal antigens. There is an absence of a classical polarisation of either T-helper (Th) 1 or Th2 cytokine responses, although increased expression of mRNA for interleukin (IL) 2 and IL-12p40 and a shift towards mucosal immunoglobulin (Ig) G production are consistent findings, whilst variable responses are seen in tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Increased mucosal permeability and deranged intestinal motility are common sequelae. Despite obvious similarities with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in humans, important differences exist. Of these, the diffuse superficial nature but with no Th1 or Th2 bias, and the prevalence of proximal small intestinal disease are notable. Potential hypotheses for these disparities include specific differences in the types or locations of agonistic gut flora, diffuse abnormalities in microbial-host interactions, a greater importance of diet, or anatomical or cellular differences in mucosal immune responses. Although specific pathogens and genetic susceptibilities may be involved, quantitative or qualitative changes in the normal flora or abnormal responses to a normal flora are more likely to be involved in the immunopathogenesis. Dietary influences include a large source of antigen, promotion of abnormal microbial growth through Maillard compounds within canned diets, and specific macro- and micronutrient deficiencies. Although dependent on a histopathological diagnosis, limitations of biopsies procured endoscopically, lack of histopathological standardisation and difficulty distinguishing inflammation from neoplasia remain significant problems. Clinician-pathologist dialogue, immunohistochemistry, cytokine profiling and lymphocyte clonality assessment may lead to more accurate diagnoses, a deeper understanding of the immunopathogenesis, and ultimately to new therapies or prevention of disease induction.},

   abstract = {The incidence and prevalence of Crohn's disease (CD) among children in developed countries is extremely high. Although, dietary factors have long been implicated, to date no single causative element has been identified. Risks or benefits for CD from dietary elements would depend on their appropriate metabolism within the gut by xenobiotic metabolising enzymes (XME). The metabolising capacity among individuals differs and is determined by the level and/or activity of the specific XME. As the latter is the function of the DNA variants that code them, we propose that certain individuals exposed to dietary elements are likely to be more or less susceptible for CD. We highlight this hypothesis by describing gene-environment interaction (GxE) mechanisms that could determine susceptibility for CD. We suggest that investigating these mechanisms will be paramount for the appropriate identification of susceptible populations, such that preventive and/or therapeutic interventions could be adequately targeted.},

   abstract = {Environmental factors are essential components of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and primarily responsible for its growing incidence around the globe. Epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence support an association between IBD and a large number of seemingly unrelated environmental factors, which include smoking, diet, drugs, geographical and social status, stress, microbial agents, intestinal permeability and appendectomy. Data supporting the involvement of each of these factors in predisposing to, triggering, or modulating the course or outcome of IBD vary from strong to tenuous. Smoking and the enteric bacterial flora are the ones for which the most solid evidence is currently available. Smoking increases the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and worsens its clinical course, but has a protective effect in ulcerative colitis (UC). Presence of enteric bacteria is indispensable to develop gut inflammation in most animal models of IBD, and modulation of the quantity or quality of the flora can be beneficial in patients with IBD. Surprisingly, evidence for a major role of the diet in inducing or modifying IBD is limited, while that for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is more convincing than for oral contraceptives. Northern geographic location, and a high social, economical, educational or occupational status increase the risk of IBD, an observation fitting the hygiene hypothesis for allergic and autoimmune diseases. Stress is also associated with IBD, but more as a modifier than an inducing factor, and its contribution is more obvious in IBD animal models than human IBD. Finally, an increased intestinal permeability may increase the risk for developing CD, whereas an appendectomy lowers the risk of developing UC.},

The neurology of coeliac disease includes disorders of the central nervous system encompassing cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, myoclonus, dementia and multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Peripheral neuropathies, of axonal and demyelinating types, and myopathies have also been reported. The pathomechanisms are more related to immunological-inflammatory processes than to a malresorptive vitamin deficiencies. While CNS symptoms of coeliac disease show a poor response to gluten restriction, peripheral symptoms may respond to elimination of gluten from the diet. There are few reports of a successful corticosteroid treatment in patients showing inflammatory findings in the CSF or bioptic material. Whipple's disease is caused by the gram-positive bacillus Tropheryma whipplei. Patients with a central nervous system manifestation of Whipple's disease may develop a variety of symptoms including dementia, supranuclear gaze palsy, movement disorders, hypothalamic dysfunction and myorhythmia. The CNS-infection is diagnosed by PCR of the CSF. Long-term antibiotic treatment is required, and relapses may occur after withdrawal of antimicrobial therapy. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are complicated by various forms of polyneuropathies, and arterial and venous cerebrovascular diseases. In most cases with neurological complications of inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases an immune mediated inflammatory process is suspected to be the underlying pathomechanism.},

METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of the group of 14 patients, operated on in the period of 2/1997 to 2/2003. RESULTS: In the group of 7 women and 7 men, laparoscopy was used for ileocecal resection in six cases (43%), resection of ileotransversoanastomosis in four cases (29%) and abdominal-peritoneal amputation of rectum once (7%). The surgical intervention lasted 125 min on the average. The post-operation complications were not recorded and the conversion was not necessary. The post-operation course was complicated by suppuration three times in laparotomy (21%) and once by paralytic ileus (7%), which required one reoperation. The peristaltics was resumed in the 2nd post-operation day on the average, when the patients began to refuse analgesics. The patients started to accept the liquid diet in the 3rd post-operation day on the average and stools appeared on the day 4 after the surgery. The median of post-operation hospitalization in cases of uncomplicated course was 8 days on the average. No patient was lost. CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic surgery represents a safe alternative in the therapy of Crohn's disease, being associated with a more favorable post-operation course and a better cosmetic effect in this group of patients with lower age average.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of osteopenia among patients with Crohn's disease (CD). There is some evidence that a deficiency of certain bone-active nutrients (including vitamins K and D) may have a partial role in this bone loss. AIMS: To compare the intake and the status of vitamin K in CD patients, currently in remission, with age- and sex-matched controls, and furthermore to investigate the relationship between vitamin K status and bone turnover in these patients. SUBJECTS: CD patients (n = 44; mean age: 36.9 yr) and matched controls (n = 44) were recruited from the Cork University Hospital and Cork City area, respectively. METHODS: Bloods were analyzed for the total and undercarboxylated (Glu)-osteocalcin and urine analyzed for cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx). Vitamin K(1) intake was estimated by food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Vitamin K(1) intake in CD patients tended to be lower than that of controls (mean (SD), 117 (82) vs 148 (80) mug/d, respectively; p= 0.059). Glu and NTx concentrations in CD patients were higher than controls (mean (SD), 5.1 (3.1) vs 3.9 (2.1) ng/ml, respectively; p= 0.03 for Glu; and 49 (41) vs 25.8 (19.5) nM BCE/mM creatinine, respectively; p= 0.001 for NTx). In CD patients, Glu was significantly correlated with NTx (r= 0.488; p < 0.001), even after controlling for age, gender, vitamin D status, calcium intake, and corticosteroid use. CONCLUSION: Vitamin K status of CD patients was lower than that of the healthy controls. Furthermore, the rate of bone resorption in the CD was inversely correlated with vitamin K status, suggesting that it might be another etiological factor for CD-related osteopenia.},

The aim of this review is to critically assess the results from the different observational studies that have investigated these hypotheses, and also to propose research agendas that should be pursued in the future. The conclusion is that infectious exposures and early bacterial colonization, which are associated with better hygiene early in life and that influence immune function, and possibly oral contraceptives, remain the only exposures of interest for future research into the aetiology of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anaemia is a frequent complication of Crohn disease. Treatment with ferrous iron (Fe2-) compounds is often unsatisfactory and is associated with gastrointestinal side effects. Theoretically, oral iron supplementation may even be harmful, because iron may reinforce intestinal inflammation by catalysing production of reactive oxygen species. We investigated the effect of ferrous iron on disease activity and plasma antioxidant status in patients with active Crohn disease. METHODS: Ten patients with Crohn disease and iron deficiency and 10 healthy controls were given ferrous fumarate 120 mg for 7 days. The Crohn Disease Activity Index, gastrointestinal complaints and blood samples for antioxidant status, anaemia, inflammation and iron absorption were investigated on day 1 and day 8. RESULTS: During 1 week of ferrous fumarate supplementation, the Crohn Disease Activity Index tended to increase (P = 0.071). Patients experienced aggravation of diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea. Plasma-reduced cysteine was lower (P = 0.038) in patients than it was in controls. One week of ferrous iron supplementation further decreased reduced cysteine (P < 0.001) and significantly decreased plasma-reduced glutathione (P = 0.004) in the patients. Serum iron increased significantly in patients after an oral iron load test (from 5.8 +/- 3.2 micromol/L to 30.9 +/- 13.1 micromol/L). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of iron deficiency with ferrous fumarate deteriorated plasma antioxidant status and increased specific clinical symptoms in patients with active Crohn disease. Plasma reduced cysteine may be a sensitive indicator for oxidative stress in the intestine.},

   abstract = {The physician treating children with inflammatory bowel disease is confronted with a number of specific problems, one of them being the lack of randomized, controlled drug trials in children. In this review, the role of nutritional therapy is discussed with a focus on primary treatment, especially for children with Crohn's disease. Then, the available medical therapies are highlighted, reviewing the evidence of effectiveness and side effects in children, as compared with what is known in adults. Nutritional therapy has proven to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn's disease while promoting linear growth. Conventional treatment consists of aminosalicylates and corticosteroids, whereas the early introduction of immunosuppressives (such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) is advocated as maintenance treatment. If these drugs are not tolerated or are ineffective, methotrexate may serve as an alternative in Crohn's disease. Cyclosporine is an effective rescue therapy in severe ulcerative colitis, but only will postpone surgery. A novel strategy to treat Crohn's disease is offered by infliximab, a monoclonal antibody to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Based on the best-available evidence, suggested usage is provided for separate drugs with respect to dosage and monitoring of side effects in children.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: During the last years laparoscopic surgical procedures are used more frequently in benign bowel diseases like Crohn's disease. We are reporting early results of laparoscopic procedures in Crohn's disease at our hospital. PATIENTS AND METHOD: From 1994 to 2003 54 patients (20 male and 34 female) underwent laparoscopic colonic and small bowel surgery in Crohn's disease. The mean age was 32 years (range: 16 to 55 years). RESULTS: Complications occurred in 6 patients (11.1 %). 3 patients needed a laparotomy. One computed tomography puncture was performed due to a hematoma. The remaining patients are treated successfully non-operatively. No patient died during the perioperative period. The mean operating time was 152 minutes (range 35 to 360 minutes) and the mean postoperative stay in hospital was 10 days (range 6-35 days). 0.2 blood cell concentrates were needed per operation (range 0 to 6), on average. The patients needed no analgesics after the 5 (th) day (range 1 to 13 days), got liquid diet on the 2 (nd) (range 0 to 6 days) and solid diet on the 3 (rd) day after surgery (range 1 to 14 days). DISCUSSION: Laparoscopic surgery in Crohns disease is safe when performed by an experienced surgeon. The laparoscopic procedure results in a better cosmetic result, while the longer operating time is the mean disadvantage. There are low complication rates during the early postoperative period.},

Growth retardation, osteopenia and thromboembolic phenomena are some of the inflammatory bowel disease complications in which nutritional deficits are involved. Moreover, nutrients can play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease and, in some cases, can be a primary therapeutic tool. Enteral nutrition has proven to play a therapeutic role in Crohn's disease. The nutrient(s) responsible for this effect are not well identified but dietary fat appears to be a major factor. In ulcerative colitis, unabsorbable carbohydrates can modulate the intestinal microbial environment, thus contributing to improve colonic inflammation.},

   abstract = {Nutrients may be involved in the modulation of the immune response through at least three different mechanisms. First, the intestinal ecosystem plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, triggering the uncontrolled inflammatory response in genetically predisposed individuals. Nutrients, together with bacteria, are major components of, and can therefore influence, the intestinal environment. Second, as components of cell membranes, nutrients can mediate the expression of proteins involved in the immune response, such as cytokines, adhesion molecules and nitric oxide synthase. The composition of lipids in the cell membrane is modified by dietary changes and can influence cellular responses. Indeed, various epidemiological, experimental and clinical data suggest that the immune response may be sensitive to changes in dietary composition. Finally, suboptimal levels of micronutrients are often found in both children and adults with inflammatory bowel disease, although, with the exception of iron and folate, it is unusual to discover symptoms attributable to these deficits. However, subclinical deficits may have a pathophysiological significance, as they may favour the self-perpetuation of the disease (due to defects in the mechanisms of tissue repair), cause defective defence against damage produced by oxygen free radicals and facilitate lipid peroxidation. These events can occur even in clinically inactive or mildly active disease, as well as in the development of dysplasia in the intestinal mucosa. Some dietary manipulations have been attempted as primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and specially formulated diets for enteral nutrition have proved to be an effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Most trials, although lacking sufficient patient numbers, have demonstrated a role for dietary manipulation as primary therapy for inflammatory disease. Dietary lipids are one of the most active nutritional substrates modulating the immune response. Recently, it has been demonstrated that lipids may be a key factor explaining the therapeutic effect of clinical nutrition in Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the short bowel syndromes (SBS) it is often difficult to grant a correct and sufficient alimentary supply only by ordinary natural nutrition. In the present research, we will study the prospective possibilities of integrating the nutritional supply making resort to artificial nutrition techniques in patients with SBS. METHODS: We have treated 7 patients with SBS, 6 males and 1 female, whose age was ranging from 29 and 70 years. They all underwent wide intestinal resection, 2 of them for massive infarct, 4 for Crohn's disease, 1 for bowel volvolus. An evaluation of nutritional and immunological conditions was performed on all of them, determining: albumin, transferrin, C-reactive protein, prealbumin, leukocyte count, skin test. In a second time, a protocol was implemented, based on total parenteral nutrition for the first 5 days, with scalar calorie supply up to a total of 35 kcal/kg/die; on day 6 after the operation, the parenteral caloric supply was reduced of 500 kcal/die, being compensated by the introduction of an equal caloric ration by nasointestinal tube with peristaltic pump having a flow of 20 mL/h. In the following days, the parenteral caloric supply was reduced of 500 cal each 48 hours, being substituted with an equal enteral supply in order to progressively reach a complete abandonment of parenteral nutrition. RESULTS: All the patients have a follow-up of 2 to 5 years; today they follow a high-calorie hyperglycidic, hypolipidic diet; no signs of malnutrition are shown by clinical and laboratory analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In the light of the data in our possession, it can be understood that nutritional therapy is the main treatment for SBS; parenteral subministration has to be abandoned during the postoperatory course to give way to enteral nutrition, in order to create a physiological stimulus able to make the digestive system rapidly adapt to the new situation.},

   abstract = {Major advances in the understanding of the aetio-pathogenesis and genetics of inflammatory bowel disease have been accompanied by an escalation in the sophistication of immunomodulatory inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics. However, the basic 'triple' therapy (5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, azathioprine) and nutrition have maintained their central role in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease over recent decades. This review provides an overview of the supportive and therapeutic perspectives of nutrition in adult inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of supportive nutrition is to correct malnutrition in terms of calorie intake or specific macro- or micronutrients. Of particular clinical relevance is deficiency in calcium, vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and zinc. There is justifiably a growing sense of unease amongst clinicians and patients with regard to the long-term use of corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. This, rather than arguments about efficacy, should be the catalyst for revisiting the use of enteral nutrition as primary treatment in Crohn's disease. Treatment failure is usually related to a failure to comply with enteral nutrition. Potential factors that militate against successful completion of enteral nutrition are feed palatability, inability to stay on a solid-free diet for weeks, social inconvenience and transient feed-related adverse reactions. Actions that can be taken to improve treatment outcome include the provision of good support from dietitians and clinicians for the duration of treatment and the subsequent 'weaning' period. There is evidence to support a gradual return to a normal diet through exclusion-re-introduction or other dietary regimen following the completion of enteral nutrition to increase remission rates. We also review the evidence for emerging therapies, such as glutamine, growth factors and short-chain fatty acids. The future may see the evolution of enteral nutrition into an important therapeutic strategy, and the design of a 'Crohn's disease-specific formulation' that is individually tailored, acceptable to patients, cost-effective, free from adverse side-effects and combines enteral nutrition with novel pre- and pro-biotics and other factors.},

   abstract = {The gut flora plays a fundamental role in maintaining normal intestinal function. A disturbance of this flora, or the host response to this flora, has been clearly demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This has led to attempts to modify the bacterial flora with "live non-pathogenic organisms that confer health benefits by improving the microbial balance," otherwise known as probiotics. Recent attention has focused on this potential strategy to treat or prevent IBD. The potential therapeutic benefit is enhanced by the natural and apparently safe approach that probiotics offer. Animal models of colitis have provided the proof of principle that probiotics can prevent and treat established intestinal inflammation. Controlled clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of probiotics in the maintenance of remission of pouchitis, prophylaxis of pouchitis after the formation of an ileoanal reservoir, maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, and treatment of Crohn's disease. However, large controlled trials are needed to definitively establish the place for probiotics in the treatment of IBD and resolve issues such as the dose, duration, frequency of treatment, and use of single or multiple strains. Research is focusing on establishing the mechanism of action, so that treatments with individually tailored properties are developed and innovative approaches are explored.},

It can affect people of any age, but is more commonly diagnosed in adolescence and young adulthood. Inflammation and ulceration occurs primarily in the terminal ileum and colon, although any portion of the intestinal tract can be affected. No etiology has been identified for Crohn's disease, although a number of factors contribute to its etiopathogenesis, including genetic, microbial, inflammatory, immune, and permeability abnormalities. Conventional medications are not curative but can contribute to resolution of acute flare-ups and help maintain remission. Because significant side effects are associated with many these medications, more natural interventions to help maintain remission should be considered. Associated nutrient deficiencies, dietary interventions, and nutrient and botanical supplementation are discussed.},

Th present study was undertaken to examine the diagnostic accuracy and clinical significance of ASCA determination in Japanese patients with CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Seventy-five serum samples obtained from 68 patients with CD, 34 serum samples obtained from 30 patients with UC, 35 serum samples from 35 patients with liver cirrhosis, and 31 serum samples from 31 healthy controls were examined. The optical density of each sample was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method to quantify ASCA IgA and IgG. RESULTS: The cutoff level, as determined by discriminant analysis of the data, was 0.1502 for ASCA IgA and 0.156 for ASCA IgG. Of the 68 patients with CD, 31 (45.6%) were ASCA-positive, and of the 30 patients with UC, 4 (13.3%) were ASCA-positive according to these cutoff levels. The sensitivity and specificity of ASCA determination for the differential diagnosis of CD from UC were 45.6% and 86.7%, respectively. When the relationship between ASCA and the clinical features of CD was analyzed, ASCA positivity was found to be correlated with duration of illness. CONCLUSIONS: The specificity of ASCA was high; however, the sensitivity was not. ASCA titers were generally low in the Japanese population examined. It would be desirable to determine cutoff levels for ASCA tailored to the Japanese people for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is the result of an abnormal immune response of the gut mucosa triggered by one or more environmental risk factors in people with predisposing gene variations, including CARD15 mutations. Epidemiological data allow assessment of familial environmental risk factors related to western lifestyle, diet, bacteria, and domestic hygiene. All findings point to refrigeration as a potential risk factor for Crohn's disease. Furthermore, cold-chain development paralleled the outbreak of Crohn's disease during the 20th century. The cold chain hypothesis suggests that psychrotrophic bacteria such as Yersinia spp and Listeria spp contribute to the disease. These bacteria have been identified in Crohn's disease lesions and we discuss their pathogenic properties with respect to our knowledge of the disease. From a molecular perspective, we postulate that the disease is a result of a defect in host recognition by pathogenic bacterial components that usually escape the immune response (eg, Yop molecules), which results in an excessive host response to these bacteria.},

The objective of this study was to compare early surgical outcomes in patients having laparoscopic versus open ileocolic resections for Crohn's disease. METHODS: Data collected prospectively from 21 patients having LI resection for Crohn's disease between 1995 and 2001 were compared to data from 19 patients having open ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease between 1990 and 1995. RESULTS: Patients in both groups had similar ages, sex distribution, and rates of previous abdominal surgery. Mean operating time was not significantly different between the groups. There was a nonsignificant trend to less postoperative analgesic requirement in the laparoscopic group. Resumption of liquid (P <.001) and solid (P =.01) diet, return of bowel function [flatus (P =.008), feces (P =.008)] and time to discharge (P =.001) all occurred significantly more quickly in the laparoscopic group. There was no difference in the rates of morbidity between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: LI resection for Crohn's disease appears to be safe and has comparable if not superior results to open surgery in the short term.},

A limited number of cases have been reported in the literature although it is suggested that the true incidence of this disorder is higher than observed in clinical practice. This is the case of a 76-year-old woman with a past medical history of Crohn's disease found to have PCI. The patient initially complained of abdominal pain, distention, and weight loss. Chest and abdominal radiographs demonstrated free intraperitoneal air. CT scans revealed characteristic air-filled cysts in the intestinal wall, which established the diagnosis of PCI. Because the patient did not have an acute abdomen or findings requiring emergency laparotomy she was treated nonoperatively with supportive care. Her symptoms resolved gradually over several days. The patient was discharged home in stable condition tolerating a regular diet and was doing well at follow-up. The sole finding of free air with PCI does not mandate exploratory laparotomy.},

TG estimation in diverse groups of patients with autoimmune disease or hyperactive immune response confirmed the occurrence of a similar decrease of TG. In some patients, serum FFA level was also evaluated. TG value in lean and obese patients was compared with that in lean (n = 108) and obese (n = 208) control subjects without autoimmune disease. In patients affected by autoimmune chronic thyroiditis with enhanced concentration of antithyroglobulin antibodies and without thyroidal failure (n = 24), lean and obese patients had reduced TG (-69/%, P < .01 and -52%, P < .0001, respectively). Both lean and obese patients affected by chronic active B or C hepatitis (n = 26), with autoantibodies and without signs of hepatic insufficiency or cirrhosis, presented reduced TG (-57%, P < .01 and -61%, P < .001, respectively). A marked TG decrease (-73%, P < .001) was observed in the lean patients affected by lupus-like syndrome (n = 7). The lean and obese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis (n = 11) showed TG decrease (-66%, P < .01 and -55%, P < .05, respectively). In patients affected by anamnestic allergy or atopic dermatitis/asthma (n = 66), both lean and obese, TGs were reduced (-67%, P < .0001 and -62%, P < .001, respectively). In isolated cases of diverse autoimmune diseases (scleroderma, APECED [autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, candidiasis, and ectodermal dystrophy], urticaria or urticarial vasculitis, Reiter or Sjogren syndromes, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barre syndrome) (n = 14), decreased TG was also observed both in the lean and obese subjects (-59%, P < .01 and -57%, P < .01, respectively). Concerning FFA (n = 69), value in lean patients (n = 22) vs that in lean controls (n = 18) was increased (520 +/- 31 vs 299 +/- 30 mcEq/L, +74%, P < .001), whereas value in obese patients (n = 18) vs that in obese control subjects (n = 11) was decreased (542 +/- 34 vs 774 +/- 62, -30%, P < .01). This opposite behavior of FFA in lean and obese patients needs to be confirmed. Data in this study seem to indicate that low TG value may be a precocious marker of autoimmunity or immune system hyperreactivity.},

We examined the effects of postoperative nutritional therapy in patients with perforating type and non-perforating type Crohn's disease. METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively reviewed the records for 218 patients who underwent surgical interventions for Crohn's disease in our hospital between January 1, 1974 and September 30, 2001. They were divided into four groups: 92 patients in the non-perforating type (NP type) + Elemental Diet (ED) group had received ED therapy and nutritional education, 22 patients in the NP type + NoED group had not received ED therapy or nutritional education, 88 patients in the perforating type (P type) + ED group and 16 patients in P type + NoED group. We evaluated the incidence of reoperation rate for each group. RESULTS: Patients with a postoperative ED therapy demonstrated a significant decrease in the incidence of second resection. The incidence of second resection in the NP type + ED group was significantly lower than that of the other groups. The NP type + NoED group and the P type + ED group followed similar courses. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Crohn's disease postoperative ED therapy and nutritional education is effective in reducing the incidence of second resection. It appears that postoperative ED therapy and nutritional education is more important in patients with P type Crohn's disease.},

A relatively smaller number of patients receive dietary treatment as well. Physicians' scepticism, under-resourced dietetic departments and patient compliance are the main concerns in considering enteral nutrition. The management of high stomal output in Crohn disease is even more challenging. We report a case of active Crohn disease with high stoma output treated successfully solely with enteral feeding without the need for surgical intervention or administration of potent pharmacotherapy.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the specificity of increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) with normal villous architecture in small bowel biopsy samples for diagnosis of gluten sensitivity (GS) and its significance in the absence of GS. METHODS: Small bowel biopsy samples from 43 patients with increased IELs and no other pathology were reviewed. Patients with prior diagnosis of GS were excluded. A group of 46 patients with normal duodenal biopsy during the same period served as controls. The clinical records of patients and controls were examined for presenting symptoms, laboratory tests, and final clinicopathological diagnosis. Immunohistochemical characterization of IELs was performed in 13 cases. RESULTS: Four (9.3%) patients had GS based on positive IgA antiendomysial antibodies (n = 3) and favorable response to gluten-free diet (n = 4). One patient (2.2%) had partially treated tropical sprue; six patients (14%) had disorders of immune regulation including Hashimoto's thyroiditis (n = 2) and one case each of Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis; and six patients (14%) were on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In contrast, none of the control subjects had GS (p = 0.05), tropical sprue, or immunoregulatory disorders (p = 0.011), and one (2.2%) was on NSAIDs (p = 0.04). Increased IELs were also observed in Crohn's disease, lymphocytic/collagenous colitis, and bacterial overgrowth, but the association did not reach statistical significance. Histological features (number and distribution of IELs, crypt mitoses) and immunophenotypic analysis of IELs did not reliably distinguish GS-related from non-GS-related causes of increased IELs. CONCLUSIONS: Intraepithelial lymphocytosis in an otherwise normal small bowel biopsy is somewhat nonspecific, but in nearly 10% of cases can be the initial presentation of GS. Therefore all patients with this finding should be investigated for GS. Increased IELs may also be associated with autoimmune disorders and NSAIDs.},

UC and CD are chronic and recurrent conditions, with a tendency to exacerbations and remissions. The incidence of diseases worldwide has increased over the last years. Although the etiology of inflammatory bowel syndrome has been studied intensively it still remains unclear. The development and persistence of inflammation is an effect of numerous factors: proinflammatory (aggressive), regulating bowel mucosa homeostasis and protective factors. Proinflammatory factors include intestinal bacteria, bile acids, digestive enzymes, lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans. Protective mechanisms are impermeability of mucosa barrier, presence of intestinal mucus, activity of secretive immunoglobulins, some prostaglandins and interleukins, glutamine, somatostatin, cortisol and short-chain fatty acids. Factors modifying intestinal mucosa homeostasis consist of genetically determined immunoregulators and activity of intestinal mucosa barrier and some environmental factors (diet, smoking, infections, stress, antibiotics and others). Environmental factors are jointly responsible for IBS occurrence in case of genetically determined dysregulation leading to proinflammatory cytokines overproduction or disturbances in synthesis of cytokines regulating intestinal mucosa homeostasis.},

   abstract = {The clinical management of Crohn's disease can be considered in relation to the treatment of acute disease and the maintenance of remission. The medication used to achieve these two goals may or may not be the same. Some patients with mildly active disease may respond to high-dose (4 g/day) mesalazine (mesalamine), and 5-aminosalicylic acid may also be helpful in weaning a patient off steroids after treatment for a flare-up. However, the value of 5-aminosalicylic acid in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease remains controversial. Subgroups of patients may be helped: for example, patients with Crohn's disease who have experienced a relapse within the last 2 years may benefit. Steroids form the first-line therapy for acute episodes of inflammation but do not maintain remission. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are the first-line drugs for the maintenance of remission in moderate to severe Crohn's disease, and by titrating the dose up from 2 mg/kg daily, some previously resistant patients will be brought into remission. One-half of patients who do not tolerate azathioprine will tolerate mercaptopurine. Methotrexate is effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and is useful for patients who fail azathioprine treatment. Thalidomide is not proven in controlled studies, but two open studies have demonstrated its efficacy. The optimal dose, however, remains to be defined. Purified liquid diets with food exclusion can induce remission in patients with active disease, but food exclusion is difficult to maintain long term. Infliximab can induce and maintain remission in patients resistant to other therapies, with two-thirds of patients initially responding to treatment. One-third go into remission and, of those who respond to a single treatment, approximately one-half maintain remission when treated regularly for a year. Infliximab is, however, associated with an increased risk of infection, and its effect on cancer incidence is uncertain. The development of antibodies against the drug is associated with a loss of effect and allergic infusion reactions. In summary, simple proven therapies should be used first, because of their safety and benefit in some patients. However, aggressive therapy should be used when needed.},

Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, malaise, and arthralgias, and cause considerable morbidity. Speculation about genetic, environmental, dietary, infectious, and immunologic etiologies has led to treatment modalities directed at each theoretic cause, but therapy guidelines are determined by the severity of disease. Use of salicylates and/or antibiotics can be effective in mild to moderate disease, while steroids are the accepted therapy for more severe active disease. Azathioprine and other immunosuppresant drugs can be used as adjunctive therapy for active Crohn's disease and may help to maintain remission. Infliximab, an antibody to human tumor necrosis factor alpha, has proved successful in the treatment of severe refractory disease and generally causes only mild side effects. Therapy for Crohn's disease must involve treating comorbid conditions to improve the quality of life of patients.},

   abstract = {In a 36-year-old male with ileocolic Crohn's disease (CD) no long-lasting remission was obtained by treatment with corticosteroids, mesalazine, azathioprine and antibiotics. Surgical interventions due to relapsing fistulae and abscesses resulted in the removal of >1.5 m of small bowel and left only 40 cm of large bowel. In July 2000, a new fistula and abscess developed. The combination of corticosteroids, mesalazine, ciprofloxacin, metronidazol, azathioprine, formula diet and anti-TNF-alpha antibody largely reduced clinical activity, and resection of fistula and abscess were successful. Despite clinical remission, histology showed activity in the small bowel and the colon. In March 2001, stem cell mobilization chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide was performed. It induced an endoscopic remission for 9 months, which was maintained on azathioprine and corticosteroids. After relapse, in March 2002, high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and reinfusion of T-cell-depleted autologous peripheral CD34+ blood stem cells were performed. This led to a complete clinical, endoscopical and histological remission for 9 months without any treatment. Thereafter, endoscopy showed initial aphthous lesions with minimal histological signs of inflammation. The patient is asymptomatic, but low-dose prednisolone and methotrexate are prophylactically given. Immunoablative chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation may be a beneficial therapeutic option in complicated refractory CD.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of IBD is only partly understood; various environmental and host (e.g. genetic-, epithelial-, immune and non-immune) factors are involved. It is a multifactorial polygenic disease with probable genetic heterogeneity, some genes are associated with IBD itself, while others increase the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) or are associated with disease location and/or behaviour. The role of environmental factors, in particular, enteric antigens, smoking and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug use has been well established. However uptil now no proof of a role of any unique pathogenic bacteria or special dietary and/or psychosocial factor has been identified. In this hypothesis, the disease may develop in a genetically predisposed host as a consequence of disregulated immune response to environmental, in particular, enteric antigens, resulting in a continuous immune-mediated inflammation (in CD predominantly Th-1, in UC a modified Th-2 mechanisms are involved) and not in tolerance. As a consequence, the permeability of mucosa and the antigen challenge increases, in contrast, the disregulated immune response is unable to downregulate the inflammatory process. This will result in a continuous inflammation and tissue damage. The pathogenesis of CD is thought to be mainly an antigen driven, T-lymphocyte dependent process, while in UC the role of epithelial factors and activated granulocytes are essential.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: An epidemiological study of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Veszprem county (located in western part of Hungary) was carried out from 1977 to 2001. METHODS: Both hospital and outpatient records of IBD patients were collected reviewed carefully. Most patients have been followed up regularly. RESULTS: The number of population has decreased during the observed period from 386,000 to 376,000. The county has both industrial and agrarian parts. 560 new ulcerative colitis (UC) cases, 212 Crohn's disease (CD), and 40 indeterminate colitides (IC) were diagnosed in the investigated period. Incidence rate increased from 1.66 (1977-1981) to 11.01 (1997-2001) in UC, and from 0.41 to 4.68 in CD, respectively. The incidence rate in IC rose from 0.26 to 0.74. The M/F ratio in UC was 1.06, in CD: 1.03, respectively, 41 UD patients and 13 CD patients died, the cause of death was disease related in 6 UC and in 6 CD patients. The average age at death in UC was not different from that observed in general population (66.4 years) but in CD (50.1 years) it was much earlier. The disease related mortality was low, 0.06/100,000 both in UC and CD. The prevalence rate at the end of 2001 was 142.6 for UC and 52.9/100,000 inhabitants for CD. Mean age at onset in UC was 38.9 +/- 15.5 years, in CD 31.7 +/- 12.8 years. We observed only one peak onset of the diseases, in UC it was between 30 and 40 years, in CD between 20 and 30 years. People living in towns were more liable to acquire the disease (ORUC = 1.27, ORCD = 1.13). The rate of smokers at the onset was 14.3% (OR = 0.25) in UC and 50.5% (OR = 1.98) in CD. Ex-smokers were 18.4% and 6.4%. Family history of IBD was present in 3.4% in UC and 9.9% in CD. The location of UC (according to the known largest extent) was proctitis in 112 cases, proctosigmoiditis in 162 cases, left sided colitis in 117 and subtotal or pancolitis in 169 cases. The location of CD was only ileal in 68 cases, ileocolonic in 87 cases, colonic in 57 cases. The behaviour of CD was non-stricturing-non-penetrating in 63 cases, stricturing in 54 cases, penetrating in 95 cases. 59.4% of the CD patients had at least one operation, 6.1% had more than 3 operations. CONCLUSION: The incidence and prevalence rates have increased steadily in Veszprem County, now it reaches that of most western European countries. There were no gender differences either in UC or CD. Smoking seemed to be a risk factor for CD, but it was preventive for UC. The rapid increase in incidence supports a role for environmental (e.g. diet, lifestyle changes) risk factors.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether AF synthesis could be induced in patients who had been subjected to intestinal resections. Eight patients with varying extents of intestinal resections due to Crohn's disease and six healthy controls participated. All subjects received 54 g SPC daily for 2 weeks. Plasma AF activity was determined before, during and after the treatment period. Baseline diet and medications were kept unchanged. The patients registered the daily number of bowel movements. The SPC diet increased AF activity in all controls. In the patients there was a significant correlation between the length of the remaining small intestine and AF induction (r=0.94, p<0.01) and only those patients with a remaining small intestine of about 3 m reached AF values comparable to those in healthy subjects. It is concluded that small bowel length is related to the ability of humans to induce AF activity by dietary means.},

AIM: The authors evaluated the efficacy of prefeeding Dunaliella bardawil, rich in beta-carotene, to ameliorate acid-induced enteritis in a rat model. METHODS: Enteritis was induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats by injection of 2 mL acetic acid (0.67 mol/L) to a ligated duodenal loop following 10 weeks of feeding diets containing beta-carotene and compared with various controls. The effects of beta-carotene were evaluated by changes in myeloperoxidase activity, histology, and histomorphometry. RESULTS: Feeding beta-carotene resulted in suppressed mucosal myeloperoxidase activity, both basal and that induced by acetic acid injection. Acetic acid treatment induced major histopathologic changes in the duodenal mucosa, including small, irregular, and distorted villi; damage to the epithelium; edema of the lamina propria; accumulation of inflammatory cells; and hemorrhage. Beta-carotene treatment prevented these acid-induced histopathologic changes, and this was confirmed by histomorphometry of the villi. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the effectiveness of beta-carotene in a rat model as a prophylactic dietary measure in reducing the effects of acid-induced enteritis and raise the possibility that patients with Crohn's disease may benefit from the consumption of natural beta-carotene.},

The authors evaluate current trends in treatment and areas of consensus or controversy. METHODS: An international survey of certified pediatric gastroenterologists was conducted using an e-mail questionnaire in an attempt to evaluate management of active Crohn disease, attitudes toward four types of therapy, and prevalence of testing for osteopenia and 6-thioguanine levels. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven physicians from the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Israel were included. The majority of North American physicians (71%) prefer to use conventional steroids and azathioprine (AZA) before nutritional therapy or budesonide for patients with mild to moderately active disease, versus 21% of Western Europeans (P < 0.001). Western Europeans prefer nutritional therapy followed by budesonide or steroids for those with mild or moderate disease. Only 4% of North American gastroenterologists use nutritional therapy frequently versus 62% of their Western European colleagues (P < 0.001). Infliximab was thought to be effective for steroid-unresponsive disease by almost all physicians surveyed, although its efficacy as a maintenance therapy was rated higher by North American physicians than by their Western European and Israeli colleagues (P < 0.01). Bone mineral density is routinely evaluated by about 45% of physicians in Western Europe and North America. CONCLUSIONS: Attitudes toward current therapies vary significantly by region, with North Americans strongly favoring corticosteroids followed by immunomodulatory therapy, and Western Europeans favoring nutritional therapy or budesonide and the avoidance of conventional corticosteroids.},

As many as 1.4 million persons in the United States and 2.2 million persons in Europe suffer from these diseases. Previously noted racial and ethnic differences seem to be narrowing. Differences in incidence across age, time, and geographic region suggest that environmental factors significantly modify the expression of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The strongest environmental factors identified are cigarette smoking and appendectomy. Whether other factors such as diet, oral contraceptives, perinatal/childhood infections, or atypical mycobacterial infections play a role in expression of inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear. Additional epidemiologic studies to define better the burden of illness, explore the mechanism of association with environmental factors, and identify new risk factors are needed.},

Exogenous sources are mainly titanium dioxide (TiO2) and mixed silicates (Psil); they are resistant to degradation and accumulate in human Peyer's patch macrophages and there is some evidence that they exacerbate inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD). However, whether their intake differs between those with and without CD has not been studied. We aimed to identify dietary microparticle sources and intakes in subjects with and without CD. Patients with inactive CD and matched general practice-based controls (ninety-one per group) completed 7 d food diaries. Intake data for dietary fibre and sucrose were compared as positive controls. All foods, pharmaceuticals and toothpastes were examined for microparticle content, and intakes of Ca and exogenous microparticles were compared between the two groups. Dietary intakes were significantly different between cases and controls for dietary fibre (12 (SD 5) v. 14 (SD 5) g/d; P=0.001) and sucrose (52 (SD 27) v. 45 (SD 18) g/d; P=0.04) but not for Ca. Estimated median TiO2 and Psil intakes (2.5 and 35 mg/individual per d respectively, totalling 10(12)-10(13) microparticles/individual per d) were broadly similar to per capita estimates and while there was wide variation in intakes between individuals there was no significant difference between subjects with CD and controls. Hence, if exposure to microparticles is associated with the inflammation of CD, then the present study rules out excess intake as the problem. Nonetheless, microparticle-containing foods have now been identified which allows a low-microparticle diet to be further assessed in CD.},

The present study set out to assess whether patients with CD have dietary habits that lead to low Fe intakes and/or reduced bioavailable Fe compared with control subjects. Patients with asymptomatic CD were matched to controls (n 91/group). Dietary intakes of Fe and contributions from different food groups were compared using a 7 d food diary. Promoters and inhibitors of non-haem Fe absorption were investigated and a recently published algorithm was applied to assess bioavailable Fe. Fewer patients than controls met the reference nutrient intake for Fe (32% CD patients v. 42% controls). Overall, patients had significantly lower mean Fe intakes (by 2.3 mg/d) and Fe density (by 0.26 mg/MJ (1.1 mg/1000 kcal)) compared with controls (both P<0.001). Differences were mainly due to a preference among CD patients for low-fibre non-Fe fortified cereals, particularly breakfast cereals. In particular, control subjects had higher Fe intakes than matched CD subjects for men (P<0.001) and women less than 50 years (P=0.03). Intakes of both ascorbic acid (P<0.001) and phytic acid (P<0.01), but not animal tissue (P=1.0), were lower in patients with CD, but these had no overall effect on the predicted percentage of bioavailable Fe. Thus total bioavailable Fe was reduced in patients with CD due to lower intakes (P<0.01). Dietary Fe intakes are low in CD patients, which may contribute to an increased risk of ID and anaemia. Changing dietary advice may compromise perceived symptoms of the disease so the need for Fe supplementation should be carefully considered.},

METHODS: In a randomized, non-blind, multicentre, controlled trial in Sweden, 16 children with Crohn's disease received Elemental 028 Extra (E028E) and 17 Nutrison Standard (NuS). Remission rates (Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) < 10 or a PCDAI decrease of 40% or 15 points of initial level) were compared at 6 wk. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in remission rate at 6 wk (intent-to-treat analysis): E028E 11/16 (69%) and NuS 14/17 (82%) (p = 0.438). There was no difference in the decrease in PCDAI and CDAI between patients treated with E028E and those treated with NuS from 0 to 6 wk. Patients treated with NuS gained significantly more weight than patients treated with E028E (+2.5 kg; 95% CI 0.9, 4.1; p = 0.004), this difference remained when adjusting for maximum caloric intake per kilogram bodyweight (+2.9 kg; 95% CI 1.4, 4.5; p = 0.001). Concomitant disease, complications and side effects were seen in 5/33 patients (pyelonephritis, pneumonia, intraabdominal abscess, perianal abscess and borborygmi). CONCLUSION: E028E and NuS did not differ in terms of remission rate. Patients treated with NuS gained more weight than patients with E028E. Polymeric diet may be superior to elemental diet in the treatment of paediatric Crohn's disease where the primary aim is to increase the patient's weight.},

Doppler sonography is a newer, non-invasive method to assess the hyperdynamic splanchnic blood flow that is characteristic of acute inflammation. Its role in the analysis of disease activity is still limited and its application restricted to specialized units. However, improved spatial resolution by power Doppler ultrasound, with or without the use of contrast agents, allows a very early detection of mucosal and transmural inflammatory lesions. Still more important, the repeated quantification of mesenteric blood flow enables the prediction of relapse at six months after steroid-induced remission. Future studies should clarify whether the combined application of available methods will allow a more calculated and finally more effective therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) are commonly referred to the gastroenterologists for exclusion of gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) has published a guideline for management of IDA. As recommended by this guideline, all patients should have examinations of both upper and lower GI tract with the exception of pre-menopausal women younger than 45 years old. The primary aim of this audit was to determine how thoroughly patients referred to our unit at the Singapore General Hospital had been investigated. The secondary aim was to determine the yield rate of gastroscopy and lower gastrointestinal investigations (colonoscopy or barium enema) in our patients. METHODS: We reviewed the case notes of patients who underwent gastroscopy for indication of anaemia between the period from April to December 1999. We classified iron deficiency anaemia as having haemoglobin of lower than reference range with either low ferritin level or iron/ TIBC ratio of less than 10%. RESULTS: Of a total of 326 patients reviewed, 172 patients (65 men, 109 women) met the inclusion criteria of IDA. The median age for the group was 59 (Range 16 to 88) years old and there were 107 (62.2%) women. There were 31 female patients younger than 45 years old (group A) and 141 patients in group B which included all the males and females older than 45 years old. Due to the method of data retrieval, all of the patients in group A fulfilled the standard set by the BSG guideline in that they all underwent gastroscopy. In this group, few gastrointestinal pathologies were found (one patient with peptic ulcer and two patients with colonic cancer). In terms of finding potential gastrointestinal causes of IDA, the yield rate of gastroscopy and colonoscopy were 3.2% and 13.6% respectively. In group B, 96 patients (68%) underwent upper and lower gastrointestinal investigations. Evaluation with gastroscopy showed peptic ulcer disease in 31 patients (21.7%) and gastric cancer in 9 patients (6.3%). Only 96 patients (68.1%) in group B had lower gastrointestinal investigations. Twenty-six patients were found to have gastrointestinal disorders (12 patients with colon cancer, 10 colonic polyps, one Crohn's disease, one colonic tuberculosis and two haemorrhoids). The yield rate of gastroscopy and colonoscopy were 31.2% and 25% respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study of patients with confirmed IDA, we found much higher incidence of gastrointestinal disorders in the group of male and postmenopausal women than in the group with premenopausal women. Furthermore, over 30% of patients in this group did not undergo lower gastrointestinal tract investigations as recommended by the BSG guideline. We also found two cases of colonic cancer in the latter group. We would recommend bidirectional endoscopy for postmenopausal women and men with IDA. For premenopausal women, we would recommend similar approach unless there are clinical pointers to dietary iron deficiency or menorrhagia.},

Recent studies point to alterations in enterohepatic bilirubin cycling, resulting in increased biliary bilirubin levels leading to pigment rather than cholesterol gallstones. Gallbladder (hypo)motility is another important factor in the pathogenesis of gallstones leading to bile stasis, crystallisation and stone formation. Postprandial gallbladder emptying is not markedly reduced in patients with Crohn's disease but lower fasting gallbladder volumes have been observed in patients with colonic disease or after ileocaecal resection. Prolonged and repeated bowel rest before and after intestinal surgery has been recognised as a significant risk factor for gallstone formation in patients with Crohn's disease.},

The therapeutic arsenal is well defined and has been tested for safety and efficacy. There is need and opportunity to adapt therapies to individual situations. This is made on the basis of scientific facts that have been collected from randomized controlled trials and on the basis of reasoned thinking that weighs the potential effect against potential side effects in individual cases. In clinical practice, the potency of lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation is still underestimated and not extensively exploited. As the understanding of genetic mutations, their gene function and phenotypic expression grows, we anticipate that future treatment can be tailored to certain genotypes or phenotypes of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {The intestinal immune system discriminates between invasive pathogens and antigens that are harmless, such as food proteins and commensal bacteria. The latter groups of antigens normally induce tolerance and a breakdown in this homeostatic process can lead to diseases such as coeliac disease or Crohn's disease. The nature ofthe intestinal immune response depends on how antigen is presented to CD4+ T cells by dendritic cells (DCs). Both oral tolerance and priming are influenced by the numbers and activation status of DCs in the gut and its draining lymphoid tissues, and our current work indicates that dietary proteins are taken up preferentially by DCs in the lamina propria of the small intestine. These then migrate to interact with antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the mesenteric lymph node. In vivo and in vitro studies using purified lamina propria DCs suggest these may play a unique role in the regulation of intestinal immune responses. We propose that local DCs are the gatekeepers of the mucosal immune system, inducing tolerance under physiological conditions, but being sufficiently responsive to inflammatory stimuli to allow T cell priming and protective immunity when necessary. In addition, we will discuss evidence that adjuvant vectors such as ISCOMS may be effective mucosal vaccines due to an ability to activate intestinal DCs.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Thromboembolism is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a risk factor for vascular disease and has been implicated as a mediator of thromboembolic events in adults with IBD. The authors studied the link between tHcy and IBD in children, in whom associations may be clearer, and investigated associations with plasma von Willebrand factor antigen, a marker of vascular damage. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 43 patients with IBD (27 Crohn disease, 9 ulcerative colitis, and 7 indeterminate colitis) and 46 control subjects from a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Plasma tHcy, plasma 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate, red cell folate, plasma vitamin B12, plasma von Willebrand factor antigen, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype (for the C677T mutation) were measured. RESULTS: Plasma tHcy concentrations were higher in children with IBD than in control subjects, when corrected for age (P < 0.05), and plasma tHcy was negatively correlated with plasma 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate (P < 0.0005). Plasma 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate and age were the main predictors of plasma tHcy. Neither MTHFR genotype nor von Willebrand factor showed any association with any other measure, and there were no differences between children with IBD and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma tHcy is a consequence of IBD in children, probably mediated by poor folate status associated with diet or the pathophysiology of the disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease, notably ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn disease (CD), is basically benign, but sometimes develops into serious or fatal cancer. While the primary therapies are medical, such as pharmacotherapy and dietetic modification, intractable, serious, and cancerous cases can require surgical intervention. Surgery represents only one of the treatment options, but prediction of whether UC and CD are likely to progress to serious conditions and determination of when to undertake surgery is essential. Various surgical procedures have been developed over time, and the postoperative results are now generally good. Regarding laparoscopic surgeries, relatively few cases have been accumulated, and addressing the indications and limitations is premature at this point. However, this procedure is likely to fulfill a central role in surgical treatment strategies and represent a major benefit to patients. This paper discusses surgical treatment indications and methods for UC and CD, and explains the practical aspects of laparoscopic surgery, which has made remarkable progress in recent years, for such cases.},

   abstract = {Dyspepsia is a common clinical problem. Its causes include peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux, and functional (nonulcer) dyspepsia. A detailed clinical description of pain does not reliably differentiate the cause. Approximately 80% of gastroscopies are performed for the investigation of dyspepsia. "Gastritis" is diagnosed endoscopically in 59% of all stomachs, although in only 3% are the changes severe. Pathologic examination of unselected gastric biopsy specimens reveals that abnormalities are present in 62-73%, but there is only a weak correlation between endoscopic and histologic findings. For these reasons, it is recommended that endoscopic examination should always be accompanied by biopsy. Ideally, biopsies should be taken in a systematic fashion to include sampling of antrum and corpus. Recent evidence suggests that gastric infection by Helicobacter pylori initially presents as a superficial gastritis. Later it may become atrophic with development of intestinal metaplasia. The onset of atrophic changes may be related to the duration of infection, the strain of the infecting organism, associated dietary factors, or as-yet undefined host factors related to immunity. Persistent superficial gastritis predisposes to duodenal ulcer and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Atrophic gastritis predisposes to gastric ulcer and adenocarcinoma. Evidence is accumulating that in some patients, pernicious anemia may be an end result of H. pylori-induced atrophic gastritis. Reactive gastropathy is a relatively common finding in gastric biopsies; in most instances it is associated with either reflux of duodenal contents or therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Lymphocytic gastritis, eosinophilic gastritis, and the gastritis associated with Crohn's disease are distinct morphologic entities. Lymphocytic gastritis and eosinophilic gastritis have a variety of clinical associations. Carditis is a controversial topic: currently opinions are divided as to whether it is the result of gastroesophageal reflux or a proximal extension of H. pylori infection from the remainder of the stomach.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dietary, environmental and genetic events may influence host susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF-beta 2), a multifunctional polypeptide (cytokine) present in human and bovine milk, plays a critical role in the development of tolerance, the prevention of autoimmunity, and in anti-inflammatory responses. TGF-beta 2 is a potent inhibitor of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) growth and stimulates IEC differentiation. The objective of this study was to determine whether a diet containing TGF-beta 2 modulates intestinal injury and immune responses in an Interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10-/-) mouse model of IBD. METHODS: Five-week-old IL-10-/- mice (in BALB/c background) reared in our transgenic facility were fed either an enteral diet (Diet-A) containing TGF-beta 2 or a control enteral diet (Diet-B) not rich in TGF-beta 2. Mice were weighed weekly, monitored for illness and euthanized after eight weeks on the diet. RESULTS: Final weights were 28 +/- 1.2 g (58.2% gain) for Diet-A mice and 23 +/- 1.6 g (32.9% gain) for Diet-B mice (p = 0.0194). The hematocrits were 48.3% for Diet-A compared to 42% for Diet-B mice (p = 0.0021). Mice on Diet-A had significantly lower serum TNF-alpha concentrations. Forty-four percent of mice on Diet-B developed severe diarrhea and rectal prolapse compared with none on Diet-A. Evaluation of intestinal pathology (score 0-4) revealed that animals fed Diet-A had a score of 2.1 +/- 0.4 compared to 3.2 +/- 0.36 in the Diet-B group (p = 0.040). The acute phase protein, serum amyloid A (SAA), was 3.8 times higher in the Diet-B group (p = 0.0038). CONCLUSIONS: IL-10-/- mice fed a TGF-beta 2 containing diet gained more weight, did not develop diarrhea or prolapse, had lower pathological scores, and lower SAAs. These data further support the use of TGF-beta 2 containing enteral diets as one mode of therapy for Crohn's disease.},

The authors conducted this study to assess 1) the knowledge of IBD of participants attending educational workshops offered to the public and 2) the effect of the workshop on participants' knowledge level. METHODS: Workshops on IBD were offered to the public at nine communities in the United States. Each workshop consisted of a combination of 3 hours of presentations and question-and-answer sessions. Participants, including patients with IBD and their parents, spouses, siblings, friends, and significant others, were asked to complete the Crohn's and Colitis Knowledge Score questionnaires just before (Q1) and immediately after (Q2) the workshop and approximately 3 months later (Q3). The authors scored one point for each correct answer to the 30 questions in the Crohn's and Colitis Knowledge Score. RESULTS: Of the 734 who completed the Q1, 33.7% gave correct answers for questions about IBD complications, 36.2% for treatment, 61.4% for general knowledge, and 64.8% for diet. After the workshop, the proportion for these four knowledge areas increased by 11.0% to 19%. For the participants who completed all of the three questionnaires and answered all the 30 questions (N=59), the mean score was 18 at Q1, 22 at Q2 (p<0.001, Q2 vs. Q1), and 21 at Q3 (p<0.001, Q3 vs. Q1). CONCLUSIONS: The public's general knowledge of IBD is low. Educational programs oriented toward IBD improve participant's knowledge, and the knowledge they acquired is retained for at least 3 months.},

This review examines the hypothesis that alterations in the luminal environment of the intestine regulate the expression of genes in the epithelium responsible for signaling to immune cells. Increasing chemokine expression in the mouse intestinal epithelium using transgenic techniques enhances the recruitment of neutrophils and lymphocytes into the intestine. Furthermore, SCFA concentrations in the intestinal lumen vary markedly with diet. SCFAs alter chemokine expression by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity in the enterocyte. The review therefore describes a molecular pathway explaining how changes in diet may alter leukocyte recruitment by regulating enterocyte gene expression. It is likely that other similar pathways remain to be discovered.},

Clinical and experimental studies suggest that the relative balance of aggressive and protective bacterial species is altered in these disorders. Antibiotics can selectively decrease tissue invasion and eliminate aggressive bacterial species or globally decrease luminal and mucosal bacterial concentrations, depending on their spectrum of activity. Alternatively, administration of beneficial bacterial species (probiotics), poorly absorbed dietary oligosaccharides (prebiotics), or combined probiotics and prebiotics (synbiotics) can restore a predominance of beneficial Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. Current clinical trials do not fulfill evidence-based criteria for using these agents in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but multiple nonrigorous studies and widespread clinical experience suggest that metronidazole and/or ciprofloxacin can treat Crohn's colitis and ileocolitis (but not isolated ileal disease), perianal fistulae and pouchitis, whereas selected probiotic preparations prevent relapse of quiescent ulcerative colitis and relapsing pouchitis. These physiologic approaches offer considerable promise for treating IBD, but must be supported by rigorous controlled therapeutic trials that consider clinical disease before their widespread clinical acceptance. These agents likely will become an integral component of treating IBD in combination with traditional anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are no published data from Great Britain and Ireland detailing the initial management of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). AIMS: To prospectively record the initial investigation and treatment of children aged less than 16 years with newly diagnosed IBD. METHODS: For 13 months, between June 1998 and June 1999, 3247 paediatricians, adult gastroenterologists, and surgeons across the UK and Ireland were prospectively surveyed each month and asked to report every newly diagnosed case of childhood IBD. Reporters subsequently completed a postal questionnaire about each case. RESULTS: A total of 739 new IBD cases were reported from 172 institutions. Significant variations were observed in the investigation and treatment of these cases, when examined by number of cases reported per institution, or by the specialists providing care. There were wide regional variations in the proportion of children having access to paediatric gastroenterology services. Overall, one third of children received care from an adult service, and a tenth care exclusively from an adult gastroenterologist. Children with Crohn's disease who had some or all of their care from adult services were more likely to receive systemic steroids and less likely to receive dietary therapy; those with ulcerative colitis were more likely to receive rectal steroids and to have surgery. Height and weight were also less likely to be recorded in those whose care involved adult services. CONCLUSION: Current specialist provision, and initial investigation and treatment of IBD, is heterogeneous. Optimisation of care is likely to be achieved by greater access to specialist paediatric gastroenterology services for all those with suspected IBD.},

METHODS: A 33-question questionnaire was sent, by mail, to 74 patients (over 70, between 70 and 50 and under 50 y old). The questionnaire explored 5 parameters of function: systemic symptoms, bowel symptoms, functional impairment, social impairment and emotional impairment. Further questions investigated the need for a nurse or relative to assist with management of the stoma, the frequency of changing the bag and the appliance, diet and the ability of patients to attend their normal daily activity. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients completed the questionnaire. The final quality of life score was similar for all the 3 age groups but elderly patients needed more assistance in the stoma management. The quality of life scores in males patients were significantly better than in females. No statistically significant difference was observed comparing loop ileostomy versus end ileostomy and Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life is not influenced by age, underlying inflammatory disease or type of ileostomy. Males report less impact on quality of life than women.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine potentially affecting all parts of the intestine with predilection sites in the terminal ileum and proximal colon. Its prevalence in Western Europe is 20-40/100,000 with equal affection of both sexes and familiar accumulation. Histopathologically, it is characterized by a discontinuous, segmental manifestation and implication of all intestinal layers. Celiac disease, on the other hand, is defined by histologically proven villous atrophy associated with hyperplasia of crypts, lymphocytic infiltration and clinical improvement after a gluten-free diet. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 52-year-old man presenting with long-term diarrhea and loss of weight associated with Crohn's disease. After interventional therapy for an unstable coronary artery syndrome and medical therapy for hyperthyroidism, the diarrhea stopped only after maintaining a gluten-free diet. A latent form of celiac disease (clinical symptoms, improvement after gluten-free diet, detection of anti-gliadin IgA antibodies, negative histology) was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report on the association of Crohn's disease and the latent form of celiac disease in the same patient. Whereas in most cases, Crohn's disease develops secondary to a pre-existing celiac disease, in our patient, latent celiac disease was diagnosed years after the onset of and therapy for Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increased intake of sucrose has been reported in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Since subclinical zinc deficiency reduces taste perception for sweet, we investigated taste perception, sucrose intake and plasma zinc levels as well as dental status in CD patients. METHODS: Carbohydrate intake and plasma zinc levels were assessed in 24 CD patients and 24 age-matched controls (Con). Taste threshold for sucrose, oral hygiene and caries prevalence were evaluated. RESULTS: In CD a higher sucrose intake (CD 107.1 +/- 27.7 vs. Con 71.9 +/- 13.7 g/day; p < 0.001), a higher taste threshold for sweet (CD 7.31 vs. Con 2.91 g/l; p < 0.001) and lower plasma zinc levels (CD 11.5 +/- 1.5 vs. Con 13.5 +/- 2.0 micromol/l; p < 0.001) were found. API was poor (CD 85.4 +/- 23.6, Con 31.8 +/- 24.1, p < 0.001) and correlated with sucrose intake (p < 0.01). Caries prevalence was increased in patients with longer disease (>3 years) (DMFT index: >3 years 15.6 +/- 5.7 vs. <3 years 9.5 +/- 4.3; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dental status in CD patients is poor. Both increased sugar consumption and insufficient oral hygiene seem to cause the higher caries prevalence. Obviously, patients with CD belong to a high-risk group, and preventive measures should be taken early in the course of the disease.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of CD among 100 Iranian patients with chronic non-bloody diarrhoea. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with chronic non-bloody diarrhoea of more than 6 weeks attending an academic centre in Iran were enrolled. Patients with bloody diarrhoea and renal failure were excluded. IgA endomysial antibody (IgA EMA), IgA antigliadin antibody (IgA AGA), and total serum IgA were tested in all patients. Patients with negative IgA EMA were evaluated for other causes of chronic diarrhoea. Patients who had positive IgA EMA underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsy. Patients with a positive IgA EMA were advised to follow a gluten-free diet (GFD) strictly for 6 months, and then clinical symptoms, serological and haematological tests were re-assessed. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients (55 men and 45 women) with chronic non-bloody diarrhoea were studied. Mean age of the patients was 31 years. Total serum IgA was in the normal range in all participants. Twenty patients (12/45 women; 8/55 men) had positive IgA EMA. Fourteen of them also had a positive IgA AGA. CD was diagnosed in 19 patients (19%). Small intestinal Crohn's disease, small intestinal lymphoma and idiopathic aetiology were the next. In patients with CD, after 6 months of a GFD, 15 patients (75%) had a complete clinical response, three patients (15%) had a good response, and one patient (5%) had a partial response. One patient did not follow a GFD. CONCLUSION: CD is the most common cause of adult chronic non-bloody diarrhoea in Tehran.},

Drugs that are destroyed by the acidic environment of the stomach or metabolized by pancreatic enzymes are only slightly affected in the colon. Sustained colonic delivery of drugs can be useful in the treatment of nocturnal asthma, angina, and arthritis. Treatment of colonic diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and colorectal cancer is more effective with direct delivery of drugs to the colon. This article is aimed at providing insight into the design considerations and evaluation of colonic drug delivery systems. The anatomy and physiology of the lower gastrointestinal tract is discussed; then the biopharmaceutical aspects are considered in relation to drug absorption in the colon. Various approaches to colon-specific drug delivery are discussed.},

DESIGN: Nonrandomized, comparative, retrospective analysis of a prospective database. SETTING: University hospital tertiary care center for inflammatory bowel disease. PATIENTS: Forty patients, 20 in the laparoscopic group (group A) and 20 in the conventional group (group B). INTERVENTION: From July 1, 1996, to June 30, 2001, we collected data on the following demographic clinical end points: age, sex, duration of disease, preoperative medical treatment, previous abdominal surgery, procedure performed, conversions to open surgery, operating time, number of trocars used, size of incision, blood loss, time to resolution of ileus, time to starting solid food diet, duration of hospital stay, hospital charges, morbidity, and mortality. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgical results, length of hospital stay, hospital charges, and recurrences. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 34.7 years (range, 20-68 years) in group A vs 40.0 years (range, 18-75 years) in group B. The male-female ratio was 1:2 in group A vs 1:1 in group B. The morbidity was 5% in group B. There was no mortality. Operating time was longer in group A (mean, 145.0 minutes; range, 45-270 minutes) compared with group B (mean, 133.5 minutes; range, 98-177 minutes) (P =.36). Blood loss was significantly higher in group B (mean, 265.5 mL; range, 100-400 mL) compared with group A (77.2 mL; range, 25-350 mL) (P<.001). Also, the size of the incision was significantly longer in group B (mean, 13.5 cm; range, 8-18 cm) compared with group A (mean, 5.5 cm; range, 3-12 cm) (P<.001). Bowel function returned more quickly in the laparoscopic group vs the conventional group in terms of return of bowel movements (1.70 vs 2.63 days) (P<.001) and resumption of a regular diet (1.35 vs 2.73 days) (P<.001). The mean length of stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (4.25 days) vs the conventional group (8.25 days) (P<.001). The mean hospital charges were US $9614 in group A vs US $17 079 in group B (P<.05). The mean follow-up was 17.2 months in group A (range, 2.3-59.9 months) vs 18.7 months in group B (range, 1.0-37.5 months). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolectomy for primary Crohn disease of the terminal ileum and/or cecum is safe and successful in most cases. Laparoscopic surgery for Crohn disease should be considered as the preferred operative approach for primary resections.},

This work presents our text mining algorithm and demonstrates its use to uncover information that could form the basis of new hypotheses. In particular, we use it to discover novel uses for Curcuma longa, a dietary substance, which is highly regarded for its therapeutic properties in Asia. RESULTS: Several disease were identified that offer novel research contexts for curcumin. We analyze select suggestions, such as retinal diseases, Crohn's disease and disorders related to the spinal cord. Our analysis suggests that there is strong evidence in favor of a beneficial role for curcumin in these diseases. The evidence is based on curcumin's influence on several genes, such as COX-2, TNF-alpha, JNK, p38 MAPK and TGF-beta. This research suggests that our discovery algorithm may be used to suggest novel uses for dietary and pharmacological substances. More generally, our text mining algorithm may be used to uncover information that potentially sheds new light on a given topic of interest. AVAILABILITY: Contact authors.},

Observations on temporal trends and geographical distribution point at risk factors associated with a Western lifestyle. A large number of studies have been performed on various factors such as diet, smoking, and several infectious agents. Childhood exposures modifying immune responses in later life form a particularly interesting field. However, so far, only smoking in Crohn's disease, and smoking cessation in ulcerative colitis can be considered established as risk factors for the manifestation of the disease. Smoking is also associated with a poor prognosis in Crohn's disease. A strong negative association of appendectomy with ulcerative colitis has been very consistent across many studies; however, the implications of this finding are still obscure.},

AIM: We investigated whether a 2-month course of prednisolone is associated with detectable bone loss. METHODS: Fifteen patients with active Crohn's disease and 19 controls with inactive Crohn's disease were recruited. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and hip was measured at baseline and 2 and 8 months. RESULTS: At 2 months, significant bone loss was found in patients with active disease (femoral neck -2.7%, P < 0.002; Ward's triangle -3.9%, P < 0.01). Although bone mineral density was still lower at 8 months, these differences were no longer significant (-1.3% and -3.4%, femoral neck and Ward's triangle, respectively). No significant change in hip bone mineral density was observed in controls. Previous corticosteroid use was not significantly associated with baseline bone mineral density, although significant independent associations were observed between weight, site of disease and lumbar spine bone mineral density, and between dietary calcium deficiency and femoral neck and Ward's triangle bone mineral density. CONCLUSION: Significant bone loss at the hip can be detected in patients receiving corticosteroid treatment for 2 months for active Crohn's disease ; however, it remains unclear whether this is because of disease activity or its treatment. This rapid bone loss may represent a risk factor for fracture and justify bone protective therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) is associated with osteoporosis and other extraintestinal manifestations that might be mediated by cytokines from circulating (peripheral blood) mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Fish oil rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduces disease activity in patients with CD with raised laboratory markers of inflammation and in healthy subjects alters PBMC function. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of fish oil plus antioxidants on cytokine production by PBMCs from patients with CD with raised C-reactive protein concentrations (>/=6.9 mg/L) or erythrocyte sedimentation rates (>/=18 mm/h). DESIGN: A randomized placebo-controlled trial of fish oil (2.7 g EPA and DHA/d; n = 31) or placebo (olive oil; n = 31) for 24 wk was conducted in patients with CD. The fish-oil group additionally received an antioxidant preparation (vitamins A, C, and E and selenium). Exclusion criteria included corticosteroid use. Fatty acid composition was measured by gas chromatography. Production of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays after stimulation with mitogen and endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). RESULTS: Fish-oil plus antioxidant dietary supplementation was associated with higher EPA and DHA incorporation into PBMCs (P < 0.001) and lower arachidonic acid (P = 0.006) and lower production of IFN-gamma by mitogen-stimulated PBMCs (P = 0.012) and of PGE(2) by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated PBMCs (P = 0.047). CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementation with fish oil plus antioxidants is associated with modified PBMC composition and lower production of PGE(2) and IFN-gamma by circulating monocytes or macrophages. The response of extraintestinal manifestations of CD should be investigated in a randomized controlled trial.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with nutritional deficiencies, altered plasma concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and an anti-inflammatory response to fish oil that contains n-3 PUFA. This suggests that, in CD, immune cells may have altered n-3 PUFA composition with functional consequences. The aim of this study is to investigate n-3 and n-6 PUFA composition and synthetic function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the basal state. METHODS: A case control study of 52 adult CD patients and healthy, age- and sex-matched controls. Composition of PBMC and plasma phospholipids were measured by gas chromatography and production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by PBMC were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: CD was associated with higher concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid and other n-3 PUFA, and lower arachidonic acid (AA) (n-6 PUFA) in PBMC. This was not explained by differences in dietary fat intake. Lower rates of production of PGE2 and IFN-gamma by PBMC were noted in quiescent and active CD, respectively, compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: CD is associated with a greater availability, and not a deficiency, of n-3 PUFA in PBMC, but lower concentrations of AA, and lower rates of production of PGE2 and IFN-gamma, compared to healthy controls.},

The availability of essential fatty acids (linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids) or their derivatives (arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids) may alter in plasma and cell membrane phospholipid in protein-energy malnutrition in children and in Crohn's disease in adults. AIM: To investigate the relationship of fatty acid phospholipid profiles with disease activity and nutritional status in paediatric Crohn's disease. METHODS: The fatty acid (proportionate) composition of plasma and erythrocyte phosphatidylcholine was determined in 30 patients (10.3-17.0 years) stratified into active and quiescent Crohn's disease (paediatric Crohn's disease activity index) and high and low body mass (body mass index centile). RESULTS: In plasma phosphatidylcholine, active disease activity was associated with a lower level of alpha-linolenic acid compared with that in quiescent disease (P < 0.05). A body mass index below the 50th centile was associated with active Crohn's disease, low linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids and high arachidonic acid (P < 0.05) in plasma phosphatidylcholine, and low alpha-linolenic acid in erythrocyte phosphatidylcholine. These findings could not be explained through differences in habitual dietary fat intake. CONCLUSION: In paediatric Crohn's disease, a low body mass index centile and high disease activity are associated with altered profiles of essential fatty acids and their derivatives, which may reflect altered metabolic demand.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is associated with reduced bone density. The power of simple markers of systemic inflammation to identify higher rates of bone loss, in Crohn's disease, is uncertain. This relationship and the role of circulating (peripheral blood) mononuclear cells were investigated in a case-control study. METHODS: Urinary deoxypyridinoline/creatinine and serum osteocalcin concentrations were compared in male and premenopausal females with "active" Crohn's disease (C-reactive protein > or = 10 and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate > or = 20) (n = 22) and controls with "quiescent" Crohn's disease (C-reactive protein < 10 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate < 20) (n = 21). No patients were receiving corticosteroid therapy. Production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma and prostaglandin E(2) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured. RESULTS: Active Crohn's disease was associated with a higher deoxypyridinoline/creatinine (P = 0.02) and deoxypyridinoline/creatinine:osteocalcin ratio (P =0.01) compared with quiescent Crohn's disease, but similar osteocalcin (P = 0.24). These were not explained by vitamin D status, dietary intake or nutritional status. However, production of interferon-gamma by concanavalin A-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells was lower in active Crohn's disease (P = 0.02) and correlated negatively with the deoxypyridinoline/creatinine:osteocalcin ratio (r = -0.40, P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: In Crohn's disease, raised C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate may indicate higher rates of bone loss and, if persistent, the need to assess bone mass even where disease symptoms are mild. This may be partly explained by altered production of interferon-gamma by peripheral blood mononuclear cells.},

   abstract = {Even with the development of new therapeutic agents, such as infliximab, enteral nutrition (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN) therapies remain important for the treatment of Crohn's disease because Crohn's patients often require nutritional support. Furthermore, nutritional therapies can be used in the control of disease activity. Elemental diets, which are mainly used in EN therapy, consist of a refined amino acid mixture, glucose or maltodextrins and minimal essential fatty acids. EN therapy can reduce mucosal inflammation by the elimination of dietary antigens, which induce inflammation, and by reductions in fat, which activates inflammation. EN is applied not only as induction therapy, but also as maintenance therapy after remission (home EN). However, the unpalatability of elemental diets, difficulties related to self-intubation and the high cost of EN have limited its application as a primary therapy in western countries. PN is utilized as complete bowel rest supporting nutrition. However, since the therapeutic efficacies of EN and PN are similar, the indications for PN are limited and PN is mainly utilized in patients with bowel obstructions or severe fistulas. PN is also used as home therapy in the treatment of Crohn's patients with short bowel syndrome. However, long-term PN sometimes causes life-threatening complications including catheter-induced sepsis, liver failure and lethal mineral deficiencies. We suggest that gastroenterologists should recognize the advantages and limitations of all therapies and choose carefully or combine various therapies in order to maintain the quality of life in individual patients even if in cases where remission can not be achieved.},

Chitosan is a water-insoluble dietary fiber, and a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture has been shown in rats to increase fecal fat excretion without affecting protein digestibility. However, it remains unclear whether a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture is safe and effective for patients with Crohn's disease. We designed a pilot trial to investigate the tolerability and amount of fat excretion after the oral administration of a chitosan and ascorbic mixture for inactive Crohn's disease. METHODS: Eleven outpatients were given seven tablets daily of a chitosan and ascorbic mixture (chitosan was given at 1.05 g/d) for 8 wk. Patients did not interrupt their respective therapies for Crohn's disease. RESULTS: The bowel movements of most patients increased slightly during the study. Nutritional and inflammatory markers in patients did not differ before and after treatment. The chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture significantly increased the fat concentration in the feces during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that oral administration of a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture in patients with Crohn's disease is tolerable and increases fecal fat excretion without affecting disease activity.},

   abstract = {In contrast to bile salts, which undergo a highly efficient enterohepatic circulation with multiple regulatory and physiologic functions, glucuronic acid conjugates of bilirubin are biliary excretory molecules that in health do not have a continuing biologic life. Intestinal absorptive cells are devoid of recapture transporters for bilirubin conjugates, and their large size and polarity prevent absorption by passive diffusion. However, unconjugated bilirubin, the beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis product of bilirubin glucuronides can be absorbed passively from any part of the small and large intestines. This can occur only if unconjugated bilirubin is kept in solution and does not undergo rapid bacterial reduction to form urobilinoids. Here we collect, and in some cases reinterpret, experimental and clinical evidence to show that in addition to the well-known occurrence in newborns, enterohepatic cycling of unconjugated bilirubin can reappear in adult life. This happens as a result of several common conditions, particularly associated with bile salt leakage from the small intestine, the most notable ileal dysfunction resulting from any medical or surgical cause. We propose that when present in excess, colonic bile salts solubilize unconjugated bilirubin, delay urobilinoid formation, prevent calcium complexing of unconjugated bilirubin and promote passive absorption of unconjugated bilirubin from the large intestine. Following uptake, reconjugation, and resecretion into bile, this source of 'hyperbilirubinbilia' may be the important pathophysiological risk factor for 'black' pigment gallstone formation in predisposed adult humans.},

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of 28 patients (12 LAP, 16 open) undergoing initial bowel resection for segmental Crohn's disease. RESULTS: Patients in the LAP group had decrease LOS (5.5 days v 11.5 days) decreased days of parenteral narcotics (3 days v 5 days) and more rapid return to regular diet (3 days v 5 days). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the laparoscopic approach may offer advantages to pediatric patients undergoing an initial bowel resection for segmental Crohn's disease.},

Since its pathogenesis is complex, and incompletely understood in comparison to the well-known pathomechanism of postmenopausal osteoporosis, adequate management is difficult. We first summarize those therapeutic options which have strong evidence in postmenopausal osteoporosis and, thereafter, we review those in the context of different gastrointestinal diseases. Treatment of the underlying intestinal disorder seems to be most important to normalise altered bone metabolism and to prevent osteoporosis in patients with coeliac disease. In patients with osteoporosis associated with Crohn's disease, various treatment strategies (such as vitamin D, sodium fluoride, bisphosphonates) are discussed. In contrast to postmenopausal osteoporosis, interventional studies in secondary osteoporosis are often limited by the small study population and data about the efficacy of any treatment in prevention of fractures are therefore lacking. Well-conducted, controlled studies with the endpoint of preventing fractures are therefore required to optimise the treatment of osteoporosis in these patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This case presentation describes a method of evaluation and a conservative management plan for a child with probable inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's Disease). Possible causes for this clinical presentation and a brief review of the literature are offered. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 9-year-old female had a history of headaches, stomach ache, foulsmelling soft stools, canker and cold sores, dry skin, stuffy nose with postnasal drip, difficulty concentrating in school, mood swings and growing pains with leg cramps. She also had a trace of fecal blood. A Urine OrganiX Profile and the Food Antibody Assessment was ordered demonstrating metabolic changes and food sensitivities. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: In this case, following a clinical laboratory assessment, treatment was initiated using nutrients and dietary changes. Fourteen months after consultation, the patient was symptom-free and her final laboratory assessment was essentially negative. She learned to work with her diet and the consequences resulting from breaking it. CONCLUSIONS: There is the need for a conservative approach to evaluation and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease before considering other more aggressive and potentially hazardous approaches. The patient's signs and symptoms responded to a unique method of evaluation and conservative management when other approaches had failed.},
