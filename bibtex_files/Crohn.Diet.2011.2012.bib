   abstract = {The diet of industrialized nations may contribute to the pathogenesis of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). Malnutrition is relatively unusual in UC, but in CD, which often affects the small intestine, it is frequent and may be severe. Nutrition support is therefore frequently indicated. First principles of artificial nutrition can be applied effectively using the gut whenever possible. Parenteral nutrition is generally required only in those with short bowel syndrome. An increasing literature (especially in pediatrics) favors the use of defined exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) in the primary treatment of active CD. Controlled trials are, however, lacking, and recommendations are accordingly not of the highest rank. It appears that in this context, simple polymeric regimens are usually sufficient, and there is currently insufficient evidence to make a strong recommendation for disease-specific feeds. In the maintenance of remission in CD, controlled data demonstrate that defined EN reduces the risk of relapse requiring steroid treatment. There are no data in support of primary nutrition therapy in UC either in management of the acute flare or in maintenance. In conclusion, nutrition therapy in adults with inflammatory bowel disease is probably both undervalued and underused, but the evidence base needs to be strengthened to confirm its efficacy, determine better those patients most likely to benefit, and optimize the regimens to be employed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Vitamin D influences innate immunity, which is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, data examining vitamin D status in relation to risk of CD and UC are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 72,719 women (age, 40-73 y) enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. In 1986, women completed an assessment of diet and lifestyle, from which a 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] prediction score was developed and validated against directly measured levels of plasma 25(OH)D. Through 2008, we confirmed reported diagnoses of incident CD or UC through medical record review. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to examine the hazard ratio (HR) for incident CD or UC after adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: During 1,492,811 person-years of follow-up evaluation, we documented 122 incident cases of CD and 123 cases of UC. The median predicted 25(OH)D level was 22.3 ng/mL in the lowest and 32.2 ng/mL in the highest quartiles. Compared with the lowest quartile, the multivariate-adjusted HR associated with the highest quartile of vitamin D was 0.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-.99) for CD (P(trend) = .02) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.34-1.25) for UC (P(trend) = .17). Compared with women with a predicted 25(OH)D level less than 20 ng/mL, the multivariate-adjusted HR was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.15-0.97) for CD and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.19-1.70) for UC for women with a predicted 25(OH)D level greater than 30 ng/mL. There was a significant inverse association between dietary and supplemental vitamin D and UC, and a nonsignificant reduction in CD risk. CONCLUSIONS: Higher predicted plasma levels of 25(OH)D significantly reduce the risk for incident CD and nonsignificantly reduce the risk for UC in women.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the environmental factors leading to inflammatory bowel disease should help to prevent occurrence of the disease and its relapses. AIM: To review current knowledge on dietary risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library were searched for studies on diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Established non-diet risk factors include family predisposition, smoking, appendectomy, and antibiotics. Retrospective case-control studies are encumbered with methodological problems. Prospective studies on European cohorts, mainly including middle-aged adults, suggest that a diet high in protein from meat and fish is associated with a higher risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Intake of the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid may confer risk of ulcerative colitis, whereas n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective. No effect was found of intake of dietary fibres, sugar, macronutrients, total energy, vitamin C, D, E, Carotene, or Retinol (vitamin A) on risk of ulcerative colitis. No prospective data was found on risk related to intake of fruits, vegetables or food microparticles (titanium dioxide and aluminium silicate). CONCLUSIONS: A diet high in protein, particular animal protein, may be associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease and relapses. N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids may predispose to ulcerative colitis whilst n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid may protect. These results should be confirmed in other countries and in younger subjects before dietary counselling is recommended in high risk subjects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is common in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. This paper reports on the prevalence of decreased BMD in a referral cohort study of CD-patients next to the change of BMD over time in relation with CD-associated clinical characteristics. METHODS: 205 CD patients of a referral hospital were enrolled between January1998-January 2010 when measurement of BMD by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was available. Follow-up DXA scan was performed in subjects with known risk factors besides Crohn indicative for low BMD. Treatment of CD patients was according to a protocol which is comparable to the current (inter)national guidelines. In osteopenic patients, supplemental vitamin D (800 IU) and Calcium (500-1000 mg) were prescribed. RESULTS: Mean BMD at baseline was 0.97 +/- 0.16 gram/cm(2) in lumbar spine and 0.87 +/- 0.12 gram/cm(2) in the total hip. At baseline, higher age and low Body Mass Index (BMI), were negatively correlated with BMD. Eighty-four patients underwent a second BMD assessment with a median interval period of 4 years (IQR 3-6). A mean annual increase of +0.76% (95%CI: -2.63%; +3.87%) in lumbar spine and +0.43% (95%CI: -2.65% ; +1.11%) in total hip was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Higher age, male sex, low BMI, and a higher age at diagnosis of CD were associated with low BMD. Follow-up of BMD in CD patients showed a contraintuitive small increase of BMD at lumbar spine and total hip in CD patients only using supplemental vitamin D and calcium next to strict treatment of CD.},

   abstract = {The underlying biochemical consequences of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on the systemic and gastrointestinal metabolism have not yet been fully elucidated but could help to better understand the disease pathogenesis and to identify tissue-specific markers associated with the different disease stages. Here, we applied a metabonomic approach to monitor metabolic events associated with the gradual development of Crohn's disease (CD)-like ileitis in the TNF(DeltaARE/WT) mouse model. Metabolic profiles of different intestinal compartments from the age of 4 up to 24 weeks were generated by combining proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). From 8 weeks onward, mice developed CD similar to the immune and tissue-related phenotype of human CD with ileal involvement, including ileal histological abnormalities, reduced fat mass and body weight, as well as hallmarks of malabsorption with higher energy wasting. The metabonomic approach highlighted shifts in the intestinal lipid metabolism concomitant to the histological onset of inflammation. Moreover, the advanced disease status was characterized by a significantly altered metabolism of cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, plasmalogens, and sphingomyelins in the inflamed tissue (ileum) and the adjacent intestinal parts (proximal colon). These results describe different biological processes associated with the disease onset, including modifications of the general cell membrane composition, alteration of energy homeostasis, and finally the generation of inflammatory lipid mediators. Taken together, this provides novel insights into IBD-related alterations of specific lipid-dependant processes during inflammatory states.},

   abstract = {Microparticles are small (<1 microm), nonbiological particles that are used in many areas of daily life. As food additive they are used as anticaking agents or food colorants. The most common food-derived ingested compounds are aluminium silicate and titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), the latter being a white pigment used in toothpaste or sugar toppings. The increasing abundance of microparticles in the Western diet raises the question of the potential risks associated with gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease (CD). Accumulation of particles has been shown in cells of Peyer's patches, but it is not clear whether this also has pathological effects. NLRP3 is a member of the intracellular pattern recognition receptor family and it is part of the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex containing caspase-1 which activates the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18. With regard to recent findings identifying small particles such as asbestos and monosodium urate as NLRP3 activators, TiO(2) may be another potential target for inflammasome studies. We found that macrophage-like cells readily take up TiO(2) after 6 h. Incubation of cells with TiO(2) resulted in the assembly of NLRP3 with caspase-1. This inflammasome assembly correlated with secretion of IL-1beta. In intestinal epithelial cells, TiO(2) also was found to be ingested. The counting of particles localized intracellularly revealed a dose-dependent increase of TiO(2)-positive cells. This points to the fact that in humans with a leaky intestinal barrier (such as IBD patients), TiO(2) microparticles may be taken up by macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells, may activate the inflammasome and induce IL-1beta and IL-18 secretion. This may aggravate inflammation in susceptible individuals.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the BC of the patients with CD in active and remission phase, and compare with healthy controls (HC). METHODS: BC was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis using Tanita TBF-215 leg to leg portable impedance analyzer in 123 patients with CD and 100 matched HC. Diet intake was assessed by 24 hours diet recall method. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 36.4 +/- 12.6 years and 56% were males. Patients in active phase as well as in remission phase had a lower BMI than HC (18.8 +/- 3.6 vs. 23.9 +/- 4.0; p = 0.001 and 18.8 +/- 3.6 vs. 21.6 +/- 5.0; p = 0.002). The fat mass (FM) in active phase was significantly lower than that in remission phase (8.2 +/- 5.9 vs. 13.4 +/- 10.6 kg; p = 0.005) and HC (8.2 +/- 5.9 kg vs. 14.1 +/- 7.5 kg; p = 0.001). FM did not differ between remission phase and HC. The fat free mass (FFM) of HC was significantly higher than that of both remission phase (48.9 +/- 7.4 kg vs. 43.3 +/- 10.4 kg; p = 0.001) and active phase (48.9 +/- 7.4 kg vs. 40.7 +/- 8.5 kg; p = 0.001). There was no difference in the FFM of patients in both phases; p = 0.356. The intake of macronutrients was comparable between the two phases; however lower than that of HC. CONCLUSION: Both FM and FFM were depleted in the active phase, while only FFM was deficient in the remission phase of CD, indicating a poor recovery of lean mass in remission.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors that trigger an inappropriate immune response to commensal gut bacteria. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is well known for its involvement in the toxicity of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), an environmental contaminant that affects people primarily through the diet. Recently, TCDD was shown to suppress immune responses by generating regulatory T cells (Tregs). We hypothesized that AhR activation dampens inflammation associated with Crohn's disease. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) murine model of colitis. Mice were gavaged with TCDD prior to colitis induction with TNBS. Several parameters were examined including colonic inflammation via histological and flow cytometric analyses. TCDD-treated mice recovered body weight faster and experienced significantly less colonic damage. Reduced levels of interleukin (IL) 6, IL-12, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha demonstrated suppression of inflammation in the gut following TCDD exposure. Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)(egfp) mice revealed that TCDD increased the Foxp3+ Treg population in gut immune tissue following TNBS exposure. Collectively, these results suggest that activation of the AhR by TCDD decreases colonic inflammation in a murine model of colitis in part by generating regulatory immune cells. Ultimately, this work may lead to the development of more effective therapeutics for the treatment of Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {As inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to emerge with rising prevalence rates in the developed world and rising incidence rates in the developing world, it has become clear that environmental factors play a critical role in disease etiology. While no single environmental factor has been proven to have a definite causative role, there are several leading candidates. Smoking has been shown to adversely impact on the course of Crohn's disease (CD), but is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause CD. Considering that the countries with the highest smoking rates in the world have among the lowest rates of CD, it is more likely that smoking modulates CD once it is present as opposed to being directly causative. Diet likely plays a role, perhaps by modulating the gut microbiome directly or indirectly by impacting on the gut immune homeostasis. Antibiotics have become ubiquitously prescribed in the developed world and their emergence coincided with the emergence of IBD in the middle of the 20th century. Antibiotic use is also increasing in the developing world, and perhaps by modulating the gut microbiome this may be facilitating the emergence of IBD where it was rare 40 years ago. Finally, personal stress has intestinal physiological and immunological effects and is assuming an increasing role in the management of IBD.},

   abstract = {Traditionally, half of the direct costs associated with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) [Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)] have related to hospital inpatient treatment for a sub-group of more severely affected, often therapy-resistant individuals. The advent of effective but relatively expensive biological agents has increased the contribution of drugs to overall medical care costs. This has focussed interest on the relative cost effectiveness of rival therapies for IBD and, in particular, on the affordability of long-term biological therapy. The purpose of this article is to review the available literature on this topic and to identify areas for future research. Head-to-head trials of competing treatment options are uncommon and clinical trials have seldom addressed cost effectiveness. In UC, models have explored the cost utility of 'high-' versus 'standard-' dose 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) therapy and the theoretical impact of improved adherence with once-daily formulations. In CD, cost-utility models for anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) drugs versus standard care have suggested consistently that incremental benefits are achieved at increased overall cost. However, studies of varying design have produced a wide spectrum of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates, which highlights the challenges and limitations of existing modelling techniques.},

   abstract = {Dietary methyl donors and their genetic determinants are associated with Crohn's disease risk. We investigated whether a methyl-deficient diet (MDD) may affect development and functions of the small intestine in rat pups from dams subjected to the MDD during gestation and lactation. At 1 month before pregnancy, adult females were fed with either a standard food or a diet without vitamin B12, folate and choline. A global wall hypotrophy was observed in the distal small bowel (MDD animals 0.30 mm v. controls 0.58 mm; P< 0.001) with increased crypt apoptosis (3.37 v. 0.4%; P< 0.001), loss of enterocyte differentiation in the villus and a reduction in intestinal alkaline phosphatase production. Cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining (MDD animals 3.37% v. controls 0.4%, P< 0.001) and the Apostain labelling index showed increased crypt apoptosis (3.5 v. 1.4%; P= 0.018). Decreased proliferation was observed in crypts of the proximal small bowel with a reduced number of minichromosome maintenance 6 (MDD animals 52.83% v. controls 83.17%; P= 0.048) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells (46.25 v. 59 %; P= 0.05). This lack of enterocyte differentiation in the distal small bowel was associated with an impaired expression of beta-catenin and a decreased beta-catenin-E-cadherin interaction. The MDD affected the intestinal barrier in the proximal small bowel by decreasing Paneth cell number after immunostaining for lysosyme (MDD animals 8.66% v. controls 21.66%) and by reducing goblet cell number and mucus production after immunostaining for mucin-2 (crypts 8.66 v. 15.33%; villus 7 v. 17%). The MDD has dual effects on the small intestine by producing dramatic effects on enterocyte differentiation and barrier function in rats.},

The objectives of this article are to provide clinicians with existing dietary advice by presenting the dietary information proposed by medical societies in the form of clinical practice guidelines as it relates to IBD; listing dietary guidelines from patient-centered IBD-related organizations; and creating a new 'global practice guideline' that attempts to consolidate the existing information regarding diet and IBD. The dietary suggestions derived from sources found in this article include nutritional deficiency screening, avoiding foods that worsen symptoms, eating smaller meals at more frequent intervals, drinking adequate fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, taking vitamin/mineral supplementation, eliminating dairy if lactose intolerant, limiting excess fat, reducing carbohydrates and reducing high-fiber foods during flares. Mixed advice exists regarding probiotics. Enteral nutrition is recommended for Crohn's disease patients in Japan, which differs from practices in the USA.},

   abstract = {The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will be discussed.},

   abstract = {Besides their possible effects on the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), some environmental factors can modulate the clinical course of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This review is mainly devoted to describing the current knowledge of the impact of some of these factors on the outcome of IBD, with special emphasis on smoking and diet. Although the impact of smoking on the susceptibility to develop CD and UC is firmly established, its influence on the clinical course of both diseases is still debatable. In CD, active smoking is a risk factor for postoperative recurrence. Beyond this clinical setting, smoking cessation seems to be advantageous in those CD patients who were smokers at disease diagnosis, while smoking resumption may be of benefit in ex-smokers with resistant UC. The role of dietary habits on the development of IBD is far from being well established. Also, food intolerances are very frequent, but usually inconsistent among IBD patients, and therefore no general dietary recommendations can be made in these patients. In general, IBD patients should eat a diet as varied as possible. Regarding the possible therapeutic role of some dietary components in IBD, lessons should be drawn from the investigation of the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in CD. Low-fat diets seem to be particularly useful. Also, some lipid sources, such as olive oil, medium-chain triglycerides, and perhaps omega-3 fatty acids, might have a therapeutic effect. Fermentable fiber may have a role in preventing relapses in inactive UC.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIM: Despite their well known anti-inflammatory actions, the clinical usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel disease is controversial. We aimed to systematically review the available data on the performance of omega-3 PUFA as therapeutic agents in these patients. METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched for RCT of fish oil or omega-3 PUFA therapy in both active and inactive ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, without limitation on either the length of therapy or the form it was given, including nutritional supplements and enteral formula diets. Eligible articles were assessed for methodological quality on the basis of the adequacy of the randomisation process, concealment of allocation, blinding of intervention and outcome, possible biases, and completeness of follow-up. The five-point Oxford quality score was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 19 RCT were finally selected for this review. Overall, available data do not allow to support the use of omega-3 PUFA supplementation for the treatment of both active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease. Negative results are quite consistent in trials assessing the use of omega-3 PUFA to maintain disease remission, particularly ulcerative colitis, and to a lesser extent Crohn's disease. Trials on their use in active disease do not allow to draw firm conclusions mainly because the heterogeneity of design (ulcerative colitis) or their short number (Crohn's disease). In most trials, the appropriateness of the selected placebo is questionable. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review does not allow to make firm recommendations about the usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein responses (UPR) are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Cytotoxic CD8alphabeta(+) intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) contribute to the development of Crohn's disease-like ileitis in TNF(DeltaARE/+) mice. In this study, we characterized the role of ER-UPR mechanisms in contributing to the disease-associated phenotype of cytotoxic IEL under conditions of chronic inflammation. Inflamed TNF(DeltaARE/+) mice exhibited increased expression of Grp78, ATF6, ATF4, and spliced XBP1 in CD8alphabeta(+) IEL but not in CD8alphaalpha(+) IEL or in lamina propria lymphocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis in CD8alphabeta(+) T cells showed selective recruitment of ER-UPR transducers to the granzyme B gene promoter. Heterozygous Grp78(-/+) mice exhibited an attenuated granzyme B-dependent cytotoxicity of CD8alphabeta(+) T cells against intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting a critical activity of this ER-associated chaperone in maintaining a cytotoxic T cell phenotype. Granzyme B-deficient CD8alphabeta(+) T cells showed a defect in IL-2-mediated proliferation in Grp78(-/+) mice. Adoptively transferred Grp78(-/+) CD8alphabeta(+) T cells had a decreased frequency of accumulation in the intestine of RAG2(-/-) recipient mice. The tissue pathology in TNF(DeltaARE/+) x Grp78(-/+) mice was similar to TNF(DeltaARE/+) mice, even though the cytotoxic effector functions of CD8alphabeta(+) T cells were significantly reduced. In conclusion, ER stress-associated UPR mechanisms promote the development and maintenance of the pathogenic cytotoxic CD8alphabeta(+) IEL phenotype in the mouse model of Crohn's disease-like ileitis.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), results in substantial morbidity and is difficult to treat. New strategies for adjunct therapies are needed. One candidate is the semi-essential amino acid, L-arginine (L-Arg), a complementary medicine purported to be an enhancer of immunity and vitality in the lay media. Using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) as a murine colonic injury and repair model with similarities to human UC, we assessed the effect of L-Arg, as DSS induced increases in colonic expression of the y(+) cationic amino acid transporter 2 (CAT2) and L-Arg uptake. L-Arg supplementation improved the clinical parameters of survival, body weight loss, and colon weight, and reduced colonic permeability and the number of myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils in DSS colitis. Luminex-based multi-analyte profiling demonstrated that there was a marked reduction in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression with L-Arg treatment. Genomic analysis by microarray demonstrated that DSS-treated mice supplemented with L-Arg clustered more closely with mice not exposed to DSS than to those receiving DSS alone, and revealed that multiple genes that were upregulated or downregulated with DSS alone exhibited normalization of expression with L-Arg supplementation. Additionally, L-Arg treatment of mice with DSS colitis resulted in increased ex vivo migration of colonic epithelial cells, suggestive of increased capacity for wound repair. Because CAT2 induction was sustained during L-Arg treatment and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) requires uptake of L-Arg for generation of NO, we tested the effect of L-Arg in iNOS(-/-) mice and found that its benefits in DSS colitis were eliminated. These preclinical studies indicate that L-Arg supplementation could be a potential therapy for IBD, and that one mechanism of action may be functional enhancement of iNOS activity.},

In 2001, she underwent a total colectomy and further small bowel resection as a result of active Crohn's. Her residual anatomy consisted of 150 cm of small bowel to an end jejunostomy. Subsequently, she developed short bowel syndrome with recurrent episodes of hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia, and hypokalaemia. Dietetic assessment revealed her to be severely underweight at 37 kg with a bodymass index (BMI) of 14.4 kg/m(2) . During her admission, our patient underwent psychiatric assessment and was established on home parenteral nutrition (HPN). At the time of discharge, 1 month later, her weight had increased to 44 kg (BMI = 17.7 kg/m(2) ). Over the following 12-month period, she lost weight (BMI, 15.4 mg/m(2) ; weight, 39.5 kg) and she described a high stoma output (up to 17 L) and dehydration. Assessment of her oral intake found she was consuming an estimated 14,000 kcal and 600 g protein per day. At this time, the possibility of a new form of eating disorder was discussed with the patient and she agreed that her behavior i.e., using her stoma as a purging device, fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa and she was referred to a specialist eating disorder unit.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that most commonly involves the terminal ileum and colon (55 percent). Surgical treatment is required in approximately 70 percent of patients. Multiple procedures and repeat operations are required in 30 - 70 percent of all patients (Duepree 2002) but the disease remains incurable.Laparoscopy has gained wide acceptance in gastrointestinal surgery with potential advantages of faster return to normal activity and diet, reduced hospital stay, reduced postoperative pain, better cosmesis (Duepree 2002, Dunker 1998, Milsom 2001, Reissman 1996), improved social and sexual interaction (Albaz 2000) and its use is accepted in benign and malignant colorectal diseases. Laparoscopic surgery offers additional advantage of smaller abdominal fascial wounds, low incidence of hernias, and decreased rate of adhesive small-bowel obstruction (Albaz 2000) compared with conventional surgery reducing the need for non-disease-related surgical procedures in CD population.There are concerns about missing occult segments of disease and critical proximal strictures due to limited tactile ability, earlier recurrence due to possible reduced immune response induced by laparoscopy, technical difficulty due to fragile inflamed bowel and mesentery and the existence of adhesions, fistulas, and abscesses (Uchikoshi 2004). It is therefore important to evaluate the potential benefits and risks of laparoscopic surgery versus open surgery in patients with small bowel CD (Lowney 2005). OBJECTIVES: To determine if there is a difference in the perioperative outcomes and re-operation rates for disease recurrence following laparoscopic surgery compared to open surgery in small bowel CD. SEARCH STRATEGY: Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials were searched for in the following electronic databases: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2010 issue 2 The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) 2010 issue 2 The Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group Controlled Trials Register Ovid MEDLINE (1990 to 2010) EMBASE (1990 to 2010) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (1990 to 2010) SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for small bowel CD were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed the studies and extracted data. RevMan 5.0 was used for statistical analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Two RCTs comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for small bowel CD were identified. Long term outcomes of the patients in both the trials were published separately and these were included in the review.Laparoscopic surgery appeared to be associated with reduced number of wound infections (1/61 vs 9/59), reoperation rates for non disease related complications (3/57 vs 7/54 ) but the difference was not statistically significant [p values were 0.23 and 0.19 respectively]. There was no statistically significant difference between any of the compared outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgery in the management of small bowel CD. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery for small bowel CD may be as safe as the open operation. There was no significant difference in the perioperative outcomes and the long term reoperation rates for disease-related or non-disease related complications of CD.},

Nutritional interventions either alone or associated to drug therapy may be effective to achieve and maintain inflammation remission. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate usual food intake as quantitative and qualitatively, in CD patients; and describe the effect of a supplement containing whey proteins and TGF- on their body composition. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dietary intake was assessed considering 42 consecutive patients, followed in a tertiary center, and by using the 3-day food recall and food intake frequency questionnaire. Body composition was assessed previously and 8 weeks after supplementation with a diet containing whey proteins and TGF-beta (N = 22). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Considering carbohydrates and lipids, most patients had adequate dietary intake according recommendations. Protein, saturated fat, B12 vitamin and zinc intakes were higher than the recommended values. The dietary fiber, A, D, C and E vitamins, calcium, iron, folate, potassium and sodium intakes did not reach the recommended requirements in most patients. Patients supplemented with the whey protein and TGF-beta dietary presented a positive increment in their lean body mass, when compared to non-supplemented group. CONCLUSION: CD patients require nutritional orientation. Whey protein intake resulted in significant differences, such as improvement in Lean Body Mass and reduction in Fat percentage.},

   abstract = {Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is the most important anti-inflammatory cytokine at intestinal level, and its absence is involved in inflammatory bowel diseases. However, oral treatment with IL-10 is difficult because of its low survival in the gastrointestinal tract and systemic treatments lead to undesirable side effects. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of the administration of milks fermented by Lactococcus lactis strains that produce IL-10 under the control of the xylose-inducible expression system using a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis murine model. Mice that received milks fermented by L. lactis strains producing IL-10 in the cytoplasm (Cyt strain) or secreted to the product (Sec strain) showed lower damage scores in their large intestines, decreased IFN-gamma levels in their intestinal fluids and lower microbial translocation to liver, compared to mice receiving milk fermented by the wild-type strain or those not receiving any treatment. The results obtained in this study show that the employment of fermented milks as a new form of administration of IL-10-producing L. lactisis effective in the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease in a murine model.},

This disease has a fluctuating course, with alternating periods of remission and relapses, and it is characterized by a remarkable clinical heterogeneity; it may be complicated by perianal fistulas, abscesses, and intestinal strictures leading to obstructions, besides several systemic manifestations. However, a complete resolution of the disease is currently not possible, yet Crohn's disease can be managed with established and novel therapies, which achieve long-term remission and acceptable quality of life.

An adjacent small node was sampled for frozen biopsy, revealing a lymph node infiltrated with adenocarcinoma. Laparoscopic assisted small bowel resection and appendectomy were carried out. Final pathological results supported the initial report of diffuse small bowel adenocarcinoma.

Similarly, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are also prevalent in these regions. Evidence exists to support that factors, such as lack of zinc (it is common in patients with IBD, in particular Crohn's patients) may significantly affect the activity of some enzymes, such as, disaccharidases and other digesting enzymes of carbohydrates and that would lead to the recruitment of incompletely digested carbohydrates to the terminal ileum and continual stimulation of the immune-response accordingly. This concept may explain the observation of the existence of higher significant percentage of severe disease in Caucasian patients with IBD comparable with the respected Asian patients who consume less.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing condition that has no certain cure. Both genetic susceptibility and nutrition have key roles, but their level of involvement varies between patients. Interacting gene pathways influence the probability of disease development, but these are affected by stress and various environmental factors, including diet. In addition, the role of the gut microbiome must not be underestimated, as it is substantially altered in patients with Crohn's disease. Although an elemental diet might lead to disease remission, reintroducing real foods and sustainable diets in patients with Crohn's disease is currently difficult, and would benefit from the sensitivity and rapid feedback provided by the field of nutrigenomics. Nutrigenomics utilizes high-throughput genomics technologies to reveal changes in gene and protein expression that are modulated by the patient's nutrition. The most widely used technique thus far is transcriptomics, which permits measurement of changes in the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously in one sample. Given the volume of numbers generated in such studies, data-basing and bioinformatics are essential to ensure the correct application of nutrigenomics at the population level. These methods have been successfully applied to animal models of Crohn's disease, and the time is right to move them to human studies.},

It is here where a single layer of epithelial cells mediates the intricate encounters that occur between the host's immune system and a multitude of potential threats present in the intestinal lumen. Several key factors play an important role in the final outcome of this interaction, including the state of oxidative stress, the level of activation of the immune cells, and the integrity of the epithelial barrier. This chapter describes the main evidence demonstrating the impact that l-carnitine has on each of these factors. These findings, combined with the demonstrated safety profile of l-carnitine, underscore the potential therapeutic value of l-carnitine supplementation in humans suffering from intestinal inflammation and highlight the functional data supporting an association between Crohn's disease and mutations in the l-carnitine transporter genes.},

   abstract = {Intestinal lymphangiectasia in the adult may be characterized as a disorder with dilated intestinal lacteals causing loss of lymph into the lumen of the small intestine and resultant hypoproteinemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia and reduced number of circulating lymphocytes or lymphopenia. Most often, intestinal lymphangiectasia has been recorded in children, often in neonates, usually with other congenital abnormalities but initial definition in adults including the elderly has become increasingly more common. Shared clinical features with the pediatric population such as bilateral lower limb edema, sometimes with lymphedema, pleural effusion and chylous ascites may occur but these reflect the severe end of the clinical spectrum. In some, diarrhea occurs with steatorrhea along with increased fecal loss of protein, reflected in increased fecal alpha-1-antitrypsin levels, while others may present with iron deficiency anemia, sometimes associated with occult small intestinal bleeding. Most lymphangiectasia in adults detected in recent years, however, appears to have few or no clinical features of malabsorption. Diagnosis remains dependent on endoscopic changes confirmed by small bowel biopsy showing histological evidence of intestinal lymphangiectasia. In some, video capsule endoscopy and enteroscopy have revealed more extensive changes along the length of the small intestine. A critical diagnostic element in adults with lymphangiectasia is the exclusion of entities (e.g. malignancies including lymphoma) that might lead to obstruction of the lymphatic system and "secondary" changes in the small bowel biopsy. In addition, occult infectious (e.g. Whipple's disease from Tropheryma whipplei) or inflammatory disorders (e.g. Crohn's disease) may also present with profound changes in intestinal permeability and protein-losing enteropathy that also require exclusion. Conversely, rare B-cell type lymphomas have also been described even decades following initial diagnosis of intestinal lymphangiectasia. Treatment has been historically defined to include a low fat diet with medium-chain triglyceride supplementation that leads to portal venous rather than lacteal uptake. A number of other pharmacological measures have been reported or proposed but these are largely anecdotal. Finally, rare reports of localized surgical resection of involved areas of small intestine have been described but follow-up in these cases is often limited.},

Pathogenesis of IBD is discussed connecting microbial flora, host immunity, and genetic interactions. The best studied genetic example, NOD2 in Crohn's disease, is highlighted as a model which encompasses these interactions and has been shown to depend on butyrate for normal function. The role of these opposing concepts in management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is contrasted with what is known in IBD. The conclusion reached is that, while both approaches may alleviate symptoms in both IBS and IBD, there is insufficient data yet to determine whether both approaches lead to equivalent bacterial effects in mollifying the immune system. This is particularly relevant in IBD. As such, caution is urged to use long-term carbohydrate withdrawal in IBD in remission to control IBS-like symptoms.},

METHODS: In this series, 20 consecutive unselected patients underwent LESS colorectal surgery including right hemicolectomy (n = 3), extended right hemicolectomy, high anterior resection (n = 2), low anterior resection involving total mesorectal excision (TME; n = 3), ileocolic anastomosis (n = 2, including 1 redo surgery), colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (n = 4, including 1 with ventral mesh rectopexy), panproctocolectomy (n = 2), proctocolectomy and ileoanal pouch (n = 2) and an abdominoperineal excision of rectum. Single-port conventional instrumentation and transversus abdominus plane (TAP) block analgesia were used. The indications included cancer (n = 8), Crohn's disease (n = 4), ulcerative colitis (n = 3) complicated diverticulosis (n = 2), and slow-transit constipation (n = 3). Eight of the patients had undergone previous surgery. RESULTS: Most of the cases (90%) were managed successfully using the LESS technique and conventional instrumentation. Two operations (10%) were converted to standard laparoscopy, due to insufficient theater time and an unstable port. The operative time ranged from 45 to 240 min (median, 110 min). A normal diet was tolerated within 6 h by 7 patients and in 12 to 16 h (overnight) by 11 patients. Complications included anastomotic bleed (n = 1), ileus (n = 2), acute renal failure secondary to hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia (n = 1), urine retention (n = 1), and wound infection (n = 1). The median hospital stay was 46 h (range, 7-384 h). Eight patients were discharged within 24 h. There was one readmission (5%). CONCLUSION: Laparoendoscopic single-site colorectal resection using conventional instrumentation is feasible and safe when performed by an experienced team. The LESS approach may have advantages in terms of minimal pain, cosmesis, lower costs, and faster recovery. A randomized trial is required to confirm whether LESS offers a true patient benefit over standard laparoscopic resection.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions, which are increasing in incidence, prevalence, and severity, in many countries. While there is genetic susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways. Distinguishing cause from effect, and characterizing the relative roles of human and microbial genes, diet, age of onset, gender, life style, smoking history, ethnic background, environmental exposures, and medications, will require innovative and internationally integrated approaches.},

   abstract = {Disease-associated undernutrition of all types is very common in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent weight loss remains one of the triad of clinical manifestations and a cornerstone for the diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD), although significantly fewer patients now present as being underweight. Recent evidence suggests that the introduction of medical treatment will quickly restore body weight, although this does not reflect concomitant changes in body composition. CD children present with features of nutritional cachexia with normal fat stores but depleted lean mass. Poor bone health, delayed puberty and growth failure are additional features that further complicate clinical management. Suboptimal nutritional intake is a main determinant of undernutrition, although activation of the immune system and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines exert additional independent effects. Biochemically low concentrations of plasma micronutrients are commonly reported in IBD patients, although their interpretation is difficult in the presence of an acute phase response and other indices of body stores adequacy are needed. Anaemia is a common extraintestinal manifestation of the IBD child. Iron-deficient anaemia is the predominant type, with anaemia of chronic disease second. Decreased dietary intake, as a result of decreased appetite and food aversion, is the major cause of undernutrition in paediatric IBD. Altered energy and nutrient requirements, malabsorption and increased gastrointestinal losses are additional factors, although their contribution to undernutrition in paediatric CD needs to be studied further.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy is the primary treatment for active pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) in the UK/Europe, improving disease activity and anthropometry. This study assessed changes in micronutrient status during exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). METHODS: Seventeen children (male/female: 8/9; median age: 12.7 years) with active CD were treated exclusively for 6-8 weeks on a polymeric feed (Modulen IBD; Nestle, UK). Body impedance was measured at baseline, during EEN, and posttreatment on normal diet and converted to z-scores of fat and lean mass. Blood samples for nutrient analysis were collected from 13 children at baseline, end of EEN, and posttreatment. RESULTS: Lean but not fat mass improved at the end of EEN (initiation vs. end of EEN; fat mass [z-score]: -0.5 vs. -0.3; P = 0.141; lean mass [z-score]: -2.1 vs. -0.8; P < 0.0001). At baseline several children presented with suboptimal concentrations of carotenoids, trace elements, vitamin C, B6, and folate in plasma but not in erythrocytes. EEN improved concentrations for several nutrients, but more than 90% of patients had depleted concentrations of all carotenoids. The latter improved on normal diet but other micronutrients, which improved during EEN, returned toward pretreatment concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Lean but not fat mass improved at the end of EEN. Median concentrations for several plasma micronutrients improved on EEN but carotenoids were depleted. These findings may have implications for clinical practice and producers of enteral feeds. As plasma concentrations for many micronutrients can be affected by the acute phase response, measurements in erythrocytes may be a better marker of actual body stores.},

   abstract = {Chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) affect bone metabolism and are frequently associated with the presence of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. Although several mechanisms may contribute to skeletal abnormalities in IBD patients, inflammation and inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 may be the most critical. It is not clear whether the changes in bone metabolism leading to decreased mineral density are the result of decreased bone formation, increased bone resorption, or both, with varying results reported in experimental models of IBD and in pediatric and adult IBD patients. New data, including our own, challenge the conventional views, and contributes to the unraveling of an increasingly complex network of interactions leading to the inflammation-associated bone loss. Since nutritional interventions (dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation) are of limited efficacy in IBD patients, understanding the pathophysiology of osteopenia and osteoporosis in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is critical for the correct choice of available treatments or the development of new targeted therapies. In this review, we discuss current concepts explaining the effects of inflammation, inflammatory mediators and their signaling effectors on calcium and phosphate homeostasis, osteoblast and osteoclast function, and the potential limitations of vitamin D used as an immunomodulator and anabolic hormone in IBD.},

   abstract = {Mastic (Pistacia lentiscus) of the Anacardiaceae family has exhibited anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in patients with Crohn's disease. This study was based on the hypothesis that mastic inhibits intestinal damage in inflammatory bowel disease, regulating inflammation and oxidative stress in intestinal epithelium. Four different dosages of P. lentiscus powder in the form of powder were administered orally to trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitic rats. Eighty-four male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to seven groups: A, control; B, colitic; C-F, colitic rats daily supplemented with P. lentiscus powder at (C) 50 mg/kg, (D) 100 mg/kg, (E) 200 mg/kg, and (F) 300 mg/kg of body weight; and G, colitic rats treated daily with cortisone (25 mug/kg of body weight). Colonic damage was assessed microscopically. The cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10 and malonaldehyde were measured in colonic specimens. Results were expressed as mean +/- SE values. Histological amelioration of colitis (P</=.001) and significant differences in colonic indices occurred after 3 days of treatment. Daily administration of 100 mg of P. lentiscus powder/kg of body weight decreased all inflammatory cytokines (P</=.05), whereas 50 mg of P. lentiscus powder/kg of body weight and cortisone treatment reduced only ICAM-1 (P</=.05 and P</=.01, respectively). Malonaldehyde was significantly suppressed in all treated groups (P</=.01). IL-10 remained unchanged. Cytokines and malonaldehyde remained unaltered after 6 days of treatment. Thus P. lentiscus powder could possibly have a therapeutic role in Crohn's disease, regulating oxidant/antioxidant balance and modulating inflammation.},

   abstract = {Vitamin D deficiency, diagnosed when the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD(3)) concentration is less than 20 ng/mL, has joined vitamin A deficiency as two of the most common nutrition-responsive medical conditions worldwide. There have been more scientific articles published about vitamin D in the 21st century than about any other vitamin, reflecting the massive expansion of the field of vitamin D research. Adequate vitamin D status has been linked to decreased risks of developing specific cancers, including cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, gallbladder, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus, ovary, prostate, urinary bladder, kidney, skin, thyroid, and hematopoietic system (e.g., Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma); bacterial infections; rheumatoid arthritis; Crohn's disease; periodontal disease; multiple sclerosis; asthma; type 2 diabetes; cardiovascular disease; stroke; peripheral artery disease; hypertension; chronic kidney disease; muscle weakness; cognitive impairment; Alzheimer's disease; clinical depression; and premature death. On the other hand, inadequate vitamin D status during human pregnancy may be associated with increased risk for the development of type 1 diabetes in the offspring. However, this point of view may be excessively optimistic. There also is evidence that despite the current heavy reliance on serum 25-OHD(3) concentration for the diagnosis of an individual's vitamin D status, local tissue vitamin D intoxication may be present in individuals with much lower serum 25-OHD(3) concentrations than are currently appreciated. Only rarely are the symptoms of local tissue vitamin D intoxication associated with vitamin D status or intake. An individual's serum 25-OHD(3) concentration may appear to be "low" for reasons totally independent of sunlight exposure or vitamin D intake. Serum 25-OHD(3) concentration is only poorly responsive to increases in vitamin D intake, and the prolonged routine consumption of thousands of international units of vitamin D may interfere with the regulation of phosphate homeostasis by fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) and the Klotho gene product, with consequences that are detrimental to human health. In light of these counterbalancing observations, curbing excessive enthusiasm for universally increasing vitamin D intake recommendations may be in order.},

In that sense, rosemary extracts have long been recognized as having antioxidant properties, and folic acid may be able to improve endothelial progenitor cell function. A mixture containing both has been tested as a possible nutraceutical to improve health complications in diabetes. We have developed the methodology to evaluate metabolic changes in the urine of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats after supplementing their diet with rosemary extract obtained with supercritical fluids (SFE) containing 10% folic acid in an acute but short-term study. It has been done with a metabolomics approach using LC-QTOF as an analytical tool. About 20 endogenous metabolites have been identified by databases and MS/MS showing statistically significant changes. Among them, several amino acids and their metabolites point to changes due to the effect of the gut microbiota. In addition, the comparison between control and streptozotocin-diabetic rats has permitted the showing of some metabolic coincidences between type 1 diabetes and other (possible) autoimmune diseases such as autism and/or Crohn's disease, and the nutraceutical intervention has succeeded in inducing changes in such biomarkers.},

Manipulation of diet and the microbioma will probably play an increasingly important role in the treatment of this disease and, in the long term, in its prevention. Biological agents will probably be used earlier and more widely; new information on levels of biological agents, mucosal healing and new comparative studies will also allow these agents to be used in a more precise and personalized way. In addition to infliximab, adalimumab, natalizumab and certolizumab, other biological agents will be employed; among the first of these to be used will be ustekinumab, golimumab and vedolizumab. In the near future, biological agents will be used as frequently in ulcerative colitis as in Crohn's disease. New healthcare models will be developed that will progressively include greater participation among patients and nurses. The ability to predict new diagnostic and prognostic models will allow decisions to be more individualized.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are more likely to have Crohn's disease (CD) than ulcerative colitis (UC) and their disease tends to be more extensive and severe than in adults. We hypothesized that the prevalence of anemia would therefore be greater in children and adolescents than in adults attending IBD outpatient clinics. METHODS: Using the WHO age-adjusted definitions of anemia we assessed the prevalence, severity, type, and response to treatment of anemia in patients attending pediatric, adolescent, and adult IBD clinics at our hospital. RESULTS: The prevalence of anemia was 70% (41/59) in children, 42% (24/54) in adolescents, and 40% (49/124) in adults (P < 0.01). Overall, children (88% [36/41]) and adolescents (83% [20/24]) were more often iron-deficient than adults (55% [27/49]) (P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression showed that both active disease (odds ratio [OR], 4.7 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5, 8.8) and attending the pediatric clinic (OR 3.7; 95% CI, 1.6, 8.4) but not the adolescent clinic predicted iron deficiency anemia. Fewer iron-deficient children (13% [5/36]) than adolescents (30% [6/20]) or adults (48% [13/27]) had been given oral iron (P < 0.05); none had received intravenous iron compared with 30% (6/20) adolescents and 41% (11/27) adults (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is even more common in children than in older IBD patients. Oral iron was given to half of adolescents and adults but, despite similar tolerance and efficacy, only a quarter of children with iron-deficient anemia. Reasons for the apparent underutilization of iron therapy include a perceived lack of benefit and concerns about side effects, including worsening of IBD activity.},

   abstract = {AIM: The general use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) as therapy for children with Crohn's disease (CD) in Sweden has not previously been studied. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate how EEN is used as therapy in Sweden for children with CD. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all 37 paediatric units in Sweden that treat children with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: The response rate was 78%, which covers nearly 90% of Sweden's paediatric population between 0 and 17 years of age. Ninety-six per cent of the units used EEN as a treatment option for children with CD, and 65% of the units used EEN as their primary therapy in newly diagnosed CD. The standard duration of EEN was 6 weeks, but the questionnaire revealed a span of 4-8 weeks. The use of polymeric formula was just as common as a combination of polymeric and elemental formulas. Fifty-seven per cent used oral nutrition supplements, and 81% allowed some extent of concomitant feeding, the addition of food and fluids, during EEN. All units used enteral nutrition to some extent as maintenance therapy after EEN was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: In Sweden, EEN is used as therapy for children with Crohn's disease (CD), but the EEN protocols vary as to choice of formula and type of food and fluids allowed during EEN. Standardized EEN protocols would enable multicentre studies in Sweden, with the objective of investigating how EEN treatment can be improved and employed in the most efficient way.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of an elemental formula (EF) to a polymeric formula (PF) in inducing remission for pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Newly diagnosed CD children were randomized to EF or PF for 6 weeks. Change in the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), fecal calprotectin, and plasma fatty acids were measured at 0 and 6 weeks. Patients were followed up for 2 years. Time and treatment choice for first relapse were documented. RESULTS: Thirty-four children completed the study; EF: 15 (7 M, 8 F), PF: 19 (13 M, 6 F). The mean age was (years) EF: 12.6, PF: 11.7. Ninety-three percent of children (14/15) achieved remission in the EF group and 79% (15/19) in the PF group. One-third of patients maintained remission for 2 years. Mean time to relapse (days); EF: 183 (63-286), PF: 162 (53-301). Most children who relapsed used feed as a treatment for that relapse (EF: 9/10 and PF: 8/13). With PF, an increase of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and alpha linolenic acid was found with a reciprocal decrease in arachidonic acid (AA). With EF, AA and EPA levels were reduced with a significant decrease in docosahexaenoic acid. Fecal calprotectin measurements decreased significantly but did not normalize at the end of week 6. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference between EF and PF in inducing remission. One-third of children maintained remission. Changes in plasma polyunsaturated fatty acid status were subtle and may be relevant; however, further evaluation is recommended.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are chronically relapsing, immune-mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. A major challenge in the treatment of IBD is the heterogenous nature of these pathologies. Both, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are of multifactorial etiology and feature a complex interaction of host genetic susceptibility and environmental factors such as diet and gut microbiota. Genome-wide association studies identified disease-relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms in approximately 100 genes, but at the same time twin studies also clearly indicated a strong environmental impact in disease development. However, attempts to link dietary factors to the risk of developing IBD, based on epidemiological observations showed controversial outcomes. Yet, emerging high-throughput technologies implying complete biological systems might allow taking nutrient-gene interactions into account for a better classification of patient subsets in the future. In this context, 2 new scientific fields, "nutrigenetics" and "nutrigenomics" have been established. "Nutrigenetics," studying the effect of genetic variations on nutrient-gene interactions and "Nutrigenomics," describing the impact of nutrition on physiology and health status on the level of gene transcription, protein expression, and metabolism. It is hoped that the integration of both research areas will promote the understanding of the complex gene-environment interaction in IBD etiology and in the long-term will lead to personalized nutrition for disease prevention and treatment. This review briefly summarizes data on the impact of nutrients on intestinal inflammation, highlights nutrient-gene interactions, and addresses the potential of applying "omic" technologies in the context of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: enteral (EN) and parenteral (TPN) nutrition exert variable therapeutic effects on the induction and maintenance of remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This review aims to provide an updated discussion on the complex relationship between diet and IBD. METHODS: medline, Cochrane and Scopus database searches were conducted. Sources cited in the articles obtained were also searched to identify other potential sources of information. RESULTS: nutritional status is significantly compromised in IBD patients, especially those with Crohn's disease (CD). Apart from restoring malnourishment, dietary components contribute to modulate intestinal immune responses. Nutritional treatment is divided into support therapy and primary therapy to induce and maintain remission through TPN and EN. EN is considered a first-line therapy in children with active CD whereas it is usually used in adult CD patients when corticosteroid therapy is not possible. TPN has limited effects on IBD.En formula composition, in terms of carbohydrates, nitrogen source and bioactive molecules supplementation, differentially influence on IBD treatment outcomes. Other dietary components, such as poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrate, polyols, and exogenous microparticles, also participate in the etiopathogenesis of IBD. Finally, new approaches to understanding the complex relationship between IBD and diet are provided by nutrigenenomic. CONCLUSION: further long-term, well-powered studies are required to accurately assess the usefulness of nutrition in treating IBD. In future research, the potential role of nutrient-gene interaction in drug trials and specific dietary formula compositions should be investigated in order to incorporate new knowledge about the etiopathology of IBD into nutritional intervention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: 6-Mercaptopurine is often used as maintenance therapy in patients with Crohn's disease. However, toxicities like myelosuppression limit its clinical benefit. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of elemental diet versus 6-mercaptopurine as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. METHODS: Ninety-five eligible patients with Crohn's disease activity index </=150 were randomly assigned to: 6-mercaptopurine (0.5-1.5mg/kg/day, n=30); Elental as an elemental diet (>/=900 kcal/day, n=32); none (control, n=33). In the three groups, patients were and remained on 5-aminosalicylic acid (2250-3000 mg/day). Patients were observed for 2 years and the rate of relapse (Crohn's disease activity index >/=200) was monitored. RESULTS: At 24 months, the fractions of patients who had maintained remission were 60%, 46.9% and 27.2% for 6-mercaptopurine, Elental and the control groups, respectively. Log-rank test showed better efficacy for 6-mercaptopurine (P=0.0041) and Elental (P=0.0348) versus control. No significant difference was found between 6-mercaptopurine and Elental. Further, in the 6-mercaptopurine group, 2 patients experienced liver injury and one developed alopecia. CONCLUSIONS: This 24 months comparison study showed that Elental as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease patients was as effective as 6-mercaptopurine. Elental should be useful for long-term maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. This is the first comparison study evaluating nutritional therapy versus 6-mercaptopurine.},

   abstract = {The primary purpose of this study was to test whether recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) supplementation would enhance protein synthesis and accretion of lean body mass. Eight adolescents (six males and two females; 17.2 +/- 2.6 years; age range, 13.7-21.2 years) participated in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial of rhGH. We employed stable isotopes to measure proteolysis and protein synthesis during fasting and fed conditions during two 6-month treatment conditions. We also measured bone mineral density (BMD), markers of bone turnover, and body composition. Whole-body proteolysis, phenylalanine catabolism, and protein synthesis did not differ during treatment with rhGH vs. placebo. Enteral nutrition suppressed proteolysis and increased protein synthesis similarly during placebo and rhGH treatments. We conclude that rhGH is unlikely to provide sufficient metabolic benefit to warrant its use as an adjunct treatment in clinically stable adolescents with Crohn disease. A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and suboptimal BMD existed, which deserves further investigation and clinical attention.},

The aim of the present study was to assess a number of formerly suggested environmental factors in a case-control study of an unselected and recently diagnosed group of patients with IBD and a control group of orthopaedic patients. METHODS: A total of 123 patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) and 144 with ulcerative colitis (UC) in Copenhagen (2003-2004) were matched 1:1 on age and gender to 267 orthopaedic controls. Participants received a questionnaire with 87 questions concerning environmental factors prior to IBD/orthopaedic admission. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by logistic regression. RESULTS: Being breastfed >6 months (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.23-1.11) and undergoing tonsillectomy (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31-0.78) decreased the odds for IBD, whereas appendectomy decreased the odds for UC only (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12-0.71). Vaccination against pertussis (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.07-4.03) and polio (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.04-5.43) increased the odds for IBD, whereas measles infection increased the odds for UC (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.15-10.6). Low consumption of fibres and high consumption of sugar were significantly associated with development of CD and UC. Smoking increased the risk for CD and protected against UC. CONCLUSION: Among Danish patients with CD and UC belonging to an unselected cohort, disease occurrence was found to be associated both with well-known factors such as smoking and appendectomy, and with more debated factors including breastfeeding, tonsillectomy, childhood vaccinations, childhood infections, and dietary intake of fibres and sugar.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: several studies have pointed out the effectiveness of the PillCam colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) compared with the colonoscopy in the study of the colonic pathology. AIMS AND METHODS: the objective of our study was to assess the agreement in the diagnosis of CCE with conventional colonoscopy as well as its sensitivity and specificity, and to describe the findings of the CCE in our clinical practice. Consecutive patients with abdominal symptoms were included in the study. The CCE was performed as previously reported (with PEG and sodium phosphate as laxative agents). The nature and location of the findings, colonic transit time, complications, cleanliness degree and consistency with diagnostic colonoscopy, when performed, were analyzed. RESULTS: a total of 144 subjects (67 women and 77 men); (52.17 +/- 16.71 years) with the following indications were included: screening of Colorectal cancer (88 patients), control after polipectomy (24), incomplete colonoscopy (7), rectal bleeding (10), anemia (8), diarrhea (7). The CCE exploration was complete in 134/144 cases (93%), with no case of retention. The preparation was good-very good in 88/134 (65,6%), fair in 26/134 (19,4%) and poor in 20/134 (15%) of the cases. The average colonic transit was of 140.76 min (9-603). Any adverse effect was notified.In 44 cases a colonoscopy was carried out after CCE (results were hidden from another endoscopist). Compared to colonoscopy, the rate of agreement was 75,6%, the sensitivity was 84% and the specificity 62,5%, PPV was 77,7% and NPV was 71,4%.The colonic findings in 134 CCE were: in 34 cases CCE it did not show lesions, diverticulosis in 63 explorations, polyps in 43, angiodysplasias in 15, Crohn's Disease in 9 and ulcerative colitis in other 8 cases. CONCLUSIONS: the CCE is an effective and reliable technique for the detection of lesions in colon, and because of its high agreement with the colonoscopy, it could be useful in clinical practice. Further studies with large seria and cost-effectiveness analysis are needed to confirm these data.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4) years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236), 1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE, it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.},

Epigallocathechin gallate and apigenin from these plants inhibit cytokines, chemokines and activated immune cells in vivo and in vitro. Clinical disorders with induced inflammatory pathways could benefit from flavonoid treatment. Dietary supplementation with specific tea-flavonoids could be used for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome. Suppression of cytokine production could ultimately lead to inhibition of carcinogenesis. This mechanism could explain why flavonoids are effective in the prevention of intestinal neoplasia. This innovative new form of therapy should be tested in controlled, randomized clinical studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary abscisic acid (ABA) has shown efficacy in ameliorating experimental IBD in mice through mechanisms requiring expression of peroxisome proliferator activated-receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) in immune cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether PPAR gamma expression in colonic epithelial cells is required for the anti-inflammatory actions of ABA. METHODS: Conditional knockout mice expressing a transgenic recombinase in intestinal epithelial cells under the control of a villin promoter (PPAR gamma flfl; Villin Cre+ or VC+) with defective expression of PPAR gamma in intestinal cells (IEC) and PPAR gamma-expressing wild type (PPAR gamma flfl; Villin Cre- or VC-) mice in a C57BL/6 background were fed diets with and without ABA (0.1 g/kg) for 35 days and challenged with 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in the drinking water for 7 days. Clinical disease severity was assessed daily and colonic lesions on day 7 through macroscopic and histopathological examination. Immune cell phenotypes were examined systemically and at the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Epithelial gene expression was assayed in the colon. RESULTS: Dietary ABA-supplementation prevented colitis, reduced disease severity, improved colonic histopathology, and upregulated epithelial lanthionine synthetase C-like protein 2 (LANCL2) expression in VC+ mice. Dietary ABA significantly increased the percentages of MLN CD4+IL-10+ T cells, and blood CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells and CD8+IL-10+ T cells. CONCLUSION: Expression of PPAR gamma in IECs was not required for the anti-inflammatory efficacy of ABA in IBD. LANCL2 in IECs and T cell-derived IL-10 may be implicated in the mechanism underlying ABA's immune modulatory activity in IBD.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing. Dietary factors such as the spread of the "Western" diet, high in fat and protein but low in fruits and vegetables, may be associated with the increase. Although many studies have evaluated the association between diet and IBD risk, there has been no systematic review. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using guideline-recommended methodology to evaluate the association between pre-illness intake of nutrients (fats, carbohydrates, protein) and food groups (fruits, vegetables, meats) and the risk of subsequent IBD diagnosis. Eligible studies were identified via structured keyword searches in PubMed and Google Scholar and manual searches. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included, encompassing 2,609 IBD patients (1,269 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,340 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients) and over 4,000 controls. Studies reported a positive association between high intake of saturated fats, monounsaturated fatty acids, total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), total omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, mono- and disaccharides, and meat and increased subsequent CD risk. Studies reported a negative association between dietary fiber and fruits and subsequent CD risk. High intakes of total fats, total PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of UC. High vegetable intake was associated with a decreased risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: High dietary intakes of total fats, PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of CD and UC. High fiber and fruit intakes were associated with decreased CD risk, and high vegetable intake was associated with decreased UC risk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prevalence of recurrent calcium-oxalate (CaOx) urolithiasis (UL) is up to fivefold higher in Crohn's disease than in the general population. Treatment options are scarce and the risk of recurrent UL or progressive renal CaOx deposition, (oxalosis) based early end-stage renal failure (ESRF), subsequent systemic oxalosis, and recurrence in the kidney graft is pronounced. We aimed to find proof that secondary hyperoxaluria is the main risk factor for the devastating course and correlates with intestinal oxalate absorption. METHODS: 24-h urines were collected and analyzed for urinary oxalate (Uox) in 27 pediatric (6-18 years) and 19 adult patients (20-62 years). In the 21 patients (8 adults and 13 children) with hyperoxaluria a [(13)C(2)]oxalate absorption test was performed under standardized dietary conditions. RESULTS: Mean Uox was significantly higher in patients with UL or oxalosis (0.92 +/- 0.57) compared with those without (0.53 +/- 0.13 mmol/1.73 m(2)/24 h, p<0.05, normal < 0.5). Hyperoxaluria then significantly correlated with intestinal oxalate absorption (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION: As UL/oxalosis has major implications for the general health in patients with Crohn's disease (ESRF and systemic oxalosis), new medication, e.g. to reduce intestinal oxalate absorption, is definitely needed.},

   abstract = {We herein report a case of a 41-year-old female with a 14-year history of Crohn's disease who had been treated with diet and mesalazine. Because of inadequate control, therapy with infliximab was planned. She had a positive result on the interferon-gamma release assay (QuantiFERON TB). After active tuberculosis was ruled out by chest x-ray and computed tomography, she was started on a six-month course of isoniazid 7 weeks prior to starting infliximab. After 10 doses of infliximab (15 months of therapy), she presented with pain of cervical lymphadenopathy. A biopsy of the lymph nodes revealed Langhans giant cells from granulomas and a positive result of polylmerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The treatment with infliximab was discontinued and anti-tuberculosis therapy was started. Although treatment for latent tuberculosis infection lowers the risk of reactivation of tuberculosis due to tumor necrosis factor alpha-blockers, it cannot completely inactivate tuberculosis. Despite the completion of chemoprophylaxis, patients receiving such agents should be instructed to watch out for any symptoms associated with pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis such as fever, cough, malaise, body weight loss, night sweating and lymphadenopathy, and they should also be closely followed up.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009. Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions, infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1 (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4))); high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)). Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5 (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)). CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD. Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.},

   abstract = {UNLABELLED: Coeliac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy, sprue) is a chrocic disorder of the small bowel leading to malabsorption. AIMS: charts of all patients with coeliac disease treated at the 2nd Department of Medicine, Semmelweis University were evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively analysed the results of a total of 132 patients with coeliac disease (107 females and 25 males; mean age, 37 years; median, 35 years; range, 19-78 years) attending the centre between 1999 and 2010. The authors routinely performed the following investigations in patients with suspected coeliac disease: multiple biopsies taken from the duodenum, tissue transglutaminase antibody or endomysial antibody based serology, body mass index calculation, osteodensitometry, evaluation of disorders associated with coeliac disease, family history for coeliac disease, and implementation of family-screening for coeliac disease given the agreement of the index patients. RESULTS: Histological samples were available in 101 cases, and distributions of data according to the Marsh-classification were as follows: negative in 9%, M3a in 27%, M3b in 18%, and M3c in 46% of cases, respectively. Serological results were available in 117 cases. 93/117 (79%) showed seropositivity. Body mass index was calculated for 95 patients, and the mean value for males was 22.4 kg/m(2) (range, 17-30.3 kg/m(2)), whereas the mean value for females was 20.7 kg/m(2) (range, 15.2-30.4 kg/m(2)). Osteodensitometry was performed in 90 patients; 45 patients (50%) proved normal, 31 (34%) had osteopenia, and 15 (26%) had osteoporosis. Coeliac disease associated disorders were present in 45/132 patients (34%; 6 males). Associated disorders were as follows: 15 dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring, 15 thyroid diseases (5 hypo- and 10 hyperthyroidism), 6 Crohn's disease, 3 selective IgA-deficiency, 2 endometrioses, 1 systemic lupus erythematosus, 1 myasthenia gravis, and 1 type-1 diabetes mellitus. Sixty-four of the 132 index patients brought 133 first-degree relatives for family screening (serology), where 26/133 (19.5%; 17 females) first-degree relatives proved to suffer from coeliac disease. CONCLUSIONS: The age distribution of this cohort demonstrates that coeliac disease can present at any age. Similarly to those of other coeliac disease centres, female predominance is significant. Histology usually showed advanced villous atrophy. Serological results were usually in conjunction with the histological results and proved to be useful for monitoring dietary compliance and for accomplishing family screening. The mean body mass index values were in the normal range confirming that adult patients with coeliac disease are usually not malnourished. The 20% prevalence of coeliac disease among first-degree relatives underlines the necessity of family screening.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy (CE) and its impact on treatment and outcome in patients without bleeding indications. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and sixty-five nonbleeding patients were enrolled in the study. The most common indications for CE were chronic abdominal pain alone (33 patients) or combined with chronic diarrhea (31 patients) and chronic diarrhea alone (30 patients). Among the 165 patients, 129 underwent CE for evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms and 36 for surveillance or disease staging. RESULTS: CE findings were positive, suspicious and negative in 73 (44.2%), 13 (7.9%) and 79 (47.9%) of cases, respectively. The diagnostic yield was highest in patients with refractory celiac disease (10/10, 100%) and suspected Crohn's disease (5/6, 83.3%), followed by patients with chronic abdominal pain and chronic diarrhea (13/31, 41.9%), established Crohn's disease (2/6, 33.3%), chronic diarrhea alone (8/30, 26.7%), chronic abdominal pain alone (8/33, 24.2%) and other indications (3/13, 23.1%) (p < 0.005). The CE findings led to a change of medication in 74 (47.7%) patients, surgery in 15 (9.7%), administration of a strict gluten-free or other special diet in 13 (8.4%) and had other consequences in 11 (6.7%). Management was not modified in 42 (27.1%) patients. Among symptomatic patients (n = 129), 29 (22.5%) were lost to follow-up. The remaining 100 patients were followed up for 8.7 +/- 4.0 months (range 2-19). Among the latter, resolution or improvement of symptoms was observed in 86 (86%) patients, no change in 11 (11%) and 3 (3%) died. All 86 patients who experienced resolution or improvement of their symptoms had a modification of their management after CE; only 7/11 patients whose symptoms did not change (63.6%) and 2/3 patients who died (66.7%) had a modification of management (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CE appears to be a useful tool in the evaluation of patients with nonbleeding indications. The outcome of most patients with negative findings was excellent.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) decreases intestinal inflammation and cytokine levels in an animal model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Luminal omega-3 (OM-3) is anti-angiogenic, reduces inflammation, and may decrease symptoms in patients with Crohn's disease. This study evaluates the synergism of HGF and OM-3. METHODS: Twenty adult female transgenic HLA-B27 rats were divided into 4 groups: group 1: regular feeds, IV saline; group 2: OM-3-enriched feeds, IV saline; group 3: regular feeds, IV HGF (150 microg/kg per day); and group 4: OM-3-enriched feeds, IV HGF(150 microg/kg per day). Rats were killed at 14 days after pump placement. Small and large bowel mucosa was harvested, and DNA and protein were extracted and quantified. Statistical analysis was done by analysis of variance with post-hoc Tukey's HSD test. RESULTS: Content of protein and DNA in the ileum were significantly increased by supplementation of HGF (P < .001, P < .01, respectively) alone. OM-3 significantly increased protein content but not DNA (P = .02, P = 0.3, respectively). Combined, they had a synergistic effect greater than either supplement alone (P = .0001, P = .002, respectively). In the colon, HGF and OM-3 did not significantly increase protein or DNA content individually or together. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of the synergistic effect of a growth factor (HGF) and a dietary supplement (OM-3) in an immunologic model of IBD.},

   abstract = {Carotenoid consumption has been linked to a number of beneficial health effects, including the reduction of chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular complications. However, no data are available on their action on the intestinal epithelium, being exposed to the highest concentrations of carotenoids in the human body, and where they could act preventively on intestinal inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether lycopene and beta-carotene in micelles (M), at concentrations that could be reached via the diet (10-25 mug/ml) could aid in the reduction of TNF-alpha plus IL-1beta-induced inflammation of Caco-2 human epithelial cells. The impact on biomarkers of inflammation, including IL-8, NO and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (through PGE-2alpha), and the NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways of intracellular signalling cascades were evaluated compared with controls (empty M). Furthermore, proteomic analyses were conducted from total cellular protein extracts. The results revealed that isolated carotenoids had no statistical significant anti-inflammatory effect on the biomarkers observed, or on the regulation of NF-kappaB and MAPK. Nevertheless, analyses of the proteome suggested that fifteen proteins were significantly (P < 0.05, expression ratio >1.3) differentially regulated following beta-carotene exposure, participating mostly in metabolic activities including antioxidant mechanisms, such as glutathione S-transferase A1. Only one protein was differentially regulated by lycopene (profilin-1). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate pathways involved in the action of carotenoids on the intestinal epithelium.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is growing evidence that vitamin D may have immunomodulatory properties in Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to determine if serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] was associated with inflammatory cytokines, IL-10, and TNF-alpha levels in patients with inactive CD. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 75 adults with quiescent CD. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by radioimmunoassay and serum IL-10 and TNF-alpha by ELISA. Disease activity was assessed by the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: IL-10 levels were significantly lower in patients with vitamin D insufficiency compared with the vitamin D replete group (mean and SE 2.48 +/- 0.51 v 6.77 +/- 2.49 pg/mL, p < 0.001). There were, however, no differences in serum TNF-alpha or CRP levels based on vitamin D status. The use of a vitamin D supplement at a low dose (200 IU) did not significantly influence IL-10 levels. CONCLUSION: Circulating levels of IL-10, but not TNF-alpha, were significantly lower in CD patients with inadequate serum 25(OH)D. This suggests that poor vitamin D status may be linked to reduced anti-inflammatory capacity in this group.},

   abstract = {The colon is largely being investigated as a site for administration of protein and peptides, which are degraded by digestive enzymes in the upper GIT. Also for local diseases of the colon such as inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer and ameobiasis, drug administration to the site of action can not only reduce the dose to be administered, but also decrease the side effects. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) such as Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation. Intestinal bacteria initiate the activation of intestinal inflammatory processes, which are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine. Increased chemokine expression has also been observed in epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Future trials of specific agents capable of inhibiting chemokine synthesis and secretion or blocking chemokine-chemokine receptor interaction will be important to study in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Many important bioactive compounds have been discovered from natural sources using bioactivity directed fractionation and isolation (BDFl) Continuing discovery has also been facilitated by the recent development of new bioassay methods. These bioactive compounds are mostly plant secondary metabolites, and many naturally occurring pure compounds have become medicines, dietary supplements, and other useful commercial products. The present review includes various approaches investigated for colon drug delivery and their site specificity. To achieve successful colonic delivery, a drug needs to be protected from absorption and the environment of the upper gastrointestinal tract and then be abruptly released into the proximal colon, which is considered the optimum site for colon targeted delivery of drugs.},

   abstract = {Nutritional factors, as sources of luminal antigens, have been thought to be important factors in the immunopathogenesis of numerous gastrointestinal diseases. In some diseases, the role of the nutritional component is causal in the susceptible host. Such diseases include celiac disease, a common heritable chronic inflammatory condition of the small intestine induced by dietary wheat, rye and barley, in susceptible individuals. Specific HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 risk alleles are necessary, but not sufficient, for disease development. The well-defined role of HLA-DQ heterodimers encoded by these alleles is to present cereal peptides to CD4+ T cells, activating an inflammatory immune response in the intestine. Genome-wide association studies have been performed which identified the IL2-IL21 risk locus and other genes with immune functions and key roles in thymic T-cell selection. Another example for this group is Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutation of the ATP7B gene, resulting in a defect of biliary copper excretion and toxic accumulation in the body, especially in the liver, brain and cornea, resulting in hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. In other diseases, however, the association is less well established. In such endeavor, epidemiological observations may become a valuable part of the overall investigations aimed at identifying dietary factors, which are involved in the initiation and perpetuation of the specific disease. As an example, relationships between nutrition and colorectal cancer have been hypothesized early on (e.g. folate, calcium, vitamin D, red meat). Similarly, intake of certain diet constituents like fat, refined sugar, fruits, vegetables and fiber was reported to be associated with the expression of inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, in children with active Crohn's disease, enteral nutrition was found to be equally effective as corticosteroids in induction of remission, with mucosal healing induced by downregulation of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in both the ileum and the colon after enteral nutrition. However, the particular effect of the consumption of each type of food remains questionable in most cases, at least in part because of insufficient data and serious methodological limitations (e.g. recall bias, heterogeneity between collected data, lack of correction for covariates, difficulties in double blinding).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: While the short-term benefits of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) for induction of remission in children with Crohn's disease (CD) are well documented, the longer-term outcomes are less clear. AIM: This retrospective study aimed to ascertain the outcomes for up to 24 months following EEN in a group of children with CD. METHODS: Children treated with EEN as initial therapy for newly diagnosed CD over a 5-year period were identified. Details of disease activity, growth, and drug requirements over the period of follow-up were noted. Outcomes in children managed with EEN were compared to a group of children initially treated with corticosteroids. RESULTS: Over this time period, 31 children were treated with EEN and 26 with corticosteroids. Twenty-six (84 %) of the 31 children treated with EEN entered remission. Children treated with EEN exhibited lower pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) scores at 6 months (p = 0.02) and received lower cumulative doses of steroids over the study period (p < 0.0001) than the group treated with corticosteroids. Height increments over 24 months were greater in the EEN group (p = 0.01). Although the median times to relapse were the same, the EEN group had a lower incidence of relapse in each time interval and survival curve analysis showed lower risk of relapse (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: EEN lead to multiple benefits beyond the initial period of inducing remission for these children, with positive outcomes over 2 years from diagnosis. Of particular clinical relevance to growing children was the reduced exposure to corticosteroids.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are inflammatory disorders caused by multiple factors. Research on IBD has often used the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. DSS induces in vivo but not in vitro intestinal inflammation. In addition, no DSS-associated molecule (free glucose, sodium sulfate solution, free dextran) induces in vitro or in vivo intestinal inflammation. We find that DSS but not dextran associated molecules established linkages with medium-chain-length fatty acids (MCFAs), such as dodecanoate, that are present in the colonic lumen. DSS complexed to MCFAs forms nanometer-sized vesicles ~200 nm in diameter that can fuse with colonocyte membranes. The arrival of nanometer-sized DSS/MCFA vesicles in the cytoplasm may activate intestinal inflammatory signaling pathways. We also show that the inflammatory activity of DSS is mediated by the dextran moieties. The deleterious effect of DSS is localized principally in the distal colon, therefore it will be important to chemically modify DSS to develop materials beneficial to the colon without affecting colon-targeting specificity.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic, progressive and disabling disorders. Over the last few decades, new therapeutic approaches have been introduced which have led not only to a reduction in the mortality rate but also offered the possibility of a favorable modification in the natural history of IBD. The identification of clinical, genetic and serological prognostic factors has permitted a better stratification of the disease, thus allowing the opportunity to indicate the most appropriate therapy. Early treatment with immunosuppressive drugs and biologics has offered the opportunity to change, at least in the short term, the course of the disease by reducing, in a subset of patients with IBD, hospitalization and the need for surgery. In this review, the crucial steps in the natural history of both UC and CD will be discussed, as well as the factors that may change their clinical course. The methodological requirements for high quality studies on the course and prognosis of IBD, the true impact of environmental and dietary factors on the clinical course of IBD, the clinical, serological and genetic predictors of the IBD course (in particular, which of these are relevant and appropriate for use in clinical practice), the impact of the various forms of medical treatment on the IBD complication rate, the role of surgery for IBD in the biologic era, the true magnitude of risk of colorectal cancer associated with IBD, as well as the mortality rate related to IBD will be stressed; all topics that are extensively discussed in separate reviews included in this issue of World Journal of Gastroenterology.},

   abstract = {The objective of this article is to report improvement of nutritional status by protein supplements in the patient with protein-losing enteropathy. The patient was a female whose age was 25 and underwent medical treatment of Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowl disease, after diagnosis of cryptogenic multifocal ulcerous enteritis. The weight was 33.3 kg (68% of IBW) in the severe underweight and suffered from ascites and subcutaneous edema with hypoalbuminemia (1.3 g/dL) at the time of hospitalization. The patient consumed food restrictively due to abdominal discomfort. Despite various attempts of oral feeding, the levels of calorie and protein intake fell into 40-50% of the required amount, which was 800-900 kcal/d (24-27 kcal/kg/d) for calorie and 34 g/d (1 g/kg/d) for protein. It was planned to supplement the patient with caloric supplementation (40-50 kcal/kg) and protein supplementation (2.5 g/kg) to increase body weight and improve hypoproteinemia. It was also planned to increase the level of protein intake slowly to target 55 g/d in about 2 weeks starting from 10 g/d and monitored kidney load with high protein supplementation. The weight loss was 1.0 kg when the patient was discharged from the hospital (hospitalization periods of 4 weeks), however, serum albumin was improved from 1.3 g/dL to 2.5 g/dL and there was no abdominal discomfort. She kept supplement of protein at 55 g/d for 5 months after the discharge from the hospital and kept it at 35 g/d for about 2 months and then 25 g/d. The body weight increased gradually from 32.3 kg (65% of IBW) to 44.0 kg (89% of IBW) by 36% for the period of F/u and serum albumin was kept above 2.8 g/dL without intravenous injection of albumin. The performance status was improved from 4 points of 'very tired' to 2 points of 'a little tired' out of 5-point scale measurement and the use of diuretic stopped from the time of 4th month after the discharge from the hospital owing to improvement in edema and ascites. During this period, the results of blood test such as BUN, Cr, and electrolytes were within the normal range. In conclusion, hypoproteinemia and weight loss were improved by increasing protein intake through utilization of protein supplements in protein-losing enteropathy.},

The importance of all health care providers partnering with their patients and asking about CAM use, as well as maintaining an awareness of efficacy, safety, harm, drug-supplement interactions, and appropriate referral sources, should be kept in mind when caring for those afflicted with this chronic disease.},

   abstract = {Alum (AlK(SO(4))(2)) is an adjuvant commonly utilized in vaccines, and is a ubiquitous element used extensively in contemporary life. Food, air, water, waste, the earth's surface, and pharmaceuticals all represent pathways of aluminum (Al) exposure. Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals and is caused by yet unidentified environmental factors. Al is a potential factor for the induction of inflammation in CD, and its immune activities share many characteristics with the immune pathology of CD: many luminal bacterial or dietary compounds can be adsorbed to the metal surface and induce Th1 profile cytokines, shared cytokines/chemokines, co-stimulatory molecules, and intracellular pathways and stress-related molecular expression enhancement, affecting intestinal macrobiota, trans-mural granuloma formation, and colitis induction in an animal CD model. The inflammasome plays a central role in Al mode of action and in CD pathophysiology. It is suggested that Al adjuvant activity can fit between the aberrations of innate and adaptive immune responses occurring in CD. The CD mucosa is confronted with numerous inappropriate bacterial components adsorbed on the Al compound surface, constituting a pro-inflammatory supra-adjuvant. Al fits the diagnostic criteria of the newly described autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants. If a cause and effect relationship can be established, the consequences will greatly impact public health and CD prevention and management.},

   abstract = {Nutritional assessment and dietary advice are fundamental to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient management and all patients should have access to a dietitian. Newly diagnosed patients often think that their pre-illness diet has contributed to the development of their IBD. However, epidemiological evidence to support diet as a risk factor is lacking. How the diet contributes to the gastrointestinal microbiota is interesting, although the role is not yet clearly defined. Nutritional problems in IBD are common. Malnutrition occurs in up to 85% of patients and weight loss affects up to 80% of patients with Crohn's disease and 18-62% of patients with ulcerative colitis. Nutritional deficiencies are prevalent, particularly in relation to anaemia and osteoporosis. Intestinal strictures can be problematic in Crohn's disease and limiting fibrous foods that may cause a mechanical obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract is helpful. Patients often explore dietary exclusion to alleviate symptoms but such changes may be self-directed or inappropriately advised and can lead to further nutritional deficiencies. Some patients experience concurrent functional symptoms (e.g. abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence and diarrhoea) that can significantly affect quality of life. Recently, a group of poorly absorbed carbohydrates that occur naturally in the diet called fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols have been associated with functional symptoms by intestinal bacterial fermentation leading to rapid gas production, and an osmotic effect increasing fluid delivery to the colon. Emerging evidence indicates that a diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols can alleviate functional symptoms in IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The widespread use of the Internet allows for unique research opportunities. We aimed to develop and follow an Internet-based cohort (e-cohort) of patients with self-reported inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) over time. METHODS: We established an e-cohort of adults with IBD (CCFA Partners) by recruiting through Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) email rosters, CCFA Website promotion, social media, and other publicity mechanisms. The baseline survey included modules on disease course and activity, diet and exercise, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Baseline characteristics of the cohort are summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 7819 adults with IBD joined CCFA Partners through August, 2011. The median age was 42 years (interquartile range [IQR] 30-54), 5074 (72.3%) were female. A total of 4933 (63.1%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 2675 (34.2%) had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 211 (2.7%) had IBD unspecified. For CD, the mean short CD Activity Index (CDAI) was 151.9 (standard deviation [SD] 106.4), with 2274 (59.4%) in remission. For UC, the mean simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI) was 3.6 (SD 2.8), with 937 (42.9%) in remission. The mean short IBD questionnaire (SIBDQ) score was 48.7 (SD 11.8). SIBDQ was inversely correlated with disease activity (P < 0.01). The mean Morisky medication adherence score (MMAS) was 5.7 (SD 2.0). MMAS scores were inversely correlated with disease activity (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CCFA Partners is a novel e-cohort. Enrollment is ongoing, with surveys twice yearly. CCFA Partners represents a unique resource to study PROs and changes in disease management over time.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The laparoscopic approach is becoming the gold standard in the surgical treatment of primary Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to compare laparoscopic-assisted and open ileocolic resection for primary Crohn's disease. METHODS: We conducted a non-randomized, comparative, retrospective analysis of a prospective database from 1998 to 2010. The remaining 129 patients were divided into two groups: laparoscopic-assisted group (Group L; n=64) and conventional group (Group C; n=65). There were no differences between the two groups as regards preoperative patient characteristics. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen (90.7%) patients had no complications. Out of 12 patients (9.3%) with complications, four (3.1%) had Grade I, six (4.7%) had Grade II and two (1.6%) had Grade III. There were no postoperative deaths (Grade V). Operating time was longer in Group L compared with Group C (P<0.001). Bowel function returned more quickly in the laparoscopic group in terms of return of bowel movements (P=0.018) and resumption of a regular diet (P=0.06). The mean length of stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (P=0.001). The mean follow-up was 26 months in Group L versus 34 months in Group C (P=0.06). During follow-up, six patients presented with small bowel obstruction in Group C, which was not statistically different from Group L (3 patients) (P=0.25). During the follow-up period, there have been no recurrences of Crohn's disease in the laparoscopic group while 11 patients (16.9%) have developed a recurrence in the conventional group (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolectomy for primary Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum and/or cecum is safe and successful in most cases. Laparoscopic surgery for Crohn's disease should be considered as the preferred operative approach for primary resections.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: With improvements in therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and changes in the prevalence of obesity, the phenotype of Crohn's disease (CD) is changing. These changes may herald an increase in the incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in this population. METHODS: Over a 10-month period we identified seven patients with CD who required liver biopsy for elevated liver function tests (LFTs), with an ultimate diagnosis of NAFLD. We performed a retrospective chart review and literature search to identify relevant data on NAFLD and CD. Specifically, we abstracted prior and current IBD-related medication exposures, disease severity, and the presence of typical comorbidities associated with NAFLD. RESULTS: We describe seven patients with CD and biopsy-proven NAFLD. The majority of these patients were overweight or obese, had quiescent CD, and were more likely to be receiving a tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor. Review of the literature produced a total of 29 articles describing NAFLD in IBD patients, primarily restricted to historical autopsy and surgical series. Limited contemporary studies highlight the rising prevalence of NAFLD in treated IBD populations. CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD is increasing in incidence and prevalence among the general population. With improvements in therapy, NAFLD is likely increasing among the CD population as well. When evaluating an IBD patient with abnormal LFTs, clinicians need to consider NAFLD. NAFLD may impact IBD management in the future if therapeutic modalities are limited due to elevated LFTs. Further, patients should be monitored for excessive weight gain and counseled regarding healthy dietary and exercise habits.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant chronic pouchitis causes significant morbidity. Elemental diet is effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Since pouchitis shares some similarities to Crohn's disease we hypothesised that elemental diet may be an effective treatment. METHOD: Seven pouchitis patients (with ulcerative colitis) were studied. All had active pouchitis with a pouch disease activity index (PDAI) >/=7. Exclusion criteria were recent NSAIDs, antibiotics or probiotics. Sufficient elemental diet to achieve energy requirements was provided. Flexible-pouchoscopy was performed, and the Cleveland Global Quality of Life score (CGQoL), Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and BMI were recorded at baseline and following 28 days of elemental diet. Faecal samples were also collected at these time points and analysed for major bacterial groups using culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Data were analysed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Following 28 days of exclusive elemental diet, median stool frequency decreased from 12 to 6 per day (p=0.028), median clinical PDAI decreased from 4 to 1 (p=0.039). There was no significant difference in quality of life scores or PDAI before and following treatment. There was a trend towards an increase in the concentration of Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale (median 7.9 to 8.5 log(1)(0)/g, p=0.08) following exclusive elemental diet. CONCLUSION: Treatment with four weeks elemental diet appeared to improve the symptoms of chronic pouchitis in some patients but is not an effective strategy for inducing remission. Although a potential symptom modifier, elemental diet cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of active pouchitis.},

Ganglioside composition of the intestinal brush border and apical surface of the colon influences numerous cell processes including microbial attachment, cell division, differentiation, and signaling. Accelerated catabolism of ganglioside in intestinal disease results in increased proinflammatory signaling. Restoring proper structure and function to the diseased intestine can resolve inflammation, increase resistance to infection, and improve gut integrity to induce remission of conditions like necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Maintaining inactive state of disease may be achieved by reducing the rate that gangliosides are degraded or by increasing intake of dietary ganglioside. Collectively, the studies outlined in this paper indicate that the amount of gangliosides GM3 and GD3 in intestinal mucosa is decreased with inflammation, low level of GM3 is associated with higher production of proinflammatory signals, and ganglioside content of intestinal mucosa can be increased by dietary ganglioside.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a chronic condition of the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous inflammation that occurs in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form fistulae. The cause is unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of medical treatments to induce remission in adults with Crohn's disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce and maintain remission in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce remission in adults with colonic Crohn's disease? What are the effects of medical interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease; and to maintain remission following surgery? What are the effects of lifestyle interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 93 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aminosalicylates, antibiotics, azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral), enteral nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection, segmental colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Activation of AhR by dietary ligands is necessary for the maintenance or expansion of innate immune cells in the gut, such as intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and interleukin (IL)-22-producing lymphoid cells (ILC22). AhR-deficient mice lack IELs, have reduced number of ILC22 cells, and are more susceptible to bacterial infections and experimental colitis. In animal models, AhR activators inhibit proinflammatory cytokine synthesis and attenuate colitis by a pathway that involves IL-22. Analysis of AhR in the human gut reveals that intestinal T cells and natural killer cells isolated from Crohn's disease patients express low levels of AhR and respond to AhR ligands by downregulating inflammatory cytokines and upregulating IL-22. SUMMARY: These novel findings may help explain how environmental factors may regulate mucosal immune responses.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease of unknown aetiology characterized by periods of remission and acute episodes of relapse with severe inflammation in the colonic mucosa. Conventional treatments for UC and CD include 5-aminosalicylate, corticosteroid, elemental dietary treatment, corticosteroid, and thiopurine (azathioprine). Recently, new immunomodulators and anti-TNFa agents, such as tacrolimus, infliximab, and adalimumab have been developed and these treatments are available to be treated for patients with refractory UC and CD. Conventional step-up treatment has been replaced by top-down treatment using biologics. Infliximab and adalimumab induce not only clinical remission but also improve relapse rates and surgical rates. Endoscopic mucosal healing predicts short- and long-prognosis for both of these diseases, thus recent treatment strategy should be aimed for endoscopic remission. Although biologics is useful for patients with UC/CD, secondary loss of responses (LOR) for biologics has been partly observed in CD patients. Measuring anti-infliximab antibodies and concentration of infliximab trough level may help considering treatment strategy for patients with LOR.},

   abstract = {In vitro and animals models have long been used to study human diseases and identify novel therapeutic approaches that can be applied to combat these conditions. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two main entities of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is an intricate relationship between IBD features in human patients, in vitro and animal colitis models, mechanisms and possible therapeutic approaches in these models, and strategies that can be extrapolated and applied in humans. Malnutrition, particularly protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies, as well as dysregulation of the intestinal microbiota, are common features of IBD. Based on these observations, dietary supplementation with essential nutrients known to be in short supply in the diet in IBD patients and with other molecules believed to provide beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, as well as with probiotic organisms that stimulate immune functions and resistance to infection has been tested in colitis models. Here we review current knowledge on nutritional and probiotic supplementation in in vitro and animal colitis models. While some of these strategies require further fine-tuning before they can be applied in human IBD patients, their intended purpose is to prevent, delay or treat disease symptoms in a non-pharmaceutical manner.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single-port laparoscopic surgery has been described for various colorectal conditions. Here, we report the first 4 single-port laparoscopic sigmoid colostomies for fecal diversion. METHODS: A 1.5-cm-round incision was made on the skin at a previously marked colostomy site. A wound retractor was inserted and an access platform with four 5-mm trocars was attached to the wound retractor. The sigmoid colon was mobilized using electrocautery, laparoscopic scissors, or an advanced bipolar device. A standard Brooke colostomy was created through the initial skin incision. RESULTS: Four elective single-port laparoscopic diverting colostomies were performed. Indications included obstructing colon and rectal cancers and intractable Crohn's proctitis. The average operative time was 73 minutes (range, 53-105), and blood loss was minimal (<50 mL). There were no intraoperative complications. Three of 4 patients received oral analgesia, and one patient received patient-controlled intravenous analgesia postoperatively. The average time to passage of flatus was 1 day. Diet was advanced either on the day of surgery or on postoperative day 1. The length of hospital stay ranged from 0 to 15 days. CONCLUSION: Single-port laparoscopic sigmoid colostomy is an effective technique that allows full intra-abdominal visualization and colonic mobilization while eliminating the need for additional skin incisions other than the colostomy site itself.},

   abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with intestinal dysbiosis evidenced by an altered microbiome forming thick biofilms on the epithelium. Additionally, adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) strains are frequently isolated from ileal lesions of CD patients indicating a potential role for these strains in disease pathogenesis. The composition and characteristics of the host microbiome are influenced by environmental factors, particularly diet. Polysaccharides added to food as emulsifiers, stabilizers or bulking agents have been linked to bacteria-associated intestinal disorders. The escalating consumption of polysaccharides in Western diets parallels an increased incidence of CD during the latter 20(th) century. In this study, the effect of a polysaccharide panel on adhesiveness of the CD-associated AIEC strain LF82 was analyzed to determine if these food additives promote disease-associated bacterial phenotypes. Maltodextrin (MDX), a polysaccharide derived from starch hydrolysis, markedly enhanced LF82 specific biofilm formation. Biofilm formation of multiple other E. coli strains was also promoted by MDX. MDX-induced E. coli biofilm formation was independent of polysaccharide chain length indicating a requirement for MDX metabolism. MDX exposure induced type I pili expression, which was required for MDX-enhanced biofilm formation. MDX also increased bacterial adhesion to human intestinal epithelial cell monolayers in a mechanism dependent on type 1 pili and independent of the cellular receptor CEACAM6, suggesting a novel mechanism of epithelial cell adhesion. Analysis of mucosa-associated bacteria from individuals with and without CD showed increased prevalence of malX, a gene essential for MDX metabolism, uniquely in the ileum of CD patients. These findings demonstrate that the ubiquitous dietary component MDX enhances E. coli adhesion and suggests a mechanism by which Western diets rich in specific polysaccharides may promote dysbiosis of gut microbes and contribute to disease susceptibility.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dairy products have been perceived as having the potential to cause adverse effects in individuals with Crohn's disease (CD) and are often avoided, potentially increasing the risk of osteoporosis and related morbidity associated with inadequate dietary calcium intake. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the self-reported effects of dairy products on CD symptoms and to determine whether these effects differed between types of dairy products consumed and disease state or location. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of dietary survey and clinical data from participants in the Genes and Diet in Inflammatory Bowel Disease study based in Auckland, New Zealand. SUBJECTS/SETTING: One hundred and sixty-five men and women diagnosed with CD for which both dietary survey data and clinical information were available. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: chi(2) analysis was conducted to assess whether significant differences in the proportions of responses relating to a worsening of CD symptoms from individual dairy products were evident between individuals with active or quiescent CD, or ileal or colonic disease locations. Odds ratios with confidence interval were calculated to determine whether CD location was associated with risk of any type of adverse reaction to milk products. Logit scales were utilized to depict self-reported CD symptoms associated with individual dairy product consumption for ileal and colonic CD patients. RESULTS: Dairy products had no effect on self-reported CD symptoms for most people. Dairy products with a high fat content were most frequently reported to worsen perceived CD symptoms. Clinically, self-reported CD activity status did not influence responses to dairy products; however, colonic inflammation was more frequently associated with adverse CD effects in comparison to ileal CD involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Research outcomes question the necessity of dairy product avoidance in CD patients and illustrate the highly individual nature of dairy product tolerance in this clinical population.},

The kind of dietetic habits before the appearance of the illness in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) has not been studied extensively. AIM: To prospectively assess the kind of food consumption in patients with CD exactly at the time of diagnosis and to identify dietary constituents as risk factors for development of CD. PATIENTS - METHODS: Twenty eight patients with a newly established diagnosis of CD (2-4 weeks), (12 men and 16 women), 30 patients with previously (between 2 - 11 years) established diagnosis of CD (14 men and 16 women) and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (16 men and 22 women) were included in the study. Dietary intake was assessed by means of special questionnaire. RESULTS: Comparisons between controls and newly diagnosed patients showed that increased consumption of milk and yogurt (P = 0.042), fruits (P = 0.0001), citrus (P = 0.0001), vegetables (P = 0.0001), carrots (P = 0.0001), legumes (P = 0.036), fish and selfish (P = 0.001), honey (P = 0.003), and nuts (P = 0.038), was associated with decreased risk for CD. On the other hand, significantly increased intake of fat (P = 0.041), olive oil (P = 0.038), margarine (P = 0.038), sugar (P = 0.02), alcohol drinks (P = 0.009), fried food (P = 0.0001), and pasta (P = 0.0001), was noticed on recently diagnosed patients in comparison with the healthy control group. On logistic regression analysis foods remaining statistically significant were: margarine, pasta, fried foods, fat, olives, sugar (increased risk), and yogurt, honey, fruits, nuts, fish, and citrus fruits (decreased risk). Newly diagnosed patients were significantly overweighed (64%) compared to healthy people (26%) and old patients (7%). CONCLUSION: Significant differences in many kinds of food between newly diagnosed patients with CD, patients with established CD and normal people certainly exist. Our results suggest that specific dietary patterns could be associated with higher or lower risks for CD in adults. However, whether these dietary factors are important for the development of CD or modulate the effect of other environmental factors is unknown.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study design, patients with confirmed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), and >/=18 years old, attending outpatient clinics at 14 hospitals in Norway were eligible to complete questionnaires including demographics, clinical variables, and the International CAM Questionnaire (I-CAM-Q). RESULTS: Of 460 patients included in the study, 430 had evaluable questionnaires (response rate 93%). Forty-nine percent (95% CI: 44-54) had used some type of CAM within the past 12 months. CAM services were utilized by 27% (95% CI: 23-31) of the patients, 21% (95% CI: 16-23) reported use of CAM products, and 28% (95% CI: 23-31) used CAM self-help practices. The most common pattern of CAM use was to combine CAM services and CAM products. Significantly, more UC patients (56%) than CD patients (44%) reported CAM use, p = 0.03. In UC, only the presence of at least one comorbid condition was directly related to CAM use. In CD, being a woman, being aged 31-50 years, having a higher education level, and experiencing adverse drug reactions from IBD medication were factors independently associated with the use of CAM. CONCLUSION: Use of CAM was common among IBD patients attending outpatient clinics. Both demographic and clinical factors were associated to CAM use, but the factors differed in their significance for UC and CD.},

Genetic variation in the NPC1L1 gene affects cholesterol absorption and serum cholesterol levels. However, NCP1L1 genotypes have not previously been invesigated. In this study, genotyping of the NPC1L1 gene was examined in healthy individuals as well as patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A total of 541 individuals were enrolled in the study, including 80 patients with HCV hepatitis, 205 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 127 with Crohn's disease (CD). Genotyping was performed using TaqMan(R) SNP assays. Minor allelic frequencies of the 17345C>G (rs2072183) and 19031G>A (rs4720470) SNPs were found to be 0.40 and 0.30, respectively. No significant differences were detected in serum HCV levels in the 1735C>G or 19031G>A SNPs. The 1735C>G SNPs were not associated with total cholesterol (TC) levels in the healthy controls and/or HCV patients. However, statistically significant associations between the 1735GG variant and TC levels were detected in CD patients, with 1735GG carriers having the highest TC levels compared to the 1735CC and 1735CG carriers (P=0.048). Similar trends were noted in UC patients, but did not reach statistical significance (P= 0.19). The 19031G>A SNPs were not associated with TC levels in the healthy controls or patients. This study showed the allelic and genotypic distribution of 1735C>G and 19031G>ASNPs of the NPC1L1 gene in a large number of subjects. The NPC1L1 1735GG variant may therefore be favorable for CD accompanied with malnutrition.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There are very few published studies of agents having the potential to improve bone health in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective of this study was to establish the efficacy and safety of intranasal calcitonin in improving bone mineral density (BMD) in young patients with IBD and to define additional factors that impact bone mineral accrual. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial in 63 participants, ages 8-21 years, with a spinal BMD Z-score </= -1.0 s.d. measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Subjects were randomized to 200 IU intranasal calcitonin (n=31) or placebo (n=32) daily. All received age-appropriate calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Subsequent BMD measurements were obtained at 9 and 18 months. RESULTS: Intranasal calcitonin was well tolerated. Adverse event frequency was similar in both treatment groups, and such events were primarily minor, reversible, and limited to the upper respiratory tract. The BMD Z-score change documented at screening and 9 months and screening and 18 months did not differ between the two therapeutic arms. In participants with Crohn's disease, the spinal BMD Z-score improved between screening and 9 months (change in spine BMD Z-score (DeltaZSBMD)(9-0)) in the calcitonin group (DeltaZSBMD(9-0)(calcitonin)=0.21 (0.37), DeltaZSBMD(9-0)(placebo)=-0.15 (0.5), P=0.02); however, this was only a secondary subgroup analysis. Bone mineral accrual rate during the trial did not lead to normalization of BMD Z-score in this cohort. Factors favoring higher bone mineral accrual rate were lower baseline BMD and higher baseline body mass index Z-score, improvement in height Z-score, higher serum albumin, hematocrit and iron concentration, and more hours of weekly weight-bearing activity. Factors associated with lower bone mineral accrual rate were more severe disease-as indicated by elevated inflammatory markers, need for surgery, hospitalization, and the use of immunomodulators-and higher daily caffeine intake. CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal calcitonin is well tolerated but does not offer a long-term advantage in youth with IBD and decreased BMD. Bone mineral accrual rate remains compromised in youth with IBD and low BMD raising concerns for long-term bone health outcomes. Improvement in nutritional status, catch-up linear growth, control of inflammation, increase in weight-bearing activity, and lower daily caffeine intake may be helpful in restoring bone density in children with IBD and low BMD.},

Pregnant women who are vegetarian or vegan, have Crohn's or celiac disease, or have undergone gastric bypass surgery are at increased risk of B12 deficiency. Low serum levels of B12 have been linked to negative impacts in cognitive, motor, and growth outcomes. Low cobalamin levels also may be related to depression in adults. Some studies indicate that B12 supplementation may improve outcomes in children, although more research is needed in this area. Overall, the mechanisms of B12 action in development remain unclear. Further studies in this area to elucidate the pathways of cobalamin influence on development, as well as to prevent B12 deficiency in pregnant women and children are indicated.},

   abstract = {In vitro and animal studies point to numerous mechanisms by which fatty acids, especially long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), can modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. These data strongly suggest that improving the fatty acid supply of young children in low-income countries might have immune benefits. Unfortunately, there have been virtually no studies of fatty acid/immune interactions in such settings. Clinical trial registers list over 150 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving PUFAs, only one in a low-income setting (the Gambia). We summarize those results here. There was evidence for improved growth and nutritional status, but the primary end point of chronic environmental enteropathy showed no benefit, possibly because the infants were still substantially breastfed. In high-income settings, there have been RCTs with fatty acids (usually LCPUFAs) in relation to 18 disease end points, for some of which there have been numerous trials (asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis). For these diseases, the evidence is judged reasonable for risk reduction for childhood asthma (but not in adults), as yielding possible benefit in Crohn's disease (insufficient evidence in ulcerative colitis) and for convincing evidence for rheumatoid arthritis at sufficient dose levels, though formal meta-analyses are not yet available. This analysis suggests that fatty acid interventions could yield immune benefits in children in poor settings, especially in non-breastfed children and in relation to inflammatory conditions such as persistent enteropathy. Benefits might include improved responses to enteric vaccines, which frequently perform poorly in low-income settings, and these questions merit randomized trials.},

However, across Asia the incidence and prevalence of IBD has increased rapidly over the last two to four decades. These changes may relate to increased contact with the West, westernization of diet, increasing antibiotics use, improved hygiene, vaccinations, or changes in the gut microbiota. Genetic factors also differ between Asians and the Caucasians. In Asia, UC is more prevalent than CD, although CD incidence is rapidly increasing in certain areas. There is a male predominance of CD in Asia, but a trend towards equal sex distribution for UC. IBD is diagnosed at a slightly older age than in the West, and there is rarely a second incidence peak as in the West. A positive family history is much less common than in the West, as are extra-intestinal disease manifestations. There are clear ethnic differences in incidence within countries in Asia, and an increased incidence in IBD in migrants from Asia to the West. Research in Asia, an area of rapidly changing IBD epidemiology, may lead to the discovery of critical etiologic factors that lead to the development of IBD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which may result in nutrition problems that impact on patient health, nutritional status and quality of life. Subjective reports of how IBD patients experience these problems as part of their disease process, including comparisons between patient groups, or the need for tailored nutrition advice as perceived by these patients, have not been widely studied. This survey aimed to identify and explore nutritional problems that are important to CD and UC patients and to investigate their views on the IBD health services provided to help them with these. METHODS: Eighty-seven IBD patients were invited to take part in a nutrition survey using face-to-face questionnaire interviews. The survey asked about food and nutrition problems that patients have experienced, identifying which were most significant and the extent to which they had been addressed by the clinical service. RESULTS: Seventy-two IBD patients completed the evaluation (47 CD, 25 UC). Of these, 45 (62.5%) felt that food and nutrition were either 'important' or 'extremely important' in their experience of IBD, and 59 (82%) reported problems with food and nutrition. Patients with CD and UC reported similar frequencies of most nutritional problems. However, 44 (94%) CD vs. 16 (64%) UC patients reported problems with weight (p=0.002). Less than half of patients had seen a dietitian for tailored nutritional advice to address these problems. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional problems experienced and reported by IBD patients are numerous and varied. They are considered important by patients with CD and UC, both of whom would generally value specific dietary counselling, highlighting a need for further research in this area and adequate and equal provision of services for both groups.},

This case-control study was designed to detect associations of environmental and dietary factors with the diagnosis of CD. METHODS: In 200 consecutive patients with CD and 200 control subjects without gastrointestinal disease, environmental hygiene exposures in childhood and in the past one year, and dietary preferences were recorded using a questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, CD showed positive association with urban residence (at birth and current), availability of protected drinking water (childhood and current), availability of piped water in the house (childhood and current), and strict vegetarian dietary habit, and negative association with regular fish consumption and presence of cattle in the house compound. Multivariate analysis showed that regular fish consumption (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33-0.80, p = 0.003), and presence of cattle in the house compound currently (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.92, p = 0.023) were significant protective associations, whereas use of safe drinking water was positively associated (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.02-2.47, p = 0.042) with the disease. CONCLUSION: Occurrence of CD was associated with dietary and environmental exposures, which indicate that diet and hygiene may influence the development of this disease.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), emerged and dramatically increased for about a century. Despite extensive research, its cause remains regarded as unknown. About a decade ago, a series of findings made me suspect that saccharin may be a key causative factor for IBD, through its inhibition on gut bacteria and the resultant impaired inactivation of digestive proteases and over digestion of the mucus layer and gut barrier (the Bacteria-Protease-Mucus-Barrier hypothesis). It explained many puzzles in IBD such as its emergence and temporal changes in last century. Recently I further found evidence suggesting sucralose may be also linked to IBD through a similar mechanism as saccharin and have contributed to the recent worldwide increase of IBD. This new hypothesis suggests that UC and CD are just two symptoms of the same morbidity, rather than two different diseases. They are both caused by a weakening in gut barrier and only differ in that UC is mainly due to increased infiltration of gut bacteria and the resultant recruitment of neutrophils and formation of crypt abscess, while CD is mainly due to increased infiltration of antigens and particles from gut lumen and the resultant recruitment of macrophages and formation of granulomas. It explained the delayed appearance but accelerated increase of CD over UC and many other phenomena. This paper aims to provide a detailed description of a unified hypothesis regarding the etiology of IBD, including the cause and mechanism of IBD, as well as the relationship between UC and CD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses 2 independent but related entities: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is characterised by transmural patchy inflammation which can involve any portion of the gastrointestinal tract. UC is characterised by superficial inflammation that begins in the rectum and extends proximally along the colon. In Europe, approximately 2.2 million people have a diagnosis of IBD. The aetiology of IBD is unknown, however, immune, environmental and genetic factors are thought to be involved. Individuals with IBD are at risk of developing osteoporosis. In line with this, there are clear guidelines that recommend vitamin D supplementation for IBD patients to prevent bone disease, especially when undergoing steroid treatment. Despite an established role for vitamin D in IBD, deficiency is common. More novel effects of vitamin D beyond bone are emerging. It is now well established that vitamin D is an important regulator of the immune system which may have implications for the development, severity and management of immune related disorders such as IBD. The efficacy of vitamin D as an immune modulator in IBD remains to be proven. This review aims to evaluate the evidence implicating vitamin D deficiency in IBD pathogenesis, to examine vitamin D's anti-inflammatory mechanisms and to explore its therapeutic potential, optimal serum levels and dietary intakes which may support immune function in this disease.},

METHOD: Forty patients with symptomatic CD were recruited. Their sera were tested for IgG4 antibodies to 14 specific food antigens and each subject's four most reactive foods were excluded for 4 weeks. Disease activity was assessed using a modified CD activity index (mCDAI). Questionnaire and inflammatory markers were measured before and on completion of the exclusion diet. RESULTS: Eleven patients did not complete the study, leaving 29 for analysis. Of these, 26 (90%) reported symptomatic improvement with a reduction in mCDAI from a mean of 171-97.5 (P = 0.0001). The ESR fell from 23 to 17 mm/h (P = 0.021) and the IgG4 titres for the excluded foods fell from a mean of 3015-2306 mcgA/l (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: IgG4-guided exclusion diets resulted in significant symptomatic improvement with an objective fall in an inflammatory marker. This approach may be useful in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {During the last few years a significant advance has been achieved in the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). From twin studies it was evident that there is more that 50% concordance of Crohn's disease (CD) in monozygotic twin pairs, however it is only 3.6% among dizygotic twins. These data indicate that the genetic background may be responsible for 50% of the risk or 'susceptibility' to develop CD. Obviously it is not a sufficient condition as otherwise there would be 100% concordance of disease in monozygotic twin pairs. Environmental factors as well must play an important role. This is further supported by the fact that there is only low development in genetic risk factors over ten thousands of years. In contrast, the incidence of CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) has dramatically increased in Western countries in the last 100 years. This further supports the concept of a 'Western lifestyle factor(s)' that triggers chronic intestinal inflammation in a genetically susceptible host. The proof of the concept of a genetic susceptibility was achieved in 2001 with the discovery that NOD2 is the most important susceptibility gene for CD. The function of NOD2 has been investigated in detail. NOD2 is an intracellular 'alarm button', a receptor recognizing invading bacteria that entered the mucosal wall. NOD2 mutants associated with susceptibility to CD seem to be deficient in their recognition of bacterial wall products. In a genome-wide association study a disease association was found in the autophagy-related 16-like 1 gene (ATG16L1). The ATG16L1 gene encodes a protein in the autophagosome pathway that processes intracellular bacteria. Based on these findings, CD is now discussed as an impaired and inadequate immune reaction to the gut bacteria which are a part of our environment (or perhaps 'in-vironment'). In addition to NOD2 and ATG16L1, there are more 'innate' pathways by which commensal and pathogenic bacteria can directly interact with cells of the intestinal mucosa. The 'environment concept' and the 'genetic concept' of IBD pathophysiology are converging. With the finding that most susceptibility genes for CD and UC are involved in innate immune mechanisms and the primary defense against bacteria entering the mucosa, for the first time a unifying concept of the 'genetic pathophysiology hypothesis' and the 'environment pathophysiology hypothesis' of IBD was possible. Bacteria are the link between the environment and mucosal defense system.},

   abstract = {Dietary polyphenols present in Punica granatum (pomegranate), such as ellagitannins and ellagic acid (EA) have shown to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a dietary EA-enriched pomegranate extract (PE) in a murine chronic model of Cronh's disease (CD). Colonic injury was induced by intracolonic instillation of trinitrobenzensulfonic acid (TNBS). Rats were fed with different diets during 30 days before TNBS instillation and 2 weeks before killing: (i) standard, (ii) PE 250 mg/kg/day, (iii) PE 500 mg/kg/day, (iv) EA 10 mg/kg/day and (v) EA 10 mg/kg/day enriched-PE 250 mg/kg/day. Inflammation response was assessed by histology and MPO activity and TNF-alpha production. Besides, colonic expressions of iNOS, COX-2, p38, JNK, pERK1/2 MAPKs, IKBalpha and nuclear p65 NF-kappaB were studied by western blotting. MPO activity and the TNF-alpha levels were significantly reduced in dietary fed rats when compared with TNBS group. Similarly, PE and an EA-enriched PE diets drastically decreased COX-2 and iNOS overexpression, reduced MAPKs phosporylation and prevented the nuclear NF-kappaB translocation. Dietary supplementation of EA contributes in the beneficial effect of PE in this experimental colitis model and may be a novel therapeutic strategy to manage inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).},

   abstract = {Current epidemiological and experimental studies support a beneficial role of dietary polyphenols in several gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the effects of a naturally occurring polyphenol, ellagic acid, present in some fruits such as pomegranate, raspberries and nuts among others, in an experimental murine model of Crohn's disease by intra-colonic administration of TNBS in rats. Analysis of the lesions were carried out by macroscopic and histological technics. Inflammation response was assessed by histology and myeloperoxidase activity. iNOS and COX-2 are upregulated by MAPKs and NF-kappaB nuclear transcription factor in intestinal epithelial cells thus, we determined the expression of iNOS, COX-2 and the involvement of the p38, JNK, ERK1/2 MAPKs and NF-kappaB signalling in the protective effect of EA by western blotting. Oral administration of EA (10-20 mg/kg) diminished the severity and extension of the intestinal injuries induced by TNBS although there was no observed a significant dose-response. In addition, EA increased mucus production in goblet cells in colon mucosa, decreased neutrophil infiltration and pro-inflammatory proteins COX-2 and iNOS overexpression. Also EA was capable of reducing the activation of p38, JNK and ERK1/2 MAPKs, preventing the inhibitory protein IkappaB-degradation and inducing an inhibition of the nuclear translocation level of p65 in colonic mucosa. In conclusion, EA reduces the damage in a rat model of Crohn's disease, alleviates the oxidative events and returns pro-inflammatory proteins expression to basal levels probably through MAPKs and NF-kappaB signalling pathways.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy has an established role as induction therapy in paediatric Crohn's disease. However, compliance is the main difficulty and may be greatly influenced by the administration route. AIM: To analyse the efficiency of exclusive nutrition to induce remission in children with Crohn's disease comparing fractionated oral vs. continuous enteral feeding. METHODS: The medical records of 106 patients treated by exclusive nutritional therapy [Modulen IBD (R)] by either oral or continuous enteral route were reviewed retrospectively. Comparative analyses of remission rates, changes in anthropometry, Paediatric Crohn's disease Activity Index (PCDAI), laboratory indices and compliance rates were performed. RESULTS: On exclusive enteral nutrition, at 8 weeks, 34/45 patients achieved remission in the oral group (75% on intention-to-treat analysis) and 52/61 (85%) in the enteral nutrition group (P = 0.157). All patients showed a significant decrease in disease severity assessed by PCDAI (P < 0.0001) and significant improvements in anthropometric measures and inflammatory indices. No difference was observed whether Modulen IBD was administered orally or by continuous enteral feeding, apart from weight gain, which was greater in the enteral group (P = 0.041). In a subgroup of patients, mucosal healing was evidenced on follow-up endoscopies showing a clear correlation to remission. Compliance rates (87% and 90%) were similar. Nevertheless, noncompliant patients had lower mucosal healing and remission rates. CONCLUSIONS: These retrospective data suggest that the use of fractionated oral nutritional therapy might be as efficacious as continuous enteral administration to induce remission and mucosal healing in children with Crohn's disease. However, appropriate prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.},

   abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic inflammatory disorders that can affect the gastrointestinal tract of children and adults. Like other autoimmune processes, the cause(s) of these disorders remain unknown but likely involves some interplay between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. Children, in particular with UC or CD, can present to their primary care providers with similar symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody stool. Although UC and CD are more predominant in adults, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that a significant percentage of these patients were diagnosed during childhood. The chronic nature of the inflammatory process observed in these children and the waxing and waning nature of their clinical symptoms can be especially disruptive to their physical, social, and academic development. As such, physicians caring for children must consider these diseases when evaluating patients with compatible symptoms. Recent research efforts have made available a variety of more specific and effective pharmacologic agents and improved endoscopic and radiologic assessment tools to assist clinicians in the diagnosis and interval assessment of their patients with IBD; however, as the level of complexity of these interventions has increased, so too has the need for practitioners to become familiar with a wider array of treatments and the risks and benefits of particular diagnostic testing. Nonetheless, in most cases, and especially when frequent visits to subspecialty referral centers are not geographically feasible, primary care providers can be active participants in the management of their pediatric patients with IBD. The goal of this article is to educate and assist pediatricians and adult gastroenterology physicians caring for children with IBD, and in doing so, help to develop more collaborative care plans between primary care and subspecialty providers.},

   abstract = {Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is a major consequence of pancreatic diseases (e. g. chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis), extrapancreatic diseases like celiac disease and Crohn's disease, and gastrointestinal and pancreatic surgical resections. Recognition of this entity is highly relevant to avoid malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality. The main clinical consequence of PEI is fat maldigestion and malabsorption, resulting in steatorrhoea. Pancreatic exocrine function should be assessed by measuring levels of faecal elastase-1. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for PEI. Administration of enzymes in form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres avoids acid-mediated lipase inactivation and ensures gastric emptying of enzymes in parallel with nutrients. In adults, the initial recommended dose of pancreatic enzymes is 25.000 units of lipase per meal, titrating up to a maximum of 80000 units of lipase per meal. Large meals require 25.000 - 80.000 units of lipase per meal while snacks require 10.000 - 40.000 units of lipase per meal. Oral pancreatic enzymes should be taken with meals to ensure adequate mixing with the chyme. Adjunct therapy with acid-suppressing agents may be useful in patients who continue to experience symptoms of PEI despite high-dose enzyme therapy. Patients with PEI should be encouraged to consume small, frequent meals and to abstain from alcohol. Dietary fat restriction is not recommended for patients with PEI.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Variations in chronic illness care are common in our health care system and may lead to suboptimal outcomes. Specifically, inconsistent use and suboptimal medication dosing have been demonstrated in the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Quality improvement (QI) efforts have improved outcomes in conditions such as asthma and diabetes mellitus, but have not been well studied in IBD. We hypothesized that QI efforts would lead to improved outcomes in our pediatric IBD population. METHODS: A QI team was formed within our IBD center in 2005. By 2007, we began prospectively capturing physician global assessment (PGA) and patient-reported global assessment. Significant QI interventions included creating evidence-based medication guidelines, joining a national QI collaborative, initiation of preclinic planning, and monitoring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2010, 505 patients have been followed at our IBD center. During this time, the frequency of patients in clinical remission increased from 59% to 76% (P < 0.05), the frequency of patients who report that their global assessment is >7 increased from 69% to 80% (P < 0.05), and the frequency of patients with a Short Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (sPCDAI) <15 increased from 60% to 77% (P < 0.05). The frequency of repeat steroid use decreased from 17% to 10% (P < 0.05). We observed an association between the use of a vitamin D supplement (P = 0.02), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (P < 0.05), and quiescent disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that significant improvements in patient outcomes are associated with QI efforts that do not rely on new medication or therapies.},

We used 454 titanium pyrosequencing of the V1-V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize adherent bacterial communities in mucosal biopsy samples from 33 subjects with adenomas and 38 subjects without adenomas (controls). Biopsy samples from subjects with adenomas had greater numbers of bacteria from 87 taxa than controls; only 5 taxa were more abundant in control samples. The magnitude of the differences in the distal gut microbiota between patients with adenomas and controls was more pronounced than that of any other clinical parameters including obesity, diet or family history of CRC. This suggests that sequence analysis of the microbiota could be used to identify patients at risk for developing adenomas.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the most recent publications on innate immunity in the small intestine. We will go over the innate immune receptors that act as sensors of microbial presence or cell injury, Paneth cells as the main epithelial cell type that secrete antimicrobial peptides, and mucosal production of immunoglobulin A (IgA). In addition, we will give an update on examples of imbalance of the innate immune response resulting in clinical disease with the most relevant example being Crohn's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in B-cell homing to the intestine, rejection of small intestinal allografts, and recruitment of mast cells. The TLR adaptor Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta is necessary to activate innate immunity after Yersinia enterocolitica infection. Moreover, MyD88 is required to keep the intestinal microbiota under control and physically separated from the epithelium, and RegIIIgamma is responsible for the bacterial segregation from the lining epithelial cells. In Crohn's disease, ATG16L1 T300A variant promotes a proinflammatory response; and miR-196 downregulates a protective immunity-related GTPase family M protein (IRGM) polymorphism leading to impaired clearance of adherent Escherichia coli in the intestine. SUMMARY: The intestine is continuously exposed to dietary and microbial antigens. The host has to maintain intestinal homeostasis to keep the commensal and pathogenic bacteria under control. Some of the mechanisms to do so are by expression of innate immune receptors, production of antimicrobial peptides, secretion of IgA, or autophagy of intracellular bacteria. Unfortunately, in some cases the innate immune response fails to protect the host and chronic inflammation, transplant rejection, or other disorders may occur.},

A yet incompletely defined subset of intestinal bacteria is required to stimulate chronic, immune-mediated intestinal inflammation, including human Crohn's disease, and intestinal microbiota composition is altered in a characteristic manner by the inflammatory response to create a dysbiotic relationship of protective vs. aggressive bacteria. We pose a number of questions regarding host interactions with the enteric microbiota, including influences of inflammation, host genetics, early environmental exposure, and diet on microbial composition and function, and conversely, the effect of bacterial metabolism, enteric fungi and viruses, and endogenous protective bacterial species on host immune and inflammatory responses. These questions are designed to stimulate research that will promote a better understanding of host-microbial interactions in the intestine and promote targeted novel therapeutic interventions.},

   abstract = {Many foods have been implicated in theories about the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease. While evidence has accumulated that nutritional factors as part of overall lifestyle changes may play a role in the growing incidence, no specific dietary recommendations except the promotion of breastfeeding can currently be given to decrease the risk of developing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. For the treatment of Crohn's disease in children and adolescents, however, enteral feeding with a semi-elemental diet seems to be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing and maintaining remission. In the meta-analyses, advantages of one formula over the other are evened out, and more research is warranted into the anti-inflammatory properties of different nutrients, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, butyrate, glutamine, and cytokines, such as transforming growth factors-beta. Unfortunately, for practical reasons, nutritional therapy remains underutilized, even though pediatric patients are most vulnerable to the harmful effects of nutrient deficiencies on growth, pubertal development, and bone health. There is hope that in the future the new field of nutrigenomics may enable physicians to more accurately tailor a specific diet to the patient genotype.},

Clinical conditions are reviewed where vitamin D may play a role in the prevention of infections or where it may be used as primary or adjuvant treatment for viral, bacterial and fungal infections. Several conditions such as tuberculosis, psoriasis, eczema, Crohn's disease, chest infections, wound infections, influenza, urinary tract infections, eye infections and wound healing may benefit from adequate circulating 25(OH)D as substrate. Clinical diseases are presented in which optimization of 25(OH)D levels may benefit or cause harm according to present day knowledge. The safety of using larger doses of vitamin D in various clinical settings is discussed.},

Food nutrients were believed to play a certain role in the causation of the disease, in conjunction with genetic, immunologic, environmental and other factors (especially intestinal microbiota). Various nutrients were found to be involved, sometimes with controversial results, possibly pertaining to geographic regions. Nutrition has to be especially considered in children as disease itself and/or the medication can severely impair normal growth and development, sometimes with permanent long-term sequels. We reviewed the data on the possible roles of diet in preventing the disease and relapses. We emphasize the crucial importance of enteral nutrition in inducing and maintaining the remission of Crohn's disease, according to the existing consensuses (benefits, indications, routes of administration, types of formula, duration, results).

Identification of specific genetic risk factors has improved the understanding of specific pathways to disease, but the primacy of environmental or lifestyle factors linked to changes in the gut microbiota, particularly in early life, is increasingly evident. Clarification of the molecular basis of host-microbe interactions in health and in susceptible individuals promises novel therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The increasing incidence of pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is well known in Western countries in the last two decades. This study was conducted to delineate the trends of incidence during this period and clinical patterns of pediatric CD in Taiwan. METHODS: All children admitted to National Taiwan University Hospital between 1990 and 2009 who met the Porto Criteria for CD were included. Annual enrollment and clinical characteristics were retrospectively reviewed. The incidence was calculated by dividing the number of index cases by total hospitalized pediatric cases to minimize the bias caused by the growing number of hospitalized patients there. We quoted data and statistics from the Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan, and Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan, Taiwan, to present the social-economic changes in Taiwan in the recent decades. RESULTS: The cumulative hospital-based incidence of CD rose from 13.2 per 100,000 to 25.4 per 100,000 children admitted to this hospital in the past two decades. The median age of diagnosis in the first decade of this study was less than that of the second decade. The other study parameters, including gender, disease activity at diagnosis, duration from disease onset to diagnosis, anatomic location and disease behavior, and symptoms at diagnosis, were not different. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the hospital-based incidence of pediatric CD has been increasing in Taiwan in recent decades. Factors contributing to such an increase could be physicians' awareness of the disease, easier access to health care, and environmental factors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intestinal microbiota contributes to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Elemental diet and total parenteral nutrition are effective therapies for Crohn's disease; however, changes of microbiota as a result of both treatments have not been fully elucidated. AIM: To elucidate changes of faecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients treated with elemental diet and total parenteral nutrition. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 33 active Crohn's disease patients and 17 healthy subjects, and recollected after elemental diet (8 patients) and total parenteral nutrition (9 patients). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of bacterial 16srDNA was performed to evaluate the whole microbiota. Specific quantitative PCR was then used to determine populations of predominant bacterial groups. RESULTS: In Crohn's disease patients, the number of terminal restriction fragments, which reflects bacterial species, was significantly lower. Populations of total bacteria and Bifidobacterium were significantly lower and the ratio of Enterococcus was higher. The number of terminal restriction fragments was significantly decreased after total parenteral nutrition, but not after elemental diet. Population of Bacteroides fragilis significantly decreased after elemental diet, while population of Enterococcus significantly increased after total parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Faecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients was markedly different from healthy subjects. Species diversity was reduced by total parenteral nutrition, but not by elemental diet.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at high risk for low bone mineral density (BMD). This study aimed to evaluate BMD in IBD patients and its relationship with bone metabolism in a group of Iranian patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with IBD to assess BMD status and serum biochemical factors. After getting the demographic data from 200 patients, they were screened using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck for BMD status. Serum levels of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH vitamin D) were measured to assess the bone metabolism status. RESULTS: Two hundred patients with IBD were enrolled in the study. One hundred and eighty three (91.5%) patients were identified as having ulcerative colitis (UC) and 17 (8.5%) as having Crohn's disease (CD). Based on the lumbar and femoral neck bone mass densitometry, 148 (74.4%) patients had low BMD at either lumbar spine or femoral neck. Of these, 100 patients (50.3%) were osteopenic and 48 patients (24.1%) were osteoporotic. A 58.6% and 61% of patients with UC had low BMD in the lumbar and femoral neck, respectively. These results for those with CD were 76.5% and 70.6%, respectively. The mean of femoral neck and lumbar T-scores in patients with UC were -1.14 and -1.38, and in patients with CD were -1.24 and -1.47, respectively (P > 0.05). The mean (+/-SD) levels for calcium (Ca) in UC and CD were in the normal range. The mean (+/-SD) levels of ALP and 25-OH vitamin D in both the groups were in the normal range, and in comparison between groups (UC and CD), no significant differences were observed (P = 0.20 for ALP and P = 0.44 for 25-OH vitamin D). In the assessment of correlation between biochemical markers and BMD, an inverse correlation between lumbar T-score and ALP or 25-OH vitamin D only in patients with UC was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of low BMD in the Iranian population with IBD needs attention. The subclinical vitamin D deficiency may contribute to bone loss in IBD patients, which is more pronounced in patients with UC in this study because of the small population of patients with CD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It remains to be shown whether inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of primary intestinal lymphoproliferative disorders (PILD). We assessed this risk in the CESAME French nationwide prospective observational cohort. METHODS: In all, 680 gastroenterologists enrolled 19,486 patients with IBD (Crohn's disease in 60.3%) from May 2004 to June 2005. Follow-up ended on 31 December 2007. Available biopsy samples and surgical specimens from patients with PILD (n = 14) were centralized for review. The reference incidence of PILD in the general population was obtained from the Cote d'Or registry and was used as a comparator to assess the standardized incidence ratio (SIR). The influence of thiopurine exposure was explored in a nested case-control study. RESULTS: In the CESAME population the crude incidence of PILD was 0.12/1000 patient-years, with a corresponding SIR of 17.51 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.43-38.11; P < 0.0001). The risk was highest in patients exposed to thiopurines (SIR 49.52, 95% CI 13.49-126.8; P < 0.0001), while it did not reach statistical significance in patients naive to thiopurines (SIR 4.83, 95% CI, 0.12-26.91; P = 0.37). The odds ratio associated with ongoing thiopurine exposure (vs. naive) was 2.97 (95% CI, 0.30-infinity; P = 0.38). All 14 cases of PILD were non-Hodgkin's B-cell LD, 78.6% occurred in males, 85.7% arose in IBD lesions, and 45.5% were Epstein-Barr virus-positive. Eleven cases occurred in patients with Crohn's disease. Mean (SD) age at PILD diagnosis was 55.1 (5.6) years and the median time since IBD onset was 8.0 years (interquartile range, 3.0-15.8). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD have an increased risk of developing PILD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease have an increased frequency of osteopenia and osteoporosis. This randomized, controlled, double-blind study assessed the efficacy of risedronate versus placebo in treating low bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: 88 Crohn's disease outpatients with BMD T-score<-1.0 by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups for the two year study duration: one group received risedronate 35 mg weekly while another received placebo. Both groups received daily calcium (Ca; 500 mg) and vitamin D (D; 400 IU) supplementation. Percent change in BMD relative to baseline was compared between the two therapies at 12 and 24 months. RESULTS: Using intent-to-treat analysis, at 12 months, risedronate+Ca+D increased BMD, relative to baseline, more than placebo+Ca+D in the femoral trochanter (1.4+/-3.4% vs -0.1+/-3.1%; p=0.03) and total hip (1.1+/-2.7% vs -0.1+/-2.5%;p=0.04). This trend in greater BMD continued for the 24 month duration of the study. There was no difference between the two treatment groups for changes in spine BMD. Subgroup analysis revealed that risedronate+Ca+D resulted in significantly better improvement in femoral trochanter BMD in non-smokers (p=0.01), males (p=0.01), those with a history of corticosteroid use in the preceding year (p=0.01), and current users of immunosuppressants (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Risedronate, in addition to daily calcium and vitamin D supplementation, is superior to calcium and vitamin D alone in improving femoral trochanter and total hip BMD in patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Environmental factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD. The history of patients of the German IBD twin study was analyzed by questionnaires and interviews. METHODS: Randomly selected German monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins with at least one sibling suffering from IBD (n=512) were characterized in detail including demography, medical history and concomitant medications. Controls comprised of non-twin IBD patients (n=392) and healthy subjects (n=207). RESULTS: The most significant variables that were associated with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) included living abroad before time of diagnosis (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 1.57-13.69), high frequency of antibiotic use (MZ CD OR, 5.03; 95% CI 1.61-17.74, DZ CD OR, 7.66; 95% CI, 3.63-16.82, MZ UC OR, 3.82; 95% CI, 1.45-10.56, DZ UC OR, 3.08; CI, 1.63-5.92), high consumption of processed meat including sausage (MZ CD OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.15-38.12, DZ CD OR, 10.75; 95% CI, 4.82-25.55, MZ UC OR, 5.69; 95% CI, 1.89-19.48, DZ UC OR, 18.11; 95% CI, 7.34-50.85), and recall of bacterial gastrointestinal infections (MZ CD OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.33-77.14, DZ CD OR, 17.21; 95% CI, 4.47-112.5, MZ UC OR, 5.87; 95% CI, 1.61-28.0, DZ UC OR, 11.34; 95% CI, 4.81-29.67). CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforced the association of life style events, in particular a specific dietary and infections history, with IBD. Alteration of gut flora or alterations of the mucosal immune system in reactivity to the flora could be an important factor to explain the relationship between life-style and disease.},

   abstract = {Recent data developing from the study of postinfectious IBS has challenged the belief that IBS is a purely psychological disorder. Distinct abnormalities of the gut mucosa have been reported including immune activation and increased release of inflammatory mediators with some overlap with IBD. New studies show that genetic factors which predispose to IBD are also associated with IBS. A common feature is impaired gut barrier function which appears to precede the development of IBD while in IBS it may be the result of either a preceding infection or psychosocial stress. Stress can activate mast cells which are a feature in most but not all IBS series. Anti-inflammatory treatments targeting activated mast cells may benefit IBS patients but currently the evidence is weak and larger trials are needed. Changes in the commensal microbiota have been recently described with a "dysbiosis" in CD characterised by reduced diversity. Inconsistent changes have also been described in IBS but studies controlling for antibiotic use and differences in diet and bowel habit are needed before definitive conclusions can be made.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Laparoscopy combined with an enhanced recovery pathway (ERP) is widely considered to be the first-choice option for patients with colorectal cancer. However, no previous reports have focused on patients with Crohn's disease (CD) treated by laparoscopy and ERP. METHODS: Twenty patients with CD underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection with an ERP at two institutions. The ERP protocol included no bowel preparation nor fasting, no nasogastric tube, no abdominal drains, early removal of urinary catheter, early solid dietary intake and mobilization, opioid-sparing analgesia and restrictive fluid management. This group was compared with a matched historical control group of 70 CD patients who underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection treated with conventional care. RESULTS: Compliance with the ERP was high (>/=80 %) for all items except no drain placement. A significantly earlier return of bowel function (time to first flatus and stool) was observed in the ERP group. Mean postoperative and total length of stay were significantly shorter in the ERP group. Postoperative complications were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported experience of laparoscopy with ERP in CD patients and suggests that optimized perioperative care combined with minimally invasive techniques may lead to further improvements in surgical outcomes for CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) mediate pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation. We characterized the role of the gelatinase (GelE), a metalloprotease from Enterococcus faecalis, in the development of colitis in mice. METHODS: Germ-free, interleukin-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) mice were monoassociated with the colitogenic E faecalis strain OG1RF and isogenic, GelE-mutant strains. Barrier function was determined by measuring E-cadherin expression, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), and translocation of permeability markers in colonic epithelial cells and colon segments from IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice. GelE specificity was shown with the MMP inhibitor marimastat. RESULTS: Histologic analysis (score 0-4) of E faecalis monoassociated IL-10(-/-) mice revealed a significant reduction in colonic tissue inflammation in the absence of bacteria-derived GelE. We identified cleavage sites for GelE in the sequence of recombinant mouse E-cadherin, indicating that it might be degraded by GelE. Experiments with Ussing chambers and purified GelE revealed the loss of barrier function and extracellular E-cadherin in mice susceptible to intestinal inflammation (IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice) before inflammation developed. Colonic epithelial cells had reduced TER and increased translocation of permeability markers after stimulation with GelE from OG1RF or strains of E faecalis isolated from patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: The metalloprotease GelE, produced by commensal strains of E faecalis, contributes to development of chronic intestinal inflammation in mice that are susceptible to intestinal inflammation (IL-10(-/-) and TNF(DeltaARE/Wt) mice) by impairing epithelial barrier integrity.},

   abstract = {Intravenous iron sucrose has been used to treat iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia associated with different chronic diseases for several decades. Despite the complex structure of iron sucrose, copies called iron sucrose similars (ISSs) have been approved according to the generic approach and therefore, therapeutic equivalence is taken for granted. In February 2011, three patients who previously tolerated well the prescribed iron sucrose originator experienced urticaria, oedema and headache within 1 hour after infusion of an ISS that had been substituted for the originator at the pharmacy level. One patient collapsed due to severe hypovolaemic dysregulation and required hospitalisation. Due to emerging evidence that ISSs differ from the iron sucrose originator in safety and efficacy profiles, it seems prudent for physicians as well as patients who require intravenous (i.v.) iron to have available data on therapeutic equivalence of new ISS preparations versus the originator. This may be especially important in patients who are chronically ill and need iron supplementation on a regular, long-term basis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of single-site laparoscopy (SSL) for the treatment of ileocolic Crohn's disease complicated by an abscess, a phlegmon, or fistulizing disease has not been thoroughly assessed. METHODS: A prospectively maintained database of SSL surgeries performed between October 2010 and March 2011 was reviewed. Consecutive patients with ileocolic Crohn's disease complicated by a paracolic abscess, a phlegmon, or a fistula were included for analysis. Data recorded included demographic information, body mass index (BMI), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of surgery, rate of conversion to standard laparoscopic surgery or open surgery, length of hospital stay, and rate of complications. RESULTS: A total of six patients were identified. Complications from Crohn's disease included four (66%) patients who developed a paracolic abscess that required drainage upon admission, one (16%) patient who developed a phlegmon, and one (16%) patient who developed an enterocutaneous fistula. Mean age of the study population was 25 years, with a mean BMI of 21 and a mean ASA score of 3. Five (83%) of the patients were immunosuppressed with high-dose steroids. Mean operative time was 160 min, with a median EBL of 60 mL. One patient required the insertion of an additional trocar, whereas there were no conversions to laparotomy. Four (66%) patients required diversion with a loop ileostomy. Median time to flatus was 1 day. All patients tolerated a diet on the day of surgery, with a median length of stay of 3 days. There were no deaths and no complications related to bleeding, organ injury, surgical site infections, or anastomotic leaks. CONCLUSIONS: A single-site laparoscopic approach for complicated ileocolic Crohn's disease can be performed safely, with short lengths of hospital stay and with a low rate of complications. A multicenter study would be beneficial to validate these findings.},

This is in stark contrast to their European counterparts. The present study aimed to define attitudes and practice patterns of EEN use by members of the North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition. METHODS: Members were contacted by e-mail and provided with access to a Web-based survey. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 326 of 1162 (30.7%) eligible North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition members from North America (86% United States, 14% Canada). Thirty-one percent of respondents reported never using EEN, 55% reported sparse use, and 12% reported regular use. Physicians in Canada reported significantly more use than those in United States (P < 0.001). Currently working and previously working in a centre where EEN was used were highly correlated with both the perceived appropriateness of EEN and the regularity of its use (P < 0.01). More American physicians than Canadian physicians reported that concurrent medical therapy was necessary to induce remission (P < 0.001). Canadian respondents were more likely to use maintenance therapy than American respondents (P = 0.02). Compliance issues were seen as the main disadvantages of EEN and as the major barrier to increased use by nonregular users. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant variations in the patterns of use and the acceptance of EEN between Canada and the United States, with Canadian physicians showing a greater use of EEN. The use of EEN appears influenced by the extent to which physicians are exposed to its use both in their training and in their current practice setting.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vitamin D deficiency impacts on bone health and has potential new roles in inflammation. We aimed to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for vitamin D deficiency and to explore vitamin D supplement usage in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in an outpatient setting, compared with controls. METHODS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay in 151 participants, comprising 81 CD patients and 70 age-, sex- and socio-economic status-matched healthy controls. Levels of 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L were classed as deficient. Data on vitamin supplement usage were recorded for all participants at interview. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency was common in patients with CD (63%) and significantly higher in winter than summer (68% v 50%; p<0.001, chi(2)). Notably, the deficiency rate remained high even in summer (50%). On regression analysis, 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with winter season. Disease-specific factors for lower serum 25(OH)D levels were longer disease duration and smoking. Overall, 43% of patients reported using a vitamin D-containing supplement, primarily at low dosages (200-400 IU/d); however, this level of supplement did not prevent deficiency. For the majority of CD patients, 25(OH)D remained below optimal levels proposed to confer bone and immune health benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency was common in patients with CD and associated with longstanding disease, smoking and winter. While over 40% of patients used a vitamin D-containing supplement, the dosages were inadequate to prevent deficiency. Appropriate vitamin D screening and supplementation should be considered in the context of health promotion of outpatients with CD.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are life-long, complex conditions. They are characterised by periods of exacerbation and remission and surgical intervention may be required in severe cases. Drugs employed in the management of IBD are used to induce remission and maintain remission. IBD has a physical, psychological and sociological impact on individuals and IBD quality standards have been developed to provide a framework for addressing the services and care that should be available for them. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies play an important role in the holistic approach to management of IBD as they are being increasingly used alongside conventional medical treatments. Community nurses have an important role to play in the management and care of individuals with IBD and in supporting them in making informed and appropriate choices that support their wellbeing and quality of life.},

   abstract = {The intestinal hormone, glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), enhances intestinal growth and reduces inflammation in rodent models. Hence, a degradation-resistant GLP-2 analog is under investigation for treatment of Crohn's disease. However, GLP-2 increases colonic dysplasia in murine azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer. Considering the increased colon cancer risk associated with chronic colitis, we have therefore examined the effects of long-acting hGly(2)GLP-2, as well as of endogenous GLP-2 using the antagonist hGLP-2(3-33) in two novel models of inflammation-associated colon cancer: rats fed the carcinogen 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and a high-fat diet (HFD) for one or three cycles, and mice with chronic dextran sodium-sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis administered AOM. hGly(2)GLP-2 treatment of one-cycle PhIP/HFD rats increased the number of colonic aberrant crypt foci by 72 +/- 11% (P < 0.01). Fifty-one weeks after three PhIP/HFD cycles, hGly(2)GLP-2-treated rats had a 22% incidence of colon cancer, compared with 0% in vehicle-treated rats. AOM-DSS mice treated with vehicle or hGly(2)GLP-2 had high-grade dysplasia/colon cancer incidences of 56 and 64%, respectively, compared with 46% in hGLP-2(3-33)-treated AOM-DSS animals (P < 0.05). Unexpectedly, hGLP-2(3-33) also reduced the colitis damage score by 32.0 +/- 8.4% (P < 0.05). All high-grade dysplastic/cancerous tumors had nuclear localization of beta-catenin although beta-catenin mRNA transcript and protein levels did not differ between treatment groups. GLP-2 receptor mRNA expression also was not different. However, hGLP-2(3-33)-treated mice had markedly reduced numbers of doublecortin-and-calmodulin-kinase-like-1-positive stem cells, by 73.7 +/- 8.6% (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the results of this study indicate a role for hGly(2)GLP-2 and endogenous GLP-2 as potential cancer promoters in rodents.},

   abstract = {Both environmental and genetic factors play roles in the development of some diseases. Complex diseases, such as Crohn's disease or Type II diabetes, are caused by a combination of environmental factors and mutations in multiple genes. Patients who have been diagnosed with such diseases cannot easily be treated. However, many diseases can be avoided if people at high risk change their living style, one example being their diet. But how can we tell their susceptibility to diseases before symptoms are found and help them make informed decisions about their health? The susceptibility to complex diseases can be predicted through the analysis of the genetic data. With the development of DNA microarray technique, it is possible to access the human genetic information related to specific diseases. This paper used a combinatorial method to analyze the genetic casecontrol data for Crohn's disease. A distance based cluster method has been applied to publicly available genotype data on Crohn's disease for epidemiological study and achieved a highly accurate result.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study was designed to assess the role of foods with raised IgG antibodies and additives on the symptoms and inflammation of Crohn's disease. METHODS: Eight patients with Crohn's disease in remission were studied. They followed a strict diet during phase I. Then, provocations with two, three-day periods (phases II and III) followed: in phase II, pure forms of foods with high IgG antibodies and in phase III, off-the-shelf forms of those foods were added. Stool samples were collected for fecal calprotectin assay. Blood samples were taken on the 11th and 17th days for highly sensitive C-reactive protein, ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cells, and platelets. Patients kept a diet-symptom diary. RESULTS: Increased Crohn's disease activity index scores were found statistically significant (p=0.012) between pre- and during the provocation weeks. There were significant increases according to Harvey-Bradshaw Index when the highest values during the phases I, II (p=0.027) and I, III (p=0.027) were compared. The increases in highly sensitive C-reactive protein (p=0.025) and white blood cells (p= 0.036) were found statistically significant. Fecal calprotectin levels showed day-to-day variability. When compared, the levels of fecal calprotectin increased in all patients on the last day of the restriction (10th day) and the first day of the provocation (11th day) with the exception of one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Foods with raised IgG antibody levels and food additives can provoke the symptoms and may stimulate the inflammation in patients with Crohn's disease. Addition of a proper diet with restriction of those foods may be beneficial in the medical treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to longitudinally study serum homocysteine levels in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in relation to disease activity and B vitamin status. METHODS: In all, 98 consecutive adult patients (age 25-55 years) with CD (n = 70) and UC (n = 28) were enrolled and assessed at three timepoints over 1 year. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in levels of homocysteine, B vitamins, or dietary intake by disease type, disease activity, or across visits. 13% of all inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients had elevated homocysteine at least once during the study. Nine patients with CD had fluctuating homocysteine levels during the study but these were inconsistent, ranging from within normal range to elevated levels in any individual. Six of these nine patients were persistently in remission. 30% of all IBD patients had vitamin B6 deficiency, 11% had vitamin B12 deficiency, and one patient (CD) had folate deficiency. All vitamins showed a significant correlation between intake and serum levels (B6; r = 0.46, P < 0.001, B12; r = 0.42, P < 0.001, and folate; r = 0.26, P = 0.008). There was an inverse relationship between serum homocysteine in the blood and serum vitamin B12 (r = -0.241, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Serum homocysteine was mostly normal in patients with IBD and changed minimally over time. There was no association between disease activity and elevation of serum homocysteine. 30% of patients have vitamin B6 deficiency but vitamin B6 is not associated with elevated homocysteine. The routine measurement of homocysteine is not warranted.},

   abstract = {In patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), malnutrition is frequently observed and is an important complication, frequently associated with nutritional deficiencies, especially vitamins (both water- and fat-soluble) and essential trace elements. It is often a result of the disease activity, poor oral intake and/or restrictive diets. Nutrition plays an important role in disease management and helps to maintain remission in CD patients. Deficiencies occur in patients with active Crohn's disease, and also in those in remission. Specific supplementation of vitamins and micro- and macronutrients might be helpful or even necessary in this group of patients. This review outlines the most frequent nutritional deficiencies and their complications in relation to the Crohn's Disease Activity Index, and provides an overview of therapeutic perspectives for CD patients in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Biological therapy, which is being used with increasing frequency, seems not only to mitigate the inflammatory process in the gastrointestinal tract, but also has significant impact on the nutritional status of patients with Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective method of treatment in achieving remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. The objective of our study was to assess the influence of EEN on serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in children and adolescents with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine children and adolescents with IBD (24 with Crohn disease [CD] and 15 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 25 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. VEGF and TGF-beta1 were assessed at the baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of EEN in CD and UC groups and once in controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoassays. RESULTS: At the baseline, we found increased serum VEGF in the CD versus UC group and controls (P < 0.05) and serum TGF-beta1 in the UC versus CD group and controls (P < 0.05). During EEN, VEGF decreased in the UC and CD groups, whereas TGF-beta1 increased in the CD group and decreased in the UC group. The CD group achieved disease remission faster than the UC group, and the weight gain of patients with CD during EEN was higher compared with patients with UC. Additionally, TGF-beta1 concentration correlated with protein and energies daily intake in the CD group (R = 0.95; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different effectiveness of EEN in achieving remission in CD and UC may result from a modification of growth factor production. EEN stimulated TGF-beta1 production in CD but not in UC, which possibly resulted in higher effectiveness of EEN in this group of patients.},

This study was undertaken to determine the clinical presentation and whether a western style diet or infection with geo-helminths were associated with the condition. METHODS: Three questionnaires were given to the patients: one relating to diet, one relating to clinical presentation and one relating to quality of life. The disease was confirmed endoscopically and histologically. Faeces were examined for parasites. RESULTS: Forty four patients were enrolled (43-ulcerative colitis; 1-Crohn's Disease). All but one had ulcerative colitis. Most had no family history of disease. The peak age of onset was 21-40 y and 63% gave a history of more than 6 months symptoms prior to diagnosis. Clinical presentation was similar to cases in western countries although milder with less severe life-events. None of them had undergone surgery. All patients ate a rice-based diet and none ate bread made of refined flour. Only 2 patient was infected with a geo-helminth. CONCLUSIONS: Eating bread made of refined flour is not related to development of IBD in these patients. The prevalence of geo-helminths in the study population corresponded to the general population average. Delay in diagnosis occurs because of an initial assumption that the cause of symptoms is infective. A National Register of non-infectious gastrointestinal disease would aid the epidemiology and allocation of funding to this inflammatory condition.},

The SenseWearPro(2) armband allows to measure physical activity under everyday life conditions. METHODS: Thirty-nine IBD patients (27 Crohn's disease, 12 ulcerative colitis, 24 boys) in remission (n=26) or with only mild disease activity (n=13) were compared to 39 healthy age and sex-matched controls. Body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), lean body mass as phase angle alpha (determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis), and dynamometric grip force were expressed as age- and sex-related Z-scores. SenseWearPro(2) armbands were applied for three consecutive days to record number of steps, duration of physical activity and sleeping time. Quality of life was assessed with the German KINDL and IMPACT III questionnaires, energy intake with prospective food protocols. Differences between patients and pair-matched controls were analysed by paired t-test. RESULTS: Patients showed lower Z-scores for phase angle alpha (difference -0.72; 95% CI [-1.10; -0.34]) and lower grip strength (-1.02 [-1.58; -0.47]) than controls. They tended towards lesser number of steps per day (-1339 [-2760; 83]) and shorter duration of physical activity (-0.44 h [-0.94; 0.06]), particularly in females and patients with mild disease. Quality of life and energy intake did not differ between patients and controls. CONCLUSION: In spite of quiescent disease lean body mass and physical activity were reduced. Interventions to encourage physical activity may be beneficial in this lifelong disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Iron replacement therapy is a common treatment in patients with anaemia and Crohn's disease, but oral iron supplements are less tolerated. The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease is attributed to intestinal bacteria and environmental factors that trigger disease in a genetically predisposed host. The aim of this study was to characterise the interrelationship between luminal iron sulfate, systemic iron, the gut microbiota and the development of chronic ileitis in a murine model of Crohn's disease. METHODS: Wild type (WT) and heterozygous TNF(DeltaARE/WT) mice were fed with an iron sulfate containing or iron sulfate free diet in combination with intraperitoneal control injections or iron injections for 11 weeks. RESULTS: TNF(DeltaARE/WT) mice develop severe inflammation of the distal ileum but remained completely healthy when transferred to an iron sulfate free diet, even if iron was systemically repleted. Absence of luminal iron sulfate reduced cellular markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses and pro-apoptotic mechanisms in the ileal epithelium. Phenotype or reactivity of major effector intraepithelial CD8alphabeta(+) T cells were not altered in the absence of luminal iron. Interestingly, ER stress mechanisms sensitised the small intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line Mode-K to cytotoxic function of effector T cells from TNF(ARE/WT) mice. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA tags of the caecal microbiota revealed that depletion of luminal iron sulfate induced significant compositional alterations, while total microbial diversity (Shannon's diversity index) and number of total operational taxonomic units were not affected. CONCLUSION: This study showed that an iron sulfate free diet in combination with systemic iron repletion prevents the development of chronic ileitis in a murine model of Crohn's disease. Luminal iron may directly affect IEC function or generate a pathological milieu in the intestine that triggers epithelial cell stress-associated apoptosis through changes in microbial homeostasis. These results suggest that oral replacement therapy with iron sulfate may trigger inflammatory processes associated with progression of Crohn's disease-like ileitis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Differing protocols have been utilized in published studies evaluating exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in the management of active pediatric Crohn's disease. This study aimed to ascertain the protocols currently utilized in different pediatric centers around the world and to highlight their similarities and differences. METHODS: A questionnaire was circulated to individuals at pediatric centers in countries in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific. Respondents were asked to indicate the number of children treated with EEN at their centers in the previous years and to provide details of their protocol used for administering EEN to these children. RESULTS: Responses were received from 35 separate centers (42% of those asked). The duration of EEN varied from <6 weeks to >12 weeks, but was most commonly 6 to 8 weeks. Although 23 different formulas were utilized across the centers, most (90%) used polymeric formulas. Flavourings were commonly added to formulas but wide variations existed between centers with the prescription of food and fluids permitted during the EEN period. The reintroduction of food after EEN also varied greatly: the most common recommendations were for an initial low-fiber diet (26%) or the gradual introduction of food quantity as the formula volume decreased (52%). CONCLUSIONS: This questionnaire-based study has shown the wide variations in EEN protocols used in different areas of the world. The development of consistent protocols may enhance the acceptance, efficacy and wider utilization of this therapy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research in the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) supports anti-inflammatory benefits of n-3 fatty acids from fish oil, prebiotics, and antioxidants. A nutritionally balanced inflammatory bowel disease nutrition formula (IBDNF) enriched with these compounds has the potential to improve nutrition status and disease activity in CD. METHODS: This is an open-label pilot study investigating the effects of IBDNF on nutrition status in CD patients. Twenty-eight patients with active CD on stable medication were asked to consume 16 oz of IBDNF/d for 4 months. Nutrition status was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans and serum micronutrient levels. Disease activity and quality of life were measured using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). RESULTS: Twenty patients completed the final visit. After 4 months, there was a significant decrease in plasma phospholipid levels of arachidonic acid with increases in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid. Ten patients had a final EPA concentration of >2%. There was improvement in fat-free and fat mass in patients with final EPA >2% (P = .014 and P = .05). Vitamin D (25-OH) levels improved in all patients (18.5-25.9 ng/mL, P < .001). Those with EPA >2% had significantly lower CDAI (116 +/- 94.5 vs 261.8 +/- 86.5; P = .005) and higher IBDQ (179.1 +/- 26.6 vs 114.6 +/- 35.9, P < .001) compared to those with EPA <2%. CONCLUSIONS: IBDNF has the potential to deposit fat-free and fat mass, improve vitamin D status, and improve quality of life in CD patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the use of nutrition risk assessment tools in paediatrics to identify those who need nutrition support. Four non-disease specific screening tools have been developed, although there is a paucity of data on their application in clinical practice and the degree of inter-tool agreement. METHODS: The concurrent validity of four nutrition screening tools [Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Paediatrics (STAMP), Screening Tool for Risk On Nutritional status and Growth (STRONGkids), Paediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS) and Simple Paediatric Nutrition Risk Score (PNRS)] was examined in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease. Degree of malnutrition was determined by anthropometry alone using World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria. RESULTS: There was good agreement between STAMP, STRONGkids and PNRS (kappa > 0.6) but there was only modest agreement between PYMS and the other scores (kappa = 0.3). No children scored low risk with STAMP, STRONGkids or PNRS; however, 23 children scored low risk with PYMS. There was no agreement between the risk tools and the degree of malnutrition based on anthropometric data (kappa < 0.1). Three children had anthropometry consistent with malnutrition and these were all scored high risk. Four children had body mass index SD scores < -2, one of which was scored at low nutrition risk. CONCLUSIONS: The relevance of nutrition screening tools for children with chronic disease is unclear. In addition, there is the potential to under recognise nutritional impairment (and therefore nutritional risk) in children with inflammatory bowel disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increased resting energy expenditure (REE) unmatched by dietary intake is implicated as a cause of poor nutrition in childhood inflammatory conditions. Adequate description of disease activity and correction of REE data for body composition are important to reach reliable conclusions about changes in REE associated with disease. The present study aimed to determine the effect of disease activity measured by clinical status, systemic and stool inflammatory markers on REE in children with Crohn disease using appropriate correction for confounding factors. METHODS: Sixty children with Crohn disease were recruited from the regional paediatric gastroenterology unit and studied on 1 occasion. REE was measured by indirect calorimetry. Fat-free mass (FFM) was estimated by skinfold thickness. Disease activity was measured using systemic (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and faecal markers of inflammation (lactoferrin, calprotectin) and clinical scores (Paediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index). RESULTS: Using a multiple regression model, there was no significant change in REE from active or inactive disease (beta = 0.03, P = 0.7) nor from CRP (beta = -0.05, P = 0.52), ESR (beta = -0.07, P = 0.43), faecal calprotectin (beta = -0.07, P = 0.38), and faecal lactoferrin (beta = 0.01, P = 0.88). REE/kg FFM was not associated with the Paediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (r = 0.1, P = 0.44), CRP (r = -0.3, P = 0.84) or ESR (r = 0.12, P = 0.4), faecal calprotectin (r = 0.04, P = 0.97), or faecal lactoferrin (r = 0.02, P = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: REE corrected for physiologically relevant confounders is not associated with degree of disease activity using clinical tools or systemic and local inflammatory markers, and therefore is an unlikely mechanism for poor nutritional state.},

Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range 6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), - 0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of enteral nutrition (EN) as a maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) patients following surgery. METHODS: This study was an extension of our previous study to prolong the duration of intervention and follow-up from 1 to 5 years. Forty consecutive patients who underwent resection for ileal or ileocolic CD were included. Following surgery, 20 patients received continuous elemental diet infusion during the nighttime plus a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group). Another 20 patients received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (control group). All patients were followed for 5 years after operation. No patient received corticosteroid, immunosuppressants, or infliximab except patients who developed recurrence. The end point of this study was recurrence requiring biologic therapy or reoperation. Recurrence rates were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: In the EN group, four patients could not continue tube intubation for elemental diet intake. Two patients (10 %) in the EN group and nine patients (45 %) in the control group developed recurrence requiring infliximab therapy (P = 0.03). The cumulative recurrence incidence rate requiring infliximab was significantly lower in the EN group vs the control group (P = 0.02). One patient (5 %) in the EN group and five patients (25 %) in the control group required reoperation for recurrence (P = 0.18). The cumulative incidence of reoperation was lower in the EN group vs the control group, the difference not being significant (P = 0.08). CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study suggest that EN therapy reduces the incidence of postoperative CD recurrence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: 5-Aminosalicylates (ASA) are widely used in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nephrotoxicity has been described in some IBD patients treated with 5-ASA. Whether physicians managing these patients are monitoring renal function in daily practice is unknown. The aims of this paper were to investigate how private gastroenterologists monitor renal function and manage renal failure in IBD patients treated with oral 5-ASA therapy. METHODS: This was a web-based cross sectional national survey which was conducted among private gastroenterologists. RESULTS: A total of 249 practitioners completed the survey. Eighty two percent (n=205) of responders declared that they always monitor renal function. The respondents monitored twice a year Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) [90% (n=225)] and Creatinine Clearance (CCr) using a 24-hour urine collection [51% (n=126)]. Blood electrolytes, 24-hour urinary protein rate and dipsticks are performed by 41%, 39% and 22% of practitioners, respectively. Before oral 5-ASA initiation, 59% (n=148) of respondents screen for renal failure. In case of elevated serum creatinine, a nephrologist's opinion is asked by 80% (n=200) of responders and by 76% (n=189) of respondents before treatment initiation. CONCLUSIONS: Most gastroenterologists are monitoring renal function once or twice a year in IBD patients on 5-ASA. Less than two thirds of them screen for renal failure before treatment initiation. MDRD is mainly used, but a wide range of parameters is evaluated.},

   abstract = {The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex and abundant microbial community reaching as high as 10(13)-10(14) microorganisms in the colon. This endogenous microbiota forms a symbiotic relationship with their eukaryotic host and this close partnership helps maintain homeostasis by performing essential and non-redundant tasks (e.g. nutrition/energy and, immune system balance, pathogen exclusion). Although this relationship is essential and beneficial to the host, various events (e.g. infection, diet, stress, inflammation) may impact microbial composition, leading to the formation of a dysbiotic microbiota, further impacting on health and disease states. For example, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively termed inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have been associated with the establishment of a dysbiotic microbiota. In addition, extra-intestinal disorders such as obesity and metabolic syndrome are also associated with the development of a dysbiotic microbiota. Consequently, there is an increasing interest in harnessing the power of the microbiome and modulating its composition as a means to alleviate intestinal pathologies/disorders and maintain health status. In this review, we will discuss the emerging relationship between the microbiota and development of colorectal cancer as well as present evidence that microbial manipulation (probiotic, prebiotic) impacts disease development.},
