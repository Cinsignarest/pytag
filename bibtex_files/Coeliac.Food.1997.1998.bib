   abstract = {A total of 167 children and adolescents with insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetes mellitus (97 males; age range 1.9-22.4 yrs) in a UK paediatric diabetic clinic were screened for coeliac disease using the IgA endomysial (EMA) test, or, in IgA deficient subjects, the IgG antigliadin (AGA) test. Antibody positive subjects were selected for small bowel biopsy, and confirmed coeliac cases started on a gluten free diet. Clinical features, height (Ht) standard deviation score (SDS), body mass index (BMI) SDS, HbA1c, insulin requirements' haemoglobin (Hb), mean red cell volume (MCV), serum folate and ferritin levels were evaluated at diagnosis and thereafter at 3-6 month intervals. A total of 156 subjects (93.4%) were antibody negative. Eleven (6.6%) were antibody positive (10 EMA/1 AGA; 6 males), of whom 9 had biopsies: 1 normal: 8 coeliac (4.8%; 5 males; 1 'classical'; 1 anaemia; 3 'atypical'; 3 asymptomatic). Seven coeliac subjects were followed during 12-24 months of dietary therapy. Pretreatment mean (range) Ht SDS = 0.08 (-1.66 to 1.88); BMI SDS = 0.32 (-0.82 to 1.29); HbA1c = 8.9 (6.2 to 11.3%); insulin dose = 0.98 (0.51 to 1.29) U kg(-1) day(-1). During treatment antibody status reverted to and remained negative, and symptoms resolved. By 24 months, there was a trend towards increased BMI SDS (mean (range) 1.31 (0.47 to 2.29), p = 0.248) and to reductions in HbA1c (8.1 (6.4-10.8), p = 0.697). Repeat small bowel biopsies were normal in 6 subjects (1 refused). No statistically significant changes occurred in any other parameters. In conclusion, serological screening is effective, although the therapeutic benefit of dietary therapy in asymptomatic cases remains uncertain.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The detection and evaluation of steatorrhea in a rapid, quantitative fashion are clinically needed in patients with suspected steatorrhea. Our aim was to evaluate the acid steatocrit method, on random spot stools in adults with and without steatorrhea, relative to the qualitative (microscopic) and quantitative assessments for fecal fat. METHODS: Stool samples were collected 72 h after a diet of 100 g of fat per day and randomly from 15 healthy controls, 14 patients with chronic pancreatitis, and seven patients with small bowel disease. All stools had quantitative, qualitative, and acid steatocrit analyses performed for fecal fat. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of steatorrhea by the spot stool qualitative fecal fat were 78 and 70%, respectively. The spot stool acid steatocrit correlated linearly with the 72-h stool quantitative fecal fat (g/24 h), r = 0.761 and p < 0.001. The acid steatocrit on random spot stools, compared with the 72-h stool quantitative fecal fat, revealed a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 95%, and a positive predictive value of 90% for the detection of steatorrhea. It also estimated the quantitative fecal fat. CONCLUSIONS: The acid steatocrit can be performed accurately on random spot stools and can be used to detect the presence of steatorrhea and estimate the quantitative fecal fat. This assay can be done with readily available equipment for rapid evaluation. Use of a spot stool sample simplifies the acid steatocrit, further improving on the practicality of this test. This study also confirms the clinical usefulness of this simplified method to detect steatorrhea.},

Eight cases of silent coeliac disease were found and these were compared with the 73 siblings in whom the diagnosis was excluded. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between cases and referents in terms of duration of breast feeding, age at introduction of cows' milk products, frequency of breast feeding after gluten introduction, and gluten consumption.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the operating properties of endomysial antibodies (EMAs) in the diagnosis of celiac disease and to examine, using a cost minimization model, different strategies used in the diagnosis of celiac disease. METHODS: A total of 248 EMA results were reviewed and compared with small bowel biopsy results in 66 patients who had undergone both tests. Regression analysis was used to look for predictors of positive EMA results and positive biopsy results. A cost minimization model from a societal perspective was used to evaluate the cost differences among three different strategies. RESULTS: EMAs had a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 64%. The only predictor of a positive biopsy result that reached statistical significance was a positive EMA. The strategy of EMA as a diagnostic test for celiac disease was the most expensive strategy, with a cost of $3,174 per patient assessed. The strategy of small bowel biopsy for all patients had a cost of $997, and a strategy of EMA followed by small bowel biopsy for positive patients had a cost of $866 per patient. The results were sensitive to cost of a gluten-free diet, the specificity of the EMA and the cost of a small bowel biopsy. CONCLUSION: The EMA is best used as a screening test from both a clinical and cost perspective.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a new hypothesis for the etiology and pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD). It is our contention that CD is triggered by the binding of one or more gliadin peptides to CD-associated HLA class II molecules. Furthermore, we propose that these putative CD peptides bind to oligosaccharide residues on HLA class II molecules distal to the peptide-binding groove invoking recognition and binding by specialized subsets of gamma delta T cell receptor-bearing lymphocytes. The binding of these gamma delta T cells serves as a signal for abrogation of oral tolerance to ingested proteins setting in motion a series of immune responses directed against the small intestinal epithelium of CD patients. CD patients are victimized by this self-distructed immune response because of inheritance of certain combinations of HLA-DQ and DR haplotypes. Dimers encoded by HLA-DR haplotypes may be the primary restriction elements for lectin-like, gliadin peptides while the degree of immune suppression (or lack thereof) to ingested gliadins is governed by inherited HLA-DQ haplotypes. Finally, we speculate that molecular mimicry between one or more gliadin peptides and some, as yet unidentified, bacterial or viral superantigen plays a role in disease pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An association between celiac disease and primary biliary cirrhosis has been reported in a few cases, mainly as individual case reports. OBJECTIVES: To screen adult patients with celiac disease for primary biliary cirrhosis and patients with primary biliary cirrhosis for intestinal celiac involvement. METHODS: The celiac group consisted of 336 adults (218 women and 118 men; mean age, 36 yr; range 18-74 yr) with celiac disease diagnosed by serological and histological tests, 38 with newly diagnosed celiac disease and 298 with previously diagnosed celiac disease who were consuming a gluten-free diet. The mean follow-up period was 6 yr (range, 1-16 yr). Liver function parameters and autoantibody levels were determined, and, when indicated, histological tests were performed. The biliary cirrhosis group consisted of 65 subjects (58 women and seven men) (mean age, 59 yr; range, 35-67 yr) with primary biliary cirrhosis diagnosed 1-17 years previously (mean, 7 yr) on the basis of the usual biochemical, serological, and histological criteria. Antigliadin and antiendomysium antibody levels were determined, and two biopsy specimens from the distal duodenum obtained during endoscopy were evaluated. RESULTS: In patients with celiac disease, impairment of liver function was frequently found at diagnosis (16 of 38, or 44%), but primary biliary cirrhosis was diagnosed in only one case. In patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, no cases of celiac disease, as currently defined, were found. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that celiac disease and primary biliary cirrhosis are rarely associated and support the hypothesis that the intestinal lesions per se are not responsible for the liver disease.},

The diagnosis of CD was established on the basis of ESPGAN criteria (1969). 5-15 years ago. Antigliadin antibodies, IgG-, and IgA-AGA (by fluorescence enzyme immunoassay), Gliastick by ELISA technique, and Anti-endomysium antibodies (by indirect immunofluorescence on sections of monkey esophagus) were examined in the serum. Only 5 patients had no antigliadin or anti-endomysium antibodies. In 21 cases the IgG-AGA showed positive results; the IgA-AGA was positive in 6, the Gliastick in 19, and the anti-endomysium antibodies in 8 cases. The main cause of the mismanagement of the diet was inadequate food labeling; so it seems to be important to also establish a Food Intolerance Data Bank in Hungary. The 5 sero-negative children volunteered for a gluten challenge; 3 of them became positive in a few weeks or months. Two patients remained negative even after 1 year. Their gluten sensitivity may not prove to be permanent.},

However, notwithstanding patient' belief about 'allergies' related to food stuffs, only a minority of them have actually such a diagnosis substantiated. Moreover, the diagnostic approach to these problems is cumbersome and unsatisfactory, and the objectivation of a food hypersensitivity is often difficult. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For these reasons we studied by means of small bowel manometry a small group of patients with food hypersensitivity, and showed abnormal fasting and postprandial findings in those with the gut as a target organ on clinical grounds. RESULTS: Manometric abnormalities were somewhat similar to those previously described in celiac disease, a well recognized food allergy disease. The possible usefulness of this technique in the investigative approach of food hypersensitivity is discussed.},

The question has never been addressed whether gamma-interferon influences binding of gliadin and other food peptides to human enterocytes. Therefore, the human intestinal epithelial cell line HT-29 was cultured with gliadin, casein, beta-lactoglobulin and ovalbumin, with or without gamma-interferon, and peptide binding to cells was determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. gamma-Interferon stimulated gliadin binding by a factor of 4. Binding was saturable with half maximal binding at 0.15 mg/ml. For maximal binding, an incubation of at least 24 h was necessary. gamma-Interferon increased binding of beta-lactoglobulin and casein, too, but inhibited that of ovalbumin. Binding of gliadin was inhibited by the other peptides. Under the conditions of ongoing mucosal inflammatory reactions and release of gamma-interferon, enhanced binding may trigger intestinal lymphocytes, increase secretion of cytokines and thus induce a vicious circle.},

METHODS: Five patients with milk-related gastrointestinal symptoms diagnosed by double-blind placebo-controlled milk challenges, but with negative responses to skin prick tests and RASTs with milk, and eight healthy control subjects were investigated. Repeated perfusion studies were performed with a two-balloon, six-channel tube by using milk, casein, and whey as antigens. Luminal eosinophil cationic protein, histamine, and albumin were measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Luminal cow's milk induced a pronounced increase in intestinal secretion of histamine and eosinophil cationic protein in patients, but not control subjects, during the first 20 minutes after challenge (histamine from 123 +/- 12 to 543 +/- 175 ng/cm, hr; eosinophil cationic protein from 80 +/- 23 to 686 +/- 262 ng/cm, hr). Albumin, as a marker of plasma leakage, was also significantly increased. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that mast cells and eosinophils are effector cells not only in patients with allergic disease but also in patients intolerant to foods and lacking circulating antibodies. The underlying mechanisms may be a reaction mediated by locally appearing antibodies or an immunologic activation resembling that found in intestinal disorders such as celiac disease.},

Coeliac disease is characterized by an enteropathy sensitive to gluten, malabsorption of food and partial or total villous atrophy. Also malignant lymphoma may present with malabsorption and mucosal lesion similar to that found in coeliac patients. The diagnosis of lymphoma in coeliac patients can be extremely difficult because the presenting symptoms and histological lesion are similar, but the presence of a cluster of symptoms such as abdominal pain malabsorption, weight loss in patients older than 40 years with a history of poorly responsive coeliac disease should raise a suspicion of malignancy.

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is diagnosed by means of jejunal biopsy, an invasive procedure. Anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) have therefore been used in the first screening of the disease. On the other hand, low titers of AGA are widely detected also in normal subjects. In order to investigate if low levels of AGA could be correlated with laboratory and clinical data, we performed a study on 167 subjects with various illnesses, such as recurrent abdominal pain, failure to thrive, short stature, diarrhoea or constipation, cow-milk protein intolerance and/or food allergy, recurrent vomiting or previous gastroenteritis, all non coeliac conditions which have been associated with AGA presence. Seventy coeliac children, all biopsied, were selected as a control group. Among the 167 cases we found 60 subjects positive for AGA (35.9%), a high proportion as compared with the general population. Only 33/167 patients, all IgG and IgA AGA positive, fulfil our laboratory and clinical criteria to perform a 'confirming' biopsy. For the 134 residual cases (14 IgA, 13 only IgG AGA positive, 107 AGA negative) a diagnosis of coeliac disease has been excluded by clinical criteria (scoring). As a whole, the patients with coeliac disease had significantly higher levels of AGA of both IgG and IgA classes (p < 0.01). On the other hand, no significant difference emerged for all the anamnestic and laboratory parameters considered between AGA+ and AGA- non-coeliac subjects. However, laboratory parameters of IgG-AGA and/or IgA-AGA positive patients were similar to those of coeliac children for ion, Xylose, total IgA count. As no biopsied case showed mucosal atrophy, it is suggested that the presence of even low AGA levels in non-coeliac children may represent a highly sensitive index of intestinal alteration causing an increased permeability to macromolecules, but it is very unlikely that one could detect coeliac children by means of Ig-AGA among such illnesses and normal subjects. Strong clinical diagnosis and laboratory parameters are required to justify intestinal biopsies. In fact, the production of AGA seems to be a merely immunological phenomenon linked to an increased and probably transient permeability to macromolecules of the intestinal mucosa.},

   abstract = {Genetics of human diseases has passed through three main historical phases: (1) studies of formal genetics aimed at investigating mechanisms of inheritance using Mendelian models in population, family and twin surveys; (2) studies of associations between HLA antigens and diseases; and (3) direct mapping of genes through candidate gene or random genomic search approach. Very few data in each of these three phases are available for food allergy and intolerance. They are mostly confined to formal genetics studies of allergy in general and to HLA association studies in celiac diseases. The main reason for paucity of data in this important area of investigation is represented by the heterogeneity of the clinical entities grouped under the label of food allergy at the level of: (1) the clinical phenotype, because of the many diseases and end-organs interested; (2) pathophysiological variables involved, since several immunological and non-immunological mechanisms can be invoked in different cases of food allergy and intolerance; and (3) the foods or their absorbed metabolites which induce symptoms. However, progress made in genetics of allergy can be in part extrapolated to the limited number of cases where an IgE-mediated mechanism has been demonstrated. The review of studies based on a more punctual definition of the allergic phenotype and of the candidate genes (regions) of allergy: (1) suggests that allergen recognition and specific IgE response, total IgE (and IgG4) polyclonal activation, up-regulation of inflammatory cells (mast cells and eosinophils mainly) and hyper-responsiveness of end-organs are possibly regulated by different genetic and environmental factors; and (2) calls particular attention on the following genomic regions: 5q31.1-33, 6p21.3, 11q13,14. Research on genetics of food allergy and intolerance is highly recommended because of its high prevalence and of the potential applicative value of results for preventive measures of dietary control in subjects at risk. Since `food allergy and intolerance' does not represent an useful phenotype for genetic studies because of its heterogeneity, adequate strategies of gene mapping should be designed in study groups selected for defined variables with a well established role in the pathogenesis of the different clinical expressions of this common condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Age at onset and clinical presentation of celiac disease have often been related to the age of gluten introduction into the diet. It has also been shown that breast feeding delays the onset of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study attempts to evaluate the respective contributions of these two parameters in the determination of the age at onset of the symptoms in celiac Tunisian children. RESULTS: One-hundred-sixty-nine children were studied. Mean duration of breast feeding in our population was 9.6 +/- 8.9 months and mean age of gluten introduction was 5.6 +/- 3.2 months. The mean age at onset of the disease was 15 +/- 8.7 months and mean latency time between gluten introduction and onset of the disease was 9.5 +/- 7.8 months. Both variables, duration of breast feeding and age at gluten introduction were strongly correlated to the age at onset of the disease (r = 0.47 and 0.40, respectively). Only breast feeding was correlated to the variable latency time (r = 0.33). Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the two variables independently influenced the age at onset with coefficients of regression of 0.90 +/- 0.20 and 0.26 +/- 0.07, respectively. Only breast feeding influenced the latency time with a coefficient of regression equal to 0.26 +/- 0.07. DISCUSSION: Our study confirms the independent effect of breast feeding in the determination of the age at onset of the disease. Breast feeding has two effects: an indirect effect, by delaying the introduction of gluten, and a direct effect, by increasing the latency time between gluten introduction and onset of the disease. CONCLUSION: Prolonged breast feeding, at least until the 6th month, and gluten introduction started at least at the 5th month of life, significantly delay the onset of the disease. Gluten introduction should be done progressively and under breast feeding protection. Introduction of gluten 2 months before weaning has a protective effect.},

   abstract = {The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) taught us to set target blood glucose (BG) and glycohaemoglobin (GHb) goals, to ensure safety regarding hypoglycaemia, to be flexible with insulin and meal planning and to offer frequent contact with diabetes educators, dieticians, psychologists and social workers as well as with diabetologists skilled in intensified management. Insulin dosage should be individualized based upon frequent BG monitoring results. Co-ordinated multidisciplinary health care teams provide optimum problem-solving rather than disaster control working with children, adolescents and their families. The patient and the family should form the central core of the diabetes team with outpatient follow-up every month and frequent telephone contact between visits. GHb should be obtained at least every 1-2 months to provide feedback as based on the DCCT intensified treatment cohort. Insulin lispro helps minimize hypoglycaemia and makes insulin administration more convenient and timely. Barriers to improvement should be identified: learning problems, concomitant significant illnesses (epilepsy, coeliac and thyroid disease, asthma) and family problems. Ensure age-appropriate transfer of self-care but continue adult supervision. Educate, motivate and re-educate. Meal planning includes not only carbohydrate counting but also maintaining normal lipids and energy needs for growth and development as well as strategies for activity compensation and hypoglycaemia prevention. Consideration of protein restriction may be required in adolescents with microalbuminuria. Individualized multidose insulin algorithms allow reactive (corrective) decisions based upon capillary BG results plus proactive (anticipatory) decisions to compensate for expected BG changes from changes in activity, food and/or illness using a multidose insulin schedule. The number of insulin injections does not define an intensified insulin treatment programme but rather the ability to target and achieve near-normal BG values as often as possible - without severe episodes of hypoglycaemia. Self BG monitoring is a key to success. Long-term monitoring should include not only frequent GHb but also at least annual fasting lipids, thyroid functions and microalbuminuria as well as dilated retinal exams, blood pressure, growth charting and Tanner staging.},

This pattern was identified in both processed and unprocessed gluten-containing food samples. The procedure allows the micro-quantification of gluten in food samples below levels toxic for coeliac patients, with a linear response in the 0.4-10 mg per 100 g range and a high detection sensitivity similar to that of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems. Food samples simultaneously analyzed by MALDI/TOF-MS and a highly sensitive laboratory-made sandwich ELISA revealed a good correlation between the two techniques. In addition, MALDI/TOF-MS provides a rapid screening system to determine the presence of gliadins in food samples by directly monitoring the occurrence of the protonated gliadin mass pattern. The procedure also permits the study of the alteration of gliadins in food during the baking process, providing data on the heart effect by changes in protein mass signals.},

The method is based on the direct observation of the characteristic avenin mass pattern, around 20-30 kDa, as revealed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF-MS). The mass range where avenin signals appear is free from mass peaks arising from wheat gliadin, barley hordein and rye secalin protein components, which are also toxic to coeliac patients. Therefore, avenins can easily be screened in complex formula food samples elaborated with mixtures of wheat, barley, rye and oats. In addition, a procedure to quantify avenins in food samples is described on the basis of avenin mass area measurement with a detection limit of 0.4 mg of avenins per 100 g of food.},

Gliadin, secalin and avenin characteristic mass profiles are nearly identical amongst distinct cultivars from the corresponding cereal, while hordeins profiles show more variability depending on the particular barley cultivar. On the basis of these four distinguishable characteristic mass patterns spreading within the 20,000-40,000 Da range, MALDI-TOF-MS has permitted the direct and simultaneous visualization of gliadins, hordeins, secalins and avenins in foods elaborated with cereal mixtures of wheat, barley, rye and oats. This capacity has been demonstrated by mass analyzing foods made with these four cereals in varying ratios. Thus MALDI-TOF-MS can be preliminarily established as a unique system with the ability to discriminate the specific type of gluten toxic fractions present in food samples.},

In this study body composition, dietary habits, basal energy expenditure, and substrate oxidation were investigated in patients with the classic form of coeliac disease. METHODS: Sixteen untreated and 18 adult coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet participated in the study. Body composition was assessed by anthropometry and bioimpedance. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry. A food diary over 7 days was collected. RESULTS: Coeliac patients showed reduced body weight components but not a different fat-free mass percentage compared with age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Basal metabolic rate normalized by fat-free mass (BMR/FFM) was higher in coeliac patients than in controls. Untreated patients showed a significantly higher non-protein respiratory quotient with regard to both treated patients (P < 0.01) and controls (P < 0.05), an increased percentage of carbohydrate intake, and a good correlation between lipid faecal loss and carbohydrate oxidation (Spearman R = 0.74; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Both groups of patients had lower fat mass and FFM content than controls. The preferential carbohydrate oxidation in untreated patients might be a result of both lipid malabsorption and high carbohydrate intake.},

AIMS: To investigate pancreatic function in HIV infected children and to determine whether faecal fat loss, a prominent feature of intestinal dysfunction, is associated with pancreatic dysfunction. PATIENTS: Forty seven children with HIV infection without apparent pancreatic disease and 45 sex and age matched healthy controls. METHODS: Pancreatic function was evaluated by measuring elastase 1 concentration and chymotrypsin activity in stools by ELISA and colorimetric methods, respectively. Intestinal function was evaluated by measuring fat and protein loss by the steatocrit method and by faecal alpha1 antitrypsin concentration. RESULTS: 14 (30%) had abnormal pancreatic function tests: seven had isolated elastase activity deficiency, three isolated chymotrypsin deficiency, and four pancreatic deficiencies in both enzymes. Patient enzyme values were significantly lower than those of controls. Low faecal pancreatic enzymes were not associated with symptoms. Twelve children had steatorrhoea and four had increased alpha1 antitrypsin. Steatorrhoea was significantly associated with reduced faecal pancreatic enzymes. There was a significant negative correlation between elastase 1 concentration and steatocrit. Children with pathological faecal elastase 1 or chymotrypsin values did not differ from the other HIV infected children with respect to nutritional and immunological status, stage of HIV disease, presence of opportunistic infections, or drug administration. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal pancreatic function tests are a frequent feature of paediatric HIV infection; this condition is associated with steatorrhoea, which probably contributes to the disease.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Evaluate in patients with celiac disease the tolerance of prolonged consumption of small amounts of gliadin contained in products containing wheat starch. DESIGN: Open 1-year trial of the addition of wheat starch to a gluten-free diet in a cohort of adult patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease who had never consumed wheat starch. The control group consisted of patients with celiac disease who tolerated wheat starch. SUBJECTS: Seventeen patients with celiac disease and 14 control patients, all diagnosed according to criteria of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, were recruited from the Canadian Celiac Association and the Quebec Celiac Foundation. SETTING: The study was conducted in the outpatient clinic of the Gastroenterology and Nutrition Service of Ste Justine Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were asked to consume four to six portions daily of a wheat starch-containing product, mainly bread, for up to 1 year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The gliadin content of the wheat starch product used in this trial was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patient outcome measures included symptoms, nutritional parameters (anthropometric data, complete blood count, serum folate and iron levels), and immunologic parameters (antigliadin antibody and antiendomysium antibody titers). RESULTS: A quantifiable amount of immunoreactive gliadin (0.75 mg/100 g) was found in the wheat starch. The majority of the patients with celiac disease (11 of 17) who had never consumed wheat starch previously developed symptoms, which resolved within weeks of discontinuing the product. Relapse of skin lesions was seen in two of three patients with coexisting dermatitis herpetiformis. No weight loss or biochemical changes were observed. Despite the presence of symptoms, antigliadin antibody and antiendomysium antibody determinations were not useful to detect the clinical intolerance. APPLICATIONS: The innocuousness of the long-term ingestion of "gluten-free" products containing wheat starch is still unproven, and prolonged use of such products by patients with celiac disease cannot be recommended.},

   abstract = {The mechanisms responsible for bowel disturbances in celiac disease are still relatively unknown. Recent reports suggested that small bowel motor abnormalities may be involved in this pathological condition; however, there are no studies addressing small bowel transit in celiac disease before and after a gluten-free diet. We studied the mouth-to-cecum transit time of a caloric liquid meal in a homogeneous group of celiac patients presenting with clinical and biochemical evidence of malabsorption and complaining of diarrhea. Sixteen patients were recruited and investigated by means of hydrogen breath test through ingestion of 20 g lactulose together with an enteral gluten-free diet formula. A urinary D-xylose test was also done in each patient. Both breath tests and D-xylose tests were carried out basally and after a period of gluten-free diet. Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited as a control group and underwent the same breath testing. At the time of the diagnosis, mouth-to-cecum transit time was significantly prolonged in celiacs with respect to controls (243 +/- 10 vs 117 +/- 6 min, P = 0.0001). The D-xylose test was also abnormal (average urinary concentration 2.8 +/- 0.25 g, normal values >4.5). No correlation was found in patients between mouth-to-cecum transit time and urinary D-xylose output (r = 0.22). After the gluten-free diet period, mouth-to-cecum transit time in celiacs was significantly reduced compared to prediet transit (134 +/- 8 vs 243 +/- 10 min, P = 0.0001) and did not show statistical difference when compared to that found in controls (P = 0.1). The D-xylose test reverted to normal in all but two subjects, who were found to be noncompliant with the diet. Mouth-to-cecum transit time is significantly prolonged in patients affected by untreated celiac disease when compared to healthy controls. This alteration might not be correlated to intestinal malabsorption, and the prolonged orocecal transit could be due to impaired small bowel function (deranged motility?). Since intestinal transit returned to normal values after an adequate gluten-free period, a link with severe active mucosal lesions is suggestive.},

   abstract = {Fumonisin B1 is currently regarded as the most significant mycotoxin produced by Fusarium spp. It has carcinogenic properties and may play a role in the etiology of human esophageal cancer. The human population is exposed to fumonisin B1 primarily by intake of fumonisin B1-contaminated maize. Maize consumed in the Netherlands is imported from all parts of the world. Since processing will not affect the overall toxic effect, the fumonisin B1 intake is directly related to the quantity of maize consumed. Literature results concerning the occurrence of fumonisin B1 in a total of 349 samples of maize from 18 countries worldwide demonstrated the presence of this mycotoxin in 93% of the samples. The median fumonisin B1 contamination of all samples was 420 ng of fumonisin B1 per g of maize, and the average contamination level was 1,359 ng of fumonisin B1 per g of maize. Human intake of fumonisin B1 was estimated based on the maize consumption of all people in the Netherlands in 1992. A probability distribution was derived to allow estimation of the exposure of the population to fumonisin B1 intake in relation to maize intake. It showed that among those in the group considered to be at risk, people with gluten intolerance such as people with celiac or Duhring's disease, 37% are estimated to be exposed to an intake of at least 10(5) ng and 97% to an intake of at least 10(3) ng of fumonisin B1 per person per day. For all people in the Netherlands these percentages would be 1% and 49%, respectively.},

   abstract = {Two peptides corresponding to bread wheat A-gliadin fragments 31-43 and 44-55, well known for their ability to damage the coeliac disease intestinal mucosa both in vitro and in vivo, have been confirmed to be very active in inducing in vitro agglutination of K 562 (S) cells. Removal of six amino acid residues from the carboxy-terminal end of the 31-43 peptide, or of five amino acid residues from the amino terminal end of the 44-55 peptide, resulted in a lower, but still very significant, cell agglutination activity. The peptide consisting of ten amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 1157.5 Da, isolated from durum wheat gliadin, was able to prevent agglutination of K 562 (S) cells induced not only by prolamine peptic-tryptic digests from all the cereals toxic in coeliac disease (i.e. bread wheat, rye, barley and oats), but also by the 31-43 and 44-55 peptides. The ability to protect K 562 (S) cells from agglutination was exhibited to the fullest extent also by all the peptides derived from the 1157.5-Da peptide by five progressive deletions of the terminal carboxylic residue, whereas the sixth consecutive deletion yielded a completely inactive peptide. A similar total loss of activity was observed upon addition of a glycine residue to the amino terminal residue of the 1157.5-Da peptide and all the above-mentioned active peptides derived from it. The remarkable sequence homologies existing between peptides able to induce [Gln-Gln-Gln-Pro and -Pro-Ser-Gln-Gln-] or to prevent [H2N-Gln-Gln-Pro-Gln-Asp-COOH] induction of cell agglutination strongly suggest that all these peptides compete for identical or structurally related binding sites on the cell surface.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Future European Community regulations will require a sensitive and specific assay for measurement of coeliac toxic gluten proteins in foods marketed as gluten-free. To avoid spurious cross reactions with non-toxic proteins, specific antibodies and target antigens are required. A synthetic 19 amino acid peptide of A gliadin has been shown to cause deterioration in the morphology of small intestinal biopsy specimens of coeliac patients in remission. AIMS: To develop an assay for detection of gluten in foods, based on measurement of a known toxic peptide. METHODS: A monoclonal antibody raised against the toxic A gliadin peptide, with a polyclonal anti-unfractionated gliadin capture antibody, was used to develop a double sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the measurement of gluten in foods. RESULTS: Standard curves for gliadin and for rye, barley, and oat prolamins were produced. The sensitivity of the assay was 4 ng/ml of gliadin, 500 ng/ml for rye prolamins, and 1000 ng/ml for oat and barley prolamins. The assay could detect gluten in cooked foods, although at reduced sensitivity. Prolamins from coeliac non-toxic rice, maize, millet, and sorghum did not cross react in the assay. A variety of commercially available gluten-free foods were analysed; small quantities of gluten were detected in some products. CONCLUSION: The assay may form the basis of a sensitive method for measurement of gluten in foods for consumption by patients with coeliac disease.},

   abstract = {Coeliac disease is associated with intestinal lesion. This lesion causes architectural derangement of the mucosa in the form of villus atrophy, increased crypt length and increased volume of the lamina propria. Several changes in the intestinal endocrine cells have been reported over the years, e.g. the number of secretin cells and increased numbers of GIP, CCK/gastrin, motilin, and serotonin cells. There is no consensus about the nature of the changes in somatostatin-cells. It has been postulated that the changes in the endocrine cells are a selective process to meet the new demands exerted by the dramatic decrease in intestinal absorptive area. It has been speculated further that the changes in the endocrine cells would cause an incomplete digestion of the ingested food and its rapid elimination from the intestine. These changes may be responsible for the diarrhoea and steatorrhoea that occur in patients with coeliac disease.},

CCK basal and postprandial levels were evaluated the day before and 45 and 90 days after treatment with oral pancreatin. Twelve healthy volunteers were included as reference group. CCK basal levels did not vary. CCK response to a test meal was increased in patients before treatment and diminished when oral enzymes were maintained for months even after three days of therapy withdrawal.

Health professionals should ensure the baby receives a sufficient and balanced diet during the weaning period, to meet the needs for energy and growth. Breast milk or infant formula should continue up to the age of at least one year. The weaning period is a good time to educate parents in good nutrition. A wide variety of foods should be the aim in child nutrition, but each different type needs to be started separately during weaning. Care is needed to ensure vegetarian babies receive enough proteins, vitamins and minerals (especially iron). Failure to thrive has a multitude of causes, and treatment must be that of the cause. Strictly vegan children who eat no dairy products will need added synthetic vitamin B12. Failure to thrive may be due to physical problems (eg choanal atresia), infection, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, parental ignorance or poverty. Other causes include coeliac disease, cow's milk protein allergy, cystic fibrosis, severe eczema or asthma, or diabetes.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of steatorrhea in patients with Graves' disease and to assess its significance and correlation with changes in body mass index (BMI), coefficient of fat absorption (COFA), and pancreatic exocrine function in these patients. METHODS: Daily dietary fat intake, 24 h fecal fat, COFA, fecal chymotrypsin activity (as an index of pancreatic exocrine function), and total T3, T4, and TSH levels were assessed in 28 patients with active Graves' disease. In 24 patients, reassessment was done after attaining a euthyroid state with carbimazole therapy. RESULTS: In the thyrotoxic state, 13 of 28 patients had steatorrhea, whereas 15 had normal (<6 g/day) fat excretion (11.4 +/- 6.7 g vs 2.9 +/- 0.8 g, p = 0.0007). Daily fat intake, basal BMI, and serum T3 and T4 levels were similar in the steatorrheic and nonsteatorrheic groups. The mean COFA of the steatorrheic group was significantly lower than that of nonsteatorrheic group (91.6% +/- 4.8% vs 97.7% +/- 0.9%, respectively; p = 0.0006). In the steatorrheic group, fat excretion and COFA normalized after attainment of euthyroidism (changes in fat excretion and COFA = 7.3% +/- 6.3 g/day and 7.7% +/- 5.4%, respectively). Fecal chymotrypsin levels were similar in the steatorrheic and nonsteatorrheic thyrotoxics and in 16 healthy control subjects. The levels did not show any significant changes following attainment of euthyroid status. CONCLUSION: Steatorrhea associated with a decrease in COFA can occur in a reversible manner in 46% of patients with Graves' disease. However, steatorrhea in these patients is not linked with weight loss or with pancreatic exocrine dysfunction.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The reader of this review will learn about the mechanisms through which breastfeeding protects against infections during and most likely after lactation, as well as possibly against certain immunologic diseases, including allergy. DATA SOURCES: I have followed the literature in the area closely for the last 30 to 40 years and have made repeated literature searches through MEDLINE, most recently in 1998. Textbooks and peer-reviewed journals have been sought for, as well as books representing meeting reports in English, French, German, and Spanish. RESULTS: Human milk protects against infections in the breastfed offspring mainly via the secretory IgA antibodies, but also most likely via several other factors like the bactericidal lactoferrin. It is striking that the defense factors of human milk function without causing inflammation, some components are even directly anti-inflammatory. Protection against infections has been well evidenced during lactation against, e.g., acute and prolonged diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, otitis media, urinary tract infection, neonatal septicemia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. There is also interesting evidence for an enhanced protection remaining for years after lactation against diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, otitis media, Haemophilus influenzae type b infections, and wheezing illness. In several instances the protection seems to improve with the duration of breastfeeding. Some, but not all studies have shown better vaccine responses among breastfed than non-breastfed infants. A few factors in milk like anti-antibodies (anti-idiotypic antibodies) and T and B lymphocytes have in some experimental models been able to transfer priming of the breastfed offspring. This together with transfer of numerous cytokines and growth factors via milk may add to an active stimulation of the infant's immune system. Consequently, the infant might respond better to both infections and vaccines. Such an enhanced function could also explain why breastfeeding may protect against immunologic diseases like coeliac disease and possibly allergy. Suggestions of protection against autoimmune diseases and tumors have also been published, but need confirmation. CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding may, in addition to the well-known passive protection against infections during lactation, have a unique capacity to stimulate the immune system of the offspring possibly with several long-term positive effects.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: People with gluten sensitivity should avoid foods containing wheat, rye, and barley, but there has been debate about whether they should avoid oats. Although patients with celiac disease have recently been shown to tolerate oats, less is known about the effects of oats on patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. METHODS: We studied seven men and three women (mean age, 58 years) with biopsy-confirmed dermatitis herpetiformis. They had followed a strict gluten-free diet for a mean of 15.8 years, which controlled their rash and enteropathy. The patients added oats that were not contaminated with gluten to their diets for 12 weeks (mean [+/-SD] daily intake, 62.5+/-10.8 g). RESULTS: None of the patients had any adverse effects. Serologic tests for antigliadin, antireticulin, and antiendomysial antibodies were negative before oats were introduced into the diet and after they were discontinued. Villous architecture remained normal: the mean (+/-SE) ratio of the height of villi to the depth of crypts was 3.59+/-0.11 before the diet and 3.71+/-0.09 afterward (normal, 3 to 5), and the mean enterocyte heights were 31.36+/-0.58 microm and 31.75+/-44 microm, respectively (normal range, 29 to 34). Duodenal intraepithelial lymphocyte counts all remained within normal limits (mean, 13.8+/-1.03 per 100 enterocytes before the diet and 14.2+/-1.2 per 100 enterocytes afterward; normal range, 10 to 30). Dermal IgA showed no significant changes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis can include moderate amounts of oats in their gluten-free diets without deleterious effects to the skin or intestine.},

   abstract = {The increased incidence of lymphoma in celiac sprue (CS) is well documented, and the risk of developing this malignancy is 40-100-fold greater than in the general population. The author believes that gluten may also be at the root of lymphomas in asymptomatic and latent celiac sprue, as well. Among the 20-30% of the population which has the HLA factors most common in celiac, increased intestinal permeability leads to absorption of macromolecular peptides with opioid activity, which derive from pepsin digests of wheat. The presence, in the bloodstream, of these peptides may increase the risk of lymphomas for the entire hereditary group, which includes CS. Several processes contribute to the effect that is herein hypothesized, including opioid attachment at the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), and subsequent downregulation of production of natural killer cells. This may offer an explanation for our longstanding awareness that there is an 'impaired lymphocyte reactivity against tumor cells in patients with coeliac disease' which may also apply to first-degree relatives with the same HLA markers.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A high prevalence of reflux esophagitis in celiac children and gut motor disorders in adult patients have been described. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of esophageal symptoms and the esophageal motility pattern in adult celiac patients before and after gluten-free diet. METHODS: In 22 consecutive adult celiac patients, before and after gluten-free diet, and in controls we calculated an esophageal symptom score regarding heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, and chest pain, and performed esophageal manometry using a constantly perfused multilumen catheter. RESULTS: Patients were divided into two groups: with and without steatorrhea. Before gluten-free diet, the prevalence of esophageal symptoms was 45.5 % in all patients, but was significantly higher in patients with steatorrhea than in those without and in 44 control subjects (80% vs 16.7% and 27%, p < 0.05). Lower esophageal sphincter pressure was 17.5+/-5.3 in all patients, but was significantly lower in patients with steatorrhea than in patients without steatorrhea and 11 controls subjects (13.1+/-4.1 vs 21.0+/-2.9 and 20.7+/-3.7 mm Hg (mean+/-SD, p < 0.05). After the diet, the prevalence of esophageal symptoms diminished in all patients (9% vs 45.4%, p < 0.05) and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, measured in 13 patients, increased (19.0+/-3.7 vs 15.7+/-5.3 mm Hg, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Adult celiac patients with steatorrhea present a higher prevalence of esophageal symptoms and a lowered lower esophageal sphincter pressure compared with celiac patients without steatorrhea and control subjects, but these phenomena can be reverted to control levels by gluten-free diet.},

IgA only occurred in in 6 patients, IgG- in 6 patients, both IgA and IgG in 7 patients. The most pronounced positive reaction to AGA was recorded in 8-year-old girl with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The emergence of AGA in immunomediated diseases may be attributed to the response to food protein in pathological conditions and is often unrelated closely with celiac disease.},

We examined the nutritional status of 40 adult patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease classified according to the grade of villous atrophy: partial, subtotal, and total. Nutritional status was determined by food records as well as by anthropometric and biochemical measurements. Anthropometric results did not differ among the three atrophy groups, but serum ferritin and erythrocyte folate were lower in patients with total villous atrophy than in the other groups. Most of the abnormal biochemical values were normalized during 1 y of a gluten-free diet; villous atrophy healed concomitantly. To conclude, patients with total mucosal villous atrophy at diagnosis had low erythrocyte folate and serum ferritin values, but no other major differences were found in nutritional status among celiac disease patients with different grades of villous atrophy.},

   abstract = {Food allergies and intolerance represent important health concerns to consumers who are predisposed to these illnesses. Unlike many current food safety issues, food sensitivities are complicated by both complex and multiple individual adverse reactions, which can vary from emotional to pathophysiological ailments. In some instances, the underlying mechanisms that result in the development of food allergies or intolerance have marked differences but produce common symptoms. The present-day diagnosis of these disorders can be impeded by intrinsic limitations in generating accurate information from patient history and biochemical, physicochemical, and immunochemical tests. Oral challenge tests represent effective methods for confirming and testing food allergens and food intolerance; however, these procedures are often restricted to clinical trials. It is important to be able to distinguish among food allergy, intolerance, and autoimmune disease in the management of these disorders. The role of food in the development of autoimmune disease may be exemplified by celiac disease, a food-induced enteropathy, requiring exposure to prolamins in wheat, rye, and barley. Various wheat and soy protein sources, including the soy protein isolates used to make infant formulas, have been related to juvenile or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), a common chronic disease of childhood. Employing food process technologies to eliminate food constituents with potential for intolerance in some individuals is a potentially viable approach for reducing risk to food-related disorders. Finally, the development of food labelling regulations that require the identification of potential food allergens or agents for intolerance in the ingredient declaration on prepackaged food is a positive step toward the prevention of severe adverse reactions in hypersensitive individuals.},

After screening 291 pupils in the fourth grade, 15 dyslexics and 15 controls were pairwise matched by gender, age, and cognitive level. Word decoding, spelling, and short-term memory tests were carried out, and information on handedness, immune and other disorders was obtained. Analyses of 24-h urine samples and of serum were performed. The reading abilities significantly differentiated the groups, and significant differences were found in frequency of left-handedness, immune disorders and other disorders. Three dyslexic children had elevated IgA antibodies. Two of these had positive endomycium tests, and coeliac disease was confirmed by biopsy. One had antibodies to proteins in milk. Our findings may suggest weak urinary peptide abnormalities in the dyslexic children, and they show significant differences in levels of IgA of antibodies to food proteins.},

A series of 128 patients with coeliac disease (CD) on a gluten-free diet (GFD), 8 patients with a newly diagnosed CD, and 30 healthy controls participated in a clinical and histopathological study of their oral mucosa. Oral mucosal lesions occurred in 71/128 GFD-treated CD patients. in 4/8 untreated and in 10/30 controls, and oral symptoms in 85/128, in 6/8 and in 10/30, respectively. Five CD patients had aphthous ulcers. Moderate to severe lymphocytic inflammation occurred in 36/117 and in 14/117 of the biopsy specimens of GFD-treated CD patients, in 1/8 and 2/8 of untreated CD patients, and in 3/30 and in 1/30 of controls, respectively. Intraepithelial T-cells were significantly more frequent in GFD-treated CD patients than in controls. There was no difference between untreated CD patients and controls. In the lamina propria of the GFD-treated CD patients, T-cells were more frequent than in the other groups. Mast cells were significantly more frequent in patients with GFD-treated CD. Nine GFD-treated CD patients had raised serum endomysium IgA antibody titres, although five of them reported to follow a strict GFD. A lack of strict compliance with a GFD may be related to the high prevalence of oral changes and symptoms. In addition, T-cell infiltration in the oral mucosa tends to increase with a longer duration of CD, independent of GFD-treatment. Clinically, it is important to study the oral cavity of patients suspected of having CD where the only clue to the disease may reside, since no less than 66% of the patients in this study had oral symptoms.},

METHOD: Coeliac axis and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) blood flow velocity were measured longitudinally in a cohort of 61 babies using Doppler ultrasound. RESULTS: Babies fed 1 hourly had significantly higher preprandial SMA peak systolic velocity (PSV) than those fed 3 hourly (70 vs 53 cm/s). Those fed 1 hourly showed no postprandial change whereas those fed 3 hourly showed significant postprandial hyperaemia. This hyperaemia had longer latency (42 vs 27 mins) and smaller amplitude (31 vs 25 mins) after expressed breast milk compared with preterm formula. The addition of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids to the formulas had no effect on the postprandial response. CONCLUSION: Hourly bolus feeding leads to a persistent hyperaemic state in the SMA. The composition of feeds is an important determinant of the postprandial response of the SMA to 3 hourly feeding.},

A fully reliable estimate of the prevalence of food allergy/intolerance does not exist. Prevalence changes with age, as does the relative importance of the most common food allergens. The cumulative prevalence of allergy and intolerance to cow's milk during the first year of life is approximately 2%. The total prevalence of food allergy/intolerance in children is not as well documented. In 18-month-old infants the Danish estimate is 6.5%. The high prevalence of peanut allergy (0.5%) in British children is not reflected in the results from other European countries. Milk, egg, fish and oranges seem to be the most common causes of allergy and intolerance in European infants and children. Results from epidemiological studies combined with the knowledge on pollen and latex cross-reactivity, systemic reactions to contact allergens and coeliac disease point to a prevalence of food allergy/intolerance in the adult European population of approximately 5%. A mild itch in the mouth and lactose intolerance are not included in this estimate which is a qualified guess.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gluten-free diet is the standard therapy for patients affected by celiac disease, although compliance with the diet is not optimal in adolescents or adults. Moreover, the gluten-free diet may induce nutritional imbalances. METHODS: Alimentary habits and diet composition were examined in 47 adolescents with celiac disease and 47 healthy aged-matched control subjects. All subjects compiled a 3-day alimentary record that allowed determination of their energy intakes: the macronutrient composition of their diets; and their iron, calcium, and fiber intakes. To evaluate compliance with the gluten-free diet, immunoglobulin A antigliadin and antiendomysium antibodies were assessed in all with celiac disease. RESULTS: The analysis of the records and the results of antibody levels showed that 25 subjects strictly followed dietetic prescriptions (group 1A), whereas 22 patients consumed gluten-containing food (group 1B). Those with celiac disease and control subjects (group 2) consumed a normocaloric diet. Lipid and protein consumption was high, however, and the consumption of carbohydrates low. Moreover, dietary levels of calcium, fiber, and especially in girls, iron, were low. These nutritional imbalances were significantly more evident in group 1A than in group 1B, as a consequence of poor alimentary choices. Moreover, in group 1A overweight and obesity were more frequent (72%) than in group 1B (51%) and in the control subjects (47%). CONCLUSIONS: In people with celiac disease, adherence to a strict gluten-free diet worsens the already nutritionally unbalanced diet of adolescents, increasing elevated protein and lipid consumption. In the follow-up of patients with celiac disease, considerable effort has yet to be made to improve compliance with a gluten-free diet, and especially to control the nutritional balance of the diet in compliant patients.},

In the present report, we describe a reproducible method for purification of these antigen molecules from fibroblast culture medium. Using reversed-phase chromatography as the final purification step, four different protein molecules reacting with coeliac disease patient sera IgA were obtained. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for coeliac disease-specific IgA, a mixture of 0.5 microgram of the four reversed-phase-separated molecules was used as antigen. The optical density values in ELISA of the sera from newly diagnosed coeliac disease patients (n = 34) were 0.740-3.400 (mean 1.830) and in control patients (n = 66) 0.090-0.850 (mean 0.320). Using an arbitrary cut-off level of 0.700, the sensitivity of the present autoantibody test was 100%, specificity 91% and positive predictive value 85%. Our identified autoantigens may generate the production of the classical tissue antibodies, known as anti-reticulin and anti-endomysium antibodies, and may be used as antigen in an immunoassay for the antibodies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse the intake of coeliac disease (CD) inducing, gluten containing cereals (wheat, rye, barley and oats) in Estonian infants diet and compare these results with neighbouring countries with different CD incidence rate. DESIGN: Study group consisted of 32 healthy full term infants of Estonian origin. SETTINGS: Study was carried out in Tartu University Women's Hospital and in Tartu University Children's Hospital. These are both primary care facilities. SUBJECTS: Infants were recruited to the study group according to their health parameters and parents agreement to take part of this study. Material of this article is based on one part of Estonian infants dietary habits investigation. RESULTS: The total amount of gluten containing cereals in Estonian infants diet was lower than in Sweden and Finland. We found that there is a certain parallelism between CD incidence and cereal intake. Wheat intake of Estonian infants was very close to Finnish infants, but almost twice lower than in Swedish infants. CONCLUSION: Data from the study is consistent with the hypothesis that gluten intake during infancy play role in development of CD. The quality of gluten-containing cereals may have important part in the development of the disease.},

Changes in upper small intestinal pH and lipase secretion, plasma fatty acid profiles, serum fat-soluble vitamin levels and symptoms of their deficiency, and nutritional status are discussed in detail. Treatment of pancreatic steatorrhea is described. Throughout this study, we compared characteristics of maldigestion and malabsorption in these patient populations and our study revealed that fecal fat excretion reflected quantitative differences in fat consumption, plasma fatty acid profiles reflected quantitative and qualitative differences in fish oil consumption, and there were no differences in pancreatic exocrine dysfunction among these three groups. Since differences in fecal fat excretion and plasma fatty acid profiles appear to depend on dietary fats, the pathology and treatment of CP patients should be evaluated and the findings used to prescribe treatments.},

They are associated with several animal diseases and are a potential threat to human health. A total of 127 samples of corn-based foods (gluten-free diet) in the Czech Republic were analysed by Ridascreen Fumonisin Fast ELISA methods in years 1995-1996. Eighty eight % of the corn-based foods were found to be positive for fumonisins (FB1, FB2, FB3) and 12% of the examined corn-based foods laid below of a determination limit which was about 9 ng fumonisins/g corn-based foods. The highest fumonisin contamination levels were recorded in extruded corn products containing up to 1,808 micrograms/kg of fumonisins. Levels ranging from < 9 to 1,243 ng/g fumonisins were detected in polenta. Lower levels of fumonisins were found in other commodities, such as corn flour (up to 487 ng/g), corn instant porridge (up to 788 ng/g), and corn pastes (511 ng/g). Intake of fumonisins from several corn-based foods (gluten-free diet) for the population with coeliac disease was estimated. The highest estimate of exposure dose of fumonisins was determined from corn-extruded bread: 3.2 micrograms/person/day (mean of measured values). Daily intake of fumonisins from polenta is expected 2.8 micrograms/person/day (mean). The lower exposure dose of fumonisins we can expect from corn instant porridge, corn postes and other corn products--corn and amaranth biscuit, corn beverage: 0.9, 1.1 and 0.3 micrograms/person/day (mean) respectively.},

In some of sera, we registered antibodies against gliadin and in parallel the appearance of anticasein antibodies. A high percentage of glutamic acid has been proven by amino acid analysis in both these proteins. Therefore we try to demonstrate the existence of cross-reactivity between them in sera from coeliac patients. METHODS: We analyzed sera from 5 adult patients by using Western blot (SDS-PAGE and immunoblot assay). All of them had previously proven serum antibodies against casein and gliadin. In the procedure, antigliadin-antibodies were removed from sera by adsorption with gliadin. Adsorbed antibodies were then eluted from the adsorbent. RESULTS: Adsorbed samples retained anticasein activity. Eluates had a strong reactivity to gliadin but not to casein. CONCLUSION: No cross-reactivity restricted to any of the immunoglobulin isotypes (IgG, IgM, IgA) had been proven between these two proteins. Before the final conclusion, we believe the study has to be completed by using partly of totally disassembled proteins by intestinal enzymes. It might be that enzymatic digestion could open some epitopes shared by both these proteins.},

However, the expression of the disease in man is very heterogeneous, it varies with the age of the subject and is to a certain extent genetically determined. For example, food allergy is frequent in childhood and not common in adulthood. The intestinal mucosa in the child with cows milk allergy shows a 'flat' mucosa, which may be indistinguishable of that observed in gluten sensitive entero-pathy or coeliac disease. Subjects with other forms of food allergy may have a morphologically normal small intestinal mucosa, occasionally with increased IgE plasma cells and often only characterised by an increased intestinal permeability. An abnormal intestinal permeability is one of the hallmarks of an inflamed gut, however, subjects with a latent form of coeliac disease have an abnormal permeability only without overt signs of inflammation. Recently, it has become clear that what determines the characteristics of the intestinal inflammatory response is dependent on the cytokines involved during the response and this seems to be the same in the stomach, the small intestine and the colon. A so-called Th1 response, with an increased production of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, occurs in the stomach when infected by Helicobacter pylori, in the small intestine when the subject with coeliac disease consumes normal bread and during the active phases of Crohn's disease. A Th2 response is characteristic of the allergic subject and there is some evidence that it is the predominant response in subjects with ulcerative colitis. We still do not know the fine-tuning of the cytokine response but IL-12 appears to be a key cytokine in polarising the response to a Thl type. More recently it has become clear that the intestinal mucosa has a unique subset of CD4(+) T cells that secrete TGF-ss (Th3 cells) that provide help for IgA. These cells have downregulatory properties for Th1 cells and therefore play an important role in the active suppression of oral tolerance and IgE response. What determines that an individual develops one of these diseases? It is now clear that these different pathological entities are multifactorial. Different environmental factors and a complex genetic predisposition where more that one gene and more than one chromosome are involved. The extent and severity of the inflammatory response depends on the genetic diversity of the bacteria or the amount of the antigen on the one hand and on the genetic constitution of the host on the other. The abnormal immune response in the human gut is predominantly a Th1-like inflammatory response. This can be elicited by bacteria, peptides, possibly the bacterial flora and some viruses. The recent findings in the pathogenesis of the intestinal inflammatory response will probably alter the therapy of the future.},

J., and T. L. Powley. Am. J. Physiol. 271 (Regulatory Integrative Comp. Physiol. 40): R766-R779, 1996]. To evaluate the contributions of the vagus to this detection of gastric volume, groups prepared with different selective vagotomies and equipped with pyloric cuffs and gastric catheters were tested. Liquid diet consumption during a 30-min feeding bout was measured after infusions of 5.0 and 10.0 ml of normal saline on cuff-open and cuff-closed trials. Consistent with earlier observations, sham animals with cuffs closed exhibited volume-dependent suppression of food intake to the infusions, and completely vagotomized animals did not inhibit feeding in response to the loads. In cuff-closed trials, the suppression function slopes of the selective vagotomy groups were intermediate to those of the shams and the completely vagotomized animals. Furthermore, for the different groups, the extent of suppression after vagotomy was proportional to the density of the afferent innervation respective branches supplied to the stomach. Specifically, the group with the gastric branches spared (nonsignificantly attenuated in comparison to shams) and the group with only the hepatic branch spared (significantly attenuated with respect to shams) both still exhibited significant dose-dependent suppression slopes (compared with completes), whereas the group with only celiac branches spared was not significantly different from completely vagotomized animals. In sum, the vagus nerve mediates the detection of the gastric volumes tested, and the different branches of the vagus make distinctive contributions to this afferent feedback.},

   abstract = {HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 41-year-old obese patient presented with cramp-like abdominal pain, watery diarrhoea with partly digested food particles, projectile vomiting and newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. For the preceding 6 years he had been treated for recurrent gastric and duodenal ulcers. Although the fasting gastrin level was raised and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome suspected, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and coeliac angiography at another hospital had failed to discover a tumor. INVESTIGATIONS: Biochemical tests were unremarkable except for an increased GPT concentration, slight fasting hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. The gastrin and chromogranin A levels were markedly elevated (15,590 pg/ml and 584.2 U/l, respectively). Gastroscopy revealed, in addition to multiple small duodenal ulcers, a round polypoid mass (diameter of 0.7 cm) lateral to the papilla of Vater, histologically an APUDoma. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed a 0.5 cm long compression of the duct of Wirsung in the region of the head of the pancreas. Liver metastases were excluded by magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Endosonography showed a ca. 4 mm space-occupying lesion in the region of the body of the pancreas. Octreotide scintigraphy demarcated two foci at the level of the head of the pancreas (somatostatin-receptor positive). TREATMENT AND COURSE: After a pylorus-preserving partial duodenopancreatectomy with lymph node dissection N1/N2, histology confirmed a gastrinoma of the duodenum and a glucagonoma of the pancreas (pT3pN1pMx). Postoperatively the patient became symptom-free and both the blood sugar level and the tumor marker were normal. CONCLUSION: Combined ERCP, endosonography and scintigraphy are more sensitive than other radiological examinations (CT and MRI) in diagnosing and localizing neuroendocrine tumours of the gastrointestinal tract. Despite the low incidence of such tumours, the possible synchronous occurrence of several such tumour should not be ignored.},

IgA-deficiency was ruled out in all patients. Positivity was considered for titers > 30.3 UA obtained from controls. The AAG-IgA titer was positive in 9 of 10 celiac patients on P1. Nine of these 10 patients were tested on P2; all cases showed a decrease in the AAG-IGA level and a significant difference was observed between the mean values for P1 and P2; although seven patients had maintained positive titers. On P3 and P4 all patients had AAG-IGa negative levels. On P1 the AAG-IGA liter levels were significantly higher than the values for P2, P3 and P4. The AAG-IgA values decreased towards control levels after one year of treatment. In Group III one out of 14 patients had a positive titer and the AAG-IgA values in this group were significantly lower than the celiac titers on P1 and P2 and no difference was found compared to patients titers on P3 and P4. The sensitivity of ELISA test was 90% and the specificity 93%. The AAG-IgA determination proved to be reliable for differentiating celiac disease from food hypersensitivity and useful in monitoring gluten-free diet compliance.},

   abstract = {This review reevaluates the rational basis for choice of diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected malassimilation. Prospective evaluation of diagnostic tests must fulfil several requirements for a correct assessment of their clinical value. Very few studies meet such requirements, resulting in unnecessary investigations as well as overlooked cases with a negative impact on patients and society. This problem includes evaluation of assimilation of macronutrients (carbohydrate, fat, protein) as well as micronutrients (e.g. vitamin B12), and it is further complicated by the occurrence of conditions with occult (compensated) malassimilation. Malassimilation of carbohydrates may be physiological (starch, fructose, sugar alcohols etc., in certain ethnic groups lactose) as well as pathological. In both instances chronic gastro-intestinal distress may arise in sensitive individuals. The diagnosis is based on tolerance tests, combined with blood tests or breath tests (hydrogen excretion). The latter is considered the most reliable, but the available evidence for choice of tests is not solid. Similar reservations apply to conditions of bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine, which may lead to diffuse malassimilation. The frequency and clinical importance of this condition is in all probability underestimated. Screening for coeliac disease may be achieved by several serological tests (reticulin-, gliadin-, endomysial antibodies), of which IgA-endomysial antibodies seem superior. Comparative studies are often flawed in design, however, and permeability tests may also eventually find their place in the test battery. There is thus a strong need for more evidence-based diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected malassimilation.},

The process of this disease is not yet thoroughly understood. Purification of basement membrane protein-180 (BM180) (a basement membrane protein with a potential autoantigen role) and multiple analysis of the purified protein can lead to a better understanding of this disorder, which affects millions of people worldwide. Our preliminary work on the purification and characterization of this protein is presented in this paper. BM180 proteins were expressed in mouse EHS (Engelberth-Holm-Swarm) tumor cells. A crude purification process (see "Methods") was performed and the purified fractions were analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) for determination of the apparent molecular weight of the protein components in each fraction. The fractions, which contained compounds of the expected molecular weight, were further analyzed using a capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) method developed for the routine analysis of wheat gliadins. Using the two CE methods, we were able to compare BM180 with certain gliadin fractions. Additional information on the protein stability was also obtained.},

   abstract = {Recent evidence has suggested a role of abdominal vagal afferents in the pathogenesis of the febrile response. The abdominal vagus consists of five main branches (viz., the anterior and posterior celiac branches, anterior and posterior gastric branches, and hepatic branch). The branch responsible for transducing a pyrogenic signal from the periphery to the brain has not as yet been identified. In the present study, we address this issue by testing the febrile responsiveness of male Wistar rats subjected to one of four selective vagotomies: celiac (CBV), gastric (GBV), hepatic (HBV), or sham (SV). In the case of CBV, GBV, and HBV, only the particular vagal branch(es) was cut; for SV, all branches were left intact. After the postsurgical recovery (26-29 days), the rats had a catheter implanted into the jugular vein. On days 29-32, their colonic temperature (Tc) responses to a low dose (1 microg/kg) of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were studied. Three days later, the animals were subjected to a 24-h food and water deprivation, and the effectiveness of the four vagotomies to induce gastric food retention, pancreatic hypertrophy, and impairment of the portorenal osmotic reflex was assessed by weighing the stomach and pancreas and measuring the specific gravity of bladder urine, respectively. Stomach mass, pancreas mass, and urine density successfully separated the four experimental groups into four distinct clusters, thus confirming that each type of vagotomy had a different effect on the indexes measured. The Tc responses of SV, CBV, and GBV rats to LPS did not differ and were characterized by a latency of approximately 40 min and a maximal rise of 0.7 +/- 0.1, 0.6 +/- 0.1, and 0.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C, respectively. The fever response of the HBV rats was different; practically no Tc rise occurred (0.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C). The HBV appeared to be the only selective abdominal vagotomy affecting the febrile responsiveness. We conclude, therefore, that the hepatic vagus plays an important role in the transduction of a pyrogenic signal from the periphery to the brain.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutrients and properties of lipases affect survival of lipolytic activity during aboral gastrointestinal transit. Whether different doses and formulations of bacterial lipase and diets affect steatorrhea was tested in pancreatic-insufficient dogs. METHODS: A dose of 0-600,000 IU of powdered and 135,000 and 300,000 IU of liquid bacterial lipase was given with a standard meal to 5 dogs with ligated pancreatic ducts. In 4 dogs, 0 or 300,000 IU (normal 6-hour postprandial amount) of powder bacterial lipase was also given with five meals containing 850 kcal with different nutrient caloric densities (mixture design). Coefficients of fat absorption during 72-hour fecal balance studies were used to assess treatments. RESULTS: With the standard meal, powder bacterial lipase reduced steatorrhea in a dose-dependent manner (P = 0.03), and 135,000 and 300,000 IU of the liquid form decreased steatorrhea more than powder bacterial lipase (P = 0.017 and 0.057, respectively). Coefficients of fat absorption with 300,000 IU of powder bacterial lipase correlated (r2 = 0.79; P < 0.001) with increasing proportions of fat calories in diets. CONCLUSIONS: Liquid bacterial lipase decreases steatorrhea more than powder, and 300,000 IU of powder bacterial lipase ingested with high-fat meals corrects canine pancreatic steatorrhea. The combination of adequate mixing of small amounts (milligrams) of bacterial lipase and high-fat meals abolishes canine steatorrhea and may abolish human pancreatic steatorrhea.},

Here we demonstrate that tTG selectively deamidates gluten peptides, which results in strongly enhanced T cell-stimulatory activity. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an enzymatic modification of a food protein that affects T cell recognition. Moreover, these modifications may lead to the amplification of gluten-specific T cell responses in the gut and consequently may be important for the development of CD.},

   abstract = {Malabsorption of fat is an important gastrointestinal cause of malnutrition and growth retardation in childhood. The gold standard for the evaluation of fat malabsorption is the faecal fat balance method. The acid steatocrit method has recently been introduced as a simple method to evaluate faecal fat. The present study was aimed at evaluating the acid steatocrit in clinical practice. Faecal fat excretion and acid steatocrit results were determined in 42 children, half with and half without fat malabsorption. Acid steatocrit results correlated significantly with both faecal fat excretion (p < 0.01) and faecal fat concentration (p < 0.001). Sensitivity and specificity of the acid steatocrit for the diagnosis of malabsorption were 90% and 100%, respectively. We consider the acid steatocrit method useful for the screening and monitoring of patients with steatorrhoea.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that the amount of gluten intake in populations offers an explanation for differences in the epidemiology of coeliac disease. Investigations into first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients have often shown that relatives exhibit intermediate features of coeliac disease, possibly due to a low gluten intake. AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of gluten consumption in the general Dutch population for different age and sex groups and for different product groups, and to investigate the daily gluten intake of first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients. METHODS: Questionnaires concerning the gluten intake of 55 first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients were analysed. To determine the gluten intake of the general Dutch population, the results of a mass investigation were used. The amount of gluten in the gluten-rich products was estimated by multiplying the amount of vegetable proteins by 0.8. RESULTS: The median daily gluten intake of the relatives was 12.9 g (range: 3.8-31.3). The mean daily gluten intake of the study population in the Netherlands was 1 3.1 g. CONCLUSION: The gluten intake of first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients was the same as that of the general population. Thus, a low gluten intake apparently does not explain the aspecific presentation and prevalence of coeliac disease in first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients.},

Initially, latent celiac disease was suggested because of normal endoscopic findings, the finding of non-specific inflammation on histological evaluation of duodenal biopsies, positive IgA and IgG gliadin, as well as endomysium antibodies and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. There was no response to a gluten-free diet. A reevaluation revealed Crohn's disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a widely distributed neuropeptide contained in intrinsic and extrinsic neurons of the gastrointestinal wall that has been shown to be released by noxious stimulation, to be involved in nociception, to inhibit gastrointestinal motility, and to partly mediate postoperative gastric ileus. We hypothesized that abdominal surgery-induced release of CGRP might inhibit postoperative colonic motility and food intake. METHODS: Colonic transit, stool pellet number, stool pellet weight, and food intake were measured for 48 hours after induction of postoperative ileus in rats. CGRP was immunoneutralized by preoperative injection of CGRP monoclonal antibody, or visceral afferent nerve fibers containing CGRP were functionally ablated by topical capsaicin treatment of the vagus nerves or of the celiac/superior mesenteric ganglia before abdominal surgery. RESULTS: Abdominal surgery increased colonic transit time and decreased 24-hour cumulative stool pellet number, stool pellet weight, and food intake. CGRP immunoneutralization reversed postoperative inhibition of colonic transit, 24-hour cumulative stool pellet number, stool pellet weight, and food intake by 77%, 82%, 80%, and 52%, respectively. Whereas ablation of vagal afferent nerve fibers had no effect, spinal afferent nerve fiber ablation reversed postoperative inhibition of 24-hour cumulative stool pellet number, stool pellet weight, and food intake by 41%, 38%, and 19%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CGRP and spinal afferent nerve fibers partly mediate postoperative colonic ileus and inhibition of food intake in the rat. By the magnitude of reversal of postoperative ileus, CGRP seems to be an important mediator of postoperative colonic ileus. Our results for the first time show involvement of a neuropeptide and spinal afferents in the mediation of postoperative colonic ileus and postoperative inhibition of food intake in rats.},
